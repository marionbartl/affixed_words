She has been described as the " world 's luckiest woman " .
And as Ewa Wisnierska began recovering from the most incredible ordeal , she probably thought that was an understatement .
VIDEO : Ewa recalls her ordeal
Caught in a raging storm , the 35 - year - old paraglider had been sucked up to a height of 32,000 ft - higher than Mount Everest .
She survived lightning , pounding hailstones as big as tennis balls , temperatures as low as minus 50c and oxygen deprivation .
She came down to earth covered in ice and gasping for air - but alive .
Doctors feared she might have suffered brain damage - but apart from frostbite and bruising she was given a clean bill of health .
During her 80 - minute ordeal under the span of her paraglider , the German adventurer was taken so high that she passed out for nearly 40 minutes .
As she remained unconscious with the storm throwing her and her parachute about like a puppet on a string , her ground crew used state - of - the - art monitoring equipment to follow her progress across the angry skies .
" You ca n't imagine the power , " Miss Wisnierska said as she recovered from the ordeal in a hotel in the small New South Wales town of Manilla , bandages covering her frostbitten ears and legs .
" You feel like nothing in that power , tossed around like a leaf from a tree . "
In that same storm , a Chinese paraglider died from oxygen deprivation and the freezing temperatures .
Miss Wisnierska and 200 others had gathered at Manilla for training flights in readiness for next week 's Paragliding World Championships .
Fitted out with specialised clothing to protect themselves at 5,000ft , they launched themselves from a 500 ft cliff in the hope of picking up good ' thermals ' .
But Miss Wisnierska and the Chinese flier soon found themselves being dragged upwards into storm clouds that had gathered .
Her ground crew were alarmed to see her soaring from 2,500 ft to more than 32,000 ft in 15 minutes .
" Before I passed out I found myself being pulled up and up at a violent rate .
I was trying to fly around the clouds , but I got sucked into them at a speed of 65ft a second and then I started to spiral .
I was shaking all the time .
It was dark , like the night .
" Lightning was flashing all around me , huge hailstones were battering me and there was nothing I could do about it .
I knew then that the chances of my survival were almost zero .
" Ice was forming on my sunglasses and instruments and I could n't get any air - and then I passed out .
" It was about 40 minutes later that I woke up .
I thought I must have been unconscious for about a minute but then saw from my watch how long I had been out .
From my instruments I saw I was as high as 6,900 m ( 22,600 ft ) . "
Miss Wisnierska said that passing out probably saved her life in those conditions - her heart rate slowed down and put her into a kind of hibernation .
The previous altitude survival record for a paraglider without oxygen was 24,000ft .
She saw a farm and managed to steer down towards it : " I could see the earth coming , wow , like Apollo 13 - I can see the earth ! "
She landed safely , 40 miles from her launch site .
Somehow her parachute had survived without damage .
Event organiser Godfrey Wenness said : " She was covered in ice .
Her ears were nearly frozen off up there .
" It 's like winning the lottery ten times in a row - the odds of her surviving were that long . "
Miss Wisnierska added : " I do n't believe in God .
But I do believe in angels .
I think they were the ones who brought me back safely . "
Shop staff is going to need to wear face masks and weddings will probably be restricted to a max of 15 individuals , under rules .
Fines for violating legislation on parties rather than wearing a mask increases to £ 200 for a first offence .
In addition , he cautioned ” significantly greater constraints ” might come if needed .
Scotland ’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also declared a 22:00 curfew for hospitality companies but proceeded farther on constraints , banning visiting different families indoors .
I am sorry to state this , like in Spain and France and several other nations , we have reached a reckless turning point ”
In addition , he affirmed that office employees were asked to work at home once more , if at all possible .
Mr Johnson said the authorities would offer local and police authorities in England with additional funding to enforce regulations and also the choice to draw military assistance .
He said that the rules were ” carefully judged ” to get the maximum decrease in the R – which measures how fast the virus is spreading – while inducing ” the minimal harm to lives and livelihoods ” .
Schools , schools , universities and colleges will stay open .
Attendance figures reveal the number of colleges in England sending dwelling teams of students because of Covid - 19 incidents quadrupled at per week , nevertheless .
In the past fortnight , hospital admissions have escalated and Covid - 19 is very likely to propagate quicker in winter months , Mr Johnson said , adding : “ This is the moment once we must behave . ”
If those constraints do n’t attract the number under one – the point at which the outbreak is no longer climbing - “ we then reserve the right to set up increased firepower with considerably greater constraints ” he explained .
Mr Johnson said : “ We shall spare no effort in creating vaccines , therapies , new kinds of mass - testing but unless we palpably create progress we ought to assume that the constraints I have declared will stay in position for possibly six months ”
Under the new steps for England : Takeaways can last hospitality places need to close at 22:00 out of Thursday – that means tripping then , maybe not phoning last orders ( in Scotland the exact same curfew principle comes into force on Friday ) Office employees are being advised to work from home if the possible projected yield of audiences to sports places will not go ahead from 1 OctoberFace covering should be worn from the store staff , cab drivers and passengersClients in indoor hospitality places will also need to wear masks , except once seated at a desk to eat or drinkExemptions into the ” rule of six ” will probably be cut , meaning indoor sports like five - a- side soccer matches will finish .
Restating her support for individuals working from home , Scotland ’s first minister announced her authorities could impose a” legal obligation ” on companies to permit home working .
Ms Sturgeon said authorities of coronavirus principles for the general public in Scotland is ” under review ” but added : ” Allowing individuals to do the ideal thing is significantly more powerful than threatening harsh punishment when they cannot . ”
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he encouraged ” necessary ” more rigorous steps , but added that households were concerned ” the government does not have a plan ” .
“ One - day people were invited to operate in the workplace , in reality , over encouraged they had been publicly challenged by the prime minister for not doing this .
Now they are told the reverse , ” he explained .
“ That is a period of national disaster but we want clear direction . ”
Sir Keir stated it ’d be a” tragedy ” to draw the furlough plot in ” one fell swoop ” with no extra support for individuals whose jobs may be in danger .
The CBI , which reflects the company , said that it was ” desperately pressing ” to announce that a targeted replacement to the furlough scheme .
“ It ’s saved thousands and tens of thousands of tasks but there ’s a cliff - edge looming .
Marc Gough , who conducts on the crockery and glassware company in the wedding events industry , stated the cut into the limitation for weddings to 15 has been ” heart - breaking ” .
“ I can not make a living as you are restricting me of 15 individuals , ” Mr Gough told BBC Radio 5 Live , including that the turnover of his company had fallen from £ 750,000 to 20,000 .
“ To walk in that warehouse , to place a grin on my head to the team I have abandoned , to the customers that I deal with consistently , the brides , it is genuinely dreadful , ” he explained .

Was a legendary punk rocker arrested for possession of ... soap ?
That ’s the question surrounding last week ’s jailing of Germs drummer Don Bolles after a traffic stop in Newport Beach .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Friday April 27 , 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 2 inches ; 88 words Type of Material : Correction
Don Bolles arrest :
An April 11 California section article about the arrest of Germs drummer Don Bolles , as well as some previous articles , gave an incorrect age for Germs singer Darby Crash when he committed suicide in 1980 .
Crash was 22 .
The article also stated that previous police field tests of Dr. Bronner ’s Magic Soaps had indicated the presence of THC , the active ingredient in marijuana , because the soaps contain hemp oil .
The previous field test problem actually involved a Dr. Bronner ’s energy bar made with hemp nuts .
Bolles , 50 , whose real name is Jimmy Michael Giorsetti , said in an interview that he and his girlfriend were driving to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting Wednesday evening when police pulled over his 1968 Dodge van for a broken taillight .
Inside the vehicle , police found a toiletry kit containing denture glue , razors and a bottle of Dr. Bronner ’s Magic Soap .

When a field test of the alleged liquid peppermint soap indicated it was GHB , a date - rape drug , Bolles was arrested on suspicion of felony narcotics possession , said Sgt. Evan Sailor of the Newport Beach Police Department .
Bolles insisted the soap was only soap .
“ I ’ve been using Dr. Bronner ’s for 35 years , ” he said Tuesday , adding that the organic ingredients help give him the complexion of a 15 - year - old girl .
Executives at Dr. Bronner ’s rushed to Bolles ’ defense , hiring attorney Bruce Margolin , who specializes in marijuana cases , to represent the musician .
The alliance between Germs and the soap manufacturer followed an Internet plea to help bail Bolles out of jail .
A musician from one of his other bands , Fancy Space People , set up a PayPal account to raise the $ 2,500 bond .

Bolles , who lives in Huntington Park , was released Sunday .
“ The Newport Beach jail was the nicest one I ’ve ever been in , ” he said .
But Bolles spent just one night there before being moved to two county jails he described as “ terrifying . ”
The Germs , a trailblazing punk ban formed in Los Angeles in the late 1970s , are credited with influencing generations of musicians and popularizing mohawks .
Bolles took his name from Arizona Republic journalist Don Bolles , who was killed in 1976 by a car bomb while investigating corruption .
The band broke up in 1980 after their 24 - year - old singer , Darby Crash , committed suicide .
The Germs reunited in 2005 .
As word of the punk rocker ’s arrest spread online , Dr. Bronner ’s switchboard lighted up with calls .
After speaking with Bolles on Monday , company President David Bronner decided to intervene .

The Escondido - based soap maker is used to run-ins with the law .
Because the ingredient list for Dr. Bronner ’s Magic Soap includes hemp oil , police field tests of the soap occasionally indicate THC , the active ingredient in marijuana , Bronner said .
But the idea of finding GHB in a Dr. Bronner ’s product is “ beyond belief , ” Bronner said .
“ The field test must have been flawed or tampered with . ”
Is it possible Bolles was using the soap bottle to carry the drug ?
No way , Bronner said .
With a definitive test of the bottle ’s contents coming soon from the Orange County Crime Lab , “ it would be ridiculous for Bolles to be lying , ” Bronner said .
Advertisement
Bolles , a onetime heroin addict who is scheduled to play a London concert with the Germs in August , likewise dismissed the idea that he would carry GHB .
“ A date - rape drug is the last thing I need , ” he said .
“ If anything , I need a way to keep the girls off of me .
They make my girlfriend mad . ”

Interviewed February 20 , 2007  Listen to the interview .
Is Iran making nuclear weapons ?
Is the United States preparing to wage war against them to prevent them from obtaining nuclear weapons ?
Our guest is Scott Ritter .
He is a former Marine , United Nations weapons inspector , and author of an armful of books : Endgame , War on Iraq , Frontier Justice , Iraq Confidential , and his latest is Target Iran : The Truth About the White House ’s Plans for Regime Change .
Welcome to Antiwar Radio , Scott .
Scott Ritter : Thank you for having me .
Horton :
It ’s great to have you on .
The theme of your book , Target Iran , is that nuclear disarmament is the excuse  the policy is really regime change .
Is that right ?
Ritter :
That ’s correct .
The Bush administration has made it clear that when it comes to the Middle East , the policy is regional transformation .
That ’s inclusive of regime change in nations that the Bush administration has identified as either being a rogue nation or a failed nation state , and the current theocracy that governs Iran has been deemed by the Bush administration as being rogue in character in part because , as the Bush administration articulated it in the March 2006 National Security Strategy document , Iran is the number one state sponsor of terror in the world today .
Horton :
And so it ’s really not that our government is worried that they are about to have an armful of nuclear weapons then ?
Ritter :
Well , actually the government knows that Iran is not about to have an armful of nuclear weapons .
When you hear someone say that Iran is ten years away from having a nuclear weapon , that means that they are at zero right now , because ten years is about how long it takes in this day and age  that ’s what it takes to put in place the technology , develop the infrastructure , pump out the fissile material , etc .
Ten years is what a nuclear program takes .
So if someone says they are ten years away , that means they are doing nothing now .
Horton :
That ’s funny because just this morning in the Financial Times , Mohamed el - Baradei , the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency used exactly that same figure , ten years .
Ritter :
It ’s one that people continuously throw out .
What Mohamed el - Baradei and others 
I ’ll just speak about el - Baradei because I know what he is committed to .
He has said repeatedly that the work of the IAEA inspectors has uncovered no evidence that sustains the allegations that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
However , he notes that the type of inspections that are permitted in Iran : those inspections that are mandated by the Nonproliferation Treaty , the safeguards inspections , even the additional protocol inspections that Iran agreed to  none of these gives the IAEA inspectors the kind of access that is necessary to ascertain that there is no nuclear weapons program in Iran .
This means if someone throws out the supposition that Iran has a nuclear weapons program , it does n’t matter if the IAEA does n’t find any evidence to back this up .
The IAEA , under pressure from the United States to try to prove the negative that Iran does not have a nuclear weapons program , is saying that they [ the IAEA ] have to have absolute access to every site in Iran even though that ’s a violation of the Nonproliferation Treaty .
It ’s not called for by the Nonproliferation Treaty .
Horton :
We saw in Iraq what really happens in a situation like that ; total access still is n’t good enough because if you are not turning over your banned weapons we know you have , then that ’s just proof that you are hiding them better than we were accusing you of hiding them .
Right ?
Ritter : Well , ( laughs ) , that ’s the rhetoric .
The bottom line is , as was the case in Iraq , disarmament is not the objective in Iran .
Believe me , there are much better ways to go about pursuing disarmament than what the United States , than what the IAEA are doing .
Verification , disarmament and arms control all require that you have a modicum of trust  that it is a bilateral activity  that in exchange for giving something , you get something .
In the case of Iraq , it was clear that even though the Iraqis did everything in their power eventually to demonstrate that they had disarmed .
They granted full access to the inspectors .
It was the American agenda of regime change that corrupted the integrity of the entire operation and created a cloud of distrust that polluted every aspect of the inspector ’s work .
The same thing is taking place today .
Iran has given the IAEA inspectors extraordinary access to facilities throughout Iran .
They have explained things .
They have provided documents .
They have done above and beyond what is required by the Nonproliferation Treaty and have demonstrated that their nuclear energy program is a program that is consistent with that which is permitted by the law .
But thanks to the United States , the IAEA has corrupted the integrity of the process : by insisting that Iran comply with things that it is not required to do ; by creating a wall of mistrust ; by buying along with the notion that somewhere in Iran  we do n’t know where , no one knows where , somehow we do n’t know how , nobody knows how 
Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
And they just throw that out there without any evidence to back it up .
It ’s just a given .
We are told that the President of the United States and others in the administration have said there can be no doubt Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
Well you know what , there ’s nothing but doubt that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
There is no evidence whatsoever !
I need to reinforce that point :
There is no evidence whatsoever to back up the rhetoric that the Bush administration has put out there that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
Horton :
What ’s happening here is , if I pull a gun on you and say ,
“ Hands up !
Drop your weapon . ”
You say ,
“ Look at me I ’m unarmed . ”
Then I say ,
“ Ah ! … you have n’t dropped your weapons yet . ”
The fact that the gun is not at your feet , means that it must still be in your waist band somewhere .
Ritter :
Or if I pick up a stick and say ,
“ Wait a minute now , I ’m going to bat your gun away . ”
Now you say ,
“ Ah , ha !
You ’re trying to attack me . ”
Horton : Yeah , exactly .
Ritter : ( laughter )
Horton : Okay , you wrote 
I ’m trying to remember if it was a year or two years ago  that this whole “ attempt ” by the United States and the Europeans to get Iran to back down from their nuclear capability  such as it is  that rather than being plan A , and then if that does n’t work , plan B and then if that does n’t work , Plan C ( that is , getting the Europeans to negotiate for us , and then Plan B , getting the United Nations to do sanctions if necessary and then Plan C being warfare ) , you said that this is really step 1 , 2 and 3 , not plan A , B and C .
Ritter :
That ’s correct .
It ’s all part of the same plan .
The Bush administration knows there is a certain process to be followed through in getting the world and the American people prepared for armed conflict .
You ’re not going to get the IAEA to rubber stamp the Bush administration ’s contentions .
That was one of the things learned by the U.S. Government : that international Weapons Inspectors do possess a relative degree of integrity and are n’t going to go about making things up at the behest of the United States .
They also know the Security Council is an environment where the United States has near absolute control .
The United States gets to insert its will and impose its directives .
The Security Council makes the United Nations an extension of American foreign policy .
The Bush administration needed to shift the debate from the IAEA in Vienna , Austria to the Security Council .
If they can pressure the IAEA to shift the debate , they have now created the impression that there is something of concern .
You see , if there was nothing of concern , why shift the debate ?
Now they ’ve [ the Bush administration ] brought it to the Security Council and they ’ve started to build this trap for the Security Council members and others to say , there is a problem here : now do something about it .
So initially the Security Council will pass an Article 40 resolution that says , Iran must comply .
If Iran does n’t , it constitutes a threat .
Now the Security Council will need to do something else .
They ’ll pass an Article 41 resolution that says , because Iran fails to comply , there is going to be economic sanctions .
If Iran just sweeps that aside too , what do you do now ?
This is where the United States builds the trap : by defining Iran as a threat worthy of a Chapter 7 resolution [ UN Resolutions must invoke Chapter 7 to use force against states ] .
If the UN Security Council does nothing , then the U.S. has every right to say that it will not allow it ’s national security interests to be hijacked by the international community and it will do that which is necessary to defend itself .
This is what the Bush administration has done .
We are in such a situation as we speak .
The Bush administration needs to go to no one for permission .
They have got the International Community backed into a corner .
They ’ve gotten Congress backed into a corner .
Congress , idiots that they are , have abrogated any constitutional responsibility when they passed these ridiculous war powers resolutions in 2001 – 2002 .
Instead of keeping the verbiage in these resolutions specific to the task at hand , they , in their patriotic fervor , have pretty much given the President a blank check to do whatever he wishes .
Today , having rubber stamped the President ’s statements regarding the threat posed by Iran , who in Congress is standing up to challenge the President ’s assertions about Iran ’s nuclear weapons program ?
Hardly anybody .
Practically nobody of stature .
Not a single one of the would be Presidential candidates .
In fact , they ’ve all been going overboard to embrace Iran as a threat worthy of all options remaining on the table , to paraphrase Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Congress is trapped .
The international community is trapped and now it ’s just a matter of the Bush administration picking the time and place of the fight .
Horton : Now about that United Nations trap …
I guess the rest of the countries went along with the American pressure on the IAEA to move it to the Security Council because they are trying to get in between the U.S. and the war .
Sort of the same situation we had in Iraq .
The reason they passed Resolution 1441 [ on Iraq ] was not to get America into war , but to try to stop us from getting into a war .
But as you say , they basically accepted the US premise : there ’s a problem , and if the UN is not willing to do something about it , we are .
Ritter :
That ’s absolutely correct .
You know , people feel that they need to be at the table to be part of the game .
They do n’t realize that once you sit at the table , you nullify yourself .
To stay part of the game , you need to stay out of the table .
For whatever reason , Europe has fallen into the trap of saying , in order to get America to soften its position , we must play the game that America dealing out here .
Now that ’s wrong .
Europe should never play the game to begin with .
It should have told the United States , “ absolutely not .
We do n’t consider Iran a threat .
We are not engaging on this issue .
Go pound sand . ”
That would have made it very difficult for the Bush administration , especially in the aftermath of it ’s unilateral disaster in Iraq , to move strongly against Iran .
But by playing the game , Europe legitimized the cause the United States is embracing .
Now they may not believe that ’s what they are doing up front , but that ’s the end result .
Today , George W. Bush can stand before the world and before the American people and say that Europe has reached this conclusion together with America  that America is not the only one saying this .
Horton : Right , and now to be clear .
Is America saying that Iran may not enrich uranium at all ?
Ritter : Well , the United States has said that Iran will not be permitted to have any technology that could be useful in nuclear weapons , but the enrichment of uranium is a dual purpose technology .
Once you have that technology to enrich uranium , you can enrich it to five percent , which is usable for a nuclear reactor , or you can enrich it to 80 or 90 percent , which is usable in a nuclear weapon .
Horton :
Let me stop you right there .
If you had your centrifuge equipment perfected to the degree that you could enrich uranium to electricity grade low enriched uranium , how easy is it to enrich it up to 94 percent ?
Is it simply a matter of flipping a switch ?
Ritter :
Well , it ’s not just flipping a switch .
You basically are taking the feed stock that goes through at 5 % and feeding it back through and repeating that process until you get your highly enriched uranium .
Horton : Okay , so you do n’t need a whole new setup then .
Ritter :
You do n’t need a whole new setup , but I ’ll tell you this .
If your initial setup is under the monitoring of the IAEA , there is no way you can enrich uranium to high enrichment levels without being caught .
Horton : I see .
But the worry is that if they get the know - how , then they can kick the IAEA out , withdraw from the NPT , and start making a bomb .
Is that it ?
Ritter : Well , at that point and time the debate changes tremendously .
Right now , the question of Iran ’s intent ca n’t be proven .
We need to discuss what the facts that are available show .
I would say that one of the negotiating tactics that I would take with the Iranians is : if you pursue an enrichment program , it must be under 100 % verifiable monitoring by the IAEA .
Should you withdraw from the NPT and kick the inspectors out , we will be right to infer ill intent .
We will be right to infer a nuclear weapons program .
I would say to the Iranians : you ’ve said some irresponsible things ; you ’re behavior has been questionable .
We have reason to doubt your sincerity .
We are willing to go down this path [ Iranian civilian enrichment program ] , but we are going to create an Iran - only caveat here , and that is : Iran is permitted to pursue it ’s article 4 right of enriching uranium , but Iran will do so with stringent inspections .
I would say , “ Iran , now you are forever married to the NPT as long as you have an enrichment program .
If you kick the inspectors out or are found cheating , we have a right to infer nuclear weapons intent and this will never be tolerated . ”
If Iran goes down that path [ nuclear weapons development ] , I myself would support a military strike against Iran , because then it ’s legitimate .
We have a legitimate right to say Iran cannot have nuclear weapons .
There ’s nothing wrong with that stance .
Horton :
Are you sure ?
Even that .
Iran does n’t have the right to tell us that we ca n’t have nuclear weapons .
Ritter : Hmmm .
I ’m sorry , that ’s not the way the game is played .
I ’m not one of those guys who believes that because we ’ve got nuclear weapons , everybody ’s allowed to have them .
I believe that we need to be getting rid of them .
But that ’s an argument for the American people to engage in .
The Iranians do n’t get a vote on that one .
I disagree very strongly .
We live in a very dangerous world .
I do n’t want to play little feel - good games here .
The Iranians are not a nation that should be having nuclear weapons .
You know what ?
The Ayatollah Khamenei , the supreme leader of Iran , agrees with me .
He does n’t want to engage in this silly debate about whether Iran should have nuclear weapons because Israel has them .
He has said that nuclear weapons are incompatible with Islam .
I ’d like to take him at his word .
Horton :
Well , sure , I think that America should disarm as well , but I ’m just not sure that it is America ’s responsibility to allow or disallow other nations to have a nuclear program one way or another .
Ritter : Well , it ’s not the United States alone that ’s saying this .
It ’s the international community .
This is where I would agree .
We have to draw the line .
There can be no more nuclear proliferation .
We need to concur with the rest of the world that there is no more room for the continuation of proliferation of nuclear weapons .
Here ’s the problem .
If we get into the debate about whether Iran can or ca n’t have one , we ’ve lost .
What we should be seeking here is to resolve a problem that ’s leading us down a path towards war .
That problem is America ’s policy of regime change .
That ’s what our focus should be on .
Horton :
You are a firm believer in nonproliferation .
Do you believe the Bush administration , by misusing the nonproliferation regime such as the NPT and the IAEA to make all these false accusations against Iraq and now against Iran , has that hurt the long term future of the NPT and the IAEA ’s ability to keep track of these kinds of things ?
Ritter : Oh , absolutely .
It ’s hurt nonproliferation not just in Iran , not just for the IAEA .
It ’s hurt disarmament and arms control efforts globally .
The Bush administration has what I call an incoherent disarmament and arms control policy .
It essentially does n’t have one .
Its arms control policy has been confused with its global hegemony efforts , where it uses the fear that ’s induced by the topics of arms control and disarmament to provide support for policies that , if you think about them , are about furthering armament , furthering proliferation .
Why do nations proliferate ?
It comes down to something simple , to Newton ’s second law : for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction .
So long as the United States behaves irresponsibly , possesses nuclear weapons of its own and comes up with policies that talk about preemptive use of nuclear weapons  do n’t be surprised when other nations around the world react in a similar manner .
The Bush administration ’s policies have been devastating to disarmament , devastating to arms control and have done nothing more than promote the proliferation of WMD .
Horton :
In fact , was n’t there a United Nations report that came out a few weeks ago that said they were predicting in 20 years there will 15 more states with nukes .
Ritter :
Well , they did put out that report , but I do n’t know what the basis is .
Let ’s focus on the example of North Korea .
They went down the path of nuclear weapons and what have they gotten for it ?
They are bankrupt .
The bottom line is , a sound foreign policy would generate the kind of economic assistance to North Korea that nuclear weapons would n’t .
North Korea does n’t need a nuclear weapon .
It has enough artillery to rain 300,000 rounds of high explosive shells on the capital of South Korea per hour in a conflict .
So they did n’t need to go that path .
They nearly bankrupted themselves .
They did n’t get the support of the world when they went this path .
I believe that , yes , there are nations that will have access to technology that could allow them to proliferate into the nuclear weapons sphere in the next 20 years , but I believe that responsible nations are saying , that ’s not the route we want to go .
That ’s stupidity .
You ’re going to see , rather than a push for proliferation , the world saying : we need to back this puppy up .
There ’s going to be a lot of pressure put on the United States [ to disarm ] .
Just take a look at the debate that ’s going on in England today concerning Tony Blair ’s efforts to acquire a new generation of nuclear missile submarines .
The only argument people can put forward about the need for Great Britain to have nuclear submarines goes like this : although there is no threat that manifests itself today that warrants Great Britain spending billions of dollars on the new submarine and new nuclear missiles , we need to be concerned about Russia in the future .
That ’s heading us in the path towards the resumption of the cold war .
Back to the resumption of the bad days .
That ’s not pushing us forward .
That ’s old thinking .
That ’s outdated thinking .
I ’m hopeful that sometime post - George W. Bush , the United states will get in line with the rest of the world and say , we need to rethink this whole direction .
Horton : Yeah , and it may even be the silver lining of all this trouble of the Bush years .
People are going to renew their focus on the nuclear problem because , you ca n’t use a nuke without killing innocent people .
These things have got to go , one way or the other .
Ritter : I totally agree .
Look , I ’m a big fan of the zero option .
That ’s why I just do n’t want to get into the discussion about Iran having nuclear weapons  well they can’t .
I do n’t believe Israel should have them .
I do n’t believe we should have them .
I do n’t believe Russia should have them .
I do n’t believe anybody should have them .
I just think its the wrong direction to be taking the conversation , to say , because we have them , other people should have them .
No !
Nuclear weapons are bad .
They are destabilizing , and they have the potential inflicting horrific harm on this planet .
We need to be thinking long term here .
I ’ve got 14 - year - old daughters .
I want them to grow up and live in a world free of nuclear holocaust .
I want them to be able to have children , who can live in a world free of the threat of nuclear holocaust .
If we keep going in the direction we are going right now , I may see a nuclear holocaust in my age , and not only would that be bad for me , it would be devastating for my children .
I just think it ’s time responsible humans realize there can be no justification for having nuclear weapons in this day and age .
Horton : Okay , now back to Iran specifically and their nuclear program  such as it is .
We began by talking about the experts saying that they are 10 years away , which you say means they have n’t started yet .
They ’re not really on the path .
But there ’s a word that stuck out at me in a video I saw of you and Seymour Hersh on a stage in New York last October .
You used the word ‘ tantamount . ’
You said that to the Israeli point of view , if the Iranian ’s have any nuclear technology whatsoever , that is tantamount to their ability to make a nuclear weapon .
Their red line is way way back before your red line .
Is that it ?
Ritter : Yeah , that ’s the Israeli point of view .
I do n’t agree with this point of view , but I acknowledge this point of view .
Horton : I understand , I ’m just saying that it helps your argument .
You accept their [ the Israeli government ] premise that Iran should not be allowed to have nuclear weapons .
You ’re just saying that they are freaking out when there is nothing to freak out about .
Ritter :
Well , the Israelis have taken a very absolutist point of view , which is , they want to take the potential of risk down to as close to zero as possible .
From the Israeli perspective , once you are able to perfect the enrichment of uranium , there is nothing to stop you from going down the path toward nuclear weapons .
So they say “ no ” to enrichment technology [ for Iran ] .
The problem with the Israelis is the rest of the world just disagrees with that premise .
We have an Nonproliferation Treaty and the world has signed it .
Israel has n’t .
The treaty says nations are allowed to pursue this technology for peaceful purposes as long as they embrace certain verification processes .
Horton :
And again , Iran is a member of the NPT and has IAEA inspectors crawling all over the place , and Israel is not a member at all .
Ritter :
That ’s right .
As someone who is a friend of Israel and is sympathetic to the legitimate national security concerns of Israel , I say it is time Israel stop and reflect that its basic stance , when it comes to Iran , is an uncritical one with no legitimacy in the eyes of the majority of the world .
Israel cannot cry wolf when it is itself the biggest wolf on the block .
Horton :
You ’ve said in your book that you are very much pro-Israel , and you ’re very much in favor of the security of Israel , but you point out in your book that the Israelis are actually increasing the risks to themselves by imagining a danger in Iran that does n’t exist .
Israel is going to get into a war over nothing .
How risky is that ?
Ritter :
It ’s very risky .
Genuine security is not brought about by searching for enemies .
Right now Israel is in the hunt for enemies .
Genuine security is brought about by figuring out how to peacefully coexist with your neighbors as equals .
One of the big problems is the Israelis refuse to provide equality to their Arab neighbors .
Israel wants to have a situation where five million people get to dictate regional terms of coexistence to hundreds of millions of people .
That calculus just does n’t work in the long run .
It creates a situation where inevitably Israel is going to find itself in increasingly dangerous situations .
Horton :
Now all throughout your book you tell the entire history since Bush came into power : our relations with Iran ; Iran ’s relations with the IAEA , etc .
It ’s all very complicated : first generation centrifuges ; second generation centrifuges ; what came from A Q Khan ; what did they make themselves and which facility is where .
It seems that in some places in your books there is smoke .
That , wait a minute , Iran ’s been hiding something that now they are admitting to because they have been forced to admit to it .
Is there enough smoke to indicate any kind of fire in terms of a secret nuclear program ?
Ritter :
Well , you have to put everything in it ’s proper perspective .
If you just talk about the smoke , and you leave it without a context , you could say , “ yes , they are cheating , they are hiding something or whatever we have a right to assume . ”
But I always like to believe in mitigating circumstances , especially ones that are legitimate .
You have to ask the question , why were the Iranians hiding this ?
If you investigate and find that Iran has a nuclear weapons program , then the answer will be that they are pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
If you investigate and find the answer is that since 1979 the US has blocked every effort undertaken by the Islamic Republic of Iran to pursue its legitimate rights to acquire technology related to nuclear energy , and furthermore , if the Iranians have determined that possessing a nuclear energy capability is a strategic necessity  not a nicety , but a necessity  for Iran ’s long term survival , you might be able to say , “ wait a minute .
Iran was ‘ cheating ’ or ‘ hiding ’ because that ’s the only way they could acquire this stuff . ”
When you ask the question and investigate , that ’s the answer that comes out .
Not that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons , but that it is the Unites States that instigated their cheating by creating the conditions by which Iran could not acquire the technology it is permitted to acquire under law in legitimate circles .
Why did Iran go to A. Q. Khan ?
Because that was the only outlet available for Iran to acquire the technology they needed .
It just so happens that A Q Khan is also a nuclear weapons proliferator , but the technology for enrichment that A. Q. Khan used in his weapons program is the same technology that is usable in the energy sphere .
So , you have to ask that question .
You have to go down that path .
It ’s the same thing that happened with Saddam .
I was a chief weapons inspector .
I was blocked out of numerous sites at gunpoint .
People said , why is Saddam blocking the inspectors ?
He must be hiding weapons of mass destruction .
But you must ask the question and truly investigate and not just ask in a rhetorical fashion , why is Saddam blocking ?
It turned out Iraq had some legitimate concerns that the inspection teams I was leading were loaded to the gills with CIA and British intelligence operatives who were trying to collect intelligence about the security of Saddam Hussein so that they could assassinate Saddam as part of their unilateral regime change national security objective on Iraq .
Does n’t that put the blockages in a little different perspective ?
Of course it does .
I would say the same thing holds true of Iran and it ’s nuclear program .
Horton : Something we always hear about Iran ’s nuclear program is , “ Come on !
Persia is sitting on a sea of oil .
What could they possibly need a civilian nuclear energy program for ? ”
Ritter : I ’d love to be a Congressman for a day with subpoena authority .
I ’d subpoena Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld .
I ’d say :
“ In 1976 , Dick , when you were White House Chief of Staff , and Donald , when you were the Secretary of Defense for Gerald Ford , you guys concurred that Iran had every right to pursue a nuclear energy program inclusive of indigenous enrichment of uranium capabilities , and yet at that time Iran was one of the major oil producers , awash in a sea of oil .
Why did you reach that conclusion ?
If you do n’t want to testify , I ’ll pull out the documents you signed .
You reached that conclusion because you agreed that the expert opinion in Iran and the US , that Iran had a finite amount of oil , that this oil needed to be exported for Iran to retain economic viability , that Iran was a developing economy , that if it did not develop an alternative energy source , would eventually be consuming the bulk of the oil meant for exportation , thereby destroying Iran ’s ability to generate the income needed build its economy .
It would self - destruct . ”
Wow !
We knew that in 1976 .
And the people that knew it were there same people that 30 years later are saying , “ Iran is awash in a sea of oil .
There is no reason for them to be pursuing a nuclear program other than to acquire nuclear weapons . ”
Horton :
So , it ’s simply a matter of opportunity cost .
I own a shop have some gasoline and some coal .
Do I want to sell my coal and burn my gasoline or sell my gasoline and burn my coal .
It ’s simply a matter of which one is cheaper for me , right ?
Ritter : Well , let ’s say the Iranians could enrich nuclear fuel .
The market for nuclear fuel is n’t that great .
The market for petroleum is huge .
Let ’s say you have gasoline and gasoline sells at $ 6.00 per gallon 
I ’m throwing out a hypothetical number  and you ’ve got coal at $ .39 per unit .
What are you going to heat your house with ?
Gas ?
If you can sell coal at $ .39 while gas would get $ 6.00 ?
You ’re going to sell the gas and heat your house with coal .
The Iranians are going down the same path .
The amount of money they are spending on their nuclear program is not that much money when you think about it .
They are spending about $ 30 billion a year to import gasoline .
Now wait a minute  they are a nation awash in a sea of oil .
What do they need gasoline for ?
Because they do n’t have any refining capacity .
It was all destroyed during the Iran - Iraq war .
So they have to import refined oil products to feed their national economic requirement for consumption .
Iran has a serious energy problem .
They need an alternative source of energy .
Horton : OK .
Now last week I spoke with Philip Giraldi , a former CIA officer , and he agreed with what you said at the beginning of the show ; that there is no evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons program .
But he said , he kind of believes that Iran does , and his CIA friends believe that Iran does , even though they ca n’t prove it .
What do you say about that ?
Ritter : I respect people ’s gut feelings .
As an analyst , you always have a gut feeling .
But I ’ll tell you this : I do n’t act on what I believe ; I act on what I know .
Horton : Right , but your indications are that they really do n’t have any nuclear weapons program ?
Ritter : I ’m somebody who believes that you have to look at the totality of things .
You ca n’t just go on your own prejudices .
My prejudices about Iran were formed in the 1980s with the bombing of Beirut barracks .
I had friend who participated in the Desert One Hostage Rescue mission , I had friends who were held hostage in the Embassy .
I had friends who were blown up in Beirut .
I have a deep , dark hatred for Iranians for what they did to the U.S. Marine Corps , the U.S. military and what they ’ve done to our country .
They held Americans hostage for 444 days .
I do n’t like these people .
But as a professional intelligence analyst , I have to step back away from my own prejudices and say , where do the facts take me on this one ?
I always point out , I ’m not a Catholic .
I ’m not a big fan of the Pope , but if the Pope came up to me and put his hand on the Bible and swore an oath to God that something was so , I would have to take that seriously because I do respect the fact that the Pope is a religious man who takes his religion seriously , and would n’t lightly put his hand on the Bible and swear an oath .
I take the religion of the Ayatollah Khamenei seriously .
This is a serious religious figure .
I ’m not someone who takes him dismissively saying : he ’s an Iranian ; he ’s a cheating Muslim so - and - so .
No .
He ’s a serious Islamic scholar who had issued a fatwa that nuclear weapons are incompatible with Islam , and that the Islamic Republic of Iran will never pursue them .
I ’ve got to take that seriously .
It does n’t mean that I base my whole assessment on that , but it becomes a major part of calculating the intent of Iran .
Intent becomes a very important factor when you have no evidence , and there is no evidence .
So I say , why do you think Iran would do that ?
You say , because they intend to do it .
I say , but what do you base that on ?
I can tell you that the overwhelming amount of indicators available point away from Iran acquiring nuclear weapons .
The evidence does not point to Iran having some kind of intent to acquire nuclear weapons .
Horton :
And now let ’s talk about the peace offers .
There ’s been various attempts .
It ’s been in the news lately about the April 2003 peace offer that Condoleezza Rice is now saying that she never even saw or heard of until the Washington Post reported it last summer .
There was also another peace offer that was to Internationalize Iran ’s nuclear program where they said , let ’s go ahead and bring in French and German companies and we ’ll make it an international consortium .
That way it is all perfectly above board , because it is America ’s allies helping them do it .
Ritter :
But the bottom line again is that we are talking about genuine efforts at diplomacy on the part of Iran to resolve a difficult situation .
To me this screams intent ; the Intent of the Iranians not to pursue nuclear weapons .
If you were going to pursue a nuclear weapons program , why would you agree to these things ?
Why would you put them on the table ?
Why would you go down this path ?
Horton : Right .
Ritter :
It shows me that there is one side that is serious about resolving this and there is another side that is not .
Look , the US government is not about to do anything that legitimizes the Iranian government ’s position .
To sit down and actually negotiate with the Iranians means that you respect what they bring to the table .
You create opportunities to avoid conflict , to avoid confrontation .
The sole purpose of the Bush administration ’s policy objectives vis-à - vis Iran is to create opportunities for conflict and confrontation , because the goal is regime change .
This is what the Bush administration wants .
They do n’t want to negotiate this thing away .
They do n’t want to resolve this .
This is not their objective .
If I hear one more time that the President wants a diplomatic solution , as I ’ve said before , I wo n’t believe it until he puts Condoleezza Rice ’s butt on an airplane and flies her to Tehran .
Then I ’ll say , okay , they are serious about negotiation .
James Baker flew to Europe to meet with Tariq Aziz prior to the 1991 Gulf war .
That proved to me that we were serious about seeking any alternative to war .
This Bush administration is not even close to that .
Horton :
They do n’t want a diplomatic solution .
And again , if we can revisit this April 2003 peace offer .
My understanding is that they offered : to withhold all support for Hamas and Hezbollah ; to go along with the U.S. when it comes to their nuclear program ; they were prepared to recognize Israel even to the degree that Malaysia does .
This is the offer that America turned down , right ?
Ritter : Correct .
I ’m not intimately familiar with the offer .
I do n’t believe Iran was going to withdraw all support for Hamas or Hezbollah .
I think they said that they would reduce the support and would pressure Hamas and Hezbollah to behave .
The recognition of Israel would n’t be that they were going to suddenly exchange embassies but it would be the kind of recognition that says , “ Israel exists .
We may not be happy about it , but Israel exists and we are not going to challenge Israel ’s right to exist . ”
On the nuclear issue Iran is saying , “ look , we ’ll put it on the table .
If it bothers you , OK , let ’s talk about it . ”
It ’s serious diplomacy .
Horton :
If Iran is really willing to compromise about their nuclear program , about Hamas and Hezbollah and about recognition of Israel , why is American policy so intent on regime change ?
Ritter : Because we have ideologues who have bought into a singular direction of travel for the United States .
When you ’re the sole remaining superpower 
I ’ve been in Washington DC and seen this many many times  you say , “ we are America .
We are the sole remaining super power .
We do n’t negotiate .
We do n’t want to treat others as equals .
It ’s our way or the highway . ”
That ’s just the way that it is .
When a policy gets staffed in Washington DC , it becomes dogma .
It becomes unchallengeable by anyone  especially in the international community .
You do n’t let others dictate your terms because that is a sign of weakness .
That old saying , “ absolute power corrupts absolutely ” is absolutely true .
The United States is an extremely corrupt superpower .
As I talked to you before about Israel being a country of 5 million people and dictating the terms of coexistence with hundreds of millions of people in the region .
Well , 300 million Americans think that we can dictate the terms of coexistence with billions of people on the earth .
The earth is our playground .
This is what ’s happening here .
The policies that have been formulated vis-à - vis Iran are very simplistic policies that are part and parcel of the National Security Strategy promulgated in September of 2002 that divides the world up into spheres of American national interests where we are allowed to dictate and impose our will economically , politically , militarily , and preemptively if necessary with total disregard for international law .
After all , international law is nothing more than contract law that can be renegotiated at our whim .
This is what is going on .
We do n’t have responsible policy formulators right now .
We have arrogant , global hegemonists in power .
Horton :
And tomorrow ’s deadline at the UN is for what ?
Ritter : Tomorrow ’s deadline is for Iran to suspend enrichment and to accept the Security Council ’s demand regarding its nuclear program .
Iran is just not going to do it .
Horton :
And so this is just another step towards the path to war , and I guess George Bush would be disappointed if they did suspend , right ?
He wants a war .
Ritter : George Bush wo n’t let them suspend .
What does suspension mean ?
Let ’s say Iran says they suspend enrichment .
Think of the logic now .
We have the IAEA now gaining total access with the most technologically advanced investigative instruments the world has ever seen when it comes to nuclear technology .
They have gained access to all of the identified sites , and they have said that there is nothing here to sustain anything other than a peaceful nuclear program .
The Bush administration has come out and said that Iran buried everything and created this whole alternative universe where secret nuclear programs are underway that are dedicated to military action .
So what if Iran suspends its nuclear program ?
The Bush administration is just going to say , well , you ’ve just hidden it someplace else .
They ’ve created the problem of proving the negative .
Then we are going to tell the Iranians “ we need additional access . ”
The Iranians might agree and say , “ Okay , what do you want to do ? ”
We say ,
“ Go anywhere , anytime . ”
“ You want to come into our Guardian Council ? ”
“ Yes ! ”
“ You want to come into our National Security Council ? ”
” Yes . ”
“ You want to go into secret military industrial facilities ? ”
“ Yes . ”
Finally Iran says , “ And this is at the same time that you have on paper documents that state that your policy is regime change ?
Go pound sand . ”
Iran wo n’t go for it .
If Iran said today that they are going to suspend their nuclear enrichment , that would be unacceptable to Bush administration .
The Bush administration would refuse it .
Horton :
They ’ll just make demand on demand on demand until Iran finally refuses something ?
Ritter :
That ’s correct because their intent is regime change .
Saddam Hussein , at the end of the day , did everything the International Community wanted him to do .
If you reflect on the inspections that transpired between 2002 and March 2003 , those inspectors when into Saddam Hussein ’s bathroom , bedroom , kitchen , living room and basement  that ’s his personal house by the way  not to mention all the other facilities that were out there .
There was never an obstruction .
Anything they wanted to do , they got .
They found nothing that contradicted the CIA ’s assertions about [ the absence of ] hidden WMD capability , and yet at the end of the day , George Bush with a straight face looked the American people in the eye and stated that Saddam has refused the last chance to disarm .
There is nothing the Iranians could do to make these ideologues happy .
They have a policy of regime change , not disarmament .
Horton :
Now let ’s talk about some of the incredibly complicated consequences of war against Iran that we get into by carrying out this simplistic policy .
I interviewed Wayne White , a former State Department intelligence official last week who told me he ’s seen plans that are not just for bombing Natanz and Bushehr , a couple of known nuclear sites , but are for wide ranging attacks against the entire Iranian infrastructure , their subs , their ports , their everything .
Ritter : Well , of course .
This dates back to the time of the Clinton administration .
Reflect back on the 72 - hour bombing campaign that we witnessed , Operation Desert Fox , in December 1998 .
Ostensibly it was done because the Iraqi government had refused access to certain sites for UN inspectors .
So the US ordered the inspectors out and bombed Iraq .
But if one takes a look at the sites that were bombed , a very small percentage of them had anything to do with weapons potential or production capacity .
The majority of the sites dealt with Iraq ’s military , with their National leadership and their security .
These were decapitation strikes .
Why ?
Because the bombing campaign ’s aim was not about disarming Iraq , but creating the conditions wherein certain Iraqi generals , that the CIA believed they had on their payroll , could move into a weakened Baghdad and overthrow Saddam Hussein .
It was a regime change strike .
The same mindset is at play today in Iran .
We ’ve already said  remember what I ’m saying  it ’s not about disarmament .
Disarmament can be negotiated .
The Bush administration will never trust the Iranian government .
The Iranian government can say and do anything and we [ the U.S. ] wo n’t trust them .
So ultimately , the only measure of verification is to remove the Iranian government from power and replace it with one we trust .
So even if we go to war , ostensibly to get rid of a nuclear capability , we will never get rid of it .
Why ?
Because we are bombing the targets we know ; the 12 or so nuclear sites that the IAEA has inspected .
We have already stated that these are not doing nuclear weapons activity .
The ( supposed ) nuclear weapons are happening at other locations , but we do n’t know where they are .
So what are we going to bomb , the great unknown ?
No , the only way to get 100 % certainty is to remove the regime from power .
And so the targets will be targets of decapitation , seeking to eliminate the Iranian leadership , targets of security suppression or neutralization .
We will hit the revolutionary guard .
We will hit the police .
We will hit security services .
We will hit the military targets of destabilization .
We will hit economic targets to create unrest .
The goal is to create conditions inside Iran that empower the Iranian people to rise up and remove the theocracy from power .
That ’s the objective here .
That ’s what the air strikes are supposed to effect .
But I ’ll tell you this .
They ’ll have about as much success as Bill Clinton had in 1998 .
There was no move on Baghdad .
There was never a serious effort to get rid of Saddam Hussein .
It all collapsed and the same thing will happen if we bomb Iran thinking that the Iranian people are going to rise up and assist us .
Horton :
Now as many times as that idea has been panned , do you still think the neoconservatives and the Bush Regime still actually believe that if they bomb Iran , it will encourage the people to rise up and overthrow their government and create an America - friendly one in its place ?
Ritter : Absolutely .
As many times as the notion of Saddam Hussein having some kind of strategic alliance with Osama bin Laden was panned prior to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq , the Bush administration simply created the Office of Special Projects [ sic ] with Douglas Feith , who fabricated intelligence about this linkage , and that ’s what they believe .
It was all cherry picked intelligence , believe me .
It ’s not Douglas Feith alone who is to blame here , though I condemn him wholeheartedly , but the Bush administration .
It is not as though they sat down in a restaurant and said , “ show me all the items on the menu and I ’m going to nibble from the ones I like . ”
They came in and said , “ I only want steak .
Do n’t show me anything other than steak . ”
Doug Feith ’s job was to put steak on the table .
The same thing is happening today .
This is an administration that does not want to hear , “ No . ” It does not want to hear a negative assessment .
They say , “ just feed me steak on Iran .
Give me what I want . ”
What they want is a scenario where the Iranian people rise up and topple the theocracy .
They have bought into this .
They have been speaking with Iranian ex-patriot groups in Los Angeles and New York city , who date back to the time of the Shah , who are telling the administration , “ the Iranian people are dissatisfied with this Iranian government .
They are ready for a change , and they just need help , but they are too afraid .
They have this dictatorship , this security mechanism in place , that is oppressing them .
All the Bush administration has to do is nullify that security mechanism and the Iranian people will rise up . ”
This is what the Bush administration is hearing .
This is what they want to believe .
It fits into their tiny little world view and they refuse to consider anything other than this idea .
Horton :
Well , in the real world , how might Iran fight back against the United States if we did initiate this air campaign .
Ritter :
Well , I always remind people that the Iranians are not stupid .
They are very worldly .
They understand the Middle East better than we do .
They understand Europe better than we do and , frankly speaking , I think if you took Iranian high school students and had a test on American geography and politics , it might become apparent that they understand America better than we do .
They do n’t want war .
They ’ve been to war .
They ’ve seen war .
They ’ve experienced it .
They ’ve buried hundreds of thousands of people .
It ’s the last thing they want , but if we push them in that direction ; if we look for enemies and we pick Iran as our enemy , they will wage war , and it will be a war that is very well thought out .
I always remind people of the cockiness of the Israeli army , and again , I am a friend of Israel .
I ’ve worked very closely with the IDF  but they are very cocky .
Especially when it comes to conflict with Arab fighters .
They believe that the Arabs are cowardly , lack technology , and will fire a few rockets and fire a few shells and then run away before they are captured .
Well , the Israeli ’s got a bloody nose in Southern Lebanon this summer by Hezbollah .
Hezbollah kicked their ass .
Hezbollah did a darned good job , and I just tell people , Hezbollah were the students .
The teachers were the Iranians .
We are getting ready to go up against the masters .
The students kicked the hell out of Israel .
We should keep that in mind as we prepare to take on the masters .
I ’m not saying that Iran is going to conquer America .
They are going to defend themselves , and they are going to be very very careful about how they do this .
They are not going to let themselves get trapped into a losing engagement .
They know the area .
I would say that if we put an aircraft carrier into the Persian Gulf , then we stand a good chance of losing that aircraft carrier .
I would say that if we put troops on the ground , we stand a good chance of loosing those troops .
And people say , well , in three weeks we took Baghdad .
There ’s nobody who can take us on .
Well , you know what , General Patton made a hell of a run from Normandy to Germany during World War II , yet 6 years later North Korea kicked the crap out of us in the Korean peninsula .
If we think for a second that Iran is going to be a repeat of Iraq , we are in for a big wake up call , and this is just the military aspect of it .
Then there ’s the economic aspect .
The Iranian ’s know what makes us tick .
They are going to shut down oil production .
Not just their own but the entire Middle East .
No oil is going to be coming out of the Persian Gulf , and what ’s that do ?
Well , right now we have the global oil production capacity running with an excess capacity of about 1.52 percent .
This means we are just barely producing enough oil to meet the global demand .
That demand is increasing .
If you shut down the Iranian oil and the Persian Gulf oil , and God forbid if Hugo Chavez and Venezuelan oil stops pumping oil in protest , we are looking at negative 20 to 30 percent production capacity .
That means there is not anywhere near enough oil to feed global demand .
Do you think for a second the Indians and the Chinese and all those other developing economies are going to stop seeking access to oil because America was dumb enough to commit economic suicide by attacking Iran ?
No !
America is now going to have to compete on the global market for a finite resource , and the price of oil is going to go through the roof .
I ’ve heard of people talking about $ 250 , $ 300 , $ 350 a barrel .
If you get up that high , it just does n’t matter anymore because the price of oil is reflected in the price of everything .
If we start paying that much for a barrel of oil , we are going to get into a hyperinflation cycle that ’s uncontrollable .
I just tell Americans I saw a photo once of a German in the 1920 ’s during the Weimar Republic when they got hit with hyperinflation .
He was taking a wheelbarrow full of money to the bakery to buy a loaf of bread .
We could be in that kind of situation .
All these Americans living on the margin Look , I do n’t know what percentage of Americans are living paycheck by paycheck , but if you own a house , you have a mortgage .
If you lost your job and did n’t have a paycheck , in two cycles you ’d be homeless and on the street .
I ’ll tell you what , America , get ready for that reality .
Iran is going to kick our butt .
We may thump our chests and have the F - 15s and F - 18s and go in there and bomb and blow things up , but at the end of the day they are still going to be in Iran ; they are still going to function .
America is going to be hurting .
We do n’t have much more capacity to suffer the kinds of losses that we are suffering in Iraq , and I do n’t just mean human life .
I ’m one of these people who bleeds for every American that dies , but recognizes the reality of war .
I say , “ in 4 years we ’ve only lost 3,200 ? ”
We lost 6,000 in a matter of days on the beaches of Iwo Jima .
We lost thousands at Omaha .
We lost thousands in every battle we fought .
That was real war .
Now we are talking about a real war with Iran .
Not this insurgency garbage we are playing with the Iraqis .
Not just tiddlywinks .
We are going to be doing the real thing .
We ’re going into the Super Bowl .
We may not win .
Horton :
In your book , Target Iran , you bring up the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons if our soldiers are stretched too thin and are left vulnerable to attach by the Iranians .
It ’s a possibility that the Americans could get ready and deploy nuclear weapons to defend our soldiers when we pick a fight that we ca n’t finish .
Ritter : George W. Bush is simply a man who does not know war .
He has surrounded himself with people who do not know war .
Condoleezza
Rice does not know war .
Dick Cheney does n’t know war .
None of these people know war .
And so when they strut their stuff and stick out their chest and play the great commander in chief , they are playing games here .
This is not reality based .
Harry Truman knew war .
He fought in WWI .
He knew war .
He saw war firsthand .
Harry Truman was man enough to take a bloody nose in Korea and not use nuclear weapons .
He told MacArthur to pound sand when MacArthur wanted to use nuclear weapons to stop the Chinese coming across the border .
He knew that America could regroup and come back and reengage and fight the war down to our terms .
Maybe not a total victory , but at least something that saved face .
George Bush is n’t man enough to do this .
He ’s going off on an adventure .
I ’m not the only one who is prognosticating disaster here .
There are people saying we are in for tough times , and when these tough times emerge , what is George W. Bush going to do ?
Is he man enough to say , “ Oops , got over extended and got slapped .
Let ’s back up , regroup , go back in and see what we can pull out of this fire here ? ”
Or is he going to say , “ No one does this to America ! ” even though we picked this fight ?
What if the Iranians sink an aircraft carrier or cut off 80,000 troops ?
George W. Bush has come up with a couple of ideas that should scare every American and every citizen of the world .
First , there is the notion of the “ usable ” nuclear weapon .
No longer are we talking about nuclear weapons that are a deterrent .
We have developed families of nuclear weapons that are designed to be used in conventional conflict .
The next thing that should scare everybody is the utilization policy for nuclear weapons .
Under the Bush administration we now acknowledge that America has the right to use nuclear weapons preemptively in a non-nuclear environment .
They ’ve set certain criteria for this which includes scenarios in which significant numbers of American troops are placed in harms way with no real hope for conventional help to mitigate against the impending doom .
So we would use nuclear weapons to break the back of those who are threatening these American troops .
I ’m telling you right now that if we bomb Iran , we are not going to achieve our objectives .
Iran will strike back in a way that is going to hurt us in the short term .
There will be tremendous pressure put on this president to escalate the conflict rapidly to end it fast because it is hurting America economically .
This will result in American boots on the ground , but we wo n’t have enough boots on the ground to dictate the flow of combat on the ground .
The Iranians have 70 million people .
They have hundreds of thousands of troops .
They are fighting on terrain that they know .
They have prepared the traps and they will trap us .
They will threaten our troops with annihilation , and George W. Bush is not a big enough man to say , oops , let ’s back up and regroup .
He could drop a nuclear weapon .
If he drops a nuclear weapon on Iran , just think about that in the Muslim world today .
The infidel has just dropped a nuclear weapon on a Muslim nation that did not threaten anybody ; that did not start this fight .
This is a fight started by the Christians , by the Infidel .
Musharraf is in a very precarious situation in Pakistan .
Why do I pick on Musharraf and Pakistan ?
Because they are a Muslim state that happens to have nuclear weapons  40 - 60 of them .
They have the potential , they have the fissile material for another dozen or two - dozen weapons .
If Musharraf is overthrown by Islamic fundamentalists who are outraged by American use of nuclear weapons against Iran , it does n’t take a rocket scientist to put two and two together and figure out that fissile material will find its way into the hands of Muslim Fundamentalists who will do everything they can to exact revenge on America .
That ’s why I tell Americans , pick a city .
If you want to bomb Iran , pick a city  not an Iranian city , but an American city  because we are going to lose one , at least one .
If we use nuclear weapons against Iran , this game will not stop until an American city is obliterated by a retaliatory nuclear strike .

The droplets propel themselves over metal sheets scored with a carefully designed array of grooves .
The US scientists did the experiment to demonstrate how the random motion of water molecules in hot steam could be channelled into a directed force .
But the team , writing in Physical Review Letters , believes the effect may be useful in driving coolants through overheating computer microchips .
The physics at work here has been witnessed by all of us in the kitchen .
Leave an empty pan on the stove for too long , and water , when you drip it over the scorching pan bottom , will hover over the surface on a bed of steam .
The effect was described in the 18th Century by a German scientist Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost .
What happens is that the heat is so intense , it boils the underside of the water droplet without any physical contact with the pan .
" We were interested in whether it would be possible to use this phenomenon to move liquids around , " said Dr Heiner Linke , the intellectual power behind the self - propelled droplets .
An uphill struggle
The trick seems simple .
Instead of using a smooth surface , the team scored it with a series of skewed triangular grooves .
This gives it a kind of saw - tooth profile .
Now the water droplets appear to push themselves off the long - slope side of the grooves and rocket across the heated surface - instead of just dancing on the spot as they do in the kitchen pan .
The mechanism is a little more complicated and took a while to work out , Dr Linke told the BBC .
" The vapour , " he explained , " mostly flows in one direction , and the droplet sits on the flowing vapour , a bit like a boat carried along in a flowing river . "
Droplets can also climb over steps , and up inclines of up to 12 degrees .
Filmed with high - speed cameras , the droplets appear to take on a life of their own , sliding along like sloppy amoebae .
Although the original intention was to devise an arresting demonstration of how random energy can be rectified into directed motion - the focus of Dr Linke 's main work is with molecular motors - the researchers now think there may be a use for the effect in cooling computer microchips .
The electrical currents now passing through microprocessors are so large the heat they generate can limit computing performance .
Many chips have cooling circuits nowadays , but these require pumps to drive the coolant , which in turn generate even more heat .
Suitably micro-patterned channels , argues Dr Linke , would make the coolant flow automatically .
" It would be very neat if we could use the heat from the chip to be the pump , because you would not need any additional power , but also because the pumping only happens when the thing is warm ; it would also be a thermostat at the same time .
So it would all be in one package . "

Stop Taxing Non-Addicts by Milton Friedman From Reason Magazine , October , 1988 Legalize all drugs .
They could be sold through ordinary retail outlets - primarily , I would presume , drug stores .
There should be no FDA or other controls on the drugs .
( In fact , I 'm in favor of abolishing the FDA for reasons I 've set out elsewhere . )
However , I believe there should be restrictions on sales to minors .
With respect to restrictions on advertising , I feel uneasy about either position .
I shudder at the thought of a TV ad with a pretty woman saying , " My brand will give you a high such as you 've never experienced . "
On the other hand , I have always been very hesitant about restrictions on freedom of adver tising for general free speech reasons .
But whatever my own hesitations , I have very little doubt that legalization would be impossible without substantial restrictions on advertising .
It 's almost impossible to have a confident view about how legalization would affect patterns of usage .
Some elements of legalization would tend to reduce the number of addicts , and some would tend to increase it .
As to which would be dominant , I have no idea .
Currently , for , example , it pays a pusher of drugs to make a capital investment in creating an addict .
He gives somebody a couple of doses free to get him started , because once he creates an addict he has a captive market .
Given that the drug is illegal .
his customer is likely to stick so him .
After legalization on the other hand , it wo n't pay anybody to create addicts .
This undoubtedly would tend to reduce usage .
There 's no doubt , however , that legalization would drastically reduce the market price .
The actual cost of producing drugs , whether cocaine , marijuana , or whatnot , is very low .
They sell for as much as they do now because of the costs of bribing the relevant officials , making it financially attractive for people to take a chance on getting killed or going to jail , etc .
So reducing the costs of bringing drugs to market would result in lower prices , which would undoubtedly have some tendency to increase the quantity demanded .
Then there are also different effects on supply , so it is almost impossible to say what the net result would be .
It may well be that there would be more addicts , and I would regret that result .
I believe that drugs do an enormous amount of harm .
But no law has ever been passed that had zero negative effects .
Judging every law requires balancing negative and positive effects .
In considering the case for legalization , it is important to make a sharp distinction between addicts who hurt themselves and a legal process ( that is , prohibition ) that leads to a much larger number of nonaddicts being hurt .
Legalizing drugs would reduce enormously the number of victims of drug use who are not addicts : people who are mugged , people who are corrupted , the reduction of law and order because of the corruption of law enforcement , and the allocation of a very large fraction of law enforcement resources to this one particular activity .
There are millions of people who are not addicts who are being harmed by the present system - not to mention the harm to the domestic pobtical systems of countries such as Colombia and Peru .
The costs of drug prohibition for nonaddicts , such as the increased risk of getting mugged , are the equivalent of taxes : they are government - imposed costs .
We 're imposing right now these very heavy costs on nonaddicts in the mistaken belief that we are thereby helping addicts .
That 's not sensible .
It would not be sensible after legalization , either .
So although addicts should then be treated the way every other citizen is treated - getting the medical treatment provided any other individual - they should not be given special treatment compared to victims of other medical problems .
I do not believe it is appropriate to impose special taxes on nonaddicts in order to provide benefits to addicts .
It would be very desirable after legalization for private , voluntary organizations to form for the purpose of treating addicts .
I do not believe this is an appropriate function of government any more than I believe health insurance is an appropriate function of government .
On the other hand , if government has a welfare system or a negative income tax , that should be available to addicts as well as anybody else .
We should not impose on addicts any greater stigma than we attach to other victims .
Equal treatment and equal opportunity ought to be the hallmark .
As I wrote in my Newsweek column on drugs 16 years ago , I believe that adults - by this I mean people whom we regard as responsible , and as a practical matter this means people who are neither insane nor below a certain age should be responsible for their own lives .
I'm a Libertarian - a limited government libertarian , not an anarchist libertarian .
People 's freedom to make their own decisions is my fundamental objective .

L.A. Cops Fight Car Chases With GPS Devices
Los Angeles police will propel a GPS device onto a fleeing car .
The device will stick to the car and track its location .
That 'll hopefully reduce dangerous high - speed chases .
The Los Angeles Police Department ( LAPD ) will become the first law enforcement agency to outfit cars with a device that propels and sticks a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) onto a fleeing car .
The department will mount the StarChase LLC device in the grill of some squad cars in the fall .
" Officers in the car would control a green laser light , similar to an aiming device that fixes on your target , " said LAPD Lieutenant Paul Vernon on Friday .
" A small dart - like device is propelled from the officer 's car . "
The LAPD is hopeful the GPS device will reduce the number of high - speed car chases through the city .
The department conducted more than 600 vehicle pursuits in 2005 , up from 581 in the prior year , said Vernon .
Rather than engage in a high - speed chase that is dangerous for the public and police , an officer can trigger the GPS tracking device from their car .
The officer also will have a remote unit , about the size of a device that unlocks a car , when they 're outside the patrol car .
Each StarChase unit can fire two GPS tracking devices in case the first one misses or does not stick to the vehicle .
The GPS device consists of a battery and a radio transmitter embedded in an epoxy compound .
The tag affixes to the suspect 's vehicle and transmits its location via satellite to police headquarters where it is superimposed over a map displayed on a computer .
The GPS tag activates at impact .
It transmits the car 's exact position via a wireless modem .
An encrypted cellular backbone delivers continuous position updates to the StarChase server that pushes location - based information to authorized users through a password - protected Web portal .
The delay between the transmission and the refresh - picture rate from the Web server is about two to three seconds .
The system uses data transmission encryption to ensure security .
StarChase said the platform is approved by the National Security Agency .
The LAPD expects trails to last between four and six months .
The technology is still in development .
A few questions remain .
For example , it 's not clear the optimal distance a patrol car must follow behind a vehicle in pursuit .
Vernon said it 's probably " similar distance an officer would be in most gun fights , which is fairly close , about 21 feet . "
The GPS device is one of three new technologies the department will deploy .
Others include a small Taser gun and a new crime analysis lab .

MadSci Network : Genetics Query :
Mallory :
This is a very good question .
there are lots of differences between animal & plant DNA , but what they are depends on at what you are looking .
Chemically , plant , human , animal , bacteria , fungi , and even many viruses have identical DNA .
DNA is composed of a backbone made from deoxyribose ( A sugar ) and phosphate .
The individual base pairs that encode the genetic information are adenine , guanine , cytosine , and thymine ( AGCT ) .
A base pairs with T , and G base pairs with C , which defines specificity for DNA , and allows one strand to direct the replication of an exact complementary strand , so an organism can make another set of DNA and divide / reproduce .
This was elegently demonstrated by Meselson & Stahl , a observation for which they recieved a Nobel Prize , and it agreed perfectly with the Watson & Crick model of DNA .
So , in many ways , structurally , chemically , and in the nature of reproduction / synthesis , plant DNA and animal DNA are very similar , if not identical .
So much so , that when we place genes from plants and animals inside of bacteria , they will often follow those instructions and produce a foreign protein instead .
This is how human insulin for the treatment of diabetes is produced in a bacteria .
The main difference between plant and animal DNA is in the organization of genes and the size of the total genome , or how many base pairs of DNA the organism has .
As a rule , plants tend to have much larger genomes than their animal counterparts , and they have a lerger portion of garbage and intron DNA .
Very few genes are present in this DNA , and it tends to contain regions that are spliced out , or perhaps serve a structural role in the shape , packing , and placement of the genome .
In terms of size for example , the human genome contains about 3 - 4 billion base pairs of DNA , whereas corn or maize , is perhaps a less complex organism contains a similar number of base pairs .
Some pine trees and lilly plants contain 10 - 100 times as much DNA as a human , most of which does not appear to encode any genes .
The manner in which DNA is chemically modified in the cell is different in plants and animals .
Although many of the same modifications occur in both plants and animals , such as adding methyl ( CH3 ) groups to the DNA , occurs under different circumstances or for different reasons .
I hope this is helpful to you for your project .
Let us know if there is anything else we can answer for you .
Thanks .

Definitely the ' quote of the day ' award goes to Qin Gang , a spokesman for China 's Foreign Ministry , who bizarrely stated that U.S. demands for greater transparency in Chinese military spending are , well , somehow bordering on the pornographic :
According to the Washington Post , the spokesman , in response to recent remarks by Vice President Dick Cheney , said :
" If someone always tears through your clothes and even wants to lift open your underwear , saying ' Let me see what 's inside ' , how would you feel ?
Would you want to call the police ? "
Qin told reporters when asked about Cheney 's remarks .
The difference between China 's stated defense spending and actual defense spending has long been debated ( and disputed ) as the Post articles goes on to note :
China 's defense spending has risen steadily in recent years and , when parliament convenes next week , it is expected to approve another rise in the military budget .
Last year , the National People 's Congress announced a 14.7 percent rise in the defense budget over the previous year , to 284 billion yuan ( $ 36.6 billion ) .
Foreign analysts say China 's true defense expenditure may be up to three times that , and Washington has urged Beijing to be more forthright about its military budget and intentions .
Hmmm ...
Peeks inside underwear , demands for true intentions : that reminds me of a story , from the early days of high school , when I ...
Ah , skip it .

As a symbol of American culture , Coca - Cola has penetrated every nation in the world and is served at the most strictly kosher events .
While Coke has been on the market since 1886 , only since 1935 has it been certified kosher , including kosher lPesach .
Rabbi Tobias Geffen , an Orthodox rabbi who served Atlantas Congregation Shearith Israel from 1910 until his death in 1970 at the age of 99 , is responsible for kashering Coke .
Rabbi Geffen was an unlikely contributor to the worldwide success of the beverage .
Born in Kovno , Lithuania in 1870 , he emigrated to Canton , Ohio in 1903 and accepted his Atlanta pulpit seven years later .
During his long tenure at Shearith Israel , Geffen became the dean of Southern Jewish Orthodoxy .
As the millions of Eastern European Jews who migrated to the United States from Poland , Lithuania , Russia , Ukraine and elsewhere in Eastern Europe before World War I became more Americanized , they wanted increasingly to partake of " real " American life , including consuming American foods and beverages .
While seltzer water might have been the preference of many traditional Jewish immigrants , their rapidly assimilating children and grandchildren demonstrated their Americanization by drinking Coke .
Because he lived in Atlanta where the Coca - Cola Company was headquartered , Rabbi Geffen received letters from several Orthodox rabbinic colleagues around the nation asking whether it was halachicly permissible to consume Coca - Cola .
Uncertain of the answer , Geffen contacted the company to ask for a list of Cokes ingredients .
At the time , Rabbi Geffen did not know that the formula for Coca - Cola is a closely guarded trade secret ; however , once Rabbi Geffen inquired , the Coca - Cola Company made a corporate decision to allow him access to the list of ingredients in Cokes secret formula provided he swore to keep them in utter secrecy .
Geffen agreed to the terms .
The company did not tell Geffen the exact proportions of each ingredient , but just gave him a list of contents by name .
When Geffen was given the list of ingredients , he discovered that one of them was glycerin made from non-kosher beef tallow .
Even though a laboratory chemist told Geffen that the glycerin was present in only one part per thousand ( one part in 60 is dilute enough to earn kosher certification ) , Geffen informed the Coca - Cola Company that , since this glycerin was a planned rather than accidentally added ingredient , observant Jews could not knowingly tolerate its inclusion .
Coke failed to meet Geffens standards .
Back at the companys laboratories , research scientists went to work finding a substitute for tallow - based glycerin and discovered that Proctor and Gamble produced a glycerin from cottonseed and coconut oil .
When they agreed to use to this new ingredient , Geffen gave his hecksher , or seal of approval , for Coke to be marketed as kosher .
Still , a second problem vexed Geffen : the formula for Coke included traces of alcohol that were a by - product of grain kernels .
Since anything derived from grains is chametz , or forbidden at Passover , Coca - Cola could not be certified kosher for use at Passover even after the formula was changed to include vegetable based glycerin .
Cokes chemists experimented and found that , during the Passover season , they could substitute sweeteners produced from beet sugar and cane sugar for grain - based ones without compromising Cokes taste .
They agreed to start manufacturing Coke with the new sugars several weeks before Passover each year .
Rabbi Geffen was pleased to have performed this service for the American Jewish people and the Coca - Cola Company .
In his papers , which are housed in the archives of the American Jewish Historical Society , researchers can find a teshuva ( rabbinic response ) that Geffen wrote which includes the following :
" Because Coca - Cola has already been accepted by the general public in this country and Canada and because it has become an insurmountable problem to induce the great majority of Jews to refrain from partaking of this drink , I have tried earnestly to find a method of permitting its usage .
With the help of G-d I have been able to uncover a pragmatic solution in which there would be no question nor any doubt concerning the ingredients of Coca - Cola . "
Thanks to Rabbi Geffen , even the most observant Jews can feel comfortable that " things go better with Coke . "

Avoiding quicksand along the banks of the Ivindo River in Gabon , Cornell neurobiologists armed with oscilloscopes search for shapes and patterns of electricity created by fish in the water .
They know from their previous research that the various groups of local electric fish have different DNA , different communication patterns and wo n't mate with each other .
However , they now have found a case where two types of electric signals come from fish that have the same DNA .
The researchers ' conclusion :
The fish appear to be on the verge of forming two separate species .
" We think we are seeing evolution in action , " said Matt Arnegard , a neurobiology postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Carl Hopkins , Cornell professor of neurobiology and behavior , who has been recording electric fish in Gabon since the 1970s .
The research , published in the June issue of the Journal of Experimental Biology , describes how some of these fish violate an otherwise regular pattern of mating behavior , and so could be living examples of a species of fish diverging into separate species .
The electric fish -- known as mormyrids -- emit weak electric fields from a batterylike organ in their tails to sense their surroundings and communicate with other fish .
Each species of mormyrid gives off a single characteristic electric impulse resulting in the flash of signals , indicating , for example , aggression , courtship and fear .
While the fish may be able to understand other species ' impulses , said Arnegard , " They seem to only choose to mate with other fish having the same signature waveform as their own . "
Except for some , Arnegard has discovered .
When he joined Hopkins ' lab , the team was about to publish descriptions of two separate species .
But when Arnegard decided to take a genetic look at these particular fish , he could n't find any differences in their DNA sequences .
" These fish have different signals and different appearances , so we were surprised to find no detectable variation in the genetic markers we studied , " Arnegard said .
Because all of the 20 or so species of mormyrid have distinct electric signals , Arnegard believes the different impulses of the fish he studies might be their first step in diverging into different species .
" This might be a snapshot of evolution , " Arnegard said .
Understanding how animals become different species , a process known as speciation , is a major concern in understanding evolution .
Arnegard 's fish may allow researchers to test if a specific type of speciation is possible .
One common type of speciation is geographically dependent .
Animals diverge into separate species because they become physically isolated from each other .
Eventually , genes within each group mutate so that the groups can no longer be considered to be of the same species .
Another type of speciation , which many scientists have found harder to imagine , involves animals that live in the same geographic location but , for some reason , begin to mate selectively and form distinct groups and , ultimately , separate species .
This so - called sympatric speciation is more controversial because there have been few accepted examples of it to date .
" Many scientists claim it 's not feasible , " Arnegard said .
" But it could be a detection problem because speciation occurs over so many generations . "
These Gabon fishes ' impulses , however , can change very quickly in comparison .
So Arnegard suspects that the different shapes of the electric impulses from these mormyrids might be a first step in sympatric speciation .
On the other hand , the fish could be a single species .
" This could be just a polymorphism , like eye color in humans , that violates the fishes ' general evolutionary pattern but does n't give rise to separate species , " said Arnegard , who will return to Gabon in June to conduct further tests , funded by the National Geographic Society .

US markets are falling despite positive comments from the Fed
A large slide in Europe and Asia was compounded by a drop on US indexes .
The Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes fell 0.3 % , while the Nasdaq lost 0.5 % .
London 's FTSE 100 index closed 0.9 % lower .
It has shed 5 % in three days , wiping more than £ 80 bn of its value .
The global sell - off was triggered by fears of a new tax in China on Tuesday , and has now spread to wider issues .
Shares fell 9 % in Shanghai on Tuesday , their biggest daily reverse in 10 years , and dropped a further 87.99 points on Thursday , closing 2.9 % lower .
On Thursday , Germany 's Dax and France 's Cac both fell 1.1 % .
Earlier in the day , Japan 's Nikkei 225 index had closed 0.9 % lower , while Hong Kong 's Hang Seng slipped 1.6 % .
Spreading out
Since Tuesday and China 's tax worries , investors have become more concerned about the state of the US economy and strength of the mortgage market .
On Wednesday , figures from the US Commerce Department showed that the US economy grew at a slower - than - expected pace of 2.2 % in the last three months of 2006 .
Investors are still wondering if the storm is actually over or not

Send us your experiences Q&A : World stocks slump
Other figures showed that spending on new home building fell 19.1 % during the quarter , the sharpest drop since early 1991 , adding to worries over the state of the housing market in the world 's largest economy .
" The biggest risk in the next few weeks is likely to come from the US data front and developments in the mortgage and housing markets , " said analysts at JP Morgan Chase .
Losses in the US were trimmed slightly thanks to good manufacturing data that helped allay some of investors ' fears but it was not enough to turn the market around .
" Right now , everything and anything is viewed in a negative light , " said stock analyst Dick Green .
" It will take a while for the fears to calm down . "
Heady heights
At the same time , investors are questioning whether stock prices have climbed too high , too quickly .
A number of the world 's main indexes have broken records recently , and analysts said that corporate earnings may not be good enough to underpin the gains .
It is not unusual for stock markets to have a significant correction , and then go on to even higher levels .
Last May , the UK's FTSE lost more than 9 % in three weeks , before recovering and surging to its highest level in more than six years in February , 2007 .
" Investors are still wondering if the storm is actually over or not , " said Masatoshi Sato , a senior strategist at Mizuho Investors Securities .
" Aftershocks in some markets , where prices are overvalued , may be seen from now on .
Volatile and sensitive trading is likely to continue at least until mid-March , " he added .

Not so long ago , researchers at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia made a serendipitous discovery : when they punched identification holes in the ears of a certain strain of mice known as MRL , the holes rapidly healed without any sign of scar tissue , and with regenerated cartilage and hair follicles .
Their curiosity was understandably piqued .
Further experiments showed that the regenerative potential of these mice was not limited to healing their ears .
Researchers performed a series of experiments , surgically removing such things as toes , tails , and sections of heart from the mice , and each removed section grew back without evidence of scarring , joints and all .
Of each surgically removed portion , only the brain tissue of the mice was unable to regenerate .
The unique regenerative power of these mice is unheard of in adult mammals , but it is strikingly similar to that exhibited by some amphibians .
Rather than regrowing damaged or lost tissues , mammal physiology closes the wound with scar tissue , which is the body ’s quick response to prevent infection .
When cells from one of these regenerating mice is injected into an ordinary mouse , it takes on the ability to regenerate as well .
After six months of observing these previously ordinary mice , there was no noticeable decline in this healing ability .
The ability seems to be controlled by about a dozen genes , and researchers are almost certain that humans have comparable genes .
Naturally the military is interested in applying this technology to humans , as it would allow a wounded soldier to recover fully , including any amputated limbs or damaged organs .
It also has some interesting implications in repairing non-genetic birth defects , since a defective limb or organ could be removed , and grow back normally .
Scientists also believe that these extraordinary healing properties may extend the lifespan of an organism , but these mice are only eighteen months into their normal two - year lifespan , so it is too early to make any conclusions .
The potential for this regenerative ability in humans is extraordinary , but it is only a matter of time until the lawsuits from prosthetic limb manufacturers start up .
Damn human nature .

LONDON – There have been critics enough of the U.S. - led military actions under way in Afghanistan , but now military commanders too have begun to question just what they are doing in Afghanistan .
Most prominently , an officer who was an aide to the British forces in Helmand , the southern district of Afghanistan that has witnessed the strongest fighting between the Taliban and international forces , has come out with strong criticism of the British army in Afghanistan  and quit the army .
Capt .
Leo Docherty said the British campaign in Helmand province was “ a textbook case of how to screw up a counter - insurgency . ”
His statements came in an open letter that was prominently reported in British media  but not followed up in much public debate .
The army officer raised the fundamental question of the development of Afghanistan arising from the campaign to capture the town of Sangin in Helmand , a military campaign in which he participated .
Docherty says British troops managed to capture the Taliban stronghold , but then had nothing to offer by way of development .
“ The military is just one side of the triangle , ” he said .
“ Where were the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office ? ”
As forces sat back with little to offer , the Taliban hit back , and British troops there are bunkered up and under daily attack , he wrote .
“ Now the ground has been lost , and all we ’re doing in places like Sangin is surviving , ” said Docherty .
“ It ’s completely barking mad . ”
And such action is only provoking greater support for the Taliban , he warned .
“ All those people whose homes have been destroyed and sons killed are going to turn against the British .
It ’s a pretty clear equation  if people are losing homes and poppy fields , they will go and fight .
I certainly would . ”
He added that British troops have been “ grotesquely clumsy ” in their operations , and that the military policy was “ pretty shocking and not something I want to be part of . ”
Development and rights groups have for long been critical of an exclusively military intervention .
They have warned also that military action of this kind appears to local Afghans as part of a larger Western assault on the Muslim world .
“ There were windows of opportunity for collaboration five years ago between the West and Muslim countries , but the window of opportunity is closed now , that is for sure , ” Emmanuel Reinert , head of the Senlis Council , an independent group studying the effects of drugs policies in Afghanistan told IPS .
“ We can still reopen it but we need to show that we are going to change our ways , ” he added .
“ There has to be a clear change in our approach , a change of management . ”
There is little promise that will happen .
The United States has been struggling to get more soldiers into Afghanistan to bolster the international force .
The emphasis on strengthening the military rather than raising resources for development is now only growing .
Human development in the form of improved rights for women is in fact becoming a casualty of the military operations  after declarations that human development was one of the goals of the Afghanistan intervention besides countering terrorism .
The Senlis Council has reported starvation conditions in several parts of southern Afghanistan .
And this is only increasing support for the Taliban , and potentially , for terrorism too .
The increased military presence is not always helping the military , either .
Another British army officer has said in a leaked e-mail that the air force is “ utterly , utterly useless ” in protecting troops on the ground in Afghanistan .
The air force has been called in as ground troops face increased attacks from the Taliban
Such military voices from the front in Afghanistan are in alarming tune with warnings from groups such as the Senlis Council .
Some soldiers are talking the language of development now more than governments .
The new voices from Washington suggest increased pressure on Pakistan to cease military support for the Taliban , under pressure from visiting Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai .
Much of the future of Afghanistan could be decided by decisions  or the lack of them  on increasing development support for Afghanistan .
LFS
Short history and Description
The LFS , or Log- structured File System , is an alternative filesystem design proposed by Rosenblum and Ousterhout and originally implemented for the Sprite operating system at the University of California , Berkeley .
A different version of LFS , called BSD - LFS , was written by Margo Seltzer for 4.4BSD .
The NetBSD LFS is directly derived from the latter , via the 4.4 lite2 release .
LFS presents a radical new design for filesystem layout which makes rather different assumptions than traditional filesystems .
The most important difference is that whereas traditional filesystems lay out files on disk once , near each other , and rewrite those blocks in the same place whenever they need to be rewritten , LFS instead always writes whatever blocks it has to write , all in the same place ( i.e. all blocks to be written at time t 0 are written to adjacent disk locations , regardless of what files they belong to ) , so that the same block of a file , written multiple times , will exist on the disk in multiple different locations .
This allows safe , asynchronous file creation ( the old version of the parent directory still exists in the case of a crash ) ; fast file writes ( all blocks are written together , without intervening head seek ) ; and near - instantaneous crash recovery ( the fs recovers from the last checkpoint and rolls forward , rather than having to be checked in its entirety for consistency ) .
The NetBSD LFS was orphaned for some years before I picked up work on it .
I believe the version in NetBSD - 1.6 to be almost completely working , although there is still work to be done ( see To Do , below , and the NetBSD problem report database ) .

Benchmark results
It is difficult to find an appropriate benchmark , in general : you want to know how fast the system will do what you ask it to do , not how fast it will run benchmark x .
Nevertheless , you may find some benchmark results useful : I have a build test and Sean Davis has volunteered bonnie and tar results .
To Do :
Userland
fsck_lfs : fragmentation measuring and repair as an option .
lfs_cleanerd : do file coalescing .
[ done , needs to be optimized ]
Somehow coordinate " external " processes with the cleaner : dump_lfs fsck_lfs alternative cleaner write strategies ( hole - plugging ? ) get rid of the Ifile entry in the root dir , since no user process needs to see it any more ( use fhopen / fhstat instead )
Social
Code buy - back / exchange request to Dr. Seltzer [ done , but I could always try again ]
Kernel
Write up lfs{get , put}pages for UBC , test for basic operation .
Fix the cleaner so that fragment extension works correctly .

Threads are a seemingly straightforward adaptation of the dominant sequential model of computation to concurrent systems .
Languages require little or no syntactic changes to support threads , and operating systems and architectures have evolved to efficiently support them .
Many technologists are pushing for increased use of multithreading in software in order to take advantage of the predicted increases in parallelism in computer architectures .
In this paper , I argue that this is not a good idea .
Although threads seem to be a small step from sequential computation , in fact , they represent a huge step .
They discard the most essential and appealing properties of sequential computation : understandability , predictability , and determinism .
Threads , as a model of computation , are wildly nondeterministic , and the job of the programmer becomes one of pruning that nondeterminism .
Although many research techniques improve the model by offering more effective pruning , I argue that this is approaching the problem backwards .
Rather than pruning nondeterminism , we should build from essentially deterministic , composable components .
Nondeterminism should be explicitly and judiciously introduced where needed , rather than removed where not needed .
The consequences of this principle are profound .
I argue for the development of concurrent coordination languages based on sound , composable formalisms .
I believe that such languages will yield much more reliable , and more concurrent programs .

The match for the world chess championship taking place in Elista , the capital of the Russian republic of Kalmykia , took a bizarre turn yesterday as one side — unsurprisingly , the player who is trailing — accused the other of suspicious behavior during the games and threatened to quit .
On a day in which no game was played , Silvio Danailov , the manager of Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria , sent a letter to the appeals committee of the match detailing what he said were an excessive number of bathroom breaks — more than 50 per game — by Vladimir Kramnik of Russia .
( The length of the games varied from less than four hours to more than six . )
The letter stopped short of accusing Mr. Kramnik of cheating , presumably by getting the assistance of a computer , but it noted that there was no surveillance equipment in the private bathrooms used by the players , and it demanded that both players be required to use a public restroom from now on , and then only when accompanied by a match referee .
The letter , which was sent to several journalists , concluded by saying that Mr. Topalov might withdraw from the match if the demands were not met .
An appeals committee will review the protest , and presumably will take it seriously to avoid having the match derailed .
Starting Fire With an Ice Lens
by Bob Gillis
Use clear lake or pond ice .
To practice , boil water for 10 minutes to remove gas .
Let it cool , then boil 10 minutes again .
Let it cool again , then freeze slowly .
Create a foil container 2 " deep and freeze slowly .
Or buy a clear block of ice .
To make fire , the ice must be clear .
Shape the ice lens for fire making .
First shave with a knife to get the rough shape of a lens .
You can also grind your ice fire lens on cement or a stone .
Finish shaping your ice fire lens by using the heat of your hand to melt the ice lens smooth .
The edge of your lens should look something like this .
Locate tinder that is completely dry and finely divided .
With the sun at its highest in the sky hold your lens perpendicular to the sun and move it up and down to focus the brightest spot of light onto your tinder .
Be careful to avoid dripping water onto your tinder .
The tinder will first smoke and then ignite .
Carefully add more tinder and very small sticks until a good fire is established .
E-mail from Elijah Cobb :
Hi Bob ;
I would be happy for you to use the images that Linda Raynolds took of my fire with ice making .
Enclose are some others .
These are taken by other folks .
A local paper ran a story that was not very informative .
The other local paper may do a story also - perhaps it will be worth sending to you .
I used professionally made ice that was very clear .
I have not been able to freeze a good size piece of clear ice outdoors .
I do n't live near a lake so I really have no idea how often you would be able to find a nice clear piece of ice .
Because I had a large piece I went for size - maximum light gathering / concentrating .
My focal the focal length of the lens was about 10 inches and the diameter of the focal area was about 50 cent size .
The focal area was not very coherent but seemed to have quite a bit of depth .
It would produce smoke on dark paper in less than thirty seconds , and you could not hold your hand in the focal area for more that twenty plus seconds .
I carved the lens with a 2 " chisel and smoothed by hand with a flexible sheet abrasive for tile work .
I was amazed that it worked on my first real try .
I thought it would need to be much more accurately focused .
I assume a much smaller lens could be made to work .
I tried to make a smaller lens with a flat side and deeply curved surfaces - almost a sphere .
I have not gotten it to work yet but I think this is the way to go - no double convex surfaces to line up with each other .
I accidently destroyed it by exposing it to too much sun light which fogs , crazes and makes bubbles in the lens so that all the light scatters instead of focusing .
After using my two big lens for about four hours each they were both useless .
The shape was fine but the ice was to bubbly and crazed .
Just before trying to make a fire I usually ran a bit of cool water over the surface of the lens to clarify it .
( water too cold if freezes in rivulets - too warm it will make thermal stress crack through the whole lens / block of ice )
Many folks assumed that I had made a mold and frozen water in it .
My experience with making ice for fun sculptures is that I could not get ice that was any where near clear enough .
Perhaps it would work in a freezer with distilled and boiled ( deoxygenated ) water with an insulator on the side away from the cooling coils .

A GOOGLE bomb — which some Web gurus have suggested is perhaps better called a link bomb , in that it affects most search engines — has typically been thought of as something between a prank and a form of protest .
The idea is to select a certain search term or phrase ( “ borrowed time , ” for example ) , and then try to force a certain Web site ( say , the Pentagon ’s official Donald H. Rumsfeld profile ) to appear at or near the top of a search engine ’s results whenever that term is queried .
As Google has explained on the company ’s blog , this can be accomplished if enough “ determined pranksters ” use the selected phrase to both describe — and link to — the chosen site , because “ results are generated by computer programs that rank Web pages in large part by examining the number and relative popularity ” of other sites that link to them .
It may be in Google ’s interest to think of link bombs as nothing more than pranks , but Clifford Tatum , a doctoral student in communications at the University of Washington , compared them in a paper published in the online journal First Monday ( www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue10_10/) to the “ media mindbombs ” conceived by the late co-founder of Greenpeace , Bob Hunter .
“ Reaching the public consciousness through dramatic , camera - ready opposition to environmental crimes ” is how Greenpeace describes Mr. Hunter ’s concept .

Think Progress :
Last week , Bush administration officials invited senior congressional reporters to the White House and pressured them to increase their coverage of how Iraq war critics are " divided " over legislative strategy , multiple sources have confirmed with ThinkProgress .
The sources say White House officials pointed to examples of national political reporters who have highlighted such " division " and pressed the congressional reporters to follow suit .
Specifically , the White House pointed to a recent AP piece on Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) , which reported that Obama believes that " [ i ] f President Bush vetoes an Iraq war spending bill as promised , Congress quickly will provide the money without the withdrawal timeline the White House objects to . "
In a speech this week , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) also drew attention to the AP 's characterization :
When the president vetoes , as he should , the bill that refuses to support General Petraeus ' new plan , I hope Democrats in Congress will heed the advice of one of their leading candidates for president , Senator Obama , and immediately pass a new bill to provide support to our troops in Iraq without substituting their partisan interests for those of our troops and our country .
The effort to highlight this article is notable because it turned out to be baseless .
The AP report never directly quoted Obama saying that Congress would give up its fight for a withdrawal timeline , and Obama has said the AP 's characterization is false .
Indeed , Obama has been quoted saying the direct opposite - that Congress will continue to force votes on a timeline - both before and after the AP report .
Instant Usability ...
How Freshbooks .
Com Turns Learners into Users on Every Page Jack Bellis , May 20 , 2006 Synopsis :
The FreshBooks.com online business application is a model of techniques that can be used to make an interface self - training .
It does this through excellent user interface design ( both interaction and visuals ) and a veritable encyclopedia of methods for embedding instruction right into the interface .
This article enumerates and shows each technique .
I recently came upon an online application , FreshBooks.com , that absolutely epitomizes how to make a system self - training .
In my view of the user experience ( UX ) world , usability has two halves : learnability , which is fairly self - explanatory , and facility , by which I mean the speed of use once learned .
So the example of FreshBooks represents what might , by some accounting , be roughly half of the solution to the usability puzzle .
In this article I 'll dissect their design and explain how each technique contributes to the overall effect .
Although anyone in the UX field might enjoy this article , it is especially targeted to new students of software development because your knowledge of usability is the key to the great software yet to be created .
What Is FreshBooks ?
FreshBooks is an online invoicing application , but it includes a growing suite of other tools such as timesheets and customer support tickets .
Some of you might know of it from its previous domain name , SecondSite.biz .
I think I learned about it on AListApart.com ( a technology magazine for web design issues ) so it ’s probably popular with freelancers in the software world .
Constantine and Lockwood 's List I 've been on the lookout for exemplary web apps , as opposed to content - centric sites , for years now , as models of design solutions , so I gladly clicked that advertising link in AListApart .
After just a few minutes using its free trial , I found FreshBooks to be a model of the techniques for eliminating the need for advance training of a software application .
An article by Larry Constantine & Lucy Lockwood , Instructive Interaction : Making Innovative Interfaces Self - Teaching does a comprehensive job of defining the techniques .
The article is from 2002 but still perfectly current and well worth reading .
On page 6 they zero in on what they call “ instructive interaction , ” items such as the following : Balloon Tips
Embedded Prompts
Instructive Animation
Progressive Disclosure
Start Highlighting … and so on .
The article covers all of the ingredients that make software self - training , not just informational techniques but also the broader values of forgiveness , undo support , explorability , and so on .
Although FreshBooks clearly answers those higher callings — I ’ve heard them called “ lofty goals ” — this article will focus on instructional techniques and explict interaction design , showing exactly how FreshBooks employs them .
If you 've made it this far , I have a free gift for the first 10 visitors who reply .
( Still available . )
If you know anyone who 's learning to read , email me and I 'll send you a free copy of a kid's book I wrote that has just been printed ( February 14th , 2007 ) .
Please include " Poopy Phonics " in the subject line so I have a chance of recovering it if it goes to my spam folder .
For smart mouths everywhere , the book is PoopyPhonics ( .com ) .
No strings attached , but if you like it , consider posting a review to Amazon.com .
— Thanks ,
Jack — No spam , no emails , no private info given out —
On Amazon The Techniques Very few of the techniques are particularly groundbreaking .
They just happen to be used well and all in one place .
FreshBooks has a completely free trial mode , so I encourage you to give it a try .
If I ’m not right about its usability , let me know .
I found a few — very few — usability imperfections , but they 're not significant enough to even bother with in this article .
( If you 're really curious and want to see how good an eye you have for usability , send me an email with at least one flaw that you find , and I 'll send you back my list . )
The techniques that follow have been grouped a little bit but otherwise are in the order in which they were discovered .
1 . Sandbox
In fact that free trial mode that I mentioned is the first instructional technique … a no-risk environment in which to play .
It has just enough sample data , so you can use most features without doing your own setup of every single item .
2 . Fly - In Field Help
The following image shows the technique that hooked me almost from the start .
On their initial setup page , the help flies in from the right as you anchor the cursor in a section :
As you anchor the cursor in each field , that field 's help appears .
Now we all know ( do n't we ? ) that animation is generally frowned upon ... but here it 's pure state - of - the art ... it works for the teacher , like a song - and - dance supporting a tough math or science lesson .
( Did anyone else have Mr. Issod for chemistry ? )
I 've been recommending fixed - in - place , embedded help for years now but it 's still easily ignored .
The fly - in technique gives it impact .
When looking back through FreshBooks to get a screen capture of the fly - in help , I could n’t find it .
That ’s because it ’s used very sparingly … only on the first pass through the account setup wizard .
When you later modify account info , there 's no distracting motion .
So the lesson of using animation conservatively is not lost on the Freshbooks designers … they know it ’s not something to overuse .
Prior to writing this story , I spoke with the folks at FreshBooks and they told me that the animated help vindicated itself quite clearly in the support department , through the reduced call volume .
3 . Support Phone Number ( With Time Zone )
When I ’m done this article , I want to have a veritable functional spec of self - training techniques , so it ’s not trivial or even tangential that a phone number , a “ voice link , ” is prominently displayed .
Self - training does n’t mean “ never has a problem . ”
The availability of a phone number is something I look for on the website of any distance vendor with whom I ’m considering doing business .
I ’ll even make a preemptive phone call to judge their accessibility if it ’s an important purchase .
4 . On - the - Fly Feedback
Going back one step , even in the page where you initially identify your trial account , two things show up that start to really distinguish the site 's usability .
First , as you type your company name , the prompt on the page updates interactively — letter by letter — to tell you the URL at which your system can be accessed .
I call this on - the - fly feedback .
I stopped to consider whether this is an instructional technique , even with a liberal interpretation .
Or is it simply good interaction design ?
After all , could n’t a dialog box , after saving the form , be just as instructional ?
No .
The reason it is instructional is that you see the effect of Company Name without waiting until it 's too late to change your mind .
You know by seeing the URL built that Company Name is not simply a descriptive field but also a unique identifier … and you know not to make it so long that you might forget it after your bookmark or favorite has been deleted .
OK , it ’s good interaction design , too .
5 . Explicit Button Labels
Most systems use formulaic button labels such as Submit or OK , even when they ’re not as instructive , because they 're built into the tools that make the forms .
By putting four words on the " Create ... " button above , there ’s no question what the result is .
It even reinforces the user ’s subsequent language .
Imagine a later conversation …
“ Did you create a FreshBooks account ? ”
The user does n’t have to recall a “ page name , ” such as Create FreshBooks Account , to confirm if they created an account .
6 . Explain , Advise , Inform
The following image shows the login page .
Although logging in is a simple matter on return visits , it has important peculiarities in this particular scenario , for two reasons : 1 ) it is a trial system , 2 ) the web was never designed for applications .
To deal with these complexities , there are three types of information provided on this page , above and beyond the actual prompts :
An explanation of the temporary login .
The user needs to understand what ’s going on and how to use it .
of the temporary login .
The user needs to understand what ’s going on and how to use it .
Advice about saving a bookmark .
It ’s advice because performing it is optional .
about saving a bookmark .
It ’s advice because performing it is optional .
Information about the requirement for cookies .
Too Much Wording ?
By this time , perhaps you 're asking , " When is more text too much ? "
I 'm glad you asked .
The answer is that it 's a balancing act and requires judgment .
If you make the right judgment , you 're called an interaction designer , or Ix , Ux , IA , choose whatever flavor you feel is appropritate .
If you make the wrong judgment , you 're probably something else , not that there 's anything wrong with that .
7 . Can't -Miss Error Formatting
The following figure shows the formatting for " inline " errors , meaning those that appear right in the problem page or " context . "
I 've seen more elegant formats , but none more noticeable .
In fact maybe this is a good time to mention the overall look and feel of the site .
They could have used a warning icon or a framed box , or a soft red - to - white gradient background but they did n't .
The whole look of FreshBooks is a slightly spartan , " plain HTML " decor , with some nice effects sprinkled on top .
Web designer Luke W. , http://www.lukew.com, points out that a site ends up having a visual " personality " that is more than the sum of its graphical parts .
If you 've ever designed a site from a blank page and found yourself adding unplanned graphical elements to it , you can appreciate this phenomenon ; you end up saying , wow , I did n't really set out to make it look bold / stark / elegant / intimidating / warm ... but that 's how it ended up .
The personality of FreshBooks is clean , crisp , no -nonsense , inviting ... and to those in the business , this implies speed .
Speed is good .
8 . Password Explanation
This next technique is a literal , special case of providing information .
When users are creating their passwords , provide an explanation of minimum password requirements : 9 . Announcements Area Provide an area at the top of the home page for announcements from the system owner .
FB calls it News : I 've heard the terms " bulletin board , " " messages , " and " notices , " but I like " Announcements . "
It 's indicative of being broadcast to everyone .
An announcements feature enables you to augment training over the course of time .
If your home page has a lot of functionality , consider making it collapsible but only for the session or until a new announcement .
FreshBooks has separate news functions for your clients and staff .
10 . Intro Panels
Now we start to get into the " heavy lifting " if you will allow that embedded instruction entails real work .
The following figure shows what I call an intro panel : Although I 've probably seen lots of examples building up to this technique , the first thorough use of it that I recall is in Salesforce.com .
The FreshBooks model really nails it .
Notice it includes the following key features : Real information , not just instructions on how to click a button or complete a form .
( That 's been the bane of software techwriting for the last 15 years .
As interfaces became graphical , most writing fell into a trap where it described the interface instead of how the system works . )
Notice the second and third bullets tell you how tickets work !
Even the first bullet , which would be gratuitous if it simply explained clicking New Ticket , actually tells you that it 's a feature for your clients .
The link to more information is important to have .
Both the functionality of having the intro panel disappear and the explanation of when it does so are important .
11 . Choose Clarity Over Consistency
The following figure shows a simple interaction design choice , but a subtle one .
Given the visual layout that they 're using in this example , many teams would have opted for a dropdown list with Yes / No choices for the third item , rationalizing that it looks more consistent .
Instead they used the more appropriate control from an interaction and comprehension point of view ... a checkbox .
What do I mean by " comprehension ? "
I mean that the " message " of the checkbox goes right from the user 's eyes to the final destination in the brain without slowing down anywhere .
It says " I 'm an on - off switch . "
The FB designers understood that visual consistency is not the Mother of All Design Rules : when the limiting factor is training , it is more important to honor functionality than aesthetic consistency .
12 . Legends Right on the Page
The following figure shows how legends are placed right on the page where they are used as cues :
The Support Ticket Legend is actually from an unrelated page but I added it to show how color - coding is indicated .
If space is at a premium , put the legend in an area that can be hidden once the user values space more than training .
13 . Link - and - Blurb " Menus " Perhaps you can tell me a more sophisticated name for it , but the following figure shows what I call a link - and - blurb layout .
It 's a list of reports , and in contrast to a typical Win / Mac system where the reports might be on a dropdown menu of terse names , this page shows descriptions .
Notice helpful details such as the words " active client " and " grouped by client . "
As a report list grows , these are key values provided by this type of menu .
14 . Catch - All Choices
The following figure shows that FB makes reports available in both categorical and all - in - one lists .
There 's an All Reports link and individual category links such as Document Reports :
There are several subtly different principles involved in this one example but the first one concerns the availability of a catch - all listing for all reports .
By providing a unified list , the user gets at least two advantages .
First , you can see at a glance the scope of reports ... a gauge of the system 's breadth .
Second , and more importantly , if your mental model does n't match that of the person who made the groupings , you can still find the report you want .
15 . Two Paths to Functions
The second principle in the reports menu is the notion of having multiple links to a single function .
I use the analogy of rooms in a building ... it 's often helpful to have doors on two sides of a room , so why should n't the same apply to software functions ?
16 . Ubiquitous Linking
I 'm not sure what to call this one , so I 'll start the bidding at " ubiquitous linking , " and ask the audience to vote on it ( as in email me ) .
Notice in the following figure that something as un-functional as the version number is linked :
Of course it 's linked to a list of that version 's features .
The principle is that everything that has significant information associated with it should be linked ... to that information .
What could be more natural ?
Yes , as more things are linked , other design issues will arise , but that 's not my fault is it ?
What ?
No More Blue Underlining ?
If you go to Macromedia . com 's home page , you 'll notice that underlining links ain't what it used to be .
On pages that are primarily functionality ( as opposed to text ) everything might eventually be a link and the ol ' blue underlining will be a thing of the past .
I recommend even today , that visited text links in prose should probably turn the same color as the text , but still be underlined .
17 . Visually Efficient Information
The following figure shows FB 's upgrade page , which is now a fairly standard layout for a comparison chart :
Although it 's fairly standard , it 's by no means universal .
( Here 's an example of a page that does n't do it right . )
The key is that your eye can discern the differences in the plans in a single action .
I 'm guessing they get only the barest minimum of calls asking to clarify their rates .
The use of icons instead of words for the " yes " items is key .
This is the subject matter of a book by Edward Tufte entitled the Visual Display of Quantitative Information .
If he has a name for this technique of reducing parallel information to a single glance , let me know .
( I have n't read the book ... I only looked at the pictures . )
The chart above also has a subtle interaction technique : when you point the mouse at one of the purchase buttons , the corresponding whole column turns blue , as shown by the second column .
This reinforces that you are choosing the column you intend .
This might be a tiny morsel of usability but that does n't make it a foregone conclusion .
Someone had to have that idea and value it enough to ask for it ; someone else had to write or find the code .
In today 's software development world , unfortunately almost all such code must be written over and over again ... it does n't just come already organized in a boileplate or framework project .
The effect , though bordering on frivolous ( by some shop 's low UI standards ) , is one of many , many feedback mechanisms that accumulate into a whole that is more than the sum of its parts .
I call this particular category of technique " compelling interaction , " and it 's one of my triumvirate of home page design .
18 . Display Visuals with Visuals , not Text
The following figure shows what would , in most other systems , be a set of sentences describing regions of the screen .
At best the image shown below would be relegated to a help file .
In FB it 's right in the interface : 19 .
Put Advice on Menus
When a menu needs more than just an explanation , put the related information right there .
The following figure shows " advice " on importing and " information " on exporting .
The note about using Reports as an export method is applicable to a lot of system lately .
20 . Explain What Can't Be Done
As interfaces become more powerful , self - evident , and bulletproof , one of the most important things remaining to help users with is explaining what can't be done ... what the system does not support .
The following message in the documents list does exactly this :
There 's a broader , common theme surrounding this " ca n't be done " issue .
In general look for things that users must be told in the negative , including things they might intuitively expect , but are not the case .
Here 's another example , explaining that overpayments are not supported :
The wording is subtly but significantly more informative than a typical " exception message " such as " Payment is greater than amount invoiced . "
It identifies a feature that is not supported .
This is a level of information that many organizations are embarrased to offer ... and simply end up paying for in training and support costs .
21 . Menus in Order of Frequency
The following figure shows what FB looks like when your clients log in .
For instance , what if I used FB to invoice Microsoft $ 54 billion for all the time I 've lost rebooting Windows from ' 92 to 2003 ( It 's much better now , is n't it ?...
Kids do n't know how good they have it ) .
When Bill logs into FB , he sees this :
The two links on the right are also on the Invoices and Documents tabs , but because they 're the most likely options that a client would look at , they 're right on the home page .
Systems have called these lists many things over the years , hotlists , quick picks , and so on .
The name is n't as important as the idea : it is a menu in order of frequency of use rather than the traditional menu order , functional category .
On a content centric site , it could be called popularity .
The next figure shows the same quick links feature from the Client page .
This page really drives home the notion that the links are to disparate functions that would not even be on similar menus .
You could make a case that this is slightly , but distinctly different than " frequency . "
Instead of being related functionally , they are related by data ... the customer : 22 .
Put Links Right in the Interaction Flow
The following figure shows a link to preview an anouncement , placed right in the " saved " confirmation message :
This is yet another example where links to a single function are in multiple places .
In this particular case , the goal is to provide the pertinent functionality right at the place where the user 's thought process and eyes are going .
In the development world , where any form of redundancy is frowned upon — and justifiably so — such a design is not easily " sold " to the technical team .
But here , a clear choice has been made to put the user experience first .
( In an ideal development world , the two visible links might invisibly invoke a shared reference so that no risk of redundancy is actually introduced . )
The next figure shows the same principle in the invoice page .
The Add Line link is right where you need another line added , and the Enter Payment link is at the " bottom line " in case you are entering an invoice at the time you receive funds , instead of in advance :
And one last example ... after adding a client , there 's a link to invoice them : 23 .
Talk Casually ...
Invent Words ?
Occasionally I 'll get into a discussion with someone as to whether " uncheck " is a word .
Well , let me tell you , it is now , whether you find it in Dictionary .com or not .
The FB interface deals with this issue too , and labels a button " Un- Archive " because that 's the clearest way to label the function .
I 'd say that I authorize you to invent words if you have to , but that 's not really accurate .
If a term is in common use to communicate , then it is already a word .
Trust me on this , wudja ?
24 . Explicit Empty Messages
When lists are empty , say so explicitly as shown in the following message : 25 .
Warn Before , Not After Warnings are n't warnings if they are provided after a problem occurs .
The following figure shows a good way to put a file size limit right into a field label :
The " 0.4 MB " message is also another example of the same concept .
( It appears to be a discrepancy but it is because the account is a trial account .
26 . Explain Time Lags
The following figure shows an explanation of an automated process that occurs at what would otherwise be a mysterious time .
Any form of delay must be explained to users or your application will be extremely hard to understand and you will never be able to get off the support phone .
27 . Explicit Progress Messages
Here 's a more important timing item .
One of the most troublesome interaction design weaknesses of creating applications in a web browser is feedback when processes take more than an instant .
The default behavior of the browser is to show the progress in the Windows status bar , which is so subtle as to wreak havoc .
The following figure shows that FB has a custom solution to present a prominent message right in the middle of the screen :
In my 1997 book , " Computers Stink " I pronounced , " When the user does not have control , announce it prominently " and FB answers the call .
If you 're really curious , see page 54 of the 650K PDF .
I never really published the book , though I did have 100 crude copies produced and you might get one online if you want to be a collector .
It 's probably decent reading , with a lot of good anecdotes from my years installing point - of - sale systems .
And a lot of the usability rants are still applicable 9 years later , though folks like those at FreshBooks are making strides .
We 're gettin ' there folks .
Computers Stink is listed on my Resources Page .
28 . Optimize Repetitive Processes
The following figure shows a button that has been added particularly to support repetitive processes :
Is this just another case of putting interactions in the right place ?
No .
It 's an entirely new interaction that has been added to eliminate one " measly , little " user action .
For administrative or occasional functions , one click is not a big deal .
But for repetitive functions , also called " transactions " or " heads - down " functions , every click and keystroke matters ... to all of us users .
They 're Only " Little Things " If You Do Them !
That concludes our instant learning tour of Freshbooks.com .
I hope you 've learned a few things .
We 've shown just how many " little things " — our 28 are just a sampling — add up to " instructive interaction . "
And there are some pretty nit - pickin ' items in this list , eh ?
( Did I mention that FB is out of Ontario , Canada ? )
But as I 've observed over the years , they 're only little things if you do them .
If you do n't , they 're big things .
They 're big enough to mean the difference between online success and failure .
Let 's take that last item , optimizing repetitive processes , as an example .
When you are designing interfaces , which of the following two questions are you more likely to be asking yourself or your team ?
" Why should we do this ?
After all , it will only save the user one click / keystroke . " - or - " Is there a good way we can save the user one more click / keystroke ? "
If you 're asking the first question , beware : there are companies like FreshBooks out there , one website away , providing a higher level of service and ready to take your customers as fast as you can say " Free Trial . "
As for me , I have to go add a lot of these things to my Function Tree .

Most of those killed are soldiers but the fighting took place in the river port town of Malakal so correspondents say many civilians may also have died .
A BBC correspondent in Sudan says the clashes are the most serious breach of a 2005 deal to end two decades of war .
Under that deal , the former rebels joined a power - sharing government .
Tanks
What started as a clash between a northern militia led by Maj Gen Gabriel Tang and the Sudan People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) former rebels escalated when the militia took shelter in a Sudanese army garrison .
The garrison was besieged and then the SPLA stormed the base .
Malakal is a busy port town on the banks of the Nile
The next day the Sudanese army returned and following tank battles and the shelling of parts of Malakal town , retook their camp .
Though the situation is now reported to be calm , parts of Malakal are still too tense to access , so no - one is putting an exact figure on the number of casualties .
High - level delegations from the capital , Khartoum , and the southern capital , Juba , as well as UN peacekeepers have been sent to defuse the situation and a ceasefire has now been agreed , with all forces returning to their original positions .
After fighting each other for more than 20 years , both the mainly Christian and animist SPLA and the Muslim , Arab north say they are keen to prevent any slide towards further conflict .
United Nations Secretary - General Kofi Annan said he was " deeply concerned " over clashes that flared in the southern town of Malakal on Monday and Tuesday .
Non-essential UN and aid agency staff have been leaving Malakal .
In a statement , Mr Annan appealed to Sudan 's national unity government and that of southern Sudan " to make all possible efforts to contain the situation " .
The UN peacekeepers in the town moved to defend their staff and offices .
A spokeswoman said they had no mandate to intervene and that the UN was encouraging both sides to peacefully resolve the situation .
There are 10,000 UN peacekeepers deployed in southern Sudan at a cost of $ 1bn a year .
Marginalisation
Under the terms of the peace deal , some army units are supposed to merge and these clashes were between troops who are officially part of the same force .
The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Khartoum says there has been a long dispute between Gen Tang 's militia and the SPLA over control of an area near Malakal , located on the banks of the Nile near Sudan 's oilfields .
The peace deal has held - until now
During 20 years of civil war , Khartoum armed numerous ethnic militias in the area to enable it to begin extracting oil .
Unlike the continuing conflict in the western region of Darfur , Sudan 's north - south ceasefire has largely held but few militiamen have handed in their weapons .
Under the peace deal , the SPLA joined a unity government and SPLA leader Salva Kiir is national vice - president .
Last month , however , south Sudan 's Vice - President Riek Machar told the BBC that some aspects of the deal had not been implemented , such as sharing oil revenue and civil service jobs .
At the time BBC Africa analyst Martin Plaut said anger was growing in the south at their perceived marginalisation .
Some two million Iraqis are estimated to have fled the country
The UN faces an enormous task in helping countries such as Jordan and Syria cope with the huge influx of Iraqi refugees , a spokesman said .
He said the international community had to step in to help address their food , health and education needs .
Syria says it is home to 1.2 m Iraqi refugees , with up to 800,000 in Jordan .
Damascus has repeatedly called for help to deal with the problem .
UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said : " There has been an abject denial of the impact , the humanitarian impact , of the war , the huge displacement within Iraq of up to 1.9 million people who are homeless because of the war , and those people who are homeless and never got back to the homes after Saddam Hussein was overthrown . "
There 's a need for governments to come in and address the health , the education , all the needs
Peter Kessler
UNHCR spokesman
Exiles in deportation fear Doors close on fleeing Iraqis
Many of the refugees need considerable support , and about a quarter of them are children who need education .
Many need food and healthcare , some need counselling because of the violence they have experienced or witnessed , while others need jobs .
" There 's a need for governments to come in and address the health , the education , all the needs , " Mr Kessler said .
" Food aid needs as well are becoming vital because the population is becoming further and further impoverished since they cannot work .
" So clearly in every area , there 's a need to support what the main host governments are doing and then to gird ourselves for what could be , if the war is prolonged , an increasing movement further westwards . "
Displaced inside Iraq
On top of that , almost two million more people are displaced inside Iraq - people who have fled their homes to escape the violence .
Jordan has an interest in stopping Iraq from disintegration , for fear that the already high number of refugees going to Jordan will increase substantially
Iraq neighbours ' interests
That number , too , is steadily growing , the UN says , with some provinces feeling overwhelmed and attempting to close their boundaries to refugees from other areas .
Many Sunni Arab and Shia people have been forced to flee from mixed areas to districts where their respective communities are in the majority .
A number of Arab Iraqis have moved to the autonomous Kurdish area in the north , where the security problems are less severe .
Most of the people killed in Iraq 's violence are men .
Their deaths leave households headed by women who struggle to survive the loss of the main breadwinner , says the BBC's Jill McGivering .
The public distribution system within Iraq is no longer providing a safety net for these people in the way it used to .
All these factors encourage the flow of people into other countries .
US judge orders domestic spying cases to proceed
US officials failed to sideline dozens of domestic spying lawsuits on Tuesday as a federal judge ordered the war on terror - connected cases to proceed despite a pending appeal .
San Francisco District Court Chief Judge Vaughn
Walker issued a brief written ruling that allowed evidence - gathering to commence conditionally despite protests by government lawyers .
The government lawyers wanted Walker to halt the proceedings while they press the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse his decision last year not to toss out the first of the cases in the interest of national security .
In what is the first of 48 domestic spying lawsuits consolidated before Walker , the Electronic Freedom Foundation sued AT and T on behalf of telecom customers .
The EFF suit charged that AT and T let the National Security Administration ( NSA ) snoop on e-mails and telephone calls without warrants required to do such spying legally .
The White House has confirmed that it authorized the NSA program to track overseas communications as part of " war on terror " attempts to uncover threats against the country .
The case is being closely followed as a model after similar lawsuits on the same issue , involving Verizon , Sprint , Bell South , and AT and T , were ordered consolidated before Walker .
" The government wanted this case to be placed in the deep freeze and this decision is allowing it to move forward . "
EFF attorney Kurt Opsahl told AFP .
" We are very pleased .
Now , we have to come up with our targeted set of questions . "
Walker imposed a " limited stay " intended to block the gathering of evidence that would interfere the appeal but leave him free to authorize other aspects of the " discovery " portion of the trial .
" If plaintiffs propound a limited and targeted set of interrogatories the court will entertain plaintiffs ' motion to lift the stay for the purpose of requiring a response , " Walker wrote .
Information would be handled delicately in light of arguments by US attorneys that the lawsuits threatened national security by risking exposure of anti-terrorism spying tactics .
In July Walker rejected arguments by government lawyers that the suit be tossed out on the basis that it is groundless and that its hearing could threaten national security by revealing how authorities gather intelligence .
IONA chief engineer Steve Vinoski , author of one of the most influential CORBA books and a huge number of articles , has written a new column ( PDF ) for IEEE Internet Computing introducing REST from the perspective of a SOA developer .
In the article , Steve highlights the differences between a design that focuses on explicit contracts for each specific functionality and the uniform interface approach of REST .
According to his own blog entry about it , it attempts to explain the benefits that REST brings to the distributed systems picture from the perspective of someone with a lengthy SOA background .
Steve 's conclusion :
Unfortunately , many SOA developers are far too quick to dismiss REST tools , because their favorite programming language does n’t directly support it , or because they believe REST is just HTTP .
Even if you believe SOA is exactly the right approach for the applications you develop , truly under - standing REST can help you build more scalable and better performing distributed systems .

" The sulfur Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez smells these days is n't the residue of George Bush at the United Nations , but profits from the sale of fuel to 7 - Eleven stores going poof "
" Faced with a barrage of calls from customers and bloggers calling for a boycott of Citgo gasoline stations , 7 - Eleven Inc. said yesterday that the Citgo signs are going to start coming down from its convenience stores "
" Foreign agression "
" (...) called for the removal of the Citgo sign visible over the left field wall of Fenway Park "
The neon sign , which went up in 1965 , has been called Boston 's equivalent of Big Ben .
Popular outcry in 1983 stopped a company plan to dismantle the sign .
But McDermott said that the Chavez speech changed his view .
When he was a kid on the way to Fenway , McDermott said , " you 'd be sitting in the bus and you would see the sign and you knew you were close . "
But , he said , the sign " does n't have the reverence that it once did . "
McDermott added : " It 's a corporation that is funding activities against this country , and we should take heed .
I do n't see why this symbol of foreign aggression should be emblazoned against the sky of Boston . "

On september 27 , 2006 , every ' respectable ' news outlet was running the 7 - Eleven / Citgo story : outraged by Hugo Chavez 's speech at the UN ( you know , when he could still smell sulfur ) , the 7 - Eleven executives reacted with a fiercely patriotic decision : they immediately announced they were dropping Venezuela - owned Citgo as the supplier of gasoline for 2,100 of their stores .
They were switching to star - spangled companies instead : nobody can smear Our Beloved Leader Bush and get away with it .
Irony , and some sense of victory , were palpable all over the ' respectable ' media .
Said Forbes .
There you are Mr Chavez , reaping what you sowed !
For the Washington Post , the 7 - Eleven decision came as direct consideration for concerned customers ' complaints :.
Some major company complying - in a blink - with demands from citizens , ' and bloggers ' , is n't that appreciable ?
And new ?
Of course , there 's another Angle to the story , which most of the media seem to have missed : in last july , Citgo announced it would n't renew no -longer - profitable supply contracts with hundreds of US gas stations ( many of them part of the 7 - 11 network ) .
Said contract was ending on ...
September 30th , 2006 .
Put simply , 7 - 11 dropped on september 27 its Citgo contract , which Citgo had already dropped on july 12 .
" I fire you " ...
" No , I quit ! " .
Could be one of these sitcoms ?
One featuring Associated Press ' journalists ' running the same story two months apart , only reversing the role of main characters ?
That same Washington Post article mentions interesting words from Boston City Council Jerry McDermott , whoToo bad the WP ' journalist ' did n't see fit to ask for details on that ' foreign aggression ' , as we 're now left wondering what sinister plot he was referring to .
Was it the now famous ' sulfur ' comment ( which , incidentally , a growing number of US citizens are endorsing ) or was it something else ?
Maybe it was that bold move from Citgo ( backed by state - owned ) , which decided before the '05 winter to provide 12 million gallons of heating oil to poor citizens at a 40 % discounted price ( representing a $ 10 million gift ) in Mr McDermott 's Boston area ?
Was it the overall low cost heating oil ' program , representing a rebate on a total of 45 million gallons of oil ?
Was it thisoil ( 300,000 + gallons of it ) provided to homeless shelters in Vermont , Connecticut and Delaware ?
Was it the '06 version of the Venezuelan aid program , another plan to discount 100 million gallons of heating oil for the US poor , hospitals and shelters ..?
Or , was it because of that provocative offer for help , complete with mobile hospital units , after Katrina devastated New Orleans ?
All this shows there 's plenty the USA can hold against Chavez .
It 's a surprise nobody from Capitol Hill called any of this an ' act of war ' yet .
The obvious way to cope with this ( rogue ) country that joined the ' axis of evil ' in early 2005 , is to launch one of these shock and awe operations so transnational companies can resume with plundering the Venezuelan resources in a healthy rush toward profit at any human cost , instead of just letting a Venezuelan firm help low income US families to go through winter with a decent temperature at home .
MOUNTAIN VIEW , California ( Reuters ) - A little under one - third of U.S. households have no Internet access and do not plan to get it , with most of the holdouts seeing little use for it in their lives , according to a survey released on Friday .
Park Associates , a Dallas - based technology market research firm , said 29 percent of U.S. households , or 31 million homes , do not have Internet access and do not intend to subscribe to an Internet service over the next 12 months .
The second annual National Technology Scan conducted by Park found the main reason potential customers say they do not subscribe to the Internet is because of the low value to their daily lives they perceive rather than concerns over cost .
Forty - four percent of these households say they are not interested in anything on the Internet , versus just 22 percent who say they cannot afford a computer or the cost of Internet service , the survey showed .
The answer “ I ’m not sure how to use the Internet ” came from 17 percent of participants who do not subscribe .
The response “ I do all my e-commerce shopping and YouTube - watching at work ” was cited by 14 percent of Internet - access refuseniks .
Three percent said the Internet does n’t reach their homes .
The study found U.S. broadband adoption grew to 52 percent over 2006 , up from 42 percent in 2005 .
Roughly half of new subscribers converted from slower - speed , dial - up Internet access while the other half of households had no prior access .
“ The industry continues to chip away at the core of nonsubscribers , but has a ways to go , ” said John Barrett , director of research at Parks Associates .
“ Entertainment applications will be the key .
If anything will pull in the holdouts , it ’s going to be applications that make the Internet more akin to pay TV , ” he predicted .
Anzea and Dino Zoli recently made a cooperation to develop a collection made up of exclusive items from both businesses to give the top contract textiles in the hospitality and business markets .
Dino Zoli is actually a company from Italy , while Anzea is from a company based in Texas .
This partnership is certainly a match made in heaven since it features the top of both worlds .
This this is the perfect alliance as both of the companies are focusing on textiles and they also share exactly the same values , which will make it easier for them to collaborate .
They will present the first installation of DZ x Anzea and it ’ll certainly have a huge impact on the market .
The cooperation is a large move for both firms as they ’re intending to include their inventories and make up a unique assortment .
Anzea and Dino Zoli are both known for the exquisite contract textiles in Texas and Italy , consecutively .
The partnership itself will offer more value and exclusivity to the business and hospitality markets because the products of the two can be available in a more convenient platform .
The mixture of the inventory will guarantee that the selection can be available for the projects of the consumers .
The DZ x ANZEA selection will include two options which are made from nubby argyle plaid .
The 8 fabrics which are feature in this selection would bring more texture and color to any space .
Anzea is the top selection with regards to woven textiles and fabrics , upholstery textiles , vinyl fabrics and many more .
The company was actually established in 1990 by Bruce Doeren and Mitzi Mills in Fort Worth , Texas .
The name of the business came from an acronym and it symbolizes the first selection that Anzea created : Australia , New Zealand , Europe and America .
Mills is actually a graphic artist with a interest in travel and photography while Doeren is actually an accounting expert that always ensures that the operations run smoothly .
The accomplishment of Anzea can certainly be credited to the diligence of these 2 folks .
Anzea has always focused in supplying the best and the most striking designs and high performance woven fabrics for the market .
The company offers a mix of coated and woven fabrics for arduous applications .
By checking out their assortment , you are going to certainly realize that the design , durability and safe chemistry is actually in a single item .
They also have a dynamic team that could actually adapt to any kind of situation .
The goal of the collaboration with Dino Zoli is to actually provide a better assortment for all their clientele .
This may also lead to more projects in the foreseeable future that might benefit both the business and the buyers .
If you want to look at some of the best designs of Dino Zoli and Anzea , you may go to their website to see what they could provide .
This cooperation will absolutely last for a long time so you may anticipate more collections in the near future .

Russian Army Longest Truck MZKT - 79221
( " Special Wheeled Chassis " )
Russian Strategic Military has a very mobile part , thanks to the massive truck chassis , developed by the Minsk Tractor Trailer Factory in 1997 ( delivered to the Army in 2000 )

Faced with a photo of a fly - encrusted child , the natural reaction should be to reach out and help .
Instead , I start hearing Bono and Coldplay in my head .
It 's the most mind - mangling act of branding in history .
I agree with what they are saying - I just wish THEY were n't saying it .
How can I open my wallet while my fists are curled with rage ?
Take Bono 's special edition of the Independent .
It 's incredibly annoying .
You 're trapped in a windowless room with the usual tedious sods who apparently represent British culture , except suddenly they 're wearing halos and pulling earnest expressions at you .
The front cover is by Damien Hirst .
He 's lobbed some clipart together in the shape of a cross .
Across this runs a stark headline : " NO NEWS TODAY " .
You jerk with astonishment .
No news ?
How can this be ?
Help us Bono !
We do n't understand !
Then you spot the footnote : " Just 6,500 Africans died today as a result of a preventable , treatable disease . "
You nod sadly .
But before you can truly contemplate this harrowing injustice , you note that Damien Hirst 's name appears on the cover not once , but twice - and suddenly the footnote takes on an even more tragic dimension .
Because all those people died , yet Hirst still walks the Earth .
You turn the page , weeping .
Inside lurk about 2,000 adverts for the new Motorola RED phone .
If you buy one , an Aids charity receives an initial payment of £ 10 , followed by 5 % of all further call revenues .
This is clearly a good idea .
But somehow , it 's also annoying .
For starters , the phone costs £ 149 , of which £ 139 goes toward helping Motorola .
Second , it 's bright red and seems doomed to appeal to arseholes who want to add conspicuous compassion to their list of needless fashion accessories .
I 'm not just jabbering mindlessly on the phone in your train carriage - I 'm saving fuckin ' lives , OK ?
Page 11 : a piece of artwork by renegade graffiti artist Banksy , who has defaced a wall in Chalk Farm with a picture of a hotel maid .
It 's called Sweeping It Under the Carpet and " can be seen as a metaphor for the west 's reluctance to tackle issues such as Aids in Africa " - or another example of Banksy 's tireless self - promotion ; take your pick .
Banksy says the maid in question " cleaned my room in a Los Angeles motel ... she was quite a feisty lady " .
Presumably his next portrait will depict some poor minimum - wage sod , cleaning graffiti off a wall in Chalk Farm .
Provided they 're " feisty " enough to appeal to him .
On it goes , with one Bonoriffic chum after another : noted philanthropist Condoleezza Rice picks her top 10 tunes ( including one by U2 ) ; Stella McCartney interviews Giorgio Armani , who has designed a pair of sunglasses for the RED charity range .
These cost around £ 72 and will make you look like Bono : buy a 10 quid pair from Boots , bung the remaining £ 62 to an Aids charity and not only will you enjoy a warm philanthropic glow , no one 's going to shout " wanker ! " at you when you walk down the high street .
In summary : it 's a worthy cause , rendered annoying - and that 's annoying in itself .
Bono genuinely cares , cares enough to risk ridicule , which is more than most people would do , myself included .
It 's just that , well it 's bloody Bono , is n't it ?
HALF MOON BAY / Man serves 5 months for killing ostrich that pummeled him /
He shot it after women watched bird beat him up
A Half Moon
Bay man who shot an ostrich to death after the flightless bird pummeled him and his friend when they trespassed on a coastal ranch was ordered released Thursday after serving five months in jail for animal abuse .
Jonathon Porter , 20 -- who prosecutors say killed for revenge after the bird humiliated him in front of women he was trying to impress -- was sentenced Thursday by Judge John Grandsaert , in effect , to time served .
He was also placed on probation and ordered to attend animal - cruelty counseling .
Porter pleaded no contest in February to felony animal abuse for killing the ostrich , named Gaylord , and for being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm .
He was on probation for grand theft .
Porter and his friend Timothy McKevitt , 19 , also of Half Moon Bay , got in trouble after they took some women to an ostrich ranch near Half Moon Bay after a party last Halloween , authorities said .
" Apparently the young ladies expressed an interest in seeing the ostriches , " Porter 's attorney , James McNair Thompson , said after Thursday 's hearing in San Mateo County Superior Court in Redwood City .
" That all sounded like a good idea until the ostrich physically attacked ( McKevitt and Porter ) , and apparently he got the better of them . "
With their long necks , adult male ostriches can grown up to 9 feet tall and weigh between 220 to 287 pounds , according to the San Diego Zoo .
The birds typically have a 4 - inch claw on each foot , and can produce a kick powerful enough to kill a lion , according to information on the zoo 's Web site .
Gaylord kicked McKevitt in the ribs and knocked him to the ground , according to a police report .
Porter suffered scrapes and bruises when the ostrich kicked him .
" And at that point , the crucial thing happened , " Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said .
" Apparently the girls started laughing . "
Porter and McKevitt drove away with the women , then allegedly armed themselves with a rifle and shotgun .
" We knew what had to be done , " Porter told investigators , according to the police report .
The two returned to the ostrich farm and opened fire on Gaylord , firing at least seven shots , according to the report .
" This whole thing is about male pride , " Wagstaffe said .
" The ostrich knocked them both on their butts . "
Thompson said he would " hesitate to ascribe any sort of rational motive " to the killing .
" It was a cross between being really startled by the ostrich and the alcohol , " Thompson said .
" It led to a really bad decision . "
McKevitt has pleaded not guilty to felony animal abuse and other charges .
He is scheduled to go to trial in July .
Porter " accepts the fact that he did a lot of time because he was on probation and he did a really stupid thing , " Thompson said .
" He accepts responsibility and regrets it . "

How much worse can it get for poor , old Ted ?
As if the embarrassment of getting outed for doing meth with a male hooker was n't bad enough , now the church he built from the ground up is paying him to leave Colorado Springs altogether .
Gotta love those Christian values .
Via Huffington Post :
The Rev. Ted Haggard moved Wednesday from his longtime home in Colorado Springs to Phoenix , where the disgraced minister will join the same church that helped fallen televangelist Jim Baker .
Haggard , 50 , resigned as president of the National Association of Evangelicals last year , after a former male prostitute alleged a three - year cash - for - sex relationship .
The man also said he saw Haggard use methamphetamine .
Haggard confessed to undisclosed " sexual immorality " and said he bought meth but never used it .
As part of his severance package from New Life Church , a 14,000 - member congregation he started in his basement , Haggard agreed to leave Colorado Springs , a city he helped make an evangelical center .
" When he moved out of town today , there was a kind of relief on the part of the church that life can get back to normal , " said the Rev. H.B. London , one of three ministers overseeing what has been called Haggard 's " restoration . "
" For the Haggards , it is the beginning of a huge new chapter .
It 's a brand new start for them , the beginning of a new beginning . "

[ Note : I 've updated my About page , which is where I 've got the most concise definition of The Long Tail .
This post is just a cleaned - up and easily linkable version of that . ]
The theory of the Long Tail is that our culture and economy is increasingly shifting away from a focus on a relatively small number of " hits " ( mainstream products and markets ) at the head of the demand curve and toward a huge number of niches in the tail .
As the costs of production and distribution fall , especially online , there is now less need to lump products and consumers into one - size - fits - all containers .
In an era without the constraints of physical shelf space and other bottlenecks of distribution , narrowly - target goods and services can be as economically attractive as mainstream fare .
One example of this is the theory 's prediction that demand for products not available in traditional bricks and mortar stores is potentially as big as for those that are .
But the same is true for video not available on broadcast TV on any given day , and songs not played on radio .
In other words , the potential aggregate size of the many small markets in goods that do n't individually sell well enough for traditional retail and broadcast distribution may rival that of the existing large market in goods that do cross that economic bar .
The term refers specifically to the yellow part of the sales chart above , which shows a standard demand curve that could apply to any industry , from entertainment to hard goods .
The red part of the curve is the hits , which have dominated our markets and culture for most of the last century .
The yellow part is the non-hits , or niches , which is where the new growth is coming from now and in the future .
Traditional retail economics dictate that stores only stock the likely hits , because shelf space is expensive .
But online retailers ( from Amazon to iTunes ) can stock virtually everything , and the number of available niche products outnumber the hits by several orders of magnitude .
Those millions of niches are the Long Tail , which had been largely neglected until recently in favor of the Short Head of hits .
When consumers are offered infinite choice , the true shape of demand is revealed .
And it turns out to be less hit -centric than we thought .
People gravitate towards niches because they satisfy narrow interests better , and in one aspect of our life or another we all have some narrow interest ( whether we think of it that way or not ) .
Our research project has attempted to quantify the Long Tail in three ways , comparing data from online and offline retailers in music , movies , and books .
What 's the size of the Long Tail ( defined as inventory typically not available offline ?
How does the availability of so many niche products change the shape of demand ?
Does it shift it away from hits ?
What tools and techniques drive that shift , and which are most effective ?
The Long Tail article ( and the forthcoming book ) is about the big - picture consequence of this : how our economy and culture is shifting from mass markets to million of niches .
It chronicles the effect of the technologies that have made it easier for consumers to find and buy niche products , thanks to the " infinite shelf - space effect " -- the new distribution mechanisms , from digital downloading to peer - to - peer markets , that break through the bottlenecks of broadcast and traditional bricks and mortar retail .
The Wikipedia entry on the Long Tail does an excellent job of expanding on this .
OcempGUI - a GUI engine for Pygame and more
About OcempGUI
OcempGUI is an abbreviation for Ocean Empire GUI and denotes a toolkit , which contains a set of various user interface elements based on and for Pygame .
OcempGUI is a small toolkit , which comes with various modules suitable for event management , user interfaces , 2D drawing and accessibility .
It is nearly completely written in Python and its drawing routines and user interface elements are created with and especially created for the Pygame library .
OcempGUI enables you to enhance your Python and / or Pygame applications and games easily with graphical user interface elements such as buttons , entry boxes , scrolling abilities and more , simple event brokers or features , which enhance the program by adding accessibility to its objects .
It can save you much time by providing a broad range of drawing routines and ready - to - use event capable object types .
You can focus on the main tasks instead of taking care about needed low - level components , which are given to you with OcempGUI .
Key features
Fast event management module
OcempGUI contains an event management module , that can be used in any Python application .
Objects can be bound to specific events to perform certain tasks upon their occurance and event data to be sent has no limitations in its content , size or whatsoever as event handlers have no limitations in their signature .
Objects only need to implement a single centralized method to take the full advantage of the event management capabilities .
This guarantees a low integration time and concise code changes in already existing code .
Accessibility support
An accessibility module named papi allows the easy integration of assistive technologies and acessibility support into your own application .
It is not limited to graphical user interfaces , but instead any Python object can implement various interfaces to support accessibility ranging from simple keyboard access to extensive information about any object state .
This allows people with disabilities to gain more fun and success while working with your application or playing your game .
The accessibility module settles on the AT - SPI standard , which was initially developed by the GNOME accessibility workgroup and has been adopted by the FSG accessibility workgroup to become a common and free industry standard .
This enables the OcempGUI accessibility module to be supported on a broad range of platforms and to be well integrated with assistive technologies .
Various additional interface definitions and class implementations allow you to integrate certain accessibility features such as keyboard navigation support , Pygame based screen magnifiers and various other assistive features easily into your Python project .
Robust GUI toolkit for Pygame
In its latest version , OcempGUI contains more that 20 visible user interface elements and many more core classes , which ease the daily programming job whenever you have to deal with user interfaces .
Complex graphical user interfaces based on Pygame can be created in no time .
All those so called widgets make use of the other OcempGUI modules , so that you can rely on robust and full featured graphical user interface elements , which collude well with existing code , that makes use of other OcempGUI features , be it accessibility , event capability or anything else of it .
Each widget is sprite - based , which allows you to integrate them easily in your own optimized Pygame drawing loops , if you do not want to use the provided rendering engine or just want to add a few user interface elements to your existing Pygame project .
All user interface elements support themeing and interchangeable drawing engines to fit them to your wanted look and feel .
Widgets can be themed individually with no effort , too , be it either as eye - catcher or to point out certain interaction possiblities .
High abstraction layers allow to create new user widgets or to change the behaviour of existing widgets with minimal effort .
You are not limited to the code base offered to you by OcempGUI , but instead can create your own ones for your special needs .
A generalized widget core allows you override nearly anything of each widget without loosing the widget specific method or attribute implementations .
High documentation standards
We try to keep a high documentation standard for all parts of OcempGUI .
It ships with a lot of documentation , inline comments , UML diagrams and design notes , so that you will not feel lost with any part .
Many examples , ranging from short code to more complex applications , and a short user manual will help you to gain ground within your first hours or days with OcempGUI .
Open Source
All parts of OcempGUI are open source , licensed under 2 - clause BSD license similar to the license used by the various open source BSD operating systems such as FreeBSD .
This makes it suitable for nearly any type of project , be it open source , closed source , commercial or whatever else .

Microsoft 's battle with pirates , which started as early as 1975 with Bill Gates ' infamous " Open Letter to Hobbyists , " continues on in 2007 , as the company has built a feature into Office 2007 : Reduced Functionality Mode .
While Microsoft has been fairly coy about whether or not this feature exists in the latest Office release , a new Knowledge Base article on their site confirms that it will apply to all Office 2007 products .
Reduced Functionality mode is triggered whenever Office 2k7 fails activation .
This can happen when the program is initially run after installation , or if it fails a subsequent check following an Office update .
Once the switch is thrown , Office continues to run , but with the following restrictions :
You can not create new documents .
You can view existing documents .
However , you can not edit them .
You can print documents .
However , you can not save them .
Despite what some media outlets are reporting , the Reduced Functionality Mode is not new .
It already applies to Office 2003 and even Office XP versions .
While the approach undoubtedly has at least some impact on piracy , the process is not 100 percent foolproof : some legitimate users have reported problems with the activation process .
Microsoft is not just limiting Reduced Functionality Mode to its
Office programs , however .
The company is also planning to introduce reduced functionality limitations to Windows Vista , which also must be activated after installing .
Copies of Vista that fail the activation process will have the Aero visual effects disabled and any " Premium " or " Ultimate " features deactivated .
Most industry analysts consider the total elimination of software piracy to be impossible : dedicated crackers will view any new scheme as an intellectual challenge to be overcome by any means necessary .
However , by adding all sorts of " kill switches " to the operating system and applications , Microsoft can make keeping up with their antipirating measures just annoying enough that many users will choose to purchase a legitimate version instead .

The inane ‘ Clinton did it too ’ defense
As the prosecutor purge scandal continues to become more serious and more damaging for the Bush gang , the right has struggled to come up with a coherent defense .
They seem to have embraced one , but it ’s surprisingly weak .
Karl
Rove got the ball rolling last week .
“ Look , by law and by Constitution [ sic ] , these attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president and traditionally are given a four year term .
And Clinton , when he came in , replaced all 93 U.S. attorneys .
When we came in , we ultimately replace most all 93 U.S. attorneys — there are some still left from the Clinton era in place .
We have appointed a total of I think128 U.S. attorneys — that is to say the original 93 , plus replaced some , some have served 4 years , some served less , most have served more .
Clinton did 123 .
I mean , this is normal and ordinary . ”
A few days later , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) repeated it .
Graham played down the administration ’s purge of U.S. Attorneys , calling it perfectly within President Bush ’s authority and merely “ poorly handled ” and “ unseemly . ”
He also repeated Karl Rove ’s lie that President Clinton also purged attorneys .
“ Clinton let them all go when he took over , ” Graham said .
A day later , the Wall Street Journal editorial page was using it .
[ T] hese are the same Democrats who did n’t raise a whimper when Bill Clinton ’s Attorney General Janet Reno sacked all 93 U.S. attorneys in one unclean sweep upon taking office .
Previous Presidents had kept the attorneys in place until they could replace each one .
That was a more serious abuse than anything known about these Bush dismissals .
Today , a number of far - right blogs have picked up on the same talking point , and even the traditional media is picking up on it , with NBC ’s Kevin Corke repeating the meme this morning .
I had hoped this nonsense , debunked last week , would have disappeared by now , but it seems to be the only talking point White House allies can come up with .
The argument is premised on a mistaken understanding of how the process works .
When a president takes office , he or she nominates federal prosecutors at the beginning of the first term .
Under normal circumstances , these U.S. Attorneys serve until the next president is sworn in .
In 1993 , Clinton replaced H.W. Bush ’s prosecutors .
In 2001 , Bush replaced Clinton ’s prosecutors .
None of this is remotely unusual .
Indeed , it ’s how the process is designed .
The difference with the current scandal is overwhelming .
Bush replaced eight specific prosecutors , apparently for purely political reasons .
This is entirely unprecedented .
For conservatives to argue , as many are now , that Clinton ’s routine replacements for H.W. Bush ’s USAs is any way similar is the height of intellectual dishonesty .
They know better , but hope their audience is too uninformed to know the difference .
Clinton ’s former chief of staff John Podesta told ThinkProgress last week that the entire argument is “ pure fiction . ”
Mr. Rove ’s claims today that the Bush administration ’s purge of qualified and capable U.S. attorneys is “ normal and ordinary ” is pure fiction .
Replacing most U.S. attorneys when a new administration comes in — as we did in 1993 and the Bush administration did in 2001 — is not unusual .
But the Clinton administration never fired federal prosecutors as pure political retribution .
These U.S. attorneys received positive performance reviews from the Justice Department and were then given no reason for their firings .
We ’re used to this White House distorting the facts to blame the Clinton administration for its failures .
Apparently , it ’s also willing to distort the facts and invoke the Clinton administration to try to justify its bad behavior .
Josh Marshall added this morning :
First , we now know — or at least the White House is trying to tell us — that they considered firing all the US Attorneys at the beginning of Bush ’s second term .
That would have been unprecedented but not an abuse of power in itself .
The issue here is why these US Attorneys were fired and the fact that the White House intended to replace them with US Attorneys not confirmed by the senate .
We now have abundant evidence that they were fired for not sufficiently politicizing their offices , for not indicting enough Democrats on bogus charges or for too aggressively going after Republicans .
( Remember , Carol Lam is still the big story here . )
We also now know that the top leadership of the Justice Department lied both to the public and to Congress about why the firing took place .
As an added bonus we know the whole plan was hatched at the White House with the direct involvement of the president .
And Clinton ?
Every new president appoints new US Attorneys .
That always happens .
Always … .
The whole thing is silly .
But a lot of reporters on the news are already falling for it .
The issue here is why these US Attorneys were fired — a ) because they were n’t pursuing a GOP agenda of indicting Democrats , that ’s a miscarriage of justice , and b ) because they lied to Congress about why it happened .
Note to Bush allies : if the “ Clinton did it ” defense is the best you can do , this scandal must be truly horrifying .
Update :
In case there was still any lingering doubt among conservatives on this point , in White House documents released today , there ’s an email to Harriet Miers from Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ’s chief of staff Kyle Sampson ( who resigned yesterday ) , in which Sampsons admits that the Clinton administration never purged its U.S. attorneys in the middle of their terms , explicitly stating , “ In recent memory , during the Reagan and Clinton Administrations , Presidents Reagan and Clinton did not seek to remove and replace U.S. Attorneys to serve indefinitely under the holdover provision . ”
Second Update :
No matter how often the “ Clinton did it ” defense is debunked , the right just ca n’t seem to help itself .
Third Update :
Now the right has altered the argument , shifting the emphasis to just one prosecutor Clinton fired .
Conservatives got this one wrong , too .
There 's an amusing dialogue floating around about how simple SOAP is .
As someone who bears some past responsibility for well used SOAP services ( Google 's APIs for search and AdWords ) let me say now I 'd never choose to use SOAP and WSDL again .
I was wrong .
The promise of SOAP and WSDL was removing all the plumbing .
When you look at SOAP client examples , they 're two lines of code .
" Generate proxy . RPC to proxy . "
And for toys , that actually works .
But for serious things it does n't .
I do n't have the space to explain all the problems right now ( if you 've seen my talks at O'Reilly conferences , you know ) , but they boil down to massive interoperability problems .
Good lord , you can't even pass a number between languages reliably , much less arrays , or dates , or structures that can be null , or ...
It just does n't work .
Maybe with enough effort SOAP interop could eventually be made to work .
It 's not such a problem if you 're writing both the client and the server .
But if you 're publishing a server for others to use ?
Forget it .
The deeper problem with SOAP is strong typing .
WSDL accomplishes its magic via XML Schema and strongly typed messages .
But strong typing is a bad choice for loosely coupled distributed systems .
The moment you need to change anything , the type signature changes and all the clients that were built to your earlier protocol spec break .
And I do n't just mean major semantic changes break things , but cosmetic things like accepting a 64 bit int where you use used to only accept 32 bit ints , or making a parameter optional .
SOAP , in practice , is incredibly brittle .
If you 're building a web service for the world to use , you need to make it flexible and loose and a bit sloppy .
Strong typing is the wrong choice .
The REST / HTTP +POX services typically assume that the clients will be flexible and can make sense of messages , even if they change a bit .
And in practice this seems to work pretty well .
My favourite API to use is the Flickr API , and my favourite client for it is 48 lines of code .
It supports 100 + Flickr API methods .
How ?
Fast and loose .
And it works great .
To be fair , SOAP can be forced to work .
Using SOAP did n't really hurt adoption of the APIs I worked on .
But it sure did n't help either .
So what 's the alternative ?
I 'm not sure .
Right now I 'd probably go the HTTP +POX route while trying to name my resources well enough that the REST guys will invite me to their parties .
But XML itself is such a disaster and AJAX is starting to show the cracks in HTTP ( like , say , the lack of asynchrony ) .
Truly , none of this protocol fiddling matters .
Just do something that works .
Stocks in the United States plummeted today after a surprising plunge in the Shanghai market provoked worries worldwide about the global economy and the valuation of share prices .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 416.02 points , or 3.3 percent , to 12,216.24 , as all 30 stocks in Dow declined .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index dropped 50.33 points , or 3.5 percent , to 1,399.04 .
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 96.66 points , or 3.9 percent , to 2,407.86 .
This was the steepest one - day sell - off since September 2002 .
Asian and European markets closed sharply lower
The trigger was a nearly 9 percent slide in Chinese stocks , which had just reached a record high on Monday .
The sudden reversal unnerved markets throughout Asia and into trading in Europe .
In the United States , markets had already been slumping in recent days on concerns about deterioration in the mortgage market for people with poor credit , as well as worries about the economy .

A couple of months ago , I had a chance to interview Jon von Tetzchner , chief executive officer and co-founder of Oslo - based Opera Software , for Business 2.0 Titans of Tech series .
What attracted me the most about his company was that it had customers paying for something – aka browser – which others like Microsoft and Mozilla were giving away for free .
In the interview he explained , “ About 100,000 choose to pay for Opera each year , paying about $ 39 per copy .
So that ’s one revenue stream . ”
That works out to about $ 3.9 million – not a lot , but still a lot for a company with just over $ 28 million in sales .
So this week , when the company announced that it will start giving away its browser for free , I was amazed that they were willing to give away that revenues .
There had to be a catch .
Well , little digging around , and hounding the Opera PR team , I found out that the decision to give away the browser came after the company struck “ compensation deals ” with some of the search engines .
Apparently , the premier tenant for browser ’s built - in search window , is Google .
“ The current most important deal now is with Google , ” company spokesperson Eskil Siversten wrote in an email .
The company indicated that it has similar referral - for - dollars agreements with the likes of eBay and Amazon .
Given that Opera is about one percent of the total browser market , it can not be making as much money as Mozilla folks .
Mozilla Foundation , the folks behind Firefox , brings in about $ 30 million a year , according to Tribe - founder Mark Pincus .
Even deals with Amazon.com bring in big money for Mozilla .
( I wonder how much Apple gets paid by Google for Safari tenancy ? )
This clearly is turning out to be quite a niche for browser makers .

Condoleezza Rice announcing change of policy at Senate hearing
The decision by the United States to attend a conference in Baghdad with Iran and Syria adds what many observers have felt was a " missing link " in US policy in the region .
The US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that as well as the official level Baghdad meeting , foreign ministers from the same countries would also meet " as early as the first half of April " .
She did not say where this meeting would be held but the talk is of Istanbul .
Nor did she say whether she would be meeting the Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki one - on - one .
The result , though , is that , having initially and forcefully rejected the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group that the US should engage with Syria and Iran , the Bush administration is now doing just that .
These will be the highest - level contacts between the US and Iran for two years .
And they might be a little more fruitful than the one in 2004 between the then US Secretary of State Colin Powell and his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi .
They were put side by side at a dinner in Egypt and confined their talk to innocuous chitchat .
Questions
Two questions arise immediately : why is the US doing this and what impact will it have on the issue of Iran 's nuclear activities ?
Part of the answer to the first came from Dr Rice in her Senate statement .
Basically she said that the administration had changed its mind .
She acknowledged both the Iraq Study Group by name and pressure from the Congress .
" I 've had very fruitful discussions , " she said .
The result is that , having initially and forcefully rejected the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group that the US should engage with Syria and Iran , the Bush administration is now doing just that .
Q&A : Iran nuclear activities What Iran and Syria want
But another reason was outlined by White House officials who explained the recent American strategy of building up its pressure points on Iran .
These , in Washington 's view , were needed because at the end of last year , the US was in a very weak position .
Since then , it has got its diplomatic ducks in a row and now feels that it can afford to make this gesture from a stronger position , not as a supplicant .
Washington will be demanding that Iran be more helpful to the Iraqi government .
The US pressure on Iran has grown in several ways : it has planned and begun to implement the surge of troops in Baghdad ; it has ratcheted up the campaign by producing evidence against Iran linking it to explosive devices used against US forces ; it has moved a second aircraft carrier into the Gulf .
It is taking advantage of a ruling by the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran has defied a deadline from the Security Council to suspend uranium enrichment and has began discussions to tighten sanctions on Iran .
It has also developed its aim of boosting the Iraqi government itself by urging it to put its own house in order .
For example , a new law on getting foreign oil companies to work in Iraq and on the sharing of revenue within Iraq has been agreed in framework .
So the US can present this change in policy over Iran as something that will bolster the Iraqi government further .
Iran on the other hand might regard the move as a sign of US weakness and another stage in the growth of its own influence in Iraq and the region .
There is another element at work as well - the influence of the secretary of state herself .
At the very moment when Vice - President Dick Cheney was making threatening noises against Iran on a world tour , this initiative is announced .
Nuclear
As for nuclear issue , that remains unresolved and could yet derail any attempt to forge some kind of US - Iran rapprochement over Iraq .
Whatever talks take place between the US and Iran , the planned meetings are not expected to deal with the nuclear problem .
The administration hopes that the drip - drip of pressure on Iran will eventually produce either a change of policy on uranium enrichment , though that is unlikely , or a change of government .
At the same time , the threat of military action remains " on the table " as Mr Cheney put it .
In the new twin track American diplomacy towards Iran , tension is being reduced on one track but remains on the other .

Yet another big deal with the search engine giant involved : yesterday Google agreed to pay very big money for a famous online ad company : DoubleClick .
This acquisition became the largest purchase for the company , as it paid $ 3.1 billion for the DoubleClick , which is almost twice as much as it paid for YouTube last year .
Google people consider the fact that DoubleClick did not become Microsoft to be very important too .
The $ 3.1 billion paid for the DoubleClick , based in New York , made Google one step ( and a huge one ) closer to becoming an online ad tycoon .
DoubleClick is an ad house , which makes special software for online advertisement .
The company has many large connections with web publishers and advertising agencies , which made this business an important acquisition for Google .
DoubleClick uses its software to gather useful information from the Internet users about their interaction with the ads to determine the optimal place to delivery the best effect of an advertisement .
Now experts predict a change in the online advertising strategies , as when the two giants combine there resources , we , simple web surfers , could get something more than a simple contextual ad , but an ad meant to satisfy the mot refined tastes of various users .
The negotiations about selling DoubleClick lasted a few weeks and at some time involved not only Google , but there were also Yahoo , AOL and ( oh no ! )
Microsoft involved .
It is clear that Microsoft wanted to get its hands on the online ad enterprise , as it would make Microsoft accelerate in the online ad businesses ' race .
And yet , Google has bid more money than Microsoft did , despite all the financial might of the software tycoon .
Jordan Rohan , analyst at the RBC Capital Markets , suggested that with Microsoft overboard , Google is now free to implement its new strategies in the online ad technologies .
Another important fact about the acquisition is that Google will become more competitive against Yahoo !
- Google 's all - time rival in Internet search and online advertising .
Yahoo is still first on the online ad market , yet Google 's made a serious claim against it with buying DoubleClick .
Google and DoubleClick are enterprises with the same goals , but different ways .
Google specializes in small contextual ads , which have now become something like a symbol of the flourishing Internet .
DoubleClick 's ads on the other hand , are more advanced and colorful .
Not so long ago DoubleClick has also started displaying some video ads .
Google also tried to conquer this niche of ad business , but did n't enjoy much success .
Dave Morgan , chairman of Tacoda , another online ad network , said that Google needed a strong partner to enter the display advertising , which the company wanted to initiate so badly .
DoubleClick is probably the best partner one could possibly think Google could team up with to enter this display advertising .
There is also an opinion that $ 3.1 billion is a way too high price even for DoubleClick , but what Google gets with this purchase is something more than just DoubleClick 's yearly profit .
And besides , according to Google 's last year revenue papers , they had about $ 11,25 billion in cash and other marketable securities .
So they can feel free to go shopping
What Google was also interested in when negotiating the purchase is the DoubleClick 's new exchange that makes
Web publishers and ad buyers come together on a site to bid at actions for ad space .
Some experts are a bit skeptical about this merger .
They ask how Google will manage these two businesses together , avoiding interest conflicts between the two divisions .
And indeed , if the current DoubleClick clients see that Google uses DoubleClick only to improve its own ad technique , they might break up the connection .
David Rosenblatt , the CE of DoubleClick , said that many of the companies clients are engaged in long - term contracts , which will provide Google with the necessary first clientèle .
Mr. Rosenblatt has also mentioned that his company will strive to maintain a neutral position towards its clients .
The CEO has also said that Google did n't buy the technology , but they have bought the DoubleClick 's relationships with its clients .
This way Google will do absolutely everything to keep those clients near and will do they best to make the clients become even nearer .
David Rosenblatt also admitted that not only Google will benefit from this acquisition , as DoubleClick will also have some good time working with Google .
Mr. Rosenblatt mentioned that Google 's immense ad network can give DoubleClick many opportunities to turn more visitors ' clicks on their sites into money .
During the late 90's DoubleClick enjoyed some success on the markets as it became the explorer of the online advertising .
In 2005 two equity firms , Hellman & Friedman and JMI Equity , partnered in a $ 1.1 billion deal to make DoubleClick a private business .
Then they sold an e-mail and two data ad businesses to subsequently acquire Klipmart - a company specializing in online video .
From that time DoubleClick has had about $ 300 million revenue and $ 50 million earning from online ads , which was before last year 's interest , depreciation and taxes .
The participants at negotiations said that at some regard it was a mere matter of money .
Yesterday Google outbid Microsoft , just as it did it about a year ago , when the two Goliaths were struggling to become an official dealer of ad places on Time Warner 's AOL .
Then , Google paid $ 1 billion for a 5 % stake in AOL .

Feb. 19 , 2007  -- Rachel and Shawn 's love story sounds like something out of a fairy tale .
They say it was love at first sight when they met almost eight years ago , and they have lived together as a happy couple ever since .
But there is one crucial difference that sets Rachel and Shawn apart .
They are part of a phenomenon known as genetic sexual attraction , or GSA .
Psychotherapist Joe Soll says that , " genetic attraction is an attraction between two people who 've been separated ... seeing someone they 've missed all their life , all the emotion of that loss , sometimes turns into a sexual relationship . "
You see , Rachel and Shawn are half brother and sister .
Rachel and Shawn -- who did n't want their real names or where they lived revealed -- were born only 28 days apart , from mothers who were pregnant by the same man .
Despite having the same father , the two never met until they sought each other out at the age of 27 .
Rachel believes growing up separately is key to understanding their love .
" Had we grown up together as siblings , as children , " Rachel says , " this would have not existed . "
Regardless , they know they are breaking a social taboo , and they say they understand why people might call it incestuous .
" We are related , " Rachel says .
" We 're not going to deny that . "
' It 's Like Kissing Myself '
Rachel and Shawn insist they are just like any other couple .
" I'm a normal guy , " Shawn says .
" I 'm in fantasy football , I fish , I do everything that they do .
I 'm a normal person . "
Rachel says they go to work , eat dinner , watch TV and go to sleep just like other couples .
And just like other couples , they have an intimate relationship as well .
But unlike everyone else , they believe their attraction is actually heightened by their genetic similarities .
" It 's like kissing myself , " Rachel says .
After four years together , Shawn decided to propose to Rachel .
However , they are not married , because no state in the country allows brothers and sisters to legally wed .
Rachel does not want to have children , but the couple says they would not be afraid to start a family if she did .
" I have two different sets of friends that are together , " Rachel says , referring to other brother - sister couples .
" Their children are perfectly normal . "
But is it safe for half brothers and sisters to procreate ?
No studies have been conducted on the offspring of siblings , but social anthropologist Martin Ottenheimer has done extensive research on first cousins .
" The myth is that cousin marriage , or close inbreeding , produces stupid , deformed people , " Ottenheimer says .
" But that 's not the case . "
A report from the Journal of Genetic Counseling indicates that cousin couples have only 2 percent more of a chance of having children with birth defects as compared to unrelated couples .
Going Back to the Bible ?
Ottenheimer also points out that sibling marriages were not always such an aberration .
" Brothers and sisters married in a number of different societies , " he says .
" This happened in Peru .
This happened in Egypt .
This happened in Hawaii . "
But while Ottenheimer believes it is time to change the incest taboo against cousins , he does n't think we need to go as far as accepting brother - sister couples .
" Does that mean that we have to allow brothers and sisters ? " he asks .
" No , it does n't mean that .
Nor do we have to allow parents and children to legally have sexual intercourse .
We do n't have to allow it . "
Rachel and Shawn are devoutly religious , and even point to the Bible as a precedent for their love .
" If you take Adam and Eve , " Shawn says , " where did we all come from if there was n't incest ? "
Shifting Emotions
Genetic sexual attraction is not a phenomenon that is exclusive to sibling couples .
According to Barbara Gonyo , a 70 - year - old grandmother in the Midwest , it can also occur between parents and their estranged adult children .
Gonyo was only 15 years old when she discovered she was pregnant in the early 1950s .
Her parents forced her to give up her baby for adoption , and she remembers how traumatic it was to watch the nurse at the hospital immediately take her baby son away from her .
" ' Say goodbye to your mommy now '… was all she said , " Gonyo says .
" It 's like somebody put a rock in my heart .
It was horrible . "
As the years passed , Gonyo never stopped wondering about the son she lost .
She sought him out , and almost 30 years ago , when he was 26 , they were reunited .
The first thing Barbara noticed was how much her son looked like his father , the first love of her life .
Gonyo's son made it clear to her that he did not want to call her " mom " out of respect for his adoptive mother .
As Barbara realized she could n't be his mother , her emotions began to shift .
" If I ca n't be his mother , who can I be ? " she asked herself .
" So I started to feel more romantically towards him that I did motherly . "
Gonyo was sickened by her feelings and feared she was crazy .
But she soon began to understand her feelings to be genetic sexual attraction .
She believed she had feelings of attraction because she had missed out on bonding with her son .
Joe Soll , who wrote a book called " Adoption Healing , " says GSA often happens in people separated by adoption .
" They want to be close and hug because they have n't had the relationship for 20 or 30 years , " he says .
" And that hug can turn into something else . "
' If We Act on It , It 's Called Incest '
Not everyone believes GSA is a legitimate phenomenon .
Adoption expert Adam Pertman says genetic sexual attraction is no more common a phenomenon than incest .
" It happens in adoption just like it happens in biologically formed families , " he says .
" It 's rare in adoption just like it 's rare in biologically formed families .
If we act on it , that 's called incest , and we do n't think that 's a great idea for lots of good reasons . "
Gonyo agrees that acting on those feelings would have been a horrible mistake .
Even though she had an intense attraction toward her son for 15 years , her son never reciprocated , and she never acted on desires .
" Emotionally , " she says , " you are the adult , and they are the child .
If you go through with the sexual act , then I hold the parent responsible , not the child . "
But half siblings Rachel and Shawn do n't feel the need for restraint .
They could n't be happier that they finally met and fell in love .
" I apologize to everybody out there that 's a nonsibling couple , but you will never have what we have ever , ever , ever , " says Rachel .
" It just simply can not exist outside of what we have . "

Researchers at University of Torontoplan to introducea software tool on Friday that aims tohelp people in countries that censor the World Wide Web .
Psiphon ( pronounced sigh - fawn ) , a web - based utility , lets individuals in a country that censors the internet sign on to a server that gives them secure access to web pages anywhere , bypassing government restrictions .
Its creators plan to launch the software at the Protect The Net conference at the university 's Munk Centre for International Studies , where psiphon emerged as a project of Citizenlab .
Researchers at the facility examine the relationship between digital media and politics around the world .
" We 're aiming at giving people access to sites like Wikipedia , " a free , user - maintained online encyclopedia , and other information and news sources , Michael Hull , psiphon 's lead engineer , told CBC News Online .
Citing countries such as China and Iran among some 40 countries that censor the internet , Hull said that the way in which access to information is cut off is troubling .
" My problem with it is that there 's no transparency .
Someone is making an arbitrary decision and there is no way to appeal it , even if you feel like you 're doing nothing wrong , " he said .
Psiphon works by letting people in uncensored countries download the free software to run a secure , encrypted server or node in the private network .
The server administrator would pass the connection information to friends and family in censored countries - psiphonites - who could then log in through a web browser and navigate sites without restrictions .
Lot of ' fear mongering '
The system was designed sousers do n't have to download or install any software , Hull said .
However , the administrator can see what sites usersare visiting , which can help prevent abuse of trust , Hull suggested .
" There 's a lot of fear mongering that goes on , but people have been living for thousands of years based on the fact that people trust each other , " he said .
" That 's all we 're asking people to do . "
Hull said about 60 people , many in internet - censored countries , have been testing the software and the feedback has been positive .
One of them will be participating in a live demonstration at psiphon 's launch at the Friday conference , and the researchers will also show recorded video of psiphonites in Iran using the system .

The homeless cats proved popular at Techfest
By using pictures that humans can easily distinguish , researchers hope to foil computerised efforts to get at valuable web services that perhaps offer e-mail accounts or sell tickets for popular shows .
The research plan to use pictures was showcased at Microsoft 's annual Techfest - a conference that gives the software giant 's researchers chance to publicise what they are working on .
Also on show at Techfest were Microsoft 's latest efforts to improve the way people search for information that may help the company in its battle with rivals Google and Yahoo .
Hundreds of researchers from labs in China , India , the US , and Cambridge in the UK gathered at the company 's headquarters in Redmond , Washington for the event .
Although usually restricted to Microsoft workers , this year Techfest was opened up to customers , government officials , and the media .
Cat calls
One of the most popular research projects at Techfest , called Asirra , involved two cats looking for new homes .
Often when users open a new webmail account , or buy tickets online or try to get access to any kind of secure content they are confronted with a test that tries to ensure only humans can login .
These can take the form of a series of letters and numbers shown in a distorted grid - known as a Captcha - Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart .
Humans can spot cats but computers may struggle
For instance , spammers often try to get at web - based e-mail systems to use the free accounts to send out junk mail .
Ironically the distorted characters can be recognised by computers quite easily and often fox humans .
In a bid to overcome this John Doucer came up with another way for people to prove they are human .
" What we want is a challenge that is easy for people , but difficult for software " said Mr Doucer , a researcher at Microsoft 's Redmond labs , " and such a challenge is telling a cat from a dog . "
The system developed by Mr Doucer and colleagues presents a user with a series of random images of cats and dogs , and asks them to tell which is which .
It uses an index of two million images to make it impossible for attackers to classify all the pictures and break the system .
The images used are also easy for humans to distinguish but should be much more difficult for computers because cats and dogs look so similar .
The two homeless cats , called Felix and Cleo , feature in the database of images many of which were taken from a US pet adoption website .
The research project has had one immediate success as at least one of the cats on hand to publicise Asirra has found a home .
Search success
As well as showing new ways to get at information , also unveiled at Techfest were novel ways to search data .
The eyetracker reveals how humans cope with search results .
" The idea here is to understand how people look around the search results page , and how changes to the page will , depending on what the task is , change what they do with the information " says Ed Cutrell , a researcher from Microsoft 's Redmond labs .
He has used a commercially available eye tracker , that sits below a computer monitor , and reflects infra-red off the users eyes , without them being aware of it .
Mr Cutrell believes changing the amount of information displayed with search results could change how useful they are .
For instance , he said , the snippets of text that sit beneath the title of a website in a page of search results are useful , but can also be a distraction , if a user is looking for a particular site .
" By using this eye tracking technology we were able to determine that you wind up getting sucked into this extra text , and you lose track of the really relevant information " said Mr Cutrell .
Microsoft researchers also had some ideas about improving the way that people search for pictures .
Traditional search engines can only hunt down text , so finding photos usually relies on embedded data , or tags of keywords .
But one idea shown at Techfest uses location recognition .
In this project a photo of a street or building sent to a website is compared to a database of street - side photos , and several likely looking results are returned , the user can then narrow down which one they snapped , to pinpoint their location .
" Suppose you are a traveller - you can take a photo of something you think is specific for a location , and submit it to a server " said Xing Xie from Microsoft Research Asia , based in Beijing
" You can see a map , and more information for that area , for example restaurants , and even the menu at the restaurants . "
The service could be run on a camera phone , with the results returned as a webpage formatted for the small screen .
On the other side are a separate faction of label executives and a variety of artists , many of whom privately say they are worried that the chill cast on the mixtape world would handicap labels ’ efforts to promote hip - hop sales , which declined roughly 20 percent last year , more than any other major genre , according to Nielsen SoundScan data .
Label executives remained puzzled over the sudden arrest of DJ Drama , whose ascent through the unregulated world of compilations has largely taken place in plain sight during the last couple of years .
There has been speculation that the police inquiry into his business affairs was further spurred by tips from a competitor or unhappy customer .
Chief Baker of the Morrow police declined to comment on the participation of any informants .
Mixtapes have been part of rap since the genre ’s earliest days in the 1970s — back then , D.J. ’s who spun records at clubs or parties committed their playlists to cassettes .
But the proliferation of CD burners in the last several years has made the production and wide circulation — or sale — of mixtapes easier than ever .
It has also enhanced their role in tastemaking .
Particularly since formerly underground mixtape hero 50 Cent broke out as a mainstream rap superstar in 2003 , the top producers of unlicensed CDs have been embraced by the industry ’s biggest corporations , who wager that the D.J. ’s reputations as renegades will translate into the sale of legitimate , licensed compilations , too .
Atlantic Records , for one , hired the mixtape D.J. known as Sickamore as a talent scout and had signed DJ Drama , to its artist roster with plans to release an authorized mixtape - style album this year .
Def Jam , Columbia and other big labels have released such CDs in the past .

The labels ’ reliance on the D.J. ’s is complicated further by the fact that many of the top mixtape creators also double as radio D.J. ’s on major rap stations .
Many label executives acknowledge that when they write checks to certain D.J. ’s to produce a mix CD for an artist , there is often an expectation that the D.J. will play the artist ’s music on the air — an arrangement that recalls the industry ’s recent radio corruption scandals involving illicit pay - for - play , or payola .
What Is A Professional Programmer ?
How do people become professional programmers ?
Many people go the " traditional " path through a computer science or software engineering education and from there into professional programming work .
Others become professional programmers by accident .
A person writes a small program to help at work , and their workmates say , " Oh great , you can write programs !
You 're our programmer now ! "
Other people start out as hobbyists and follow a less traditional path , not always getting a degree , but clearly wanting to be programmers from the start and working actively towards that goal .
I 've been a hobbyist programmer since I was 6 .
I was n't writing anything amazing back then but I had started writing and soon found it was absorbing most of my time .
Since I never really stopped , that gives me 24 years " programming experience " and counting .
At first I was into writing computer games .
Later people asked me to write programs for them , and sometimes I even got paid .
From this I learned that software is always for something .
Programs are not self contained worlds of their own .
People expect things out of a program that have more to do with Japanese or Geophysics or Engineering ( or whatever they 've got in mind ) than with how a computer works .
I had to learn something about all those domains in order to write programs for them .
At university it did n't take long before I was a tutor , and that 's where I found I enjoy teaching , and especially enjoy teaching programming .
While I was at university I got my first " real " job , writing Visual C++ code for a financial database company .
In terms of design and theory it was lightweight stuff .
But in terms of working with others on a large project I was being thrown in the deep end !
They had gigabytes of source code , growing cancerously through the efforts of a dozen developers of wildly differing skill levels .
In spite of my programming skills being well above average there , I learned to settle for being a junior programmer , a little fish in a large pond .
Skipping along a few more jobs and a lot more years , today I am a senior developer in a small research group — a big fish in a little pond .
I 've had to teach my co-workers a lot about professional programming , because most of them have n't been in industry to get that taste of what large code bases and diverse skill levels do to programs if you are n't using those " professional " skills to keep everyone pointed in the same direction .
There 's quite a gap between " being able to program " and being a " professional programmer . "
It took me 15 years to go from beginner to hotshot programmer , then another 10 years to go from hotshot to professional — and I 'm still learning .
Whatever the path we follow , most professional programmers have in common the fact that they learned to code first and how to be a professional later .
The Meaning of " Professional "
So what does it mean to be a professional programmer ?
What does it mean to be a professional anything ?
Some definitions simply say to be a professional is " to make money from a skill , " but true professionals also have a set of qualities often described as " professionalism . "
In my opinion , these qualities are : trustworthiness , teamwork , leadership , communication , constant updating of skills , an interest in minimizing risks and accountability .
Each of these effect the professional programmer in certain ways .
Trustworthiness
The concept of trustworthiness applies in several different ways for programmers .
Can you be trusted with a job ?
To perform a task without someone checking up on you ?
Can you be trusted to ask for help when you need it ?
If you 're given clients ' data or have signed a non-disclosure agreement , then you are being trusted to respect privacy .
You are trusted to check license agreements on third party tools or libraries and to get licenses or permission as required .
And like any professional you are trusted to simply do a good job .
Teamwork
Will you genuinely cooperate with your team mates ?
Will you work to mutual advantage and not just your own ?
Can you trust your team to work with you ?
Can you do your share of the work and trust your team to do the rest ?
And can you accept your management ( and sometimes even clients ) as part of the team , everyone trying to get the same job done ?
Leadership
Showing leadership means both earning respect from others and knowing what to do with it .
Recognize the skills of your team members , and make sure you can offer each person challenges and development without exceeding what they can cope with at a given time .
Leadership involves not always getting to do the " fun " parts of a project yourself ( that scary " delegation " word ) .
It also involves not asking anyone to do a task that you would n't be willing to do yourself .
It 's not just the managers and lead programmers who need to show leadership , it 's any professional programmer .
The best programmers to work with are the ones that know what 's going on , not just their little tasks .
Communication Respecting the people you work with , and your clients , enough to really listen to them is a critical part of communication .
Teamwork can't happen without good communication , nor can accountability .
Communication is critical for helping clients to produce usable specifications and feedback .
Will you question whether the specs you are given really will serve the purpose that the client has in mind ?
Communication skills help with making meetings timely and effective .
A professional 's communication is effective and to the point , whether in person , in email , on the phone or in written documents .
Documentation at first seems like a programmer - specific concern until you consider how many people require documentation in a serious project : other programmers need high level , API level and in - code documentation ; managers need planning , progress , and bug documentation ; lawyers need proof of what was done and when ; and users need documentation on how to use the software .
Updating Skills
Keeping your skills up to date involves staying aware of what 's going on in your industry .
What are the current ideas about methodologies like eXtreme Programming ?
What libraries and tools are out there that might support your project ?
What are the current refactoring tools ?
How about standards , file formats and protocols ?
Are you up to date with Unicode , XML , SQL , and all the other acronyms ?
Perhaps you 're missing out on something if you 're not .
What platforms are your potential clients using ?
Should you be learning about cross platform development ?
Basically you need to possess a genuine interest in your field , and to read broadly so you know what 's out there and which areas to then read deeply about .
You also need to accept that even ( or should I say " especially " ) the very best programmers are still learning .
Minimizing Risks Familiarity with best practices , combined with a healthy dose of common sense , will take you a long way towards managing risks .
Professional programmers keep track of known bugs or any other change they intend to make .
Bugs are risks , and a simple database can prevent you having a product ship with bugs you 'd simply forgotten .
Another risk that 's often not properly considered is any and all changes to the source code .
Source is your livelihood and any change can be a mistake .
There 's good software out there that will keep track of every revision of your source code and even help merge code that multiple people have changed .
Professional programmers are careful to do enough testing .
A software company will generally have testers but the developers need to know how to get the most out of testers and also how to write their own unit and regression tests to make sure every change in behavior is noticed and checked by a human .
Keeping your code simple and well styled is another commonly overlooked way to manage risks .
If anyone can look at the code and see right away what it does , you are far less likely to find bugs in it later , and you are less likely to have a junior programmer attempt to change something without understanding it first .
Another risk is the client changing their mind , or more often changing their specifications because they 've realized it was n't what they had in mind .
Write your code to be modular and reusable and you wo n't have any trouble adapting it to changing needs .
Accountability Writing code for others is a responsibility .
You need to make sure your software is reliable .
You need to make sure you and the client truly understand the requirements and specifications .
You need to have documentation of your work , all current and past bugs , your progress , any problems , signed - off milestones , and more .
You are also required to know about some basic legal issues , like software licensing , the terms of your employment contract , and intellectual property law .

As you can see , there is a huge gap between " coding " and " professional programming . "
Most programming courses focus on the coding side of things , and the professional skills tend to be glossed over or not covered at all .
I have found myself regularly teaching these skills to new co-workers , which highlighted the need for " professionalism skills training . "
Teaching my co-workers reminded me how much I enjoy teaching .
I decided to teach more people by trying my hand at professional writing for a change .
I set up a web site , which is completely independent from my day job .
The site is called Developing Programmers.com .
It is devoted to teaching people how to develop into professional programmers .
Since founding the site , I 've been presenting the tools and ideas that I think professionals should know about .
Some of my articles simply refer to other sites of benefit to would - be professionals .
I research other articles from scratch : tutorials , guides , and discussions of things professionals should be thinking about , like revision control , documentation , keeping your group pointed in the same direction — and of course , each of the aspects of professionalism that I listed earlier .
These days I consider myself to be a professional programmer , though I am still discovering the depth and breadth of what exactly that means .
Perhaps that ongoing exploration of programming and of professionalism is what makes this for me a career and not just a job .

Emma is interested in the middle east and all things ethical
" I do n't have much money , as I am just starting out on my career , but what I do have should not be used unethically , " she says .
" I hate to think of arms going to some African country funded , however indirectly , from my account . "
Ms Dellaway took an unusual step to follow through her ethical beliefs .
She opened an Islamic current account .
Global phenomenon
Ms Dellaway is not alone in equating Islamic finance with ethical living .
" Branches are reporting interest from all communities , " says Paul Sherrin , head of Islamic Finance at Lloyds TSB , which allong with HSBC and Islamic Bank of Britain offers Sharia compliant accounts .
Perhaps , though , if I had lots of money I would look at it differently and want interest
Emma Dellaway
" There is an international precedent for this .
In Malaysia up to 25 % of Islamic accounts are opened by non-Muslims .
" This is happening on a smaller scale over here , a number of non-Muslims are keen that the account does n't get involved in interest or anything they perceive as unethical . "
Ethical elements
Islamic accounts comply with Sharia law .
Under Sharia Islamic law , making money from money , such as charging interest , is usury and therefore not permitted .
PRINCIPLES OF ISLAMIC BANKING
All money must be invested in industries Muslims consider ethical
The giving or receiving of interest is forbidden Money cannot be simply traded for money Money can be used to buy goods or services , which can then be sold for a profit
Q&A : Islamic finance
Wealth should be generated only through legitimate trade and investment in assets .
But what really appeals to Ms Dellaway are the other aspects of Islamic banking .
" I have a guarantee that my money will not be used to invest in arms or tobacco , " she says .
Sharia law also forbids investment in alcohol , gambling and pornography .
Islamic interest
Ms Dellaway has always been interested in the Middle East .
She has spent time in Libya , studied politics at university and has friends from all faiths .
The reaction amongst Ms Dellaway 's friends and family to her decision seems to bear this out .
" They have been really interested in what I have done .
They ask lots of questions and can see how closely ethical finance and the Islamic financial models fit together , " Ms Dellaway says .
" When I went into my branch and told them I was keen on opening an Islamic current account , the staff member was unsurprised .
" I thought that perhaps I would be looked at as a bit of a lunatic but not a bit of it . "
The fact that Islamic bank accounts do not pay interest is not a problem to Ms Dellaway .
" I see giving up interest the same as recycling , visiting a farmers market or using the Red American Express card .
" Perhaps , though , if I had lots of money I would look at it differently and want interest . "
Most of you probably remember the C=64 , a legendary computer system that ruled the 80’s , and for some people , still brings a tear to their eyes when they hear about the name .
If you were a die - hard C=64 or Amiga fan , I ’m sure you already dreamt about Commodore coming back into business right ?
Well you do n’t have to dream anymore because Commodore is now back on the market , only this time , they are manufacturing clones using Intel chip technology .
Here are the basic specs of one of their top - end machines
Quad - core Intel Core 2 Extreme processor
4GB Corsair® Dominator memory
ASUS P5N32 - E nForce 680i SLI motherboard
Dual Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTX SLI Graphics cards
64 - bit edition of Vista
With this kind of setup , it is clear that Commodore wants to target hardcore gamers , but if you absolutely want to get a Commodore system and do n’t want to go bankrupt after your purchase , a few entry / mid-level models will also be available .
Unfortunately , no pricing details are out as of yet , but my guess is that these systems wo n’t be cheap by any measure .
We ’ll keep you updated with more details as soon as they come out , so stay tuned !

With 248 dimensions , is the biggest of the exceptional Lie groups , and in some ways the most mysterious .
The easiest way to understand a group is to realize it as as symmetries of a structure one already understands .
Of all the simple Lie groups , is the only one whose smallest nontrivial representation is the adjoint representation .
This means that in the context of linear algebra , is most simply described as the group of symmetries of its own Lie algebra !
One way out of this vicious circle would be to describe as isometries of a Riemannian manifold .
As already mentioned , is the isometry group of a 128 - dimensional manifold called .
But alas , nobody seems to know how to define without first defining .
Thus this group remains a bit enigmatic .
At present , to get our hands on we must start with its Lie algebra .
We can define this using any of the three equivalent magic square constructions explained in the previous section .
Vinberg 's construction gives
To emphasize the importance of triality , we can rewrite the the Barton - Sudbery description of as
Now let us turn from 8 - dimensional geometry to 16 - dimensional geometry .
On the one hand , we have
The really remarkable thing about the isomorphism
Starting from , we can define to be the simply - connected Lie group with this Lie algebra .
As shown by Adams [ 1 ] , the subgroup of generated by the Lie subalgebra is .
This lets us define the octooctonionic projective plane by
We can put an - invariant Riemannian metric on the octooctonionic projective plane by the technique of averaging over the group action .
It then turns out [ 5 ] that
Summarizing , we have the following octonionic descriptions of :

Donâ€™t buy the pig in the wig or \ ” why most JavaScript tutorials still suck \ ”
Monday , January 15th , 2007 at 9:23 pm
I think we all have realized it by now â€ “ JavaScript is a hot topic again and if you know your stuff and play your cards right you can make money and gain fame with publications ( books , articles , magazine submissions ) and conducting trainings and workshops .
This is grand and there is no reason why JavaScript should not be an integral part of web application and web site design â€ “ if used in an unobtrusive manner and with maintenance in mind of course .
However , lately Iâ€™ve discovered that there are a lot of publications cropping up that have been rightfully forgotten and got a lick of paint and the label Ajax just to be sold again without really looking into upgrading them .
You find terrible examples of convoluted JavaScript that was needed in the high time of the browser wars in these books and articles .
You also find examples using technologies that are simply not logical to use and actually have proven time and time again to be more destructive than helpful for the usability of your product .
Bad examples
My favourite example of this was published in a book 2006 is using a select box as a site menu via an onchange handler on the select box and by modifying the document location .
This kind of menu is impossible to use for someone who uses a keyboard and doesnâ€™t know to press â€ œAlt + Cursor Downâ€ ? to expand the whole menu first .
The normal keyboard usage pattern of a select box is that you use cursor up and down to navigate it and a menu like this will fire the redirect every time you go up or down .
The example was even worse by not providing a submit button at all ( how would a user without scripting submit the form ? ) .
Instead of explaining these problems the workaround was to offer a submit button wrapped in a NOSCRIPT tag as only users without JavaScript would need one .
It got worse by introducing document . write ( ) as a viable way to write out page content with JavaScript ( and by that mixing presentation and behaviour and making maintenance of the page a nightmare ) and trying to detect the browser in use by reading out the user agent string .
While this clearly was a case of laziness and trying to sell an outdated product with a new packaging ( pig in a wig with a bit of lipstick ) there is a more fundamental problem that could also be the cause of this kind of tutorial : it is much easier to teach somebody outdated JavaScript techniques than modern DOM scripting .
Teaching syntax vs. teaching the use of a language
The problem is that if you want to explain the basics of a programming language most tutorials start with the syntax .
This has been a convention for a long time and actually stems from teaching people human languages .
Many people learnt a foreign language in school that way and are perfectly capable of reading and writing it but fail completely in pronounciation or engagement in a conversation .
Ever wondered why you learnt much more about the language in those two hours talking to a charming and gorgeous foreigner ( most of the time of the other gender ) than in three years in school ?
It is about interest and determination .
Teaching people how to communicate in a foreign language is a much harder task than teaching the grammar and vocabulary .
You need a lot more engagement from the person you teach and you need them to be interested in the language and using it .
Most school education is seen as a â€œmustâ€ ?
rather than a â€œIâ€™d like to learn more about thisâ€ ?.
Some good language teaching techniques
I was lucky as I had an English teacher that made us subscribe to Newsweek , read the articles and then have a free debate in front of the black board .
The roles of the different celebrities , politicians or other famous people featured in the news article were played by different students and one student had to be chairman of the panel .
It was no coincidence that the teacher also ran the drama club .
This roleplaying made us become much more self - assured in using the foreign language than any long - winded grammar and syntax lecture would have done .
Using the language became fun and you wanted to engage more .
For example you wanted to learn more about using the language when you really liked the persona you had to play and wanted to get its point across in the debate .
Another good game we played was â€œjust a minuteâ€ ?.
You were asked to talk for one minute about a topic the teacher told you .
The class was divided in two groups and if you managed to finish the minute your half got a point .
The snag was that you had to avoid mistakes like hesitation , repetition , deviation and using your native language .
If you were caught committing one of these crimes the person from the other team that spotted it was to go on and would get the point for his or her team .
This technique taught you how to stay on topic and how to paraphrase a word you donâ€™t know instead of feeling inadequate for not knowing it ( as hesitation was a crime ) .
How does that relate to programming languages like JavaScript ?
Not quite the same but similar ideas apply to teaching a programming language .
When you teach the syntax and theoretical â€œhello worldâ€ ?
examples you will breed non-creative developers who consider any change in the language a threat as they have to change their ways .
The practical upshot is that you can easily explain the language and give examples that lead to immediate results for those you teach the first few lines of script .
Telling them to use document . write ( ) to print out results of a simple addition gives an immediate satisfaction that they achieved something , much like a
10 print " hello " ;
20 goto 10
back in the days of long ago .
The inaccessible dropdown menu navigations shows how to handle forms , the browser location object and event handling in one step , which allows the readers to play around with almost everything the browser offers them .
This satisfactory feeling leads to great feedback and also leads to publishers asking for this kind of tutorial .
I didnâ€™t want to use document . write ( ) at all in my book , but both technical editors demanded it as it is very handy to explain things with it .
At least I managed to get a message in that it is outdated and should be replaced with other techniques .
The real way Iâ€™d have liked to start the book about JavaScript would be to explain what an HTML document is , how browsers function and what you can reach with scripting , and how the DOM allows you to navigate around the document .
Then Iâ€™d have explained the syntax options of loops , conditions and calculations and put the lot together in a lot of examples using events .
However , a book like that is much harder to sell as people leafing through the first few pages would feel cheated not getting immediate code examples .
Our attention span is so short by now that it feels wrong to learn about the environment we are going to work in before we learn where to press the button to turn on the tool to manipulate it .
So in essence I can see ourselves being in a spot of bother : we know that some basic techniques are just bad and you donâ€™t need them any longer if you want to create an unobtrusive and easy to maintain web product .
On the other hand we also donâ€™t dare to break conventions of teaching and assume from the very start that readers are not interested enough in a subject matter to take in a bit of theory or the not obviously related information .
If you are learning about nude recreation , you may have heard about how nudists come in all shapes , size , colors and ages .
Yes , tou will fit in no matter what you look like .
Yet , some of you may be worried about being offended by what you 'll see - by what other people look like .
I can assure you , what other people look like is a non-issue .
Some reasonable questions by someone new to nude recreation :
Will I see someone much older or younger than I am ?
Will I see someone much larger or smaller than I am ?
Will I be offended by seeing different kinds of people , people different from me , nude ?
Yes , you will see people different from you .
The amazing part is that you are unlikely to be offended .
Contrary to everything you imagined you knew about the human body in all its shapes and forms , real life is much different .
Like a doctor , I 've now seen most every body type , shape , size and age in natural , nude states .
Like a doctor , I am neither shocked nor offended .
Looking at a body is like looking at a face .
A face " just is " .
A face is human .
Except , I 'm not a doctor .
I 've been a nudist for a handful of years .
The " context " of the environment changes how you see people .
Being younger than 80 or 90 % of the people at nudist resorts and beaches , I have been surprised at how normal , natural and un-shocking it is to see someone , say an 80 year old woman , nude in her natural state .
It goes against everything I thought I knew prior to trying nude recreation .
Why is this so ?
My guess is that it is human instinct .
I " feel " no different seeing this women nude than I would if I just saw her face while she was clothed .
Strange , is n't it ?
Imagine going to the zoo and seeing all of the different animals naked .
There are zebras and gorillas and tigers and giraffes .
The animals are natural .
Seeing humans in their natural state " feels the same " .
Does that make sense ?
Take a look at this small picture of a nudist couple 's backsides ( butts ! ) .
It 's a picture on the American Association for Nude Recreation 's website .
The couple are no supermodels by any means .
They are real people .
Middle - aged , imperfect , natural .
I have a feeling that if you try nude recreation , you 'll have this same experience within minutes after being nude around a lot of other people .
Besides the freedom and comfort of being without clothes in a natural state , the experience of being nude around other people in a safe , non-gawking environment creates a new appreciation of human - ness .
An un-learning happens .
The truth is that how people look is irrelevant .
We all age .
We all have different shapes and sizes and imperfections .
Hiding these imperfections behind cloth seems to be more restrictive than liberating .
Nude recreation frees your body from clothing and at the same time , frees your mind .
Numbers seem like pretty basic items , and it might be imagined that the brain has a correspondingly simple way of handling them .
In reality , however , our use of numbers is extremely complex .
For example , we can represent a number in a variety of ways ( 4 , four , and IV ) , all of which in turn represent an underlying concept ( four items : .... ) .
Does that suggest that there 's an individual , idealized representation of four in our brains ?
If so , how does our brain handle numbers that are unlikely to have a representation , such as 104 ?
Do we simply interpret numbers like that as a rough magnitude difference ?
Two papers and a perspective appearing in today 's issue of Neuron try to determine what 's going on in the brain in these situations .
As with most things these days , the newest results regarding the handling of numbers come via the application of functional MRI , which tracks the activity of different areas of the brain as it's confronted with a task .
Both studies start with the knowledge that numerical processing appears to require the activity of the intraparietal sulcus ( IPS ) .
They also rely on the fact that challenging an area of the brain produces a burst of activity , and then a degree of acclimation : continued challenges require less work .
In one paper , the researchers acclimated the brain to a set of similar numbers ( either 16 - 18 or 47 - 50 ) in a single type of notation .
Shifting from one cluster to the other — with the correspondingly significant change in magnitude — set of a new spike of activity and acclimation .
This was true whether or not the notation was changed at the same time , leading them to suggest that the brain represents different magnitudes in different areas of the IPS .
Is there any indication of symbolic specificity ?
They noticed a weak but significant difference when the notation was changed , but only in the left side of the IPS ; the right side seemed indifferent to notation .
They suggest that this might correlate with other studies that suggested that the left IPS is associated with precision ( exactly 17 ) as opposed to magnitude ( upper teens ) .
The second study set up similar tests to the first , but differed in the timing of the tests , the notations used , and the magnitude of the changes between the numerical values .
They also did a more fine - grained analysis of signals within the IPS .
In their case , they found that notation differences showed up in the right IPS , but only if the resolution of the imaging was kept extremely high .
Any sort of data smoothing eliminated the effect .
This seems to suggest the opposite of the other study , which found this sort of difference in the left side — what 's going on ?
For one , it 's important to note that the tests were structured quite differently , and that the resolution of the analyses were different .
As such , the disagreement may be far less important than the fact that both suggest that numbers are handled differently on the left and right sides of the brain .
If these sort of results hold up , it may put an end to the notion that there is any sort of idealized representation of numbers .
As a complete aside , the perspective indicates that there seems to be yet another layer of number handling in our brain that these studies do n't address : the difference between having four items revealed at once and registering them sequentially , as in a counting process .
Both of these studies also saw a number of other areas in the brain involved in number perception , so all of this research indicates that our brain does a lot of work before the IPS even gets involved .

University officials denied that Mr. Lechner 's lengthy enrollment had prevented even one qualified student from gaining admission .
But he was the beneficiary of a tuition subsidy given to all in - state students -- until the last school year , when the Wisconsin Board of Regents imposed a surcharge virtually doubling tuition for students who exceed 165 credits .
( Mr. Lechner has 242 . ) Wisconsinites call it the Johnny Lechner rule .
This year his tuition is about $ 9,800 .
Martha Saunders , the Whitewater chancellor , said that some faculty considered Mr. Lechner a bit of an embarrassment , while others believed that " we 're a community of scholars , and he just loves to learn . "
But Richard Brooks , a silver - haired philosophy professor who is Mr. Lechner 's most recent academic adviser , looked peeved when his student announced in a meeting between the two that he had made little recent progress toward completion of his senior thesis , in which he will reflect on his undergraduate years .
" The reader should come away convinced from this thesis that you actually did learn something , " Dr. Brooks said .
As a liberal studies major , Mr. Lechner must complete a thesis , which can be formal and footnoted or personal and reflective , his final requirement for graduation .
Mr. Lechner said it was stressful to reconcile his identity as a laid - back student with the image that his marketers now expect of him .
" I 'm not out getting hammered every night , " he said .
" People expect me to have crazy stories about being in threesomes , nights at the bar that end at sunup -- but that 's just people 's imaginations running away with them . "
He paused .
" I do n't know how much of a market there is for a guy who 's merely a good student , " he said .
" But I want you to know me as I am , rather than as the animal they 're making me out to be . "
When Mr. Lechner enrolled in college in 1994 , the Internet was practically a baby and his current girlfriend was starting fourth grade .
He has since drifted through four majors -- education , communications , theater , women 's studies -- and watched hundreds of friends graduate , get jobs and marry .

But judges at these competitions say the more important quality is precision and cleanliness , which can mean the difference between a vine stocked with healthy bunches of grapes and one rife with bunch rot .
In general , each of the vines is expected to carry 11 “ spurs ”  essentially offshoots of the main vine  which are expected to produce two bunches each .
But too many spurs can cause overcrowding on the vine , increasing the possibility of potentially devastating diseases spreading from grape to grape .
Too few spurs , meanwhile , means not enough product .
“ If you screw it up here , you ’re going to be paying for it all summer , ” said Nick Frey , the president of the Sonoma County Winegrape Commission , which has sponsored the competition for the last seven years .
Mr. Frey said the level of interest and number of competitors had been growing ever since the first competition in Sonoma in 1999 .
“ This is the biggest pruning event we have ever had , ” he said .
“ The quality and speed of the pruning was exceptional . ”

Spectators say the events are oddly riveting , especially for anyone with a passing interest in how wine gets made .
Like at most big games , the crowd in Sonoma was predominately male and occasionally rowdy , clapping and cheering as the pruners snipped , hacked and yanked a series of rugged chardonnay vines into shape .
Unlike most athletic crowds , however , the spectators here could talk you into the ground about plant biology , soil acidity and the relative merits of cane versus spur pruning .
( Do n’t even ask . )
One spectator , Rosa Brown , an office manager at the local Kendall Jackson winery , said she had tried pruning once and was impressed by the men ’s skills and endurance .
( For now , pruning seems to be a male - only sport . )
“ It ’s amazing what they do , ” Ms. Brown said .
“ I went out there for an hour , and I came back and my arms were sore , my back was sore , my shoulder blades were sore .
And they do it eight hours a day . ”
Oh really ?
Apparently we should all pull our money out of the market if we plan on funding our retirement or our child ’s college education according to his latest drivel over at Yahoo !
Finance .
The opening line is just classic since he immediately references one of his literary works ( if you can call it that ) :
When my book “ Rich Dad ’s Prophecy ” was released in 2002 , most financial newspapers and magazines trashed it because I discussed a looming stock market crash .
Ironically , much of what I predicted in the book is coming true earlier than I expected .
Right , I see it clearly now .
Since 2003 the DJIA has gone from around the 8,000 level to currently over 12,000 .
A 50 % gain over the course of four years is not satisfactory I guess .
In this piece he admits the market was rallying but claimed that while the market was going up the value was actually decreasing .
Huh ?
Well look at the awesome comparison he uses to prove it : he pulls out the returns of gold and oil since 1996 in order to “ predict the future ” .
Oh my goodness , oil is up 600 % and gold is up 200 % .
Shoot , why did n’t I put all of my retirement into a few commodities instead of the stock market market ?
What I really like is the comparison of gold to the DJIA in this ridiculous chart .
It shows that while the Dow is going up it is n’t going up as fast as gold so that means the Dow is actually crashing .
That ’s right folks , apparently if you compare the purchasing power of a commodity against the Dow it will allow you to predict the future .
According to his findings I was actually losing money even though my retirement accounts have been seeing 10 - 16 % returns over the last few years .
I wonder what would happen if we chart the relationship of pork bellies or soybeans and the Dow ?
Would the results be different ?
To Kiyosaki ’s credit he does bring up an important point about the purchasing power of the dollar , but this is an extremely overblown and poorly executed attempt at pushing his agenda .
Inflation is certainly a concern and it always has been and always will be .
But comparing the Dow to the price of gold in order to construe your findings to prove that you need to make 15 % in the stock market each year just to break even is downright asinine .
If we carried around gold bullion in our pockets as a form of currency he may have a valid concern .
So if you ever want to retire you should get out of the market and buy gold , real estate and other hard assets .
Better yet , just buy his books and all your problems will be solved .

It is not journalism ’s job to be safe or to make the world safe for our consumption .
It is journalism ’s job to tell us uncomfortable truths .
So I ’ve come to think that NBC made the wrong decision about the Virgina Tech shooter ’s tapes :
They should have released the worst of them .
For that would force us as a society to grapple with the issues we ’re still sidestepping :
How can our laws and systems keep a clearly insane and dangerous man out of treatment and in the public ?
How can we justify laws that value his privacy — the most overexploited buzzword of the age , I say — over his safety and sanity and the safety of those around him ?
How can we have laws that prevent the school from telling his parents about his problems and telling the rest of us what happened in his case , even now ?
If NBC showed how utterly deranged this murderer was , then I hope we would have an outcry to change the One - Flew - Over - the - Cuckoo ’s - Nest laws that purport to protect but only harm the insane and those around them .
But NBC wo n’t do that because there reportedly is an outcry ( though one should always be skeptical about what media labels an outcry ) against their decision to release what they did .
Yet I ’ll argue that by choosing to release only the safest elements of this sick collction , NBC made the killer look less dangerous , perhaps even sympathetic or cartoonish .
Compare the image with the latest cover of Wired ( and , no , of course , the parallel is not that they ’re Asian ; it ’s the fictional nature of both I ’m pointing to , each a character in a media narrative ) .
If , instead , NBC had shown the most vile of Cho ’s rants , we would see just how dangerous he obviously was .
We would ask the hard questions about why he was allowed to do what he did .
And if you ’re worried about copycats , I also think that the bilious Cho would be less likely to inspire aspiration than the cartoonish Cho we now see .
To those who argue that NBC is only giving Cho his wish — fame — I say they are doing worse :
They are cleaning up his image .
Now I ’m not saying that NBC should show these images all the time , looping the horror , forcing it upon us .
Thanks to the web , they do n’t need to show them on the air at all :
They could give us the option of seeing them online .
Does that appeal to our worst nature ?
No , it shows our worst nature and the argument can be made that we must face that .
By not facing that , we are raising , not lowering , the danger of copycats , of the next nut who ’ll be allowed to slip through our laws and systems because we would n’t want to offend anyone .
It is not NBC ’s job to be safe .
But it is NBC ’s job to be popular and in this case , that ’s unfortunate .
I normally reject the arguments of those who want news to be a not - for - profit enterprise .
I say that the news must face its marketplace .
But this is one instance in which the quest for ratings , popularity , and profit can affect journalistic judgment .
Still , NBC did release some of the images and tapes .
If they had wanted to be utterly safe , to offend absolutely no one , they might well not have put anything out , or they could have punted that decision to government .
Some say they did this for ratings , but I have to believe they knew this would not be a popular decision in many quarters .
So they did release some of the tapes .
I say they released the wrong ones .
If there were ever a story that required uncomfortable truths , this is one .

Evidence of pheromones in eye secretions surprises researchers .
Facial grooming gives a boy mouse a way to signal his sex to potential mates .
© Alamay
It may not be considered manly for humans to cry .
But when male mice shed a tear , they seem to be trying to prove their masculinity .
So say Japanese researchers who have discovered that male mice release pheromones in the fluid that moistens their eyes .
" Nobody expected that sex - specific pheromones would exist in tears , " says Kazushige Touhara of the University of Tokyo in Chiba .
Pheromones , the chemicals that convey messages about everything from fear to sexual desire , are most common in sweat in humans , and in urine in mice .
It is not clear whether mice ever cry for the same reasons as humans ; in this study , their tears were just the result of a basic physiological response that keeps a mouse 's eyes wet and comfortable .
“ Nobody expected that sex - specific pheromones would exist in tears . ” Kazushige Touhara
University of Tokyo , Chiba
Touhara says the pheromones in these secretions are probably picked up by females when they groom the faces of their fellow mice .
These sexy cues may help females to work out which of their companions are male and therefore potential mates , Touhara and his team report in Nature1 .
The crying game
In most vertebrates , pheromones seem to trigger nerve cells in the vomeronasal organs , which are situated in the hard palate between the nose and mouth .
Some studies have found evidence for such an organ in the developing human fetus , but the presence of a functioning one in human adults remains controversial .
Touhara 's group set out to explore how various pheromone compounds affect mouse vomeronasal organs , which are thought to influence mating behaviour .
But when they picked through the chemicals in mouse urine to find the pheromone responsible for triggering a specific receptor in the organ , they came up empty handed .
After testing naturally produced chemicals from various mouse glands , the team finally hit upon the right chemical ... in mouse tears .
ADVERTISEMENT
The researchers note that humans are not likely to release pheromones in their tears .
The mouse - tear pheromones are produced by a family of genes for which humans do n't seem to have an analogue , says Touhara .
But he adds that the work highlights a mystery of human tears : scientists do not fully understand why we cry when hurt .
" I think that to cry means more than people have thought , " Touhara says .

Agile People Still Don't Get It
Some Agreement
Calculating Risk
Stacks , Queues , Bowling , and FitNesse .
Tests are not Specs .
Anything not testable is useless .
But You CAN Test It .
Agile people Get It .
re : " the code is the design " and " to understand the code , read the tests " , I can see Cedric 's point to some extent .
I 've seen some tests that have been much more difficult to understand than just the code , and I 've seen some cases where a new developer on a mid-size project adds behaviour that 's already written into the application because it was not easy to find out how it was done already .
So if we 're going to live by these mantras , we have a couple of responsibilities that we must honor :
1 - make the tests look like specs , not tests .
2 - as patterns appear within a codebase , document them .
i.e. " If you want to do xyz , take a look at the Abc class " .
This sort of documentation is general and lightweight , making it easy enough to maintain while providing a powerful service .
Cedric : " Tests are ( executable ) specs .
First of all , tests are not specs .
Not even close .
Somebody in the audience was quick to give a counter - example to this absurd claim by using a numeric example ( " how do you specify an exponentiation function with a test ? " ) " ...
That one is easy : f( x , n ) = x * x * ... * x ( n times )
But that is not a spec .
What Cedric is calling " spec " is simply a requirement ( or a user story to use XP terminology ) .
The spec must be something that is either achieved or it is not .
If you hardcode the input data ( like it is used in JUnit ) , then obviously it will test a very small portion of the solution space .
But you can auomate the input to test different parts of the solution space , randomly .
" but my objection to this claim is much broader than that .
Relying on tests as a design specification is lazy and unprofessional because you are only testing a very small portion of the solution space of your application ( and of course , your tests can have bugs ) .
Tests also fall extremely short of having the expressiveness needed to articulate the subtle shades that a real specification need to cover to be effective . "
Again , Cedric is thinking that a requirment is a spec .
You can't test a requirement , but you should test if you have achieved what the spec specifies .
" This claim is part of a broader and more disturbing general Agilist attitude that is usually articulated like " Your code is your spec " , along with some of its ridiculous corollaries such as " Documentation gets out of date , code never does " .
Anyone who claims this has never worked on a real - world project .
And I 'm setting the bar fairly low for such a project : more than five developers and more than 50,000 lines of code .
Try to bring on board new developers on this project and see how fast they come up to speed if all they have to understand the code base is ... well , just code .
And tests .
I am currently getting acquainted with a brand new project that is not even very big , and while I understand Java fairly well , there is no doubt in my mind that for ten minutes I spend trying to understand how a certain part of the application works , a five - line comment would have given me this knowledge in ten seconds . "
If you can read a 5 line comment , you can also read a 5 line method .
If you need to read a 100 line method , maybe :
1 . The name of the method is not good enough .
2 . The method is too long .
Substandard code is substandard code no matter if you do XP or not .
It might be the answer , but it is a step in the right direction .
I was on an agile team that started out smoothly , with TDD and Scrum , and our burndowns looked good .
Then , we needed to interact with a non -agile company guru , and suddenly our project dragged to a halt .
Even if Agile is not the answer , it is a better answer than what was done before .
Until something better comes along , it is the choice for developers and testers that want to see their work progress in product , rather than in Project Milestones .
The criticisms shown in Cedric 's blog are of HOW it is being done , but not of the Agile process itself , and as Robert Martin points out , the criticism is valid when folks respond to a call for help with " you should have done it agile " , even when the project they are working on started before Agile was born .
Who 's is your point of view ?
Developer's ?
But it is not a developer 's decision to ship a product , is it ?
Product owners often have valid business reasons to ship buggy code , and they have the right to do so .
As a developer I may feel shitty about them shipping crappy code .
But if they do n't , I do n't get my pay cheque .
And I do n't have a place to come tomorrow to refactor what I did today .

I agree that not doing TDD is irresponsible .
But then who wants really good code ?
Maybe in developed countries people think they need to write the tests first and then they need to be sure nothing breaks .
In south america first we code , then we test if we have time .
And we do not write tests , we simply start the debugger .
No code gets bigger than a 100 thousand lines without collapsing under its own weight .
And that is after a lot of copying and pasting , so the actual number of individual and unique lines is not more than 3,000 ...
The project may go on and on for several months without making any real progress .
In developed countries this happens too when they hire undeveloped workers like for example in Duke Nukem Forever ...
So , if you want to have a real boost in productivity , you have to TDD and you have to pair developers and switch pairs on a daily basis .
Moreover you have to hire the best .
The top 2 % of the people that applies to the job are the ones that are 10 times more productive than the average .
The top 10 % are the ones that are 4 times more productive .
All the rest can be spared or hired as bean counters , nothing else .
Sometimes some of the people hired realize that they are working to make their own job irrelevant .
Those are the people we want :
The ones that look into what they have done and realize that their job is about to be fnished , so they say : " Look I 'm about to finish this , what 's next ? " , " What do you think about doing this and that ? " , " Did you realize we can improve what we are doing ? " , and so on .
The people we do n't wat is the people who think they were hired to do X and they look for ways to make themselves important , and that means doing their job improperly and halfheartedly .
If they find that their job is about to finish , they look for ways to extend it , so they can be paid for doing nothing or almost to nothing .
We get rid of those persons as soon as we can , we put other people to learn what they are doing and then we move them somewhere else where they can do no harm .
Anyway , this is not the standard way to work in latin american countries .
Most companies in this countries simply hire and hire people to do irrelevant stuff , and they never finish .
They can't finish , because having no job in an underdeveloped country may mean starvation .
There is no social security , so in the streets there are lots of people willing to work for pennies .
Having a stable job is the ultimate goal for almost 99 % of the population , so once they get hired they look for ways to remain in the position .
Using TDD and using CVS or SVN at work is considered a big step in wrong direction , because it means other people can look at my code and actually understand it .
Where is job security then ?
So from day zero we need to make sure people are not in the way .
We need to pair them everyday and force them to use SVN , ant and TDD .
Jeff :
> Instead of making excuses about why it 's too hard to test everything , we should be asking , why * ca n 't *
I test something ?
Indeed ; I work in video games and often hear that such - and - such code is inherently untestable .
What you say ?
My assertion , that came from repeated utterances of the above , is to say that a programmer finding that a given operation is untestable is akin to saying that that programmer does n't know what that operation is doing .
It 's not Rocket Science ( tm ) .
We 're doing operations on databases for crying out loud .
So yeah , " if you do n't know how to test it , you do n't know how it works . "
Unfortunately , that 's more than a little off - putting to someone who 's not already a Xealot . :)
> I never said I did n't test , I only said that sometimes , I voluntarily did n't do TDD
I think it does n't hurt when you sometimes implement first and write the test afterwards .
It just depens how much code you add before you follow with the tests .
The more untested code you add , the harder it will be to get it under test afterwards .
You do n't have those problems when you test first .
It just takes some time to get used to it .
> ... sometimes , coding the feature is more important than writing the test first .
You should n't seperate coding features and writing tests .
It 's one unseperable activity .
> Still , I have yet to find code that is 100 % tested ...
That 's true but that does n't mean that you should n't test at all .
It also depends heavily on your design how much tests are necessarry .
If you use techniques that keep your state space lean ( e.g. the Single Responsibility Principle )
it 's not too complicated to permanently have extremely high test coverage .
> ... and I think that requiring that every single line of your production code to be tested before
> your software gets shipped is a certain guarantee that you 'll never ship .
If you do it the other way round , the software will need to be permanently fixed .
You 'll arrive at a point where you are so bussy fixing that you do n't haven time
to develop something new .
Any change will increase the pain .
Shipping untested software is shipping something unfinished and your customers
will force you to finish it .
The preassure will be higher at orders of magnitude
if you finish it AFTER you have shipped it !
Bob , I think you misunderstood me with :
<<
In his article , Cedric said : " But the truth is : at times , I do n't do TDD because implementing a feature quickly is more important than a fuzzy feeling . "
This is what I find to be unacceptable .
Firstly , I wo n't accept the notion that testing is just for a " fuzzy feeling " .
>>
I never said I did n't test , I only said that sometimes , I voluntarily did n't do TDD .
I still test , but sometimes , coding the feature is more important than writing the test first .
Still , I have yet to find code that is 100 % tested , and I think that requiring that every single line of your production code to be tested before your software gets shipped is a certain guarantee that you 'll never ship .

Cedric
I realize that it's a someone radical position to take , but it has become my position that TDD is a necessary discipline for professional developers .
I consider it rather like sterile procedure for doctors .
It 's simply what you have to do to write professional code .
( At least it 's what I have to do . )
And , yes , I do like these disputes .
When we agree we only learn that we agree .
When we disagree we learn together more than the two of us know separately .
The analogy that helps me in such discussion is the tradtional engineering analogy .
Car manufacturers are spending millions on computers for all kind of simulation .
The simple purpose of those simulations is TESTING .
They are there to proove
that the engineer 's decisions are right and the car meets the specification .
In mechanical engineering , there 's no QA - Team around to fix the mess of an engineer .
They have too proove with thorough calculations that their designs work .
We are all happy that the cars , airplanes and other things are tested thoroughly before
they get into production and engineers have appropriate skills and tools in hands to actually know what their disigns
are doing , are we ?
Why should n't we use the same care for our software ?
Uncle Bob :
Do you enjoy those disputes ?
I really enjoy reading them !
I have n't talked with Cedric , but , I assume that when he says that he wo n't use TDD during the development of a feature , he actually does not mean he wo n't test it .
I assume that what he means is that he will not do TDD .
Early I think almost all of us did this .
Now I know better and I use TDD for production code , only in the case of Spikes or some legacy project I get involved that does n't have unit tests infrastructure I actually do n't use TDD .
Nevertheless , I think it is n't required that a person does TDD to be considered a professional software developer !
Sometimes I say things that are provocative in order to get people to think in a direction opposite from the one they have thought in .
When I presented the talk at Google , I said , " here are a couple of things that I use to help * me * think about what I want to do with TDD . "
On that slide , entitled " mindsets " , was the contention that if it's not testable , it 's useless .
Obviously it 's impossible to automate tests against everything .
That 's not the idea .
The idea is that until it is tested ( and it does n't have to be tested in a unit test , or even programmatically ) , you have no idea that the software does what it is supposed to do .
At which point , you should n't be shipping it .
This is what the majority of code is about in most systems .
Instead of making excuses about why it 's too hard to test everything , we should be asking , why * ca n 't *
I test something ?
No , TDD is not a panacea .
No , tests are specs , or at least they are not a complete form of specification , but the more you try to get them to read as specification , the better your tests will be .
No , perhaps untested code is not completely useless , but it 's highly questionable .
For people getting so upset at such assertions , I suggest looking at them with these thoughts in mind .
Perhaps I should have used a softer word than " sure " .
Perhaps .
On the other hand , I reject the notion of shipping bad code because we did n't have time to make it right .
In his article , Cedric said : " But the truth is : at times , I do n't do TDD because implementing a feature quickly is more important than a fuzzy feeling . "
This is what I find to be unacceptable .
Firstly , I wo n't accept the notion that testing is just for a " fuzzy feeling " .
Secondly , I wo n't accept the notion that speed is more important that accuracy .
I will grant you that speed is important .
However , it is even more important to be accurate .
Therefore , in the time allotted , we should do only what we know we can get working , and tested .
Yes , there is a statistical limit to our " sureness " .
In finite time we can never be absolutely sure that our code works as planned .
But we can have a high degree of confidence .
So to restate my point :
From my point of view it is completely unacceptable to release code that you have not tested to a degree to satisfy your project 's standard of a high degree of confidence .
" From my point of view it is completely unacceptable to release code that you are n't sure works . "
You can * never * be sure that any non-trivial system works 100 % .
You have to use statistical techniques to focus testing effort where the greatest risks are ( as you said ) and apply other practices ( formal inspections , for example ) that have been shown to reduce latent defects .
So , releasing code that you are n't sure works is not only acceptable but the only practical thing to do unless you are working on small systems .
A response to Cedric 's post Cedric raises a number of good points .
Particularly that if Agile evangelists use religious arguments , and do n't connect with real developers with real problems , then they are n't going to get much further .
The early adopters have adopted ; and the next batch of folks are a bit more skeptical .
To reach them we have to make much stronger arguments that are tied to the reality of development .
However , I disagree quite strongly with Cedric regarding " Calculated Risk " .
From my point of view it is completely unacceptable to release code that you are n't sure works .
Either make sure it works , or do n't ship it .
Period .
There is enough risk in that scenario to go around .
Besides , nobody actually calculates the risk .
What they do instead is HOPE .
They hope that their code will work well enough to keep customers and managers from getting angry .
Frankly it is this hopeful attitude that makes software engineers look like fools .
We optimistically offer our latest release , and cross our fingers behind our backs that the customer wo n't do those things we know will crash the system and corrupt the database .
A feature that crashes is much worse than a feature that does n't exist .
A feature that does n't exist will defer revenue for a release , and may give a competitor an advantage .
But a feature that crashes makes enemies out of our customers .
Our customers interpret features as promises .
When we release a feature we are promising that it works .
When it crashes we have broken that promise .
If we break too many promises we lose trust .
Cedric complains that all the examples of TDD are trivial little things like stacks , queues , and bowling games .
It is reasonable to be skeptical of such simple examples .
They are n't real .
There is also a reason that such simple examples exist .
They fit into the time and space allowed .
This is an old problem and Cedrick is n't the first one to raise it .
It was raised during the endless debates 35 years ago regarding structured programming .
However , Cedric is wrong that no significant examples exist .
I 'd like to refer him to FitNesse .
This is 30,000 lines of Java code , written test first , and with a code coverage in the 90%s .
Studying FitNesse has a lot to recommend it , both for examples of what to do , and for examples of what not to do .
FitNesse is a real application with real customers and real issues .
It 's a web driven application with a back - end database and some fairly complex business rules that involve separate processes , and multiple languages .
Of course they are .
A test is an unambiguous specification of behavior .
I agree that tests cannot specify everything .
The power - function example is a reasonable point .
( Though I 'd like to ask Cedric how he'd make sure that a power function worked . )
You can not specifywith tests .
However youspecify a .
Indeed , you can specify many of the most important behaviors of a system by writing tests for them .
This is nothing new .
Parnas - tables are an example of unambiguous specifications that are testable .
Decision tables are yet anothers .
Indeed , a great deal of a specification hadbe testable , otherwise system test will have no role .
Cedric is right that you cannot depend entirely upon tests for the system specification .
But he is wrong to case aspersions on the whole discipline of specifying through tests .
There is hardly a better way to be unambiguous and current , than to specify tests and require that they always pass .
Here 's the thing .
If you can't test it , you do n't know that it works .
If you do n't know that it works , then it 's useless .
If you have a requirement and cannot prove that you have met it , then it is not a requirement .
Any behavior of a computer is testable .
And there are a finite ( though very large ) number of tests that will prove that any computer program running in finite memory works as specified .
( Even the power function . )
Therefore , the ultimate specification of a program is the exaustive list of tests that demonstrate it 's behavior .
Of course nobody can write that many tests .
So we opt for statistical methods .
We opt for code coverage rather than path coverage .
We make sure that every line of code is executed in a test .
We make sure that every decision is tested .
And then we take a ( in the case truly ) calculated risk that if we have tested every line and every decision then the system will work as expected .
We call this " due dilligence " .
When Cedric talks about " Calculated Risk " , he may be referring to a more benign form than I referred to above .
If a team of developers invests the appropriate level of test effort to cover lines and decisions up to a very high level , and they also decide that this level of coverage provides them with a low - enough defect density , then they can take the calculated risk because they have done due dilligence .
However , this does not mean : " I ran it on my laptop last week , and it seemed to work OK .
" Actualy , Agile Peopleget it .
We get it very well .
And we have gone very far into helping the rest of the industry get it .
There is hardly a big or small company that has not tried agile developent in one form or another , and there are many , many , that have invested significatnly and are enjoying the benefits .
Agile is not a silver bullet .
Agile is not THE ANSWER .
But Agile techniques , and especially TDD , are very powerful techniques to get software written well , and to increase the level of professionalism in our industry.!commentForm -r
Yet courts have almost always deferred to the secrecy claims ; Mr. Weaver said he believed that the last unsuccessful assertion of the privilege was in 1993 .
Steven Aftergood , an expert on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists , said , " It 's a sign of how potent the national security mantra has become . "
Under Mr. Bush , the secrets privilege has been used to block a lawsuit by a translator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Sibel Edmonds , who was fired after accusing colleagues of security breaches ; to stop a discrimination lawsuit filed by Jeffrey Sterling , a Farsi- speaking , African - American officer at the Central Intelligence Agency ; and to derail a patent claim involving a coupler for fiber - optic cable , evidently to guard technical details of government eavesdropping .
Such cases can make for oddities .
Mark S. Zaid , who has represented Ms. Edmonds , Mr. Sterling and other clients in privilege cases , said he had seen his legal briefs classified by the government and had been barred from contacting a client because his phone line was not secure .
" In most state secrets cases , the plaintiffs ' lawyers do n't know what the alleged secrets are , " Mr. Zaid said .
More recently the privilege has been wielded against lawsuits challenging broader policies , including the three lawsuits attacking the National Security Agency 's eavesdropping program  one against AT&T by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco and two against the federal government by the American Civil Liberties Union in Michigan and the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York .
In a filing in the New York case , John D. Negroponte , the director of national intelligence , wrote that allowing the case to proceed would " cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States " because it " would enable adversaries of the United States to avoid detection . "
Mr. Negroponte said he was providing more detail in classified filings .
Those cases are still pending .
Two lawsuits challenging the government 's practice of rendition , in which terror suspects are seized and delivered to detention centers overseas , were dismissed after the government raised the secrets privilege .
Story Highlights • NEW : Police official urges people with information to come forward
• NEW : Betting on cricket among lines of inquiry , police official says
• Woolmer died less than 24 hours after stunning World Cup defeat
Adjust font size :
KINGSTON , Jamaica ( CNN ) --
A pathology report indicated that Pakistani cricket coach Bob Woolmer died of " manual strangulation , " according to a statement from Jamaican police commissioner Lucius Thomas .
" In these circumstances , the matter of Mr. Woolmer 's death is now being treated by the Jamaican police as a case of murder , " the statement said Thursday night .
Police announced Tuesday that Woolmer 's death was suspicious , two days after he was found unconscious in his room at the Pegasus Hotel .
Woolmer , 58 , was declared dead at a hospital soon after he was found .
( Watch what has emerged as a possible motive in Woolmer 's murder )
Initial media reports indicated he died of a heart attack .
Woolmer 's death came less than 24 hours after former world champion Pakistan was beaten and eliminated by the relatively unknown Irish team on St. Patrick 's Day , one of the biggest shocks in World Cup cricket history .
The loss on Saturday prompted outrage among the team 's hardcore fans , with protesters burning effigies of Woolmer and the team captain in Karachi .
Asked about suspects , Deputy Police Commissioner Mark Shields would only say , " We have a few definite lines of inquiry , " acknowledging later that betting on cricket matches was among them .
Shields urged people with any information about the case to come forward .
" It 's a very busy hotel , " he said .
" I 'm absolutely certain that someone saw something that could help us in this investigation . "
Blood , vomit and diarrhea were splattered over the walls and floor of Woolmer 's hotel bathroom , said Pakistan 's team spokesman Pervez Mir Wednesday afternoon .
( Watch Mir describe what he saw )
Police refused to comment on that report .
Earlier on Thursday , police fingerprinted all members of the Pakistani cricket team at the hotel , and they were to submit statements to police as part of the ongoing investigation , Mir said .
" It is standard procedure , " Mir added .
" Each of them will come along and give a written statement . "
The players ' hotel rooms were on the same floor as Woolmer's .
The team has been cleared to leave Kingston , and there was no reason to detain anyone , a Jamaican official said Thursday .
The team left the hotel secretly and was believed to be flying to Montego Bay , Jamaica , for two days ' rest before returning to Pakistan .
Woolmer , who was English , played Test cricket for England in the mid-1970s .
He later turned to coaching and coached the South African national team before taking over as Pakistan 's coach in 2004 .
CNN 's John Raedler contributed to this report .

The average American household carries almost $ 16,000 in credit card debt ( only counting indebted households ) , according to a recent study by Nerdwallet .
If that ’s not bad enough , the credit card companies are involved in what can only be described as a conspiracy to keep Americans in debt , permanently .
I watched an incredible PBS documentary online last night called “ Secret History Of Credit Cards ” .
You can watch the 5 - part eye - opener here at your leisure .
But if you do n’t have an hour to spare , here are some of the biggest dirty secrets for you .
You may want to sit down for these .
1. Minimum Payments Are Ripoffs
The minimum payments banks require on your monthly bill are not regulated .
Banks are required to set minimum payments that will allow borrowers to pay off the debt in a " reasonable " amount of time , but after that , it 's up to the banks to calculate their own minimums .
The result is often minimums that shave only a few percentage points off the principal , which extends the time borrowers pay interest .
Here 's an example .
Let 's say you owe a modest $ 2000 on a card with a decent interest rate of 13 % and a minimum payment based on paying 2 % of the principal .
Your minimum payment would be a mere $ 40 , but it would take you almost 15 years to pay off the balance !
Before that debt is retired , you will have paid the bank $ 1813 in interest .
Cha-ching .
2. A Late Payment Can Skyrocket Your APR
Before the CARD
Act became law this was really bad , and thankfully , that law has mostly eliminated the practice of " Universal Default , " which allowed banks to hit you with a skyhigh APR if you were late paying any creditor , not just your credit card company .
And while things are definitely better , the banks can still bump your APR to 25 % or 30 % or even higher if you make even one late payment .
This " Penalty APR " will be noted in your card agreement and will be applied to all new purchases .
If your payment is really late , 60 days or more , the bank can apply the penalty APR to your existing balances , too .
( Ouch ! )
Card issuers are required to review any account that has been slapped with a Penalty APR after six months of on time payments , but that 's no guarantee the Penalty APR will be reduced .
3. Late Payments Can Cost You More Than a Late Fee
Have you seen the credit card commercials that claim cardholders wo n't be charged a fee if they make a late payment , especially if they 've been good customers ?
First of all , every cardholder should know that it 's easy to get a late fee waived : Just call and ask .
Every cardholder should also know that a late pay can hurt in other ways , too .
For one , if you 've been avoiding interest charges by paying your balance in full each month , a late payment will immediately incur an interest charge on your balance , and it may take two billing cycles for the grace period to get put back in place .
Depending on how late you are , the bank may report your account to the credit bureaus as a late pay , dinging your credit score .
If the account has been open for a year or more , the bank could apply the Penalty APR to future purchases .
Finally , every day you 're late is another day you 're paying interest on that debt .
4. There Is No Federal Limit on Interest Rates
Do n’t you find it odd that in a time of very low interest on anything from car loans to mortgages , credit card companies can hand out APRs that embarrass loan sharks ?
Well , it ’s not unusual to see 34.99 % APRs , especially as a penalty rate , and the reason is simple .
Most credit card companies reside in states like South Dakota or Delaware , states that have very weak or even no “ usury laws . ”
So , there ’s no cap on interest .
By law , there ’s nothing to stop them charging whatever interest they want .
Here ’s a map that links to the locations of top 10 credit card issuers .
5. Grace Periods Are Getting Shorter ... or Being Eliminated
There 's nothing in the law that requires banks to offer a " grace period " on purchases before charging interest .
It 's a holdover from the beginnings of the industry .
Still , most cards continue to offer them as a perk , and it really is a good deal for consumers , as long as they pay their balances in full and on time .
Slip up and leave a small balance for next month , however , and you 'll lose your grace period and start incurring interest from the moment you make a purchase .
Worse , it can take two months of paying balances in full to reinstate the grace period , if it can be reinstated at all .
Check your card agreement and pay off those balances !
6. Cash Advances Hit You Twice in the Wallet
First , as I ’m sure you know , you ’ll get a different , higher APR applied to your cash advances .
But you also get hit with a transaction charge , around 2.5 % .
Even credit cards that confidently announce “ no finance charges ” can still bill you for these transaction charges .
7. Good Payers Are Called " Deadbeats " !
Deadbeat – it ’s what credit card companies call those folks who are responsible and pay off the balance each month .
They do n’t like those people , not one bit .
That ’s because they make little to no money off of them .
No , credit card companies like you to carry a nice hefty balance and pay only the minimum each month .
If you ’re one of those people , known as ‘ revolvers ’ , you ’re part of the crowd that contributes roughly 90 % of the credit card company ’s income .
What a crazy upside - down world credit is .
8. You Can Demand , and Get , a Better Deal
APR too high ?
Hate the annual fee ?
Want a longer grace period ?
It turns out your credit card company may just have to do your bidding .
See , the fees they charge are not considered a necessary cost of doing business , so you can request , firmly , that they be reduced or eliminated .
Now , imagine what would happen if we all did that ?
No wonder they want that one kept secret .
And remember , if all else fails , find a lower cost APR card and transfer your balance .
You have at least that going for you .
That ’s the scoop , folks .
If you happen to be in spiraling credit card debt , there are places you can go to for help .
PBS has a great list of resources right here .
And from now on , I hope you all look a whole lot closer at that handy piece of plastic in your wallet .
It ’s far more ominous than it first looks .
Pleasant dreams everyone .

ABOUT a year before Adam Richman was to graduate from the Harvard Business School in 1996 , he took on an extracurricular project .
It was long before the Internet bubble inflated and burst , and well before one of the school 's graduates landed in the White House .
Mr. Richman wondered :
What was the real - world value of a master 's in business administration , especially one from the iviest of Ivies ?
Was it , as widely perceived , an ace in the hole , a get - out - of - jail - free card , a ticket to the good life ?
To that end , Mr. Richman decided to track a core group of his Harvard classmates , to converse with them about their personal and professional aspirations , and then to revisit them every five years until 2026 .
He also decided to film them along the way , à la " 7 Up , " Michael Apted 's celebrated documentary series , which chronicled the lives of the same 14 people every seven years .
" I wanted to know how students made their career and leadership decisions , how they defined success , " said Mr. Richman , 36 , the co-founder of Double Nickel Entertainment , a television and film production company .
His academic adviser , Monica C. Higgins , an associate professor at the business school , became a consultant for the series , titled " Building Career Foundations , " which she uses for case - study work in her classroom .
" We 're very interested in how external shocks affect careers — like 9/11 , the dot - com boom and bust — and this class was right before the dot - com boom , " said Professor Higgins , 41 .
" We wondered : ' How do people make the decision to drop everything and go after a dream ?
Who makes those type of choices and why ? '
People ask alums , ' What was the most important class you took in school ? '
But the real test comes once you 're out . "

Abstract
A 22 - year - old woman sought medical care for a lesion in the plantar region of her left foot , a well - formed nipple surrounded by areola and hair .
Microscopic examination of the dermis showed hair follicles , eccrine glands , and sebaceous glands .
Fat tissue was noted at the base of the lesion .
Clinical and histopathologic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of supernumerary breast tissue , also known as pseudomamma .
To our knowledge , this is the first report of supernumerary breast tissue on the foot .
Clinical synopsis
A 22 - year - old woman sought medical care due to a lesion in the plantar region of her left foot present since birth .
She had no complaints of pain , pruritus , or alterations in volume or color .
During her pregnancy or postpartum period , there had been no change in the lesion .
Family history for similar conditions was negative .
The woman had the following gynecological and obstetric history : menarche and thelarche beginning at the age of 12 ; gravida 1 , para 1 ; birth of her first child at the age of 20 .
On physical examination , the breasts were symmetrical having no nodes or retractions .
In the plantar region of the patient 's left foot , there was a well - formed nipple was surrounded by areola and hair on the surface , measuring 4.0 cm in diameter , with no palpable nodes ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) .
The remaining physical examination was normal , including the mammary line .
Results of the following laboratory tests were normal : complete blood count , fasting serum glucose level , urine exam , electrolytes , serum urea and creatinine .
No alterations were found during ultrasound of the lesion and urinary tract .

Figure 2 .
Close - up of supernumerary nipple surrounded by an obvious areola on the plantar region of the left foot ( pseudomamma ) .
Hair is observed on the surface .
The patient underwent an incisional biopsy of the lesion .
Histologic findings were squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis , epithelial hyperplasia without atypia , epithelial cytoplasmic vacuolation , and hyperpigmentation of the epidermal basal membrane .
In the dermis there were hair follicles , eccrine glands , and sebaceous glands .
Fibrosis and fat tissue were noted at the base of the lesion .
No glandular tissue was identified .
Discussion
Anomalies associated with breast development are not uncommon .
Supernumerary nipples , and less frequently supernumerary breasts , are present in about 1 - 5 percent of the population [ 1 ] .
Such alterations are more common in women , usually occurring along the embryonic milk line , which extends from the axilla to the groin [ 1 , 2 ] .
Supernumerary breast tissue ( SBT ) is rarely found beyond the mammary line .
However , the back [ 3 ] , shoulder [ 4 ] , face [ 5 ] , and thigh [ 6 ] have been described as sites of SBT development .
When glandular tissue is present , SBT may be affected by the same disease processes that occur in normally positioned breast tissue [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] .
To our knowledge , this is the first report of SBT on the foot .
The classification established by Kajava [ 10 ] is based on the presence or absence of nipple , areola and breast glandular tissue , and is divided into eight categories :
1. Complete breast tissue with glandular tissue , nipple and areola
2. Glandular tissue and nipple
3. Glandular tissue and areola
4. Glandular tissue only
5. Nipple and areola , and fat tissue that replaces the glandular tissue , also known as pseudomamma
6 . Nipple only , also known as polythelia
7. Areola only , also known as polythelia areolaris
8 . Patch of hair only , also known as polythelia pilosa
The current case reported is included in the fifth category , i.e. , presence of nipple and areola but no glandular tissue .
Polythelia and pseudomamma are the two most common forms of SBT [ 11 ] .
The study of SBT merits special attention because of some aspects .
Initially , the patient seeks medical care for cosmetic reasons , expressing desire to have the lesion surgically removed , particularly if it is located in a visible area [ 5 ] .
The presence of glandular tissue in the lesion should be investigated , because SBT is not exempt from the same diseases and physiologic processes that can affect normally positioned breasts , including the cyclical alterations induced by hormone action [ 2 , 9 ] .
Usually , the presence of glandular tissue is suggested after the onset of puberty , first childbirth , or lactation , at times when a woman may complain of an increase in size , pain and discomfort , as well as milk secretion [ 2 ] .
In the current case , the patient was asymptomatic , even after pregnancy , suggesting a lack of glandular tissue .
However , despite the clinical picture , it was necessary to perform a histologic examination to rule out the presence of glandular tissue .
Another aspect that should be kept in mind is the association between SBT and renal malformations [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] .
Some authors describe a close association between both conditions , reporting that patients with SBT should be investigated for the presence of urinary tract malformations [ 13 ] .
However , other authors found no evidence to support such an association , suggesting that routine investigation for renal anomalies is not indicated in patients with supernumerary nipple [ 15 ] .
In the present case , ultrasonography of the urinary tract identified no malformations .
In fact , there is still uncertainty as to the best approach in these patients .
Apart from renal anomalies , other organ system anomalies have been described in association with SBT , including abnormalities of the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems , as well as hematologic disorders [ 12 , 16 , 17 ] .
The limited number of cases makes it difficult to establish these relationships in a clear and definite manner .
Despite the difficulties in establishing relationships between SBT and other diseases , the identification of SBT should draw the attention of the physician to these possible associations and to the occurrence of malignancy , when breast glandular tissue is present .
In cases in which it is clinically impossible to rule out the presence of breast glandular tissue , we believe that a histologic examination of the lesion is required .

Python and friends use an exception to indicate end - of - iteration , which to me crosses past inelegance to plain " hack " .
Many languages have special syntax to support iteration , via both a yield keyword as well as foreach - style looping , and these loops usually end up not supporting some useful but rare special case .
keyword as well as - style looping , and these loops usually end up not supporting some useful but rare special case .
Ruby 's blocks mean that your control flow is inverted -- there 's no way to say in the middle of your loop " in this case , skip the next element " .
preorder :: Tree -> [ Node ]
Typical iteration operations are done with your existing library of list - processing functions .
For example , to print each element in the preorder ( for e in tree. preorder ( ) : print e ) you can use map :
map print ( preorder tree )
What if I want to get a list back instead of an iterator ?
In Python you 'll write code like :
elems = [ ] ; for e in tree.
preorder ( ) : elems.append(e )
in Ruby you 'll do something similar or need to have preorder support either a block or returning an array .
But when your preorder returns a list anyway , this is transparently supported :
elems = preorder tree
What if I want each index as I go ?
This is common enough in Ruby that there 's an each_with_index method , but I always end up wanting a map_with_index and other variants .
With lazy lists , you again can use the existing list - munging functions .
Code like :
zip [ 0 ..] ( preorder tree )
gives you a list ( or equivalently an iterator ) of pairs of ( index , element ) .
For more complicated control flow , like skipping certain elements , you can fall back on referring to the iterator explicitly like you do in C++ or Python : process ( preorder tree ) where process [ ] -> ... process ( x:xs ) -> if x == 3 then do ... ; process ( tail xs ) -- skip one else do ... ; process xs
preorder tree
tree
reverse ( everyOther ( zip [ 0.. ] ( preorder tree ) ) )
I think I 've posted about this before , but lazy lists make a great iterator pattern .
I keep writing code where I wish I could use them .
To be honest , laziness to me always seemed like a sorta unnecessary language feature .
As with every language feature , there are always a couple toy examples floating around where it could be cool , but in general it never seemed like something worth designing a practical language around .
( Haskell was designed around laziness for a bunch of valid and interesting reasons , but Haskell is also intentionally weird . )
But consider an iterator : you need a way to retrieve the current value , a way to advance , and a way to signal you 're done .
And then note how similar that is to a lazy list : you have a cons of the current value and a pointer to the code to advance , and the " done " signal is the end of list .
Other languages have a variety of approaches that always felt inelegant :
To make this concrete , imagine I have some tree datatype that supports a preorder traversal .
With a lazy list , the traversal is a function from trees to lists of nodes :
Here are some compare - and - contrast patterns that I experience in other languages .
Another way of looking at this is that lazy list iterators let you look at different iteration patterns as different views of your data type .
In some sense , means " when viewed in preorder " .
And since these are functions instead of data types , instead of iteration being this concrete step - by - step process you instead can combine different " views " together : for example , you could write an " everyOther " function that pulls out every other element from a list and then use that as just another piece in a chain of iterators .
A reverse iterator over every other element from a tree with the elements numbered in preorder is then just
This also shows what you lose , and what I 've left out of these examples : the control over when the actual iteration code runs .
If , for example , iterating to the next element actually involved a network request , these lazy lists do n't make explicit whether you pay all the processing up - front or if you pay as you go .
( Since in Haskell you do make " when IO happens " explicit , if these examples involved IO they would make this explicit but also would be more complicated than how I 've written them above .
But if they were simply computationally expensive , instead of IO - based , then you basically * can't control it . ) *
You can , but it 's hacky .

So this week in the papers a man was allergic to his own hair , bee colonies were collapsing because of mobile phones , and more .
Speaking as the veteran of a great many squabbles , on MMR , phone masts , drugs , and more , I can tell you : facts are not entirely welcome .
When all the evidence goes against someone ’s beliefs , they will tell you , quite plainly , that they just know it to be true .
They sense it .
They intuit it .
Nobody will ever listen to an explanation of why intuitions can be flawed – presumably because their intuitions have told them not to .
But we have an innate human ability to make something out of nothing .
We see shapes in the clouds and a man in the moon ; gamblers are convinced that they have “ runs of luck ” ; we can take a perfectly cheerful heavy metal record , play it backwards , and hear hidden messages about satan .
Our ability to spot patterns is what allows us to make sense of the world but sometimes , in our eagerness , we can mistakenly spot patterns where none exist .
In science , if you want to appreciate a phenomenon , it is often best to reduce it to its simplest and most controlled form .
There is a prevalent belief among sporting types that sportsmen , like gamblers ( except even more plausibly ) have “ runs of luck ” .
People ascribe this to confidence , “ getting your eye in ” , “ warming up ” , or more , and while it might exist somewhere , statisticians have looked in various places and found no relationship between , say , hitting a home run in one shot , and then hitting a home run in the next .
Because the “ winning streak ” is such a prevalent belief , it is an excellent model for looking at how we perceive random sequences of events , and this was used by a social psychologist called Thomas Gilovich in a classic experiment .
He took basketball fans and showed them a random sequence of X’s and O’s â€ “ telling them that they represented hits and misses in a basketball game â€ “ and then asked them if they thought the sequences demonstrated streak shooting .
Here is a perfectly random sequence of figures from that experiment .
You could think of it as being generated by a coin being flipped ( I can explain why it ’s random if you want but it ’s a bit boring , essentially there is no correlation between one outcome and the next , and the number of adjacent figures with the same outcome â€ “ xx or oo â€ “ is the same as the number of adjacent figures with different outcomes â€ “ xo or ox ) .
Here ’s that random sequence :
OXXXOXXXOXXOOOXOOXXOO
The subjects in the experiment , when shown this entirely random sequence , were convinced that it exemplified “ streak shooting ” , or “ runs of luck ” .
It ’s easy to see why , if you look again : 6 of the first 8 shots were hits .
No , wait : 8 of the first 11 shots were hits .
I agree : no way does that look random .
But it is .
What this ingenious experiment shows is just how bad we are at correctly identifying random sequences .
We are wrong about what they should look like : we expect too much alternation , and to us , even truly random sequences seem somehow too lumpy and ordered .
Why is this important ?
Because it shows that our intuitions about the most basic observation of all , from which all others follow â€ “ our abilities to distinguish an actual pattern , from mere random background noise â€ “ are deeply , deeply flawed .
You cannot sense whether a pill improves intelligence , or cures the common cold , or whether MMR causes autism .
Your tiny , beautiful ingot of human experience in the world does not present you with sufficient information to spot patterns on that scale : it ’s like looking at the ceiling of the Sistine chapel with one eye through a very long cardboard tube .
Intuitions are great shortcuts .
They ’re very valuable for lots of things in the social domain : deciding if your girlfriend is cheating on you , perhaps , or whether a business partner is trustworthy .
But for mathematical issues , or assessing causal relationships , intuitions suffer from inaccuracies , misfires , and oversensitivity .
The challenge , perhaps , is to work out which tools to use where : because trying to be “ scientific ” about your relationship is as stupid as following an intuition about the risks and benefits of a treatment .
Aligning Interest with Capability
Have you ever been to a retail store and seen this sign on the register : “ Your purchase free if you do n’t get a receipt ” ?
You almost certainly did n’t see it in an expensive or high - end store .
You saw it in a convenience store , or a fast - food restaurant .
Or maybe a liquor store .
That sign is a security device , and a clever one at that .
And it illustrates a very important rule about security : it works best when you align interests with capability .
If you ’re a store owner , one of your security worries is employee theft .
Your employees handle cash all day , and dishonest ones will pocket some of it for themselves .
The history of the cash register is mostly a history of preventing this kind of theft .
Early cash registers were just boxes with a bell attached .
The bell rang when an employee opened the box , alerting the store owner — who was presumably elsewhere in the store — that an employee was handling money .
The register tape was an important development in security against employee theft .
Every transaction is recorded in write - only media , in such a way that it ’s impossible to insert or delete transactions .
It ’s an audit trail .
Using that audit trail , the store owner can count the cash in the drawer , and compare the amount with what the register .
Any discrepancies can be docked from the employee ’s paycheck .
If you ’re a dishonest employee , you have to keep transactions off the register .
If someone hands you money for an item and walks out , you can pocket that money without anyone being the wiser .
And , in fact , that ’s how employees steal cash in retail stores .
What can the store owner do ?
He can stand there and watch the employee , of course .
But that ’s not very efficient ; the whole point of having employees is so that the store owner can do other things .
The customer is standing there anyway , but the customer does n’t care one way or another about a receipt .
So here ’s what the employer does : he hires the customer .
By putting up a sign saying “ Your purchase free if you do n’t get a receipt , ” the employer is getting the customer to guard the employee .
The customer makes sure the employee gives him a receipt , and employee theft is reduced accordingly .
There is a general rule in security to align interest with capability .
The customer has the capability of watching the employee ; the sign gives him the interest .
In Beyond Fear I wrote about ATM fraud ; you can see the same mechanism at work :
“ When ATM cardholders in the US complained about phantom withdrawals from their accounts , the courts generally held that the banks had to prove fraud .
Hence , the banks ’ agenda was to improve security and keep fraud low , because they paid the costs of any fraud .
In the UK , the reverse was true :
The courts generally sided with the banks and assumed that any attempts to repudiate withdrawals were cardholder fraud , and the cardholder had to prove otherwise .
This caused the banks to have the opposite agenda ; they did n’t care about improving security , because they were content to blame the problems on the customers and send them to jail for complaining .
The result was that in the US , the banks improved ATM security to forestall additional losses –most of the fraud actually was not the cardholder ’s fault –while in the UK , the banks did nothing . ”
The banks had the capability to improve security .
In the US , they also had the interest .
But in the UK , only the customer had the interest .
It was n’t until the UK courts reversed themselves and aligned interest with capability that ATM security improved .
Computer security is no different .
For years I have argued in favor of software liabilities .
Software vendors are in the best position to improve software security ; they have the capability .
But , unfortunately , they do n’t have much interest .
Features , schedule , and profitability are far more important .
Software liabilities will change that .
They ’ll align interest with capability , and they ’ll improve software security .
One last story …
In Italy , tax fraud used to be a national hobby .
( It may still be ; I do n’t know . )
The government was tired of retail stores not reporting sales and paying taxes , so they passed a law regulating the customers .
Any customer having just purchased an item and stopped within a certain distance of a retail store , has to produce a receipt or they would be fined .
Just as in the “ Your purchase free if you do n’t get a receipt ” story , the law turned the customers into tax inspectors .
They demanded receipts from merchants , which in turn forced the merchants to create a paper audit trail for the purchase and pay the required tax .
This was a great idea , but it did n’t work very well .
Customers , especially tourists , did n’t like to be stopped by police .
People started demanding that the police prove they just purchased the item .
Threatening people with fines if they did n’t guard merchants was n’t as effective an enticement as offering people a reward if they did n’t get a receipt .
Interest must be aligned with capability , but you need to be careful how you generate interest .

Gordon Brown is widely expected to be the next Labour leader
The chancellor told the Fabian Society that some groups were " playing fast and loose " with the union of England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland .
He said the UK was a country " built on shared values " which served as a " model for the rest of the world " .
SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Brown was thinking only of his " self - interest as a prime minister designate " .
Mr Brown , a Scot who is MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath , is expected to take over as prime minister later this year .
Talking to former Labour MP Oona King at the start of the Labour think - tank 's conference , Mr Brown stressed the importance of the country 's shared values .
He cannot tolerate the idea of Scotland slipping out of Labour 's control just at the point he wants to move into No 10
Alex Salmond
Scottish National Party
" It is very important to recognise that Britishness and Britain itself is not based on ethnicity and race , " he said .
" It is founded on shared values that we hold in common : a commitment to liberty for all , a commitment to social responsibility shown by all , and a commitment to fairness to all . "
He said there was now a dividing line in Britain which pitted " those of us who are prepared to support the shared values of the union " against " those who are prepared to play fast and loose with the union and put the whole future of the union at risk " .
English issues
This year is the 300th anniversary of the Act of Union that merged the English and Scottish parliaments .
The pro-independence Scottish National Party is tipped to do well in the Scottish Parliament elections in May , with the independence debate likely to crop up often in the campaign .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The Union had a purpose in 1707 but it does n't now

SNP leader Mr Salmond said the chancellor " could not tolerate the idea of Scotland slipping out of Labour 's control just at the point he wants to move into No 10 " .
" Revealingly , Mr Brown is unable to accept that , under his chancellorship , the Scottish economy has lagged behind both the UK and spectacularly , the small independent countries in Europe . "
The Conservatives have suggested for some time now that it might be better if exclusively English laws were voted on by English MPs alone .
But Mr Brown said the idea of " English votes for English laws " would pull the union apart .
' Faustian bargain '
During a wide - ranging address to the Fabians , Mr Brown pledged support for the idea of raising the school - leaving age to 18 .
And he told delegates that terrorism and security issues could not be solved through military means alone .
Earlier , he had written an article in the Daily Telegraph where he criticised the Conservatives for siding with the nationalists over constitutional issues .
In it he warned : " It is now time for supporters of the union to speak up , to resist any drift towards a Balkanisation of Britain and to acknowledge Great Britain for the success it has been and is . "
He attacked today 's Conservatives for embracing " anti-unionist positions " in collusion with nationalists - contrasting them with Lady Thatcher 's determined support for the union .
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said the chancellor was right to highlight the " Faustian bargain " between the nationalists and the Tories .
" They may have different motives but their actions will jointly lead to the same conclusion - the break - up of the union , " he said .
But shadow Scotland secretary David Mundell said the chancellor was " undermining Britishness with his support for English regionalisation , identity cards and the European constitution . "
Mr Mundell also accused the chancellor of sticking his " head in the sand " over any modernisation of the union .
He told BBC News 24 : " Gordon Brown simply sticks his head in the sand and says the only way to deal with that issue , and that question , is not to ask it . "

En Xataka tenemos una pequeña exclusiva .
Se trata de unas imágenes e información del último prototipo que RIM está mostrando a muy pocas personas en el mundo y de las que han llegado apenas un par de unidades a España .
Las instantáneas nos la ha mandado un amable lector de Xataka al que estamos muy agradecidos .
El nuevo dispositivo Blackberry , con nombre en clave Daytona y posible denominación como 8300 , presenta unas cuantas novedades : por fin parece que va a ser un dispositivo WiFi no capado , y regresa con una cámara de 2 megapíxeles y flash LED que en las pruebas se ha reflejado como buena , con la posibilidad de funcionar a pantalla completa , manejando el zoom con la perla , que cómo no , es el eje sobre el que gira el resto de elementos de este terminal .
Además , el GPS también irá incluído .
El prototipo , que RIM sacó hace apenas una semana , ya se encuentra de pruebas en España , y podría llegar a nuestro país a partir de Mayo o junio , previsiblemente con la operadora Vodafone , que suele ser la encargada de introducir los terminales de RIM en España .
En el tema de software , las novedades son casi todas para el reproductor multimedia , con un catalogador avanzado y un reproductor muy mejorado , del tipo Media Center de los ordenadores .
Además , la calidad de audio con el altavoz es impresionante .
Esperemos que este rumor se confirme finalmente .

Here 's a collection of the Top 15 Funniest Unintentionally Funny Comic Book Panels of All Time .
Comics are great because as they get older not only do they get more valuable ( at least my future children hope so because they ain't going to no college unless a certain Mr. Spiderman can afford to send them ) but they also get funnier .
Thank god our use of language changes over the years because it makes our old comics look stupid and that 's funny .
15 . Joker 's Boner
I think most of the comic goes on like this .
That 's all the Joker ever talks about , really .
14 . Rod ! Rod !
Rod !
I can't tell if she 's hoping for it or is suddenly surprised by it .
13 . Archie Beats off
How convenient that the water comes up to their waists .
12 . Shut up , Sue
This one really is n't too unusual for early Fantastic Four comics .
Sue really did n't know her place back then .
11 . Spider -spunk
Aunt May should know better than to snoop around a teenage boy 's room .
10 . Wonder Woman 's eye - lash emergency
God , women can be so vain .
9. Captain America , wanker
This one 's for our Cockney audience .
8. Butt - stroked ?
No idea what this is from or what butt - stroking means to this guy but it 's funny that this is n't the first time it 's happened to him .
7. Barry Arren , Frash
It 's one thing to have a character that 's an insensitive stereotype , but did the editor really have to get in on it too ?
6. Robin takes off his panties
I 'm sure this little perv does this all the time .
I mean look at who his role model is .
5. Dr. Doom and Crazy Black Man
Most likely this one actually intended to be funny but was it meant to be a story that showed how it 's hard for a pimp working with a Dr. Doom tranny ?
4. Wonder Woman - just like a woman only smart
Well you really can't say this guy is a mysoginist .
He 's totally got respect for Wonder Woman so that 's pretty progressive of him .
3 . Hope she has a safe word
It 's hard to believe this one is real and that any version of Batman in the last 60 something years would sound natural saying this .
But there it is .
2. Lois ' morning after
Robots just do n't quit unless you let them go around back .
Lois learned the hard way .
1. Oh , Batman .
You did n't .
This is my all - time favorite .
That Batman has really got problems .
A father 's attempts to abduct his infant son from a North Carolina hospital last week were foiled by an electronic bracelet around the baby 's ankle .
Walter Mitchell was apprehended by hospital security guards outside Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte after his flight with his newborn son in a cloth bag triggered a " code pink " alert .
The alert prompted hospital staff to guard exits of the hospital .
Although Mitchell made it from the hospital 's seventh - floor nursery onto the street via an emergency exit he was quickly apprehended by guards .
The baby was returned unharmed to Presbyterian Hospital , where it was attending a check - up .
The baby was already under the care of social services after his parents , Mitchell and Juanita Slade , were charged with child abuse and neglect charges involving the alleged mistreatment of their other kids .
Mitchell told police he snatched his newborn because he did n't want to surrender the custody of another child to social services , WSOC - TV reports .
Both Mitchell and Slade have been remanded in custody following the alleged abduction last Friday ( 15 July ) .
Presbyterian Hospital installed the " Hugs " Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) infant protection system when it opened its new maternity center last September .
The " Hugs " Infant Protection System , part of the June 2005 acquisition of Instantel by VeriChip , which is best known for its controversial people chipping technology , contains a tiny radio transmitter designed to prevent infants from being removed from a health care facility without authorisation .
Every infant wears a Hugs tag on the ankle or wrist , and exit points throughout the hospital are electronically monitored to detect unauthorised removal of an infant .
The use of electronic bracelets to protect kids in maternity wards is commonplace in the US .
RFID - tags represent a refinement of the technique .
According to VeriChip , there have been 233 infant abductions in the US over the last 22 years .
Half of these abductions occurred from health care facilities .
VeriChip 's RFID infant protection systems are designed to combat not only infant abductions , but also accidental infant mismatchings .
The firm says its systems are installed in approximately 900 US hospitals . ®

No , it is not directly related to personal finance , but since when is everything I do related to money ?
But it can play a big role in your piece of mind and lifestyle , which can directly affect your financial well - being .
When you live an organized and clutter - free life , things are just …easier .
You know where to find stuff , you know when the last time your cars oil was changed , you know where your wallet is .
It saves time , money and headaches that otherwise can make your life miserable .
I have always been a neat freak .
Ever since I was a little kid , I was very clean and organized .
My room was sometimes the most organized and neat room in the entire house and I did it all myself .
As I got older , it was almost as if I had OCD … in fact , some of my friends think that I do now .
Even I think about it sometimes , but since I do not have a need for alphabetizing the kitchen cabinets , I am guessing that I do n’t have it .
Usually , once a month I go through the house looking for stuff to get rid of .
It is amazing what you find that somehow you missed the last time you went looking .
Either it was not ready to go last time or you just plain missed it .
But it never fails ; I always find something to get rid of , whether it be clothing , old candles , boxes from stuff we had delivered , unused gifts that will remain unused .
It is a never ending battle .
The funny part is that my mom is the exact opposite in that she loves her stuff , and it is difficult for me to be at her house without trying to “ fix ” it .
Her sister is the same , as was her mom .
But I got my “ OCD ” from the other side of the family , where everyone is clean and neat and orderly .
We own a label maker … who the hell has these things ?
It can be a problem , especially when people come visit and they think that no one lives in our house .
But we like it that way .
Being clutter free and neat clears my head for more important endeavors other than worrying about where my car keys are ; I already know where they are .
I know that we have enough toilet paper to last us X amount of days , and I know we have enough dish soap to last until two weeks from now .
That way , I can be much more effective at my “ day ” job and can work longer and harder at my side projects , such as my two blogs , my new company I am trying to start ( slowly ) , and studying our financials to see where I can make some adjustments in order to increase our earnings and investments .
They key is to be diligent in your tidiness … and here is how you can start :
1 . Be a thrower - awayer .
( Is that a word ?
I think not )
If you have not used something in a few months , you probably do not need it .
I am not talking about your pizza cutter because you have not had pizza in two months , but rather I am talking about clothes , old sporting equipment , back massagers , whatever .
Having used and tired candles is of no use to anyone , clear them out and keep only the good ones .
Year old rice in the back of the cabinet is probably bad , and a new bag runs about $ 1.50 .
Throw it away .
2 . Do the above on a constant basis .
Stick to a schedule , even if it is only once every two months .
Put it on your calendar if you need to , but it is important to always go back and look again once in a while .
3 . Have a system .
For your keys , designate a place you put them every day .
We have a little guy screwed to the wall ( that sounds funny , no ? ) that holds our keys , including our car , house , the storage room , the laundry room , etc .
No one ever has to go looking for a key , because they are all right there .
For your financial and life documents , invest in a file cabinet and file paperwork the minute you are done with it .
A lot of people are using the Getting Things Done program , and although I find it overkill for my needs , you might get a lot out of it and should check it out .
Until you deal with said paperwork , have an inbox on your desk that can hold everything you need to deal with in the immediate future , that way you will not forget to do it .
4 . Sell or give away your movies and CDs that you do not watch or listen to anymore .
I have touched on this before , but how many people are still seeing their old VHS copy of Point Break ?
You planning on watching it again ?
Did not think so .
Utilize sites like Freecycle to give things away or Craigslist and Half.com to sell the stuff that has some value left in it .
5. File File File .
No I am not talking about your paperwork , I am talking about articles from newspapers and magazines you want to save and even the rest of your CD collection .
When we see something in a magazine we want to save , such as a recipe or information on a vacation spot , we cut it out and put it in the blue binder in the kitchen cabinet .
Each page has its own clear file folder , and things are categorized in the book so we can find them later .
About 2 years ago I took all the CDs and DVDs we wanted to keep , recycled the plastic jewel cases , and put them all in black binders that sit in our bookcase .
It takes up much less room that way and makes your space feel bigger .
Go ahead , try it , I am sure you will be happy with the change .
The above 5 things are ways you can start today with decluttering your life .
Your mental health will be better , your relaxation time will be nicer because you are not worried about anything , and your financial life will benefit because you know bills are paid and how much is in your accounts .
When I went to my moms house in February , I was surprised ( not really though ) to find two old computers sitting in the downstairs living room … from 2 years ago !
They did not even work !
So my brother took them to be recycled and destroyed .
It is amazing how much clutter we all carry around without realizing the affect it can be having on our daily life .
Get rid of it !

Hubble celebrates its 17th anniversary and gives the world a big present — a 29,566 x 14,321 pixel image ( 500 MB TIFF image ) of the Carina Nebula * .
For those who do n't feel like downloading the entire TIFF image , there is a JPEG available for download from the same site ; however , it is still nearly 250 MB in size .
If you click on the image shown here in the NI article , you get a much more download - friendly version of the spectacular image .
The Carina Nebula is located a mere 7,500 light years away in the southern constellation Carina , the keel of the old southern constellation Argo Navis .
The Carina Nebula is a stunning view of a birthplace of new stars , there are more than a dozen stars present in the nebula that are estimated to have a mass of greater than 50 to 100 times the mass of the Sun .
The unreal landscape began its formation around 3 million years ago when the first stars in the nebula ignited amid a cloud of molecular hydrogen .
The radiation that these stars gave off etched away the matter that started out in the nebula .
The remaining globs of matter are those that have resisted being destroyed by the intense photoionization .
New stars are being formed thanks to the violent stellar wind and intense radiation compressing the surrounding wall of cold molecular hydrogen .
It is believed that our own solar system began in a similar cosmic blast furnace .
This image shows that Hubble can still offer an unparalleled view into the outer workings of the universe around us .
As our astute NI readers know , the colors are added later , for the interested , the image was taken in the light of ionized hydrogen .
Color was later added by the Cerro Tololo Inter - American Observatory in Chile ; red corresponds to sulfur , green to hydrogen , and blue to oxygen emission .
Hopefully this image shows just how much can still be learned from a " old " piece of equipment , which is sadly destined to end up as space junk in the not so distant future .

Nation to join EU in pension project
By Li Jing ( China Daily )
Updated : 2005-09-07 05:37
In the face of increasing internal migration , China will join with the European Union in a pilot " mobile pension " project early next year , an EU commissioner said yesterday in Beijing .
The 40 - million - euro ( US$ 50 million ) project is the first co-operation in social security between China and the 25 - member EU under a Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) signed on Monday at the 8th China - EU summit .
Vladimir Spidla , EU commissioner for Employment , Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities , said that the project calls for a team of experts from the EU to provide assistance and know - how in implementing mobile pensions , which are aimed at ensuring that migrants get their pensions wherever they are .
" This memorandum is a good start and provides mutual learning opportunities for both sides , " said Spidla , a former prime minister of the Czech Republic .
" China is a rapidly emerging economy and major player in international trade .
It is time for a policy dialogue between the EU and China on employment and social affairs issues . "
Spidla said the EU encourages free labourer movement and has gained some experience in how to guarantee that migrants get social welfare .
" For instance , a Czech person lived and worked in his mother country , Germany and France in his first 60 years , and now is spending his later years in Spain .

The full extent and irreversibility of the damage to our country wrought by the Bush administration will likely not be known until well after George Bush finally disappears from our political life .
But understanding the dynamics and impulses of the movement which have enabled these abuses is a critically important task , and that is the project undertaken by John Dean 's new best - selling book , Conservatives Without Conscience ( selected excerpt is here ) .
Fortuitously for Dean , this examination of what has become the so - called " conservative " movement ( composed of Bush followers , neoconservatives and hard - core religious conservatives ) comes at the perfect time .
With 2 1/ 2 years still left for this administration , the true radicalism of the administration and its followers has becoming unavoidably , depressingly clear , and it is equally clear that this movement has not reached anywhere near the peak of its extremism .
Dean 's central thesis explains why that is so .
Dean contends , and amply documents , that the " conservative " movement has become , at its core , an authoritarian movement composed of those with a psychological and emotional need to follow a strong authority figure which provides them a sense of moral clarity and a feeling of individual power , the absence of which creates fear and insecurity in the individuals who crave it .
By definition , its followers ' devotion to authority and the movement 's own power is supreme , thereby overriding the consciences of its individual members and removing any intellectual and moral limits on what will be justified in defense of their movement .
Dean relies on substantial social science data to illustrate the personality type that seeks out authoritarian movements .
But his case is made much more persuasively by what one can visibly see unfolding before one 's own eyes .
As Iraq collapses into all - out civil war and new , tragic levels of violence , Bush supporters continue to insist that things are going well there and our invasion was a success .
As the Middle East spirals into all - out regional war , Bush supporters insist that this repulsive violence is actually good for the region -- wars are encouraging " birth pangs " on the road to progress , as the Secretary of State put it yesterday -- and they are now actively involving the U.S. in this escalated conflict , even while Iraq rapidly falls apart .
And there is seemingly no limit -- literally -- on the willingness , even eagerness , of Bush supporters to defend and justify even the most morally repugnant abuses -- from constantly expanding spying on American citizens , to a President who claims and aggressively exercises the " right " to break the law , to torturing suspects , imprisoning journalists , and turning the United States into the most feared and hated country on the planet .
And as radical as the administration has become , it is clear that the administration has not even come close to reaching the level of extremism which would be necessary for its supporters to object -- if such a limit exists at all .
If anything , on those exceedingly few occasions over six years when his followers have dissented from the Presidents 's decisions -- illegal immigration , Harriet Miers , Dubai ports -- it has been not because the administration was too radical , extremist , militaristic and uncompromising -- but insufficiently so .
Bush supporters want more spying , much more aggressive actions against investigative journalists and even domestic political opposition , more death and violence brought to the Middle East , more wars , and still fewer restraints on the President 's powers , to the extent there are any real limits left .
To them , the Bush administration has not been nearly as extremist and aggressive as it ought to be in dealing with the Enemies .
And that is to say nothing of the measures that would be urged , and almost certainly imposed , in the event of another terrorist attack on U.S. soil or in the increasingly likely event that our limited war in Iraq expands into the Epic War of Civilizations which so many of them crave .
Ultimately , as Dean convincingly demonstrates , the characteristic which defines the Bush movement , the glue which binds it together and enables and fuels all of the abuses , is the vicious , limitless methods used to attack and demonize the " Enemy , " which encompasses anyone -- foreign or domestic -- threatening to their movement .
What defines and motivates this movement are not any political ideas or strategic objectives , but instead , it is the bloodthirsty , ritualistic attacks on the Enemy de jour -- the Terrorist , the Communist , the Illegal Immigrant , the Secularist , and most of all , the " Liberal . "
What excites , enlivens , and drives Bush followers is the identification of the Enemy followed by swarming , rabid attacks on it .
It is a movement that defines itself not by identifiable ideas but by that which it is not .
Its foreign policy objectives are identifiable by one overriding goal -- destroy and kill the Enemy , potential or suspected enemies , and everyone nearby .
And it increasingly views its domestic goals through the same lens .
It is a movement in a permanent state of war , which views all matters , foreign and domestic , only in terms of this permanent war .
Supreme Court justices who rule against the President on national security matters are tyrants , traitors and pro-terrorist .
Journalists who uncover legally dubious government conduct carried out in secret are criminals who should be imprisoned for life or hanged .
Virtually every political opponent of the administration's of any significance -- Howard Dean , Al Gore , John Kerry , the Clintons -- is relentlessly branded as a liar , mentally unstable , corrupt , seditious , and sympathetic to the Enemy .
And even those who devoted much of their adult lives to military service to their country ( often in ways far more courageous and impressive than most Bush supporters ) , or even those who have been longtime Republicans and conservatives , have their characters relentlessly smeared and motives and integrity impugned as soon as they criticize the administration in any way that could embarrass the President -- Richard Clarke , Paul O'Neill , the war critic Generals , Joe Wilson , Scott Ritter , Wesley Clark , John Murtha , John Paul Stevens , and on and on and on .
It is a movement devoted to the destruction of its enemies wherever they might be found .
And it finds new ones , in every corner and seemingly on a daily basis , because it must .
That is the food which sustains it .
* * * * *
In many ways , John Dean is the ideal person to examine this dynamic because he has seen and experienced both sides of it up close and personal .
Attracted to the political conservatism of Barry Goldwater , Dean joined the Nixon administration and , at the age of 32 , became Nixon 's aggressive White House counsel , deeply involved in helping to perpetrate many of the Watergate abuses .
Morton Halperin , who was a standing member of Nixon 's " enemy list , " claimed in an Op - Ed in Friday 's Los Angeles Times that Dean authored a 1971 memo setting forth a plan to " use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies . "
But in 1973 , Dean became the first high - level Nixon official to turn against the administration , famously testifying before the Senate Watergate Committee that the President ( as well as Dean himself ) was personally involved in the Watergate cover - up .
As a result of his refusal to copy the example of blindly loyal authoritarian followers such as G. Gordon Liddy and Charles Colson -- who lied and covered - up for their leader -- Dean became one of the most hated enemies of Nixon followers , a hatred which , he later discovered , would make him the target of the right - wing authoritarian tactics which he previously wielded against Nixon 's enemies .
In 1991 , as Dean recounts at length , he learned that 60 Minutes and Time Magazine were preparing to feature a new book , entitled Silent Coup , which claimed that Dean himself was the one who ordered the Watergate break - in .
The book alleged that Dean 's motive was that his wife , Maureen , had a connection to a Washington , DC call - girl operation and thus had knowledge of various sex scandals involving Democrats , and Dean sought to obtain documentation to use against them .
The very idea that Dean himself had ordered the Watergate break - in because of his wife 's connection to a call - girl service , and that these secrets were somehow kept for 20 years , was completely absurd on its face .
And once Dean vehemently denied these allegations , both 60 Minutes and Time investigated the claims and both decided not to run the story -- a noble decision which , in Time 's case , led to the loss of the $ 50,000 it had paid for the rights to run an excerpt of the book .
But using right - wing smear techniques which , back then , were still new , but which are now a staple of the " conservative " movement , these patently false allegations against Dean were aggressively promoted by right - wing ideologues and then accepted and given great attention by the mainstream media .
The book 's publishers enlisted both right - wing follower G. Gordon Liddy and by - then - born - again Christian activist Charles Colson -- both of whom still hated Dean for his blasphemy in testifying truthfully against the President -- to promote the book and push its allegations against Dean .
More and more right - wing groups and personalities jumped on board this smear campaign , until it received full - fledged support from mainstream right - wing media personalities .
That , in turn , induced many mainstream media programs -- from Good Morning America to CNN 's Larry King Live -- to invite the authors on to discuss the book .
Out of this now all - too - familiar process , this defamatory book ended up on the New York Times ' Best Seller List .
As Dean recounts :
Despite most of the news media ’s fitting dismissal of Silent Coup ’s baseless claims , the protracted litigation provided time for the book to gather a following , including an almost cultlike collection of highprofile right - wingers .
Among them , for example , is Monica Crowley , a former aide to Richard Nixon after his presidency , and now a conservative personality on MSNBC , cohosting Connected : Coast to Coast with Ron Reagan .
Other prominent media - based conservatives who have joined the glee club are James Rosen and Brit Hume of Fox News .
How these seemingly intelligent people embraced this false account mystified me , and I wanted to know .
. . .
As for Colson , his reason for promotion of Silent Coup remained a complete mystery for me , as did the motives of people like Monica Crowley , James Rosen , Brit Hume , and all the other hard - core conservatives who embraced this spurious history and made it a best seller .
The only thing I could see that these people had in common was their conservatism .
First
Second
Given the rather distinct beliefs of the various conservative factions , which have only grown more complex with time , how have conservatives succeeded in coalescing as a political force ?
The simple answer is through the power of negative thinking , and specifically , the ability to find common enemies .
. . .
Important conservative opinion journals , like the National Review and Human Events , see the world as bipolar : conservative versus liberal .
Right - wing talk radio could not survive without its endless bloviating about the horrors of liberalism .
Trashing liberals is nothing short of a cottage industry for conservative authors .
. . .
The exaggerated hostility also apparently satisfies a psychological need for antagonism toward the “ out group , ” reinforces the self - esteem of the conservative base , and increases solidarity within the ranks .
The heart of [ New York University Professor John ]
Jost and his collaborators ’ findings was that people become or remain political conservatives because they have a “ heightened psychological need to manage uncertainty and threat . ”
More specifically , the study established that the various psychological factors associated with political conservatives included ( and here I am paraphrasing ) fear , intolerance of ambiguity , need for certainty or structure in life , overreaction to threats , and a disposition to dominate others .
This data was collected from conservatives willing to explain their beliefs and have their related psychological dynamics studied through various objective testing techniques .
These characteristics , Dr. Jost said , typically cannot be ascribed to liberals .
When " a person acting under authority performs actions that seem to violate his standards of conscience , it would not be true to say that he loses his moral sense , " Milgram concluded .
Rather , that person simply places his moral views aside .
His " moral concern shifts to a consideration of how well he is living up to the expectations of the authority figure . "
UPDATE
That is how the " conservative " movement works to this day , although its methods have become even more efficient and less scrupulous .
Petty allegations and character attacks begin percolating in the smear sewers of the right wing -- through insinuations by talk - radio dirt - mongerers like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity , speculation by Matt Drudge , smear campaigns by shadowy groups and organizations , and now by attention - desperate and glory - seeking right - wing blogs .
From there , the attacks are reported by the right - wing media and then fed into the mainstream media .
A lynch mob is created which seeks not the truth of what happened , but the destruction of the movement 's enemies .
" Conservative " rank - and - file , confining themselves to an echo chamber , embrace the allegations instinctively , because they are made by the movement 's defenders against the movement 's enemies .
And their allegiance to their movement and a desire to destroy their opponents overrides any concern for proportionality or truth .
As Dean documents , it is what the contemporary , so - called " conservative " movement feeds on more than anything else -- a limitless and bloodthirsty attack on the character of its opponents and enemies .* * * * * Dean advances and then amply documents ( both with his own analysis and social science data , the former being far more persuasive than the latter ) what I consider to be the book 's two central points : , that what is currently described as the " conservative movement " bears virtually no resemblance to Goldwater 's conservatism , and has nothing to do with restraining government power or preserving historical values .
Instead , it has transformed into an authoritarian movement which largely attracts personality types characterized by a desire and need to submit to and follow authority . , because those who submit to authority necessarily relinquish their own conscience ( in favor of serving the conscience of their leader and / or their movement ) , those who are part of this movement are capable of acts which a healthy and normal conscience ought to preclude .
They can use torture , break laws , wage unnecessary wars based on false pretenses , and attempt to destroy the reputation of plainly patriotic and honest Americans -- provided that they are convinced that doing so advances the interests of the authority they serve and the movement of which they are a part .
The central premise of Dean 's argument is that the current " conservative " movement shares none of the core principles of the political conservatism which attracted Dean to its movement -- those espoused by Dean 's longtime friend , Barry Goldwater ( whose 1960 book , The Conscience of a Conservative , is the source for Dean 's title ) .
That the Bush movement bears no resemblance to traditional conservatism is a view shared by scores of the country 's most prominent conservatives , such as Pat Buchanan and increasingly George Will .
The Father of Modern Conservatism , Bill Buckely , just yesterday pronounced that Bush 's " singular problem " is " the absence of effective conservative ideology . "
And before his death , Barry Goldwater himself frequently accused the religious right of assaulting core conservative principles .
Relatedly , Dean documents that the " conservative " movement is composed of various factions who actually share very little in common in the way of political beliefs and could not come close to agreeing on a core set of political principles and ideals which define their movement .
In the absence of a set of core , shared beliefs , what , then , binds them and maintains their allegiance to this political movement ?
The answer Dean provides is the shared hatred of common enemies .
And their collective attacks on those enemies have become the consevative movement 's defining attribute .
And that is sufficient to maintain allegiance because , argues Dean , what Bush followers crave more than anything else is submission to a powerful authority as a means of alleviating their fears of ambiguity , uncertainty and complexity -- the same attributes which are common to all followers of authoritarian movements on both the right and the left :
A healthy skepticism is warranted with regard to the ability of social science data to reveal truths about political movements .
But ultimately , the ability of that data to persuade is dependent upon the extent to which it comports with one 's own observations .
And when Dean cites and applies the conclusions of the famous study by Stanley Milgram , in which subject participants administered what seemed to be excruciatingly painful electric shock because they were instructed by authority figures in white coats to do so , its applicability to the Bush movement becomes self - evident :
The Bush administration 's ability to engage in extraordinary and radical behavior has not occurred in a vacuum .
The administration is radical and can act seemingly without limits because its supporters and followers are radical and limitless in their allegiance to its abuses .
Understanding the disturbing and dangerous human dynamic which fuels that movement is critical to understanding the movement itself , and ultimately , to defeating it .
Dean 's book is a uniquely valuable tool for understanding what the so - called " conservative " movement has become . :
It is difficult to select a 1,000 word excerpt from the book , as most of Dean 's arguments are lengthier and can't be contained within that limit , but I 've selected a somewhat representative sample from a different part of the book than that which is highlighted in the review .
The excerpt is here
The concert grand strikes a note of discord as it takes a tumble
In pictures
The piano was being brought to the home of John and Penny Adie , the organisers of the Two Moors Festival , an annual music event on Dartmoor and Exmoor .
But disaster struck when it toppled over and fell 2.5 m ( 8.2 ft ) before landing on a bank , causing extensive damage to the instrument .
Removals firm G&R declined to comment on the incident .
The moments before and after the fall were captured on camera by Mrs Adie , 54 , who was hoping to record a highpoint for the festival .
But joy turned to horror as she recorded how the piano toppled onto a bank .
It is unlikely ever to come back to us
John Adie
" The piano weighs half a tonne , has 10,000 moving parts and has fallen 2.5 m onto the ground .
" How the hell do you guarantee that it will work again ? "
The festival had been raising funds for two years to buy the piano at auction in London earlier this year .
It was to go into a concert hall at the Adies ' home at Barkham , near South Molton , as a centrepiece for the upcoming spring festival .
' Simply irreplaceable '
The piano is now back in London where it is waiting for an independent assessment of the damage .
The piano was insured , but only for the £ 26,000 they paid for it at auction in London rather than its likely replacement value of £ 45,000 .
Mr Adie said : " Bosendorfers are like the Stradivarius of the piano world .
" It 's more than money that is the issue here .
They are simply irreplaceable . "
Bosendorfers are made in Austria and are the piano of choice for many of the world 's leading pianists .
Mr and Mrs Adie set up the Two Moors Festival in 2001 to help the area recover from the foot and mouth crisis .
The two - year long campaign to raise the cash for the piano was spearheaded by Sophie , Countess of Wessex , who is the event 's patron .
A spokesman for removals firm G&R said : " The matter is in the hands of the insurers .
We have no further comment to make . "
A Time Capsule that will survive One Thousand Years in Manhattan
Submitted by Jaron Lanier , with the collaboration of David Sulzer and Lisa Haney
May 3 , 1999
Summary :
An archive of the New York Times Magazine and other materials will be encoded into the DNA of cockroaches which will be released in Manhattan .
Method :
The familiar New York City cockroach predates the citys geography .
It has survived ice ages , earthquakes , famines , and floods .
It has watched the dinosaurs come and go .
It has resisted determined efforts by mankind to remove it even from individual buildings .
It would survive a nuclear attack .
It will probably outlive all other contemporary fauna on Manhattan , including humans .
Some of the cockroachs genes are extremely stable .
They have not changed substantially for millions of years , and are therefore extremely likely to remain stable for the next one thousand years .
Associated with these genes are DNA sequences known as introns which serve no known purpose .
While it is possible that these sequences serve some unidentified function , their content is gibberish .
Recombinant techniques will be used to overwrite this gibberish with the archival materials .
While computer memory is made of bits , which exist in two states ( zero or one ) , DNA is composed of four " base pairs " ; so it has four states .
Therefore a given sequence of DNA can store twice as much information as a similar length of computer memory .
A single cockroachs introns will easily be able to contain the articles , letters , and other primary texts of one full years editions of the Times Magazine .
Certain types of information will be written into mitochondrial DNA sequences , which are inherited matrilinearly and are not subject to sexual recombination , instead of introns .
DNA in this location is not as stable , but will nonetheless remain useful for the required period of time .
Mitochondrial DNA is well suited to data such as digitized photographs , audio recordings , and crossword puzzles .
The continuous nature of photographic and audio materials makes them useful even if there are slight modifications to the data ; indeed even the best preserved photographs are constantly undergoing slight changes which are not perceived by casual observers .
While crossword puzzles are made of discrete information ( text ) , it is presumed that the further in the future the puzzle is decoded , the more advanced the civilization will be ; therefore any errors caused by the passage of time will simply generate an appropriately difficult puzzle .
Once an archive is selected , it will be written into a computer file and coded into DNA base pairs .
The sequences will then be synthesized by conventional protocols .
Then the archival DNA will be ligated into cockroach intron DNA via injection into eggs .
Once the archival roaches are born they will be cultivated until the population achieves at least the specified volume ( 8 cubic feet ) .
The roaches will be released in selected locations in Manhattan .
Further cultivations and releases will follow , carefully calculated to assure that the archive is widespread enough to survive for the specified period of time .
Within approximately fourteen years , the archival roaches will inexorably become so endemic as to become an ubiquitous and permanent feature of the island .
In order to decode the archive , a future historian would make use of Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) to amplify and then sequence the fragments , turning the DNA sequence once again into the contents of a computers memory .
In order to facilitate decoding , the archive will not make use of data compression or encryption technologies .
Justification :
This proposal is not intended as a joke or social commentary .
It is the best technological solution to meet the demands of the constraints presented .
a) The time capsule is to be placed in Manhattan , yet last for 1000 years .
Manhattan is one of the least desirable locations on Earth for archival storage .
It is a likely target for terrorist or military attack during the specified period of time .
Furthermore , Manhattan might very well be subject to political pressures that would cause future residents to make unplanned use of its spaces and other resources .
Even " sacred ground " such as Central Park , might become vulnerable to exploitation because of unforeseen changed in technology and society .
For instance , travel might become restricted and parklands on Manhattan might be needed to produce food .
New forms of transportation , such as spaceports , might become available that require large amounts of space and are demanded in population centers rather than at the peripheries , where contemporary airports are found .
New space might be required to house artificial phases of human life , such as cryogenically preserved bodies or disembodied brains .
Existing residential areas will be needed for conventional human living , so spaces such as Central Park might be drafted into unforeseen service .
The archival cockroach will be a robust repository , able to survive almost all conceivable scenarios .
b ) The requirement that the time capsule survive rising oceans and other ecological catastrophes presents a dilemma .
Suppose a conventional capsule was placed on high , sacred ground , such as the grounds of the cloisters .
As the seas rise , that ground will become ever more needed for habitation and vital services ; it will lose its sacred status in precisely those scenarios in which that status would be most needed .
The archival cockroach occupies the whole of the island and is immune to changing ideologies of land and resource use .
c ) The desire was expressed to have multiple copies of the time capsule , including perhaps one in the basement of the New York Times .
The archival cockroach easily meets this requirement .
d ) The archival cockroach exceeds the materials specifications : it is water tight , impervious to changes in weather , easy to locate , impossible to destroy .
The data will last for well beyond the initial millennium specified .
e ) Because the archival cockroach will exist in so many copies , it will be easy to read the data without altering or destroying the archive .
This is the most attractive aspect of the archival cockroach .
No future historical revisionist will be able to locate and destroy each copy .
Potential problems and solutions to them :
a) Will there be ethical or public safety objections ?
The DNA in which the archival data will be placed is nonfunctional .
The cockroaches will not have an altered biological function .
They will also not be harmed or distressed in any way .
b) Will genetic drift erase the data ?
In order to combat this problem , seven copies of each article will be placed in introns .
This number has been calculated to assure that data will be recoverable even after the most severe genetic drift that might occur within the specified period of 1000 years .
c ) Any single genotype , such as the archival genotype , would be vulnerable to changes in the environment .
This is why biodiversity is important in wild populations .
The initial population of archival roaches will be generated from a wide ranging sample of roaches in residence in New York City ( Periplaneta americana ) .
In this way , pre-archival biodiversity will to some degree be represented in the archival population .
d ) If other cities choose to adopt copycat archival strategies , there is a danger that roaches imbedded with an archive of , say , the Washington Post , would interbreed with carriers of the New York Times archive .
In that case the roaches of Philadelphia would eventually contain a mixed text record .
This is not as great a difficulty as it might seem .
As significant sequence similarity is required for recombination to occur , genetic crossover between Washington Post and New York Times articles is extremely unlikely .
Indeed , if crossover were to occur , an earlier of instance of plagiarism or reprinting would be implicated .
At any rate , as long as each article is stored with its proper reference data , it will be possible for future historians to reconstruct both archives from a sample of roaches .
e ) How will historians know that the material is present ?
The beginning of each archival segment will be comprised of a digital sequence that serves as the " masthead " .
This sequence will spell out " New York Times Magazine Time Capsule , 2000 AD " .
A " Rosetta Stone " graphic will be widely reproduced .
It will contain the masthead base pair sequence represented graphically , along with the letters the base pairs represent , pictures of the mouth positions associated with each letter , and pictorial representations of the cockroach .
This graphic will be published in the magazine , of course , but will also be chiseled into all future city monuments .
It will also be etched in industrial artificial diamond disks the size of CDs .
One thousand of these disks will be hidden in locations in Manhattan .
The team :
Lead designer Jaron Lanier is joined by Dr. David Sulzer , Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry , Columbia University .
Dr. Sulzer will supervise the design , sequencing , and ligation of the archive .
Lisa Haney , technical illustrator , is responsible for presentation graphics as well as the design of the Diamond Disk Rosetta Stone .
Budget :
This project could be completed for the given budget of $ 75,000 at some point in the very near future , as the costs of biotechnology services come down .
In order to complete it before the year 2000 , it will be necessary to accept a significantly higher budget and make use of available tools and services .
Operon Technologies  published charge for creating DNA sequences is 60 cents per base pair , but we are confident we will be able to negotiate a substantial price break due to the quantity we require .
Since four base pairs are required to contain the information of one byte , and one byte is used to represent each letter in the common ASCII format , sequencing will cost $ 2.40 per letter , unless we negotiate a discount .
A selective archive should fit comfortably in a 1000 page book .
Assuming a rate of approximately $ 1 per letter after negotiations , a page of text will be sequenced for approximately $ 1000 .
The archive can therefore be created using existing commercial services for under $ 1,000,000 .
It need only be sequenced once , even though it will be inserted seven times into the cockroach genome in order to achieve redundancy .
The cockroach genome must be mapped .
This might sound daunting , but it must be remembered that the cost of genome mapping is falling rapidly .
The cockroach genome is presumed to be similar in size to that of the grasshopper ; around 10,000 million base pairs , or about three times the size of the human genome .
There are probably about 15,000 cockroach genes with roughly 5 introns per gene .
The cockroach easily has over a billion base pairs in its introns , which will have a capacity to represent over 250 million letters .
That is far in excess of what is needed for the archive , even with the requirement of redundancy .
Plasmids , enzimes , vectors , and microinjection paraphernalia will be needed - totaling approximately $ 126,500 .
Housing and care for the cockroaches and their eggs will be first rate , but will still only cost only a few thousand dollars .
Even though DNA has not been introduced into cockroaches before , the technique is already established for Drosophila flies and some mosquitoes .
A research staff will be established in Manhattan in order to adopt these techniques to cockroaches .
While the initial DNA microinjections will be expensive , costs will fall once the techniques are better understood .
Total budget for staff and physical plant should come in at approximately $ 1,132,000 up until the time of the release of the archive into the environment .
The Diamond Disk Rosetta Stones will cost approximately $ 193 per disk .
This technology is also becoming less expensive at a rapid rate , so it would make sense to wait a few years to fabricate and place the disks .
It must be re-emphasized that , while at todays prices this proposal must be considered as a " conceptual " entry , prices are falling so rapidly that the given budget constraint can be met in the very near future .
It would be entirely reasonable to select and capture the cockroaches at the present time , display them to the public for a few years , and then insert the archive into their eggs once prices have come down to the specified level .

Release 1.0 FAQ
The online documentation is out of date , please refer to this FAQ for problems using 1.0 alpha / beta releases and the latest development head .
Introduction
Elephant is a persistent object database for Common Lisp with full transaction semantics .
A persistent metaprotocol overrides class creation and slot accesses , making slot values automatically persistent .
Objects can be indexed by class and slot value and retrieved via unique - id , map and list operations over slot values and constraint - based queries .
Elephant is split between a common API and several data stores .
Berkeley DB , CLSQL and postmodern interfaces are provided .
Elephant inherits the ACID properties of these stores and all database operations are thread - safe by design .
Elephant is used predominantly in website applications , such as with the weblocks framework .
Elephant runs on SBCL , Allegro , Lispworks , and ClozureCL .
The elephant code base is available under the LLGPL license .
Data stores each come with their own , separate license .
Development work on Elephant been limited since 2009 and support not complete for the latest versions of SBCL and ClozureCL .
It has n't been tested at all with recent Allegro and Lispworks releases .
Key Features
Persistent Objects and Values A persistent metaclass enables CLOS instances to store slot values in the database Stored values can be any lisp object other than functions , closures , and class objects .
Persistent class redefinition is supported with both greedy and lazy update policies Rich slot semantics Persistent classes support slot types with different behaviors :
Persistent -
Slot writes are automatically persist in the database
Indexed - the database maintains an index that maps slot values to instances
Derived index - names an index mapping a function of other slots back to instances .
Transient - reverts to standard CLOS slot behavior
Cached - a persistent slot that can be converted to and from a transient slot for fast access .
Set - valued - an unordered set of values ; insert and delete operations are persistent
Associations - A protocol for maintaining N:1 and N:N relations between two classes
Indexing API
Objects can be retrieved by class , indexed slot values or a range of slot values .
Efficient minimally - consing mapping operators are provided .
Lightweight Persistent Aggregates
The database exports four persistence collection types :
Persistent set - a persistent collection of unique objects with insert , delete , map and find operations .
A Btree - an efficient O ( log n ) key - value data structure with both map and cursor APIs
Duplicate btree - A btree that supports duplicate keys .
Indexed Btree -
An indexed BTree is an extension to the btree that allows additional index trees to be defined that automatically index from some function of a btree value back to that key - value entry .
Transactional Architecture Elephant is a transactional database supporting complete ACID properties for database operations .
Operations on database objects are thread - safe .
The system provides a convenience macro , with - transaction , that bundles multiple database operations into atomic transactions and automatically handles transaction restarts due to contention or deadlock .
Multiple Data Stores
There are currently three different data stores that support the Elephant API : Berkeley DB , Postgresql via the postmodern library , and any database supported by the CLSQL library including SQLite3 .
Transparent migration between store instances .
Automatic deadlock detection
An online mark and sweep garbage collector Berkeley DB transparently supports multiple lisp images on the same machine .
CLSQL and postmodern stores support Elephant persistence across multiple machines and lisp images .
An all - lisp store is planned as an eventual feature at which time the CL - SQL store will be deprecated .
Object Query Language ( Prototype )
Use a simple constraint language to define sets of objects to retrieve or map .
The query planner exploits slot indices when available and performs efficient in - memory set intersections .
Limitations
Elephant is subject to some limitations that you may want to consider .
Functions , closures , and class objects cannot be stored ( although their list forms can be ) .
Perhaps the most frustrating limitation , and the one requiring the most effort to work around is that built - in aggregate objects ( arrays , lists , hash tables ) do not support persistent operations .
Any list that is loaded from a slot or index will result in a freshly consed list .
Elephant addresses many common cases via the persistent aggregate data structures described above .

THE political showdown over a Dubai company 's plan to operate terminals at six American ports briefly focused public attention on one of the most significant , yet least noticed , economic developments of the last few decades : the transformation of international shipping .
Just as the computer revolutionized the flow of information , the shipping container revolutionized the flow of goods .
As generic as the 1's and 0's of computer code , a container can hold just about anything , from coffee beans to cellphone components .
By sharply cutting costs and enhancing reliability , container - based shipping enormously increased the volume of international trade and made complex supply chains possible .
" Low transport costs help make it economically sensible for a factory in China to produce Barbie dolls with Japanese hair , Taiwanese plastics and American colorants , and ship them off to eager girls all over the world , " writes Marc Levinson in the new book " The Box : How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger " ( Princeton University Press ) .
For consumers , this results in lower prices and more variety .
" People now just take it for granted that they have access to an enormous selection of goods from all over the world , " Mr. Levinson said in an interview .
That selection , he said , " was made possible by this technological change . "
From a marketing perspective , there ’s a brilliant new game show on TV called Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader ?
The host , Jeff Foxworthy , asks adults questions from topics covered in grade school .
The adult can rely on a 5th grader for help up to three times .
For example , Foxworthy asked what constellation the Big Dipper is in ( Ursa Major ) .
Another question asked which bone in the human body is the largest ( the femur ) .
All of the 5th graders allegedly knew the answers .
Clearly , our kids are being taught a lot of useless crap .
I try to imagine a situation where I would need to know the name of my largest bone .
I suppose I might someday be in a museum when a pack of wild dogs attacked , and someone would see me standing next to the exhibit of early human skeletons and yell “ Quick , grab a femur and start swinging ! ”
But realistically , I can count on one hand the number of times anyone has asked me to hit a dog with a femur .
During the time that 5th graders are learning how much a leg bone weighs , I have to wonder what useful information they are NOT learning .
I wonder if anyone ever died because the first person to arrive at an accident scene knew the location of the Big Dipper but not CPR .
I ’m thinking it had to happen at least once .
I wonder if 5th graders are taught that attractive people generally do better in their professional lives .
I do n’t mean to be cruel to the kids on that show , but at least one of them has been eating too many cheese sticks while memorizing the names of bones .
It ’s not a good career move .
I ’ll bet that most schools do n’t have a class on how to recognize bullshit when you see it .
What could be a more useful skill than that ?
I have to wonder how many people who are able to name all of the past U.S. presidents have shaved their heads and joined cults .
I ’ll bet it ’s a few .
If it were up to me to add some classes to the grade school curriculum , I think I ’d put more emphasis on these skills : public speaking , risk assessment , bullshit detecting , social skills , decision - making , managing your own body , and influencing people .
And CPR .
In case I ever need a 5th grader to revive me .

Control Room : Norah -- we just got statement from ABC that we have been waiting for .
I 'll read it right now --" The Path to 9/11 ″ is not a documentary of the events leading up to 9/11 .
It is a dramatization , drawn from a variety of sources including the 9/11 Commission Report , other published materials , and personal interviews .
As such -- for dramatic and narrative purposes , the movie contains fictionalized scenes --- composite and representative characters and dialogue -- and time compression .
No one has seen the final version of the film -- because the editing process is not yet complete , so criticisms of film specifics are premature and irresponsible .
The attacks of 9/11 were a pivotal moment in our history -- and it is fitting that the debate about the events related to the attacks continue .
However , we hope viewers will watch the entire broadcast of the finished film before forming an opinion about it " -- So bottom line they 've just released a statement about it .
They 're not going to change this movie at all ...
It 's difficult to know what 's in the film since they only sent it to right wingers .
I wonder why they refuse to let us see it ?

特殊なキーの名称の由来の多くは、タイプライター時代の名残りです。Shiftは「ずらす」という意味です。タイプライターの一つひとつのアームには、アルファベットの大文字と小文字の両方が刻まれています。通常の入力では小文字が印字され、Shiftキーを押しながら入力すると、アームが持ち上がって大文字が印字されます。
矢沢久雄の『キーボードが複雑怪奇な理由』(日経パソコン , No.504 ( 2006年4月24日 ) , p.165 ) を読んだが、 19世紀のタイプライター を全く調査していないらしく、間違いだらけの内容だった。特に、タイプライターのシフト機構に関する以下のくだりは、間違いにしてもあまりにもヒドイ。
機械式タイプライターでは 、Shiftキーが持ち上げるのはプラテン(紙を巻きつけるローラー)の方だ。アームが持ち上がったりはしない。しかも、「持ち上げる」のなら「 Shift」ではなく「 Lift」だ。この記事では、大文字小文字の切り替え動作が、なぜ「Lift」ではなく「 Shift」になったのか、全く説明できていない。
実は 『Remington No.2』( 1878年発売)では、大文字小文字の切り替え機構は、プラテンの前後移動によって実現されていた。upstrike式タイプライターでは、印字点がプラテンの下面にあるので、プラテンを手前にずらすやり方が自然だったのだ。それゆえ「ずらす」意味の「
Shift」が、機構そのものの名称になったわけである。一方、『Underwood No.1』( 1895年発売)では、大文字小文字の切り替え機構は、プラテンの上下移動によって実現された。frontstrike式タイプライターでは、印字点がプラテンの前面にあるので、プラテンを持ち上げるやり方が自然だったのだ。しかし、「Shift」という用語そのものは17年間で既に定着してしまっていたため、プラテンを「持ち上げる」にもかかわらず「
Shift」と呼ばれ続けることになった。20世紀の機械式タイプライターは基本的に『Underwood No.1』の末裔であり、プラテンを持ち上げることを「Shift」と呼ぶのはこのためである。
ちなみにこの記事は、タイプライターの「アーム」に非常に執着しており
キーボードのアルファベットの配置は、驚くなかれ、わざとバラバラにしてあるのです。その理由もタイプライター時代の名残りです。機械式のタイプライターを使ったことがある人は経験があると思いますが、キーを連打するとアーム同士がからまることがあります。これを解決するために、連続して打つことの多いキーは、わざとバラバラに離してからみにくいようにしてあるのです。
などと平気で書いている。19世紀のタイプライターにも書いたとおり、『Daugherty Visible 』( 1893年発売)より以前のタイプライターは、「アーム」などという機構を有さない。したがって、アームの絡まり云々を、QWERTY配列の成立( 1882年頃)に関して論じるのは、全くナンセンスである。
Colombia 's Energy Drink Putting the Coca Back in Cola
Coca products were taboo for a long time in Colombia .
Now Colombians can purchase coca wine , coca tea and coca cookies .
The newest product is called Coca - Sek , an energy drink that is fast developing an international reputation -- much to the irritation of the Coca Cola company .

FEW will celebrate the fourth anniversary of America 's invasion of Iraq on Tuesday March 20th .
It was supposed to serve as an example of how to build democracy in the Middle East , but turned into a model for how to wreck a country .
It was meant to give warning to rogue regimes and instead strengthened radical states such as Syria and Iran .
It was intended to confront Islamist extremism at its source , but intensified the appeal of global jihad .
It was planned as a demonstration of America 's global power , but ended up sapping its military might in a debilitating insurgency .
Even the final demise of Saddam Hussein , one of the vilest dictators in the world , went wrong .
He maintained a striking self - composure in the face of sectarian jeering when he went to the gallows in December .
The justifications for the war have collapsed .
The pre-invasion rationale was to rid Saddam of weapons of mass destruction , but none were found .
The post- invasion objective was the promotion of democracy , but this has fed sectarian tensions in Iraq and led to the rise of Islamists elsewhere , such as Hamas in the Palestinian territories .
All that is left is President George Bush 's argument that however grim the situation may appear now , it would be grimmer still if America withdrew and abandoned the country to jihadists .
Could it have been different ?
Perhaps .
American forces invaded Iraq with enough strength to defeat Saddam 's weakened army , but not enough to establish security .
Looting and violence broke out from the moment Saddam 's statue was brought down in view of the world 's cameras , and violence has worsened every year since .
The allies expected to take over a functioning civil service , but discovered the regime had been hollowed out by years of oppression and sanctions .
The disbanding of the army , and the removal of Baath party members , destroyed the remainder of the Iraqi state 's structure and flooded the streets with armed and angry men .
Plans for the political transition to Iraqi rule were mired in confusion .
Resistance to the American presence would probably have emerged , although the errors of the post - Saddam era undoubtedly aggravated the insurgency .
Mr Bush and his entourage dreamed of rolling back dictatorship and extreme Islamism in the same way that Ronald Reagan confronted and defeated communism in Europe .
But the Middle East is different , not least because of Arab resentment of America 's alliance with Israel and the plight of Palestinians .
Mr Bush 's lieutenants should have been forewarned by the Reagan administration 's experience in Lebanon in 1982 .
At the time , American - led multinational forces were perceived to be intervening on the side of the invading Israeli army and became the target for Shia militants , who pioneered the use of suicide car bombs against the American embassy and the marines ' barracks in 1983 .
Mr Bush admits to making “ mistakes ” in Iraq but not to failure .
He rejected the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group that suggested a managed withdrawal and diplomatic engagement with Iran and Syria .
Instead he is redoubling his bet .
He has appointed new commanders and ordered a “ surge ” of nearly 30,000 troops in an effort to stabilise the capital , Baghdad .
American soldiers will now seek to protect the Iraqi population rather than trying just to kill and capture insurgents and terrorists .
They are moving out of their secure bases into joint outposts with Iraqi soldiers and police .
Success , Mr Bush said this week in a televised address , “ will take months , not days or weeks ” .
But the president may be running out of time .
For many in Iraq , the surge is too little , too late .
Most Iraqis have given up on America after four years of occupation and chaos , including the past year of particularly atrocious sectarian violence .
Many have fled to neighbouring countries .
In America , meanwhile , the advocates of “ surge ” worry that domestic support is dissolving .
The war has sapped Mr Bush 's popularity and , with Congress now in Democrat hands , there is political opposition to the surge and growing demands for the troops to be brought home by autumn next year .
The debate is no longer about how to achieve “ victory ” in Iraq , but how to limit America 's losses .
Years of comparisons among the world 's best atomic clocks -- based on different atoms -- have established the most precise limits ever achieved in the laboratory for detecting possible changes in so - called " constants " of nature .
The comparisons at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) may help scientists test the latest theories in physics and develop a more complete understanding of the history of the universe .
Some astronomical and geological studies suggest there might have been very small changes in the values of fundamental constants over billions of years , although the results have been inconsistent and controversial .
If fundamental constants are changing , the present - day rates of change are too small to be measured using conventional methods .
However , a new comparison of NIST 's cesium fountain and mercury ion clocks , scheduled to appear in this week 's issue of Physical Review Letters , * has narrowed the range in which one of them -- the " fine - structure constant " -- possibly could be changing by a factor of 20 .
Widely used in physical theory and experiments , the fine - structure constant , represents the strength of the interaction between electrons and photons .
Astronomers and geologists have attempted to detect changes in natural constants by examining phenomena dating back billions of years .
The NIST experiments attained the same level of precision by comparing the relative drifts in the " ticks " of an experimental mercury ion clock , which operates at optical frequencies , and NIST - F1 , the national standard cesium clock , which operates at lower microwave frequencies .
These data can be plugged into equations to obtain upper limits for possible rates of change of the fine structure constant in recent times .
A second study , based on seven years of comparisons of cesium and hydrogen clocks at NIST and in Europe , ** achieved record limits on Local Position Invariance , the principle that two clocks based on natural frequencies of different atoms should undergo proportional frequency shifts when subjected to the same changes in gravitational field .
The new experiments lowered the upper limit for a possible violation of LPI , by more than 20 times .
Changes in physical constants such as the fine structure constant or the gravitational constant would violate Albert Einstein 's original theory of general relativity .
Such violations are predicted in recent theories aimed at unifying gravitation and quantum mechanics .
NIST scientists now plan an all - optical - frequency comparison of the mercury ion clock with an aluminum ion atomic clock , which could increase measurement precision further , offering a more stringent test of the theoretically predicted changes .
Conducting such tests with many different types of atomic clocks offers the best chance of eliminating extraneous factors to clearly identify which , if any , of the fundamental " constants " are changing over time .

A working paper by Ilan Yaniv says we do listen to others , but we weigh our opinion 70 % and someone else ’s equally qualified opinion 30 % :
Suppose you are responsible for hiring someone to fill a job , and you initially had a strongly favorable opinion about a candidate but are told that a colleague of yours has a lukewarm opinion of the same candidate .
… from your internal point of view , the two opinions are not on a par .
Decision makers place more weight on beliefs for which they have more evidence .
Because decision makers are privy to their own thoughts , but not to the reasons underlying an advisor ’s opinion , they place a higher weight on their own opinion than on an advisor’s .
Indeed , studies show that other things being equal , people discount others ’ opinions and prefer their own , with the weights split roughly 70 % on self and 30 % on other ; this balance changes when differences in ability or knowledge between self and other are made salient
Is this self - preference a bias ?
The main excuse I can see is that you might need to use your detailed reasons to make more detailed choices .
For example , you might prefer job candidates where you know the reasons they are good , because those reasons could help you match them to tasks .
Without such an excuse , you need a better than average reason to think that your reasons are better than the average reasons of others you do n’t see .

Peggy first followed her owner into the pub several years ago
Jackie Gray recently took over the Alexandra Hotel in Jarrow and said she was shocked when carthorse Peggy joined owner Peter Dolan for a pint .
The 12 - year - old female , which has a taste for John Smiths and pickled onion crisps , has apparently been visiting the pub for several years .
Mrs Gray was taken aback at first but says Peggy is no bother at all .
She said : " When I bought the pub a few weeks ago I heard rumours that one of the regulars was a horse but I did n't quite believe them .
" It was a hot day when the horse came in and I was shocked at first because I have never run a pub before . "
Retired oil rigger Mr Dolan , 61 , from Jarrow , bought Peggy six years ago and discovered her fondness for the pub when she followed him inside .
She had been tied up , but the rope was so long she was able to follow Mr Dolan right up to the bar .
He said : " Peggy 's no bother at all .
Most of the regulars know her as she 's been coming in here for years and for them Peggy 's a bit of a novelty .
She 's a proper lady . "

Extremist Muslims who force vulnerable teenage girls to convert to Islam are being targeted by police , Met chief Sir Ian Blair has revealed .
Police are working with universities to clamp down on " aggressive conversions " during which girls are beaten up and forced to abandon university courses .
• Muslim pupils ' need their own showers '
The Hindu Forum of Britain claims hundreds of mostly Sikh and Hindu girls have been intimidated by Muslim men who take them out on dates before terrorising them until they convert .
Sir Ian spoke about the problem at a conference organised by the forum .
A Met spokesman said : " Neighbourhood officers work with university authorities in London and we would encourage anyone targeted in this way to seek help and support and where necessary use third party reporting facilities if they do not want to contact police directly . "
Ramesh Kallidai , of the Hindu Forum of Britain , said : " Some girls are petrified because they are constantly being phoned up , having their door knocked .
" One girl was beaten up on the street and others have been forced to leave university . "
• Met police chiefs are to review a controversial stop - and - search power used in the fight against terrorism .
Assistant commissioner Andy Hayman , the overall head of Britain 's anti-terrorist operations , said he had concerns about the number of stops carried out in London using Section 44 legislation .

Google Strict vs Google Deprecated
Why does Google use such deprecated HTML on their homepage ?
A web page that implements web standards must not be larger , after all , nor does it load slower .
( And CSS can be used so it degrades nicely , meaning that say Netscape 3 users might get a gray background instead of a white one . )
Google ’s Matt Cutts once argued :
Google ’s home page does n’t validate and that ’s mostly by design to save precious bytes .
Will the world end because Google does n’t put quotes around color attributes ?
No , and it makes the page load faster .
I wanted to see how the Google homepage would fare as XHTML Strict 1.0 along with external CSS and JS files .
Here ’s the XHTML homepage and there ’s deprecated Google.com .
Google gets plenty of traffic , so a couple of bytes add up to larger bandwidth .
I did n’t want to replicate all JavaScript functionality , so in comparison I removed all scripts from both pages .
Furthermore , just as Google does , I then removed spacing and such from the files .
I end up with a Strict page ( HTML + CSS , no JS ) of 2.85 K . I end up with Google ’s deprecated page ( just the HTML , no JS ) of 3.08 K. ( Furthermore , when we save the logo as PNG instead of GIF and crop it from unnecessary white space , we end up with a 7.87 K image instead of a 8.35 K one . )
But I ’m not even saying web standards cause leaner code ( they are much easier to maintain for a developer , and that ’s why I would suggest them ; they also do better on mobile devices and such ) .
It ’s probably around the same , and there are different ways to compare file sizes – e.g.
I was n’t religious about removing all white space or using shortest ID names , and on the other hand I also did n’t test the CSS anywhere outside Firefox and IE , so this is n’t a complete test case .
What might be more important is that CSS files tend to cache much better , especially when same CSS modules are re-used across the site .
So , I get the feeling Google does n’t use deprecated HTML on their frontpage ’ cause they feel it ’s better ; it ’s just completely deprecated for no good reason other than Google , by and large , not caring too much about web standards .

JOHANNESBURG , Feb. 6  For close to seven years , Zimbabwe ’s economy and quality of life have been in slow , uninterrupted decline .
They are still declining this year , people there say , with one notable difference : the pace is no longer so slow .
Indeed , Zimbabwe ’s economic descent has picked up so much speed that President Robert G. Mugabe , the nation ’s leader for 27 years , is starting to lose support from parts of his own party .
In recent weeks , the national power authority has warned of a collapse of electrical service .
A breakdown in water treatment has set off a new outbreak of cholera in the capital , Harare .
All public services were cut off in Marondera , a regional capital of 50,000 in eastern Zimbabwe , after the city ran out of money to fix broken equipment .
In Chitungwiza , just south of Harare , electricity is supplied only four days a week .
The government awarded all civil servants a 300 percent raise two weeks ago .
But the increase is only a fraction of the inflation rate , so the nation ’s 110,000 teachers are staging a work slowdown for more money .
Measured by the black - market value of Zimbabwe ’s ragtag currency , even their new salaries total less than 60 American dollars a month .

A catchy tune is n't always a good thing .
If it contains an infectious chorus , even a song you dislike might refuse to leave your head .
( " Achy Breaky Heart , " anyone ? )
The choice of descriptors is not lost on Keith Duffy , a professor of rhetoric and composition at Penn State Schuylkill and a musician on the side .
" Oddly enough , " Duffy said , " this same rhetoric also describes communicable diseases . "
There may be cognitive reasons behind a tune 's appeal , he suggested .
Referring to a study done at Dartmouth College last year , Duffy explained that " MRIs show that a catchy song makes the auditory part of the brain ' itch , ' and the only way the itch can be scratched is by listening to the song . "
" Test subjects were played snippets of familiar songs that had segments removed .
Participants said their brains filled in the gaps -- in fact , they ' heard ' the removed parts of the songs in their heads , " Duffy continued .
" This was especially true in songs that had lyrics -- as well as songs which evoked strong visual memories in participants . "
If mentally repeating a song is the brain " scratching , " Paul Barsom wants to pin down exactly what causes that initial " itch . "
" It 's a pretty intangible thing , " said Barsom , professor of music theory and composition at Penn State .
" If it was n't , then everybody would be writing catchy songs . "
Certain kinds of musical gestures or combinations , he added , seem to plug readily into our memory , like molecules coming together in a chemical reaction .
" ' We will , we will , rock you ' is just easy to remember . "
Barsom listed several factors that might cause a song to be catchy .
" A certain familiarity -- similarity to music one already knows -- can play a role , " he explained .
" Unfamiliar music does n't connect well .
It 's harder to own , especially on first listen . "
Picture a teen with an affinity for punk rock listening to his or her grandfather 's Tchaikovsky collection -- or vice versa .
Taking familiarity a step further , Barsom added that a cultural connection between music and listener can make a tune more memorable .
To listeners of a certain generation , for example , the music of the Beach Boys opened up a whole new world of summer and surfing .
" Their connection to their audience made the music more appealing . "
Repetition also can make a song hard to forget in two ways , Barsom said .
" If you have a hook ( a short catchy phrase or passage ) in the song , and if that hook is repeated often , that could do it .
You might only remember five seconds of the song -- but sometimes that 's enough . "
In addition , he noted , repeated radio play could force a song to become catchy .
" You could hear a song 25 times a day .
If it has a short refrain that everyone can remember , it will stick , even if it 's terrible . "
Lastly , a particularly appealing performance of the song may be enough to make it stick in your head .
" Sometimes there 's a certain electric thing that really carries a mediocre song , just the manner in which it is played .
But who could possibly figure out what that is ? "
Barsom concluded that there is no definite blueprint for constructing a catchy song .
At best , most songwriters can only try out different melodies until one of them sounds like a keeper , a method with which musician Duffy can identify .
" I know when I am composing and recording music , certain chord or note progressions will evoke an emotion in me , in almost a primordial way .
When this happens , I am compelled to explore that relationship further , " he said .
For Duffy and Barsom , it seems , finding a formula for " catchiness " is futile ; instead , recognition is the key .
If it 's going to spread and stick , a tune must first infect the songwriter .

I read with interest the article by Wilt Alston on the dearth of black libertarians .
I have long been the only libertarian among my circle of ( mostly black ) friends , and I think the somewhat unique cultural background of American blacks ( the only type with whom I am intimately familiar ) has made less than fertile ground for the growth of libertarian values .
American blacks are generally the descendants of slaves .
That peculiar institution set the groundwork for a lot of black cultural traditions and social habits .
Individualists who fought for their own rights were in short supply because that trait did not make you better able to survive and prosper .
Quite the opposite , in fact .
Far too often , blacks who had the burning desire to improve themselves had to hide this desire , lest they be considered uppity and be subject to sanctions .
Though I find Lincoln an opportunist and murderer , it is fact that actions he set into motion led to the freeing of the slaves at the time in which they were freed .
That is something blacks ca n’t say of Calhoun ( though consistently following his ideas on government would lead to that conclusion , though he himself may have loathed that result ) , as much as I personally admire his insight into government and freedom .
It is a historical accident that the federal government forced abolition on the South , which would have inevitably come without the assistance of Union soldiers .
Readers of this site are keenly aware of this , but we all know that , all too often , we take the baby along with the bathwater , and , indeed , often have trouble realizing the two can be separated at all .
What effects did the fact that blacks saw the federal government as their emancipators have on black culture ?
Well , for one thing , it meant that one of the first places blacks went for jobs was the government , which was basically all under federal control immediately after the Civil War .
Growing up in Mississippi , I knew few successful black businessmen .
Black professionals were usually teachers , preachers , and government workers of various sorts .
That ’s just how it was .
That ’s where the opportunities usually were .
In particular during my father ’s and grandfather ’s times , the protection of the federal government was the best way black folk knew to be successful .
Black - owned businesses generally catered to blacks only .
It would , in fact , be dangerous in many parts of the country for them to attempt to do otherwise .
This meant that most of the outside money which was coming into black neighborhoods was coming from the government , since the professionals , the high income earners , were frequently working for the government .
There has always been ( since slavery ’s end ) , as far as I can tell , a kind of black aristocracy .
Not the natural aristocracy of Jefferson , but one based upon the coercive power held by basically any white man over any black man .
This meant that if you had a problem which required white involvement , you spoke first to a black person with a personal relationship with a white person of influence .
A person who was hand picked , you might say , as the " black leader . "
This is one reason you have always seen black community leaders in this country to an extent which you just do n’t see with other ethnic groups .
This leader was often the preacher , who was one of the few black people who had the means and motivation to become literate ( most jobs blacks were working did n’t require literacy , so the infrastructure and incentive to obtain it was lacking ) .
As a result , blacks traditionally have deferred to the authority of such people .
At least in the small churches of the rural areas of the South , firing or censuring a misbehaving minister is incredibly difficult .
Indeed , he normally has to do something completely unChristian such as have an affair with a parishioner in order for this to happen .
If he simply does n’t do his job well , or violates the charter of the church , that usually wo n’t be sufficient cause to get most of the members to act .
The assumption is that he has been divinely authorized to lead them .
( I remember many times as a child when people would stand up in church and criticize some practice , first making sure to note that they were not criticizing the minister because they know he has been " set above them . " )
As a result , many black institutions are much more oriented towards the charismatic leader than the underlying doctrine .
We see that all too clearly , for example , in the Nation of Islam .
Note how they always fawn over their leaders , even to the point of committing obscene blasphemies such as referring to W. Fard Muhammad as Allah in Person and Elijah Muhammad as the Messenger of Allah .
This sort of worship of authority was inculcated into slaves by necessity , and has been exploited by government ( and private ) demagogues ever since .
So , blacks were victimized due to government protection of the planters , then it was government which freed them , then government which was the most favored employer .
Black people generally look fondly upon both the black Union soldiers ( who were largely fighting for freedom , unlike their compatriots ) as some of the few blacks at the time to be openly armed and seemingly having their human right to self - defense and self - determination recognized in a way which was not common at that time .
They also look fondly upon the Buffalo Soldiers , even though those men were aiding in a genocidal campaign against Native Americans .
Finally , black people getting to be the oppressor instead of the oppressed !
To be fair , of course , most of the people who celebrate them do n’t celebrate their actual killing of Native Americans , they celebrate that their value was recognized by the government , which is often taken to mean the majority of white people living at the time .
Libertarian values have not had much opportunity to get going among most blacks .
When Jim Crow laws and lynchings were plaguing people , it was the federal government which is largely recognized , rightly or wrongly , as having ended these evils .
When blacks were excluded from businesses and schools , once again it was the federal government which is regarded as having brought freedom to the oppressed .
The struggle for freedom for blacks in this country is largely therefore regarded as rich men , in league with state governments , versus the federal government .
Considering that worldview , is it any wonder that libertarianism has not taken root ?
Individualism just does not have a well - established history among most black people .
How could it ?
So , for the most part , black political views tend to boil down to the government which harms versus the government which helps .
Individuals , then , according to this view , have to choose sides , because those are the only two which exist .
Black libertarianism never got a good opportunity to get off the ground .
The culture in which most of us have been brought up has had a contraceptive effect on the birth of libertarian ideas among blacks .
The millions of " libertarian unborn " which were prevented and aborted due to this culture are sorely missed .
We see it in the terrible state of black America every day .
There is hope , however .
The fact that blacks are equal before the law , through whatever means that has been achieved , is a key issue which should not be ignored .
It is only lately , when the government is finally becoming an equal opportunity oppressor that libertarianism is starting to resonate .
Though my friends are n’t generally libertarians ( most are Democrats , but one is a Bush Republican ) , I find that actually talking to them personally and describing what the government does is very effective at helping them see the value of libertarian philosophy .
So , while black libertarians are in short supply , demand for the ideas we hold are increasing .
There is therefore , I feel , an unprecedented opportunity to spread libertarianism among black people .
There are , in fact , more obvious reasons for blacks to be libertarians than just about any other American ethnic group .

The Best of Robert A. Wicks
Apologies for the condescension , but honestly : when even the American public ( more than two - thirds of whom support this research ) achieves a consensus on an issue , it can't be too hard to resolve .
So the more interesting question is n't who 's in the right , but what is the curious minority myopia that has produced a debate at all ?
Earlier this week , we saw much grandstanding from both queasy , refuse - to - get - their - hands - dirty countries such as Austria , which would flat - out ban the use of EU funds for this research , and others - not only Britain but , impressively , Catholic Portugal - which would forge ahead with EU financing .
For once , the compromise agreement - to allow individual states to determine whether they will use EU science funds for stem - cell research - seems eminently sensible .
Alas , it 's impossible to characterise as " sensible " Bush 's putting the kibosh on a bill to provide federal funds for embryonic stem - cell research last week , conspicuously the first veto of his presidency .
Making the announcement , Bush surrounded himself bathetically with babies , all the results of " adopted " embryos otherwise marked for disposal .
Yet nothing about the pursuit of this research precludes individual couples continuing to bid for abandoned embryos from fertility treatments , the vast majority of which will still end up in the bin .
Indeed , after an ill - judged White House assertion that Bush considers destroying human embryos as tantamount to " murder " , stem - cell research supporters accurately observed that in that event fertility clinics should be prosecuted for homicide .
Hauling clinics into court for discarding a few clumps of cells would be OTT even for the Bush administration , which subsequently back - pedalled in embarrassment .
Exercising his only veto to date in defence of biological material undetectable to the naked eye , this president went to war in Iraq with nary a thought for the consequences , pursuing a fool 's errand that has cost tens of thousands of lives .
Mind , we 're talking about the lives of whole , big people , the kind that talk and walk around , with families and fast friends , with senses of humour and gifts for writing poetry .
Not tiny clusters of cells , which will never trot into the room when you call should you scream yourself blue in the face .
On both the left and right , a certain sanctimonious social subsection chronically indulges the moral equivalent of penny - wise , pound - foolish .
This over - scrupulous ethical bean - counting of the little stuff , and utter profligacy in relation to the large , contributes a shrill note in debates about a host of other matters : assisted suicide for the terminally ill ; abortion ; questions such as whether we should keep babies alive at any cost even if they 're in agony and doomed to die ; and cases such as Terri Schiavo's , which roiled the entire US for months over the fate of a woman who was , as an autopsy subsequently established , brain dead .
Yet these dainty moral purists are rarely anguished about going to war , or even about capital punishment .
They 're not likely to get worked up about an entire continent of big people who live on less than £ 1 a day .
Typically , hyper - purists do n't give a frig about the practical consequences of their fastidiousness .
They are n't in the least concerned about dashing the hopes of diabetes patients , forcing the terminally ill to suffer one more hateful day , or making already overstressed healthcare systems finance their personal self - righteousness at the sacrifice of caring for people who can actually get better .
This variety of moral purism has nothing to do with concern for others .
It is a vanity .
It is not about principle , but about appearing principled .
It 's about look - at - me - I 'm - so - virtuous - a preening , self - congratulatory contingent to which Bush was pandering last week .
And , of course , it 's also about bossing us other , less worthy moral scruff around .
Philip Roth 's American Pastoral portrays an ostentatiously lofty girl named Merry - a mischievous appellation , since she sure ain't a lot of fun .
Merry is so obsessed with doing no harm to a single living creature , no matter how microscopic , that she wo n't eat , wo n't wash , wo n't even walk on the ground .
Novelistically , Merry is a brilliant creation , albeit functionally insane , and one of the most supremely irritating characters I have encountered in fiction .
And she stinks .
Metaphorically , the holier - than - thou crowd always does .
Monday 's announcement that this year Transport for London is set to spend even more than 2005's £ 11.5 m on advertising stirred an ongoing rage .
Whenever I see those costly television adverts promoting cycling in the capital , with cheery , healthy young people in helmets bouncing off their mountain bikes and looking refreshed , I can not stay seated from fury .
I object on the basis of false advertising .
Realistically , those young people should be bouncing off the Tarmac .
If mayor Livingstone must run promotions for cycling , he should be broadcasting images of cyclists being cut off at speed by left - turning vehicles that have n't signalled ; sent sailing from opened car - doors ; verbally abused by drivers who have just violated the cyclist 's right - of - way ( since there 's none so indignant as the one in the wrong ) ; quite reasonably cautioned or ticketed for running a light , but by police who never , ever ticket drivers who plough pedallers off the road unless the cyclist ends up dead ; and veering around cars parked - often legally - in the rare bike lane that goes anywhere , only to be flattened by a truck .
That , friends , is cycling in London .
So if Transport for London is intent on squandering its scarce resources on adverts , instead of using them to make cycling safe , it might replace its slogan " Get on your bike ! " with " Write a will . "

Google might as well have just redirected all their image searches to Live. com 's image search since they just about completely ripped Live 's image search interface .
Barry reports the changes on SearchEngineLand and SERoundtable but fails to mention that this new interface he likes so much is the same as Live. com's .
Google Blogscoped has a before and after of Google 's interface here but here is a screenshot of Google vs Live .
See for yourself .
(3) Thoughts on Google Rips - off Microsoft 's Live Search
There are some similarities .
But if you were going to clean up the old GIS results pages , what would you change ?
Seems like a case of " similar because obvious " to me .
There are differences , too .
The GIS results pages load faster and respond quicker to user inputs .
They do n't bother with the ( lame ) fractional - zooming effect the LIS pages have .
The new GIS results page looks and acts the same in IE7 , FF2 , and Opera9 .
LIS serves Opera a different page , for some reason .

This is a very poor change IMHO .
If I wanted to look at a " clean page " I 'd go buy me a blank notebook ...
Google Image Search is a working tool of primary importance , and its purpose is not to maximize cleanliness ; it is to enable you to sift through multiple results in minimal time and with the highest likelihood of finding the content you need .
Removing the very useful clues of domain and size , and forcing this one by one hover action , slows down the task considerably with no benefit whatsoever to the user .
They could have - and still may , I hope - give the user the choice of what level of info to display ...
Comments by Nathan Zeldes : Thursday , January 25 , 2007 at 02:11 AM
Nathan , I could n't agree with you more .
Not being able to view the domain information without hovering is driving me nuts since I inherently assign a trust score to every domain I see and that 's the biggest factor ( other than the quality / subject of the image ) I use in determining which images to click on .
I have not looked at the javascript yet but I 'm guessing this is an attempt at collecting data about which pictures are important to users via an onMouseOver event but we 'll see if that ends up playing out .

I 'm snowed in , up at Tahoe , and even worse , my friends are making me watch the Oscars .
Which only turned out to be cool after seeing this Apple spot for the iPhone .
The first ever , I believe .
Simply many actors , 28 actually , from many eras , saying hello on the phone , and then an image of the device , finishing with the text " Coming in June " .
Then I got up to blog it .
Not surprisingly , when you 're trapped in snow - drifted cabin , without anything but a 56 k internet connection and old computer , there is a lot of analysis that can be done to the 30 - second spot , which reportedly went for $ 1.7 million bucks .

If you did n't notice , the phone has an AT&T logo replacing the Cingular image , on the top left of the screen .
And Richard Blakeley points out that the time used to say 10:15 .
Now it says 10:12 .
" It 's a time machine ! " , says Richard .

I wonder if there 's any significance to the numbers 10:12 and 10:15 .
Biblical , personal for Jobs ?... OK , I need to get out of this cabin .
This sort of obsession is best left to the real mac wonks .
And speaking of obsession , can anyone name all the actors in the commercial ?
Is there a pattern to the actors used , in term of time , studio , etc ?
( Hit the comments , we 'll approve em after a short while . )
That 's 40 million viewers , watching the second slot of the awards , btw .
I wonder if it is too big of an assumption to think the mainstreamers are going to have a clue to what 's going on in this spot .
Regardless , the ad is a nice little collab between Hollywood studios and Apple .
Here 's hoping to more of that in the future , in terms of iTunes movie selection .

The Dutch Droste company 's famous cocoa packaging is the origin of the name " Droste effect " .
The nurse on the package carries a plate with a package , on which there is the same package , etc , etc . .

The mathematics of creating a Droste effect are explained here .
Here is a small tutorial on creating Droste effect images and animations in Ultrafractal .
Once money starts flowing into a field , as it has been for the study of the longevity and health benefits of calorie restriction in the past couple of years , you 'll find a contingent working on advancing knowledge by mapping those parts of the problem space not yet paved and built up .
I thought I 'd point out a couple of recent papers that take a short term study approach by examining the effects of calorie restriction of different dietary components on mitochondrial metabolism .
Given the link between mitochondrial free radical generation , cellular damage and degenerative aging , this might be a helpful proxy for effects on long term health and longevity .
Carbohydrate restriction does not change mitochondrial free radical generation and oxidative DNA damage :
Many previous investigations have consistently reported that caloric restriction ( 40 % ) , which increases maximum longevity , decreases mitochondrial reactive species ( ROS ) generation and oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) in laboratory rodents .
These decreases take place in rat liver after only seven weeks of caloric restriction .
Moreover , it has been found that seven weeks of 40 % protein restriction , independently of caloric restriction , also decrease these two parameters , whereas they are not changed after seven weeks of 40 % lipid restriction .
This is interesting since it is known that protein restriction can extend longevity in rodents , whereas lipid restriction does not have such effect .
However , before concluding that the ameliorating effects of caloric restriction on mitochondrial oxidative stress are due to restriction in protein intake , studies on the third energetic component of the diet , carbohydrates , are needed .
Not all dietary components are equal - some are a good deal more equal than others , it seems .
Research into protein restriction has been going on for a while , but there 's no such thing as too much supporting evidence .
This next study heads off in the other direction , however , in search of benefits obtained without restricting protein :
Synergistic effects of caloric restriction with maintained protein intake on skeletal muscle performance in 21 - month - old rats : a mitochondria - mediated pathway :
Caloric restriction ( CR ) delays the onset of age - related mitochondrial abnormalities but does not prevent the decline in ATP production needed to sustain muscle protein fractional synthesis rate ( FSR ) and contractile activity .
We hypothesized that improving mitochondrial activity and FSR using a CR diet with maintained protein intakes could enhance myofibrillar protein FSR and consequently improve muscle strength in aging rats .
Wistar rats ( 21 months old ) were fed either an ad libitum ( AL ) , 40 % protein - energy restricted ( PER ) or 40 % AL - isonitrogenous energy restricted ( ER ) diet for 5 months .
... the synergistic effects of CR with maintained protein intake may help to limit the progression of sarcopenia by optimizing the turnover rates and functions of major proteins in skeletal muscle .
People like optimizing complex things - such as metabolic processes that contribute to longevity and health .
Enjoyment of this sort of activity is hardwired into us ; a very necessary part of our success story as individuals and as a species .
Long after aging has been defeated through the application of advanced technology , there will be communities that optimize baseline human metabolism for fun .
But today , it 's something of a distraction - there are better initiatives we could be advancing with these resources , so as to more rapidly and effectively defeat aging .
You can't get to the finish line by manipulating metabolism ; all you can do is buy a little more time .
But if you spent all your efforts on that , what time is left to really work on the defeat of aging ?
Technorati tags : calorie restriction , medical research
The Washington Post reports today that , in the five and one - half years since the September 11th attacks , the Federal Government has amassed a huge database of information as part of the War on Terror :
Each day , thousands of pieces of intelligence information from around the world — field reports , captured documents , news from foreign allies and sometimes idle gossip — arrive in a computer - filled office in McLean , where analysts feed them into the nation ’s central list of terrorists and terrorism suspects .
Called TIDE , for Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment , the list is a storehouse for data about individuals that the intelligence community believes might harm the United States .
It is the wellspring for watch lists distributed to airlines , law enforcement , border posts and U.S. consulates , created to close one of the key intelligence gaps revealed after Sept. 11 , 2001 : the failure of federal agencies to share what they knew about al - Qaeda operatives .
But in addressing one problem , TIDE has spawned others .
Ballooning from fewer than 100,000 files in 2003 to about 435,000 , the growing database threatens to overwhelm the people who manage it .
“ The single biggest worry that I have is long - term quality control , ” said Russ Travers , in charge of TIDE at the National Counterterrorism Center in McLean .
“ Where am I going to be , where is my successor going to be , five years down the road ? ”
It is the TIDE database that is the source of the no-fly and watch lists that have been a part of American aviation travel since planes started flying again after 9/11 ; watch lists which have been a continual sources of frustration for ordinary Americans who suddenly find their names on a list of suspected threats to airline safety :
Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) said last year that his wife had been delayed repeatedly while airlines queried whether Catherine Stevens was the watch - listed Cat Stevens .
The listing referred to the Britain - based pop singer who converted to Islam and changed his name to Yusuf Islam .
The reason Islam is not allowed to fly to the United States is secret .
Of course it is .
What remains unanswered is why anyone with a brain would think that the wife of a U.S. Senator could be connected in any way to a British pop singer who converted to Islam and wears a beard and Muslim clothing .
Sometimes , though , the result of being misidentified as a terrorist are n’t amusing :
So is the reason Maher Arar , a Syrian - born Canadian , remains on the State Department ’s consular watch list .
Detained in New York while en route to Montreal in 2002 , Arar was sent by the U.S. government to a year of imprisonment in Syria .
Canada , the source of the initial information about Arar , cleared him of all terrorism allegations last September — three years after his release — and has since authorized $ 9 million in compensation .
Of course , it ’s not surprising when you think for a few seconds about just how these lists are created :
Every night at 10 , TIDE dumps an unclassified version of that day ’s harvest — names , dates of birth , countries of origin and passport information — into a database belonging to the FBI ’s Terrorist Screening Center .
TIDE ’s most sensitive information is not included .
The FBI adds data about U.S. suspects with no international ties for a combined daily total of 1,000 to 1,500 new names .
Between 5 and 6 a.m. , a shift of 24 analysts drawn from the agencies that use watch lists begins a new winnowing process at the center ’s Crystal City office .
The analysts have access to case files at TIDE and the original intelligence sources , said the center ’s acting director , Rick Kopel .
Decisions on what to add to the Terrorist Screening Center master list are made by midafternoon .
The bar is higher than TIDE ’s ; total listings were about 235,000 names as of last fall , according to Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A. Fine .
The bar is then raised again as agencies decide which names to put on their own watch lists : the Transportation Security Administration ’s “ no- fly ” and “ selectee ” lists for airlines ; Consular Lookout and Support System at the State Department ; the Interagency Border and Inspection System at the Department of Homeland Security ; and the Justice Department ’s National Crime Information Center .
The criteria each agency use are classified , Kopel said .
The decision on who to add and who to delete is , it seems , entirely arbitrary .
Each agency has it ’s own rules and there are no standards to assist an individual analyst in deciding whether to add or delete a name .
In the end , whether or not you end up on a watch list may depend on the gut feeling of a guy sitting in an office building in Arlington County , Virginia at five o’clock in the morning .
Sounds like a system destined not to work .
JWST will be the successor to the Hubble telescope
Engineers have finished making the 18 hexagonal elements that will come together to form the telescope 's 6.6 m primary mirror .
The size of a mirror determines how much light a telescope can collect , and therefore how much detail it can see .
JWST is seen as the heir to the hugely successful Hubble Space Telescope .
JWST will study every phase in the history of our Universe .
Its large primary mirror will help it " see " further into the cosmos than other telescopes , to detect some of the first stars to emerge in the Universe .
JWST could even shed light on the origins of life in other planetary systems .
The orbiting observatory is due to launch in 2013 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou in French Guiana .
The primary mirror will consist of 18 lightweight elements like this
Hubble 's primary mirror was made in one piece .
JWST 's primary mirror consists of 18 different elements , allowing it to be folded up into the rocket that will carry it into space .
This design also gives the telescope more flexibility in space , because each segment can be moved by ground controllers to tweak up its performance .
Although the completed primary mirror 's diameter will be 2.75 times larger than that of Hubble , it will weigh roughly half as much .
Beryllium has been used in other space telescopes and has worked well at the super - frigid temperatures of space in which JWST will operate .
Engineers at firm Axsys examine one of the segments
This prevents JWST from emitting its own infrared radiation , swamping faint astronomical signals .
Now the mirror elements are complete , they have been taken to a firm in California to be ground and polished .
After grinding and polishing , the completed mirror segments will be assembled at a separate facility .
They are then transported to Nasa 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland to be integrated into the telescope .
JWST will study the first light to emerge after the Big Bang , the first stars to form in the Universe , investigate how galaxies are assembled and look for clues to the origin of life in other planetary systems .
Ageing and unreliable office computers are making workers unhappy and more likely to claim sick leave , a new survey shows .
A poll conducted by Tickbox . net of more 2,700 European office workers from Britain , France and Germany found that workplace dissatisfaction increased significantly with the age of computer equipment .
British and French respondents said working on outdated computers was the most irritating aspect of office life .
While browsing my referrer logs I noticed a lot of hits from a comment on Jensen Harris 's blog post about the Office 2007 UI being licenced .
Below is the comment which has driven several hundred page views on my blog
My reason for moving to a ribbon - like interface for the Phoenix release of RSS Bandit was because I was under the impression that the Ribbon was the wave of the future with regards to application user interfaces in Windows .
However I just read a blog post by Mike Torres entitled More on the Office 2007 UI where he points out that practically every Windows application released by Microsoft this year has abandoned the traditional File menu and toolbar structure in a different way .
Below are links to the screenshots from Mike 's post [ and one extra which was suggested by Omar ]
As you can se all of the above applications which where shipped by Microsoft this year embraced the idea of getting rid of the traditional File menu and toolbars yet did n't agree on what to replace them with .
As a developer of a Windows application , it is clear to me that the traditional yet consistent File menu and toolbar look is now played out on Windows .
The main question is which app I should emulate .
If history tells me anything , I can't go wrong betting on Office driving user expectations around what Windows applications should act and feel like .
I 'm glad to see Infragistics on the list of vendors who will be adopting the Office 2007 UI guidelines .
This means we 'll likely inherit some best practices around using the Office 2007 Ribbon for free since we now use the Infragistics NetAdvantage GUI components in RSS Bandit .
If this means , I 'm going to get people like Mike Dimmick flaming me for not living up to the vision of the ' Ribbon ' then so be it .
I 'd rather that than an application that looked old and busted instead of being the new hotness . ;)
HER name is Crystal Gail Man gum .
She is the woman who falsely accused three Duke University students of rape .
Yesterday , the attorney general of North Carolina came forward and flatly declared the three young men “ innocent of these charges . ”
That means their accuser is a liar .
Her name is Crystal Gail Mangum .
It is the policy of the news media not to publish the names of rape accusers on the grounds that they should not have to fear public shame for coming forward with word of a horrifying personal violation .
That is a noble policy .
But it needs a codicil .
The codicil is that if a rape accuser is revealed as a liar , her name should be spoken loudly and often – as loudly and often as the names of those whom she falsely accused have been over the past year .
Her name is Crystal Gail Mangum .
She must be denied anonymity because she makes a mockery of the very policy of granting anonymity to rape accusers .
We do not publish their names so that they will not fear public exposure .
But people who are tempted to do the monstrous thing Mangum did should fear public exposure .
They should be terrified of it .
They should have nightmares about it .
They should be given no encouragement whatsoever to believe they can launch a nuclear weapon at someone ’s reputation and escape unscathed .
Her name is Crystal Gail Mangum , and she should not escape the world ’s scorn because she is poor , or because she is black , or because her life circumstances led her to work as a “ stripper . ”
Her name is Crystal Gail Mangum , and she does not deserve to lick the underside of the shoes of hardworking and honest people of color and modest means who somehow manage to get through life without attempting to destroy and defile the lives of others .
At his press conference yesterday , Attorney General Roy Cooper said something odd about the liar Crystal Gail Mangum .
He said she would face no charges for her false accusation .
He said , “ Our investigators who talked with her and the attorneys who talked with her over a period of time think that she may actually believe the many different stories that she has been telling .
They worked real hard with her .
It does n’t make sense .
You ca n’t piece it together . ”
The suggestion here is that she has psychological problems .
So do millions upon millions of people in the United States .
And they too manage , somehow , not to spin lies about rape into false arrests .
They somehow manage not to force families of those they falsely accuse to incur legal fees reportedly totaling more than $ 1 million per family .
These families are sometimes described as “ affluent , ” as though the fact that they live in nice communities in nice houses means they can afford million - dollar fees .
Attorney General Cooper did a good thing by making so unambiguous a statement of innocence as he freed David Evans , Reade Seligmann and Colin Finnerty from their year of torment .
Until I hear more that might justify his decision beyond a desire not to inflame racial passions in the Tar Heel State , I cannot help think that Cooper has done a very , very wrong thing by allowing Crystal Gail Mangum to avoid the judgment of his state ’s legal system .
Unless he changes his mind , then , the only justice she will face is the public exposure of her name and the revelation to all the world that , if she had had her way , three young men would have been sent to prison on false charges .
Her name is Crystal Gail Mangum .
Let her name be the new Mudd .

This is the way the bubble ends : not with a pop , but with a hiss .
Housing prices move much more slowly than stock prices .
There are no Black Mondays , when prices fall 23 percent in a day .
In fact , prices often keep rising for a while even after a housing boom goes bust .
So the news that the U.S. housing bubble is over wo n't come in the form of plunging prices ; it will come in the form of falling sales and rising inventory , as sellers try to get prices that buyers are no longer willing to pay .
And the process may already have started .
Of course , some people still deny that there 's a housing bubble .
Let me explain how we know that they 're wrong .
One piece of evidence is the sense of frenzy about real estate , which irresistibly brings to mind the stock frenzy of 1999 .
Even some of the players are the same .
The authors of the 1999 best seller " Dow 36,000 " are now among the most vocal proponents of the view that there is no housing bubble .
MILAN , Nov. 27 — When the American architect Richard Meier was asked to design a church in Rome to commemorate the 2,000th anniversary of Christianity , he offered an imposing white concrete structure dominated by three soaring “ sails . ”
The project ’s main technical sponsor got to work on a coating that would enhance Mr. Meier ’s trademark white sculptural forms .
It came up with a material that essentially cleans itself , minimizing the need for maintenance .
What the sponsor , the Italcementi Group , did not know was that the new material — which contains titanium dioxide , a white pigment — has another peculiarity .
It “ eats ” surrounding smog .
Extensive testing has since determined that construction products containing titanium dioxide help to destroy pollutants found in car exhaust and heating emissions , scientists say .
The laws are due to come into force on January 1
The powers mean people can be arrested for all offences , even minor ones like painting graffiti and dropping litter .
Currently officers can only arrest people suspected of committing crimes with at least a five - year jail sentence - although there are exemptions .
But the powers of arrest will not be automatic , as police officers will have to apply a " necessity test " .
Current non-arrestable offences include impersonating a police officer , failing to stop a vehicle when ordered to do so , manufacturing or selling an offensive weapon , failing to hand over a passport to a court and unauthorised access or modification of computer material , which deals with some more minor hacking offences .
Home Office minister Hazel Blears says the aim of the new laws , which are being introduced in the Serious and Organised Crime Act 2005 , is to modernise and simplify police powers .
KEY POINTS
All offences to be arrestable Search warrants to cover more than one property , one search and to stay in force longer Community Support Officers to get range of new powers , including to search detainees Drug tests allowed on arrest rather than only when a suspect is charged Fixed penalty fines to pay for more use of automatic number plate recognition technology New offence of having an incorrectly registered vehicle New power to stop and search under - 18s suspected of carrying fireworks
Allow police to take DNA , fingerprints , shoeprints covertly Digital photographs of suspects can be taken without consent being given
Key points of police plans
" The introduction of a single rationalised power of arrest simplifies arrest powers and requires police to consider the ' necessity ' of the arrest , " she said .
" This means that the officer has to focus on the individual circumstances of the case and the needs of the investigation . "
Shadow home secretary David Davis dismissed the proposals when they were originally proposed in August last year by former home secretary David Blunkett as " another headline grabbing initiative " .
But Ms Blears insists the rationalisation of the existing complex patchwork of arrestable and non-arrestable offences means policing will be made more practical and efficient .
" These tough new powers make a significant contribution to creating a modern , efficient police service equipping frontline officers with the tools they need to fight modern crime effectively and keep our neighbourhoods safe , " Ms Blears added
Nobody wants to live in a society in which every offence results in people being dragged down to the police station
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten
However , she acknowledged : " We need to maintain a crucial balance between the powers of the police and the rights of the individual . "
But Shami Chakrabarti , director of civil rights group Liberty , says it is " disproportionate " to make offences which could not carry a prison sentence arrestable .
The Conservatives have indicated they will be closely monitoring the effect of the new powers .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten told the Daily Telegraph newspaper : " Officers need firm guidance on how to use these powers .
" Nobody wants to live in a society in which every offence results in people being dragged down to the police station . "
The police plans also give officers new rights on collecting and sharing evidence such as taking speculative footwear impressions and photographing suspects without their consent .

An assistant professor of Arabic at San Francisco State University has been stranded in Canada for three months , unable to return to campus , after the U.S. State Department canceled his visa and began reviewing his security status .
Mohammad Ramadan Hassan Salama 's troubles began in June , when he arrived in Canada for what he thought was a two - day stay to change his temporary scholar visa , which was due to expire .
He planned to exchange it at the U.S. Consulate in Toronto for the more coveted O - 1 visa , granted only to those with extraordinary ability in sciences , arts , education , business or athletics .
By law , he had to go outside the country to get the visa .
But the Egyptian - born academic got a rude awakening June 20 when a consular official , without explanation , stamped " canceled " on his temporary visa and refused to issue another visa .
Instead , Salama said , he was fingerprinted , questioned and told he could not return to the United States until he received security clearance .
" It was just a shock for me , " he said by phone on Monday .
" It is very Kafkaesque .
They just say , ' We will contact you . '
I am Egyptian , and Egypt is a very hot country right now that has produced terrorists .
They disregarded my Ph.D. , my scholarship .
My marriage , my kids were blindly disregarded , and I was told I could not come back . "
Janelle Hironimus , a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department , said she could not comment on individual cases .
" The administrative process can take quite some time , so it is not something that we have control over , " she said .
Salama , 38 , began teaching at San Francisco State a year ago .
He arrived in the United States seven years ago , has an American wife and two children , and received his doctorate in comparative literature from the University of Wisconsin , Madison .
San Francisco
State hired him last fall as its first Arabic scholar to help build its Arabic and Middle Eastern programs , which have become popular since 9/11 .
When Paul Sherwin , dean of the School of Humanities , learned Salama could n't get back from Canada , he had to scramble to find a replacement to start teaching two Arabic language classes and a literature course last month .
Salama is now teaching one of his classes , a seminar on Arabic novels , online .
" We never expected this would go on so long , " Sherwin said .
" We have a Middle Eastern studies program that we are building .
He is the language person who is essential to that program . "
He said the university is putting together its spring schedule and does n't know whether Salama will be back to teach .
Salama and his attorney have sought help from Rep. Tom Lantos , D - San Mateo , who is a ranking member of the House International Relations Committee .
" We understand that the Department of State , which acts as a funnel of up to 22 agencies , runs a variety of background checks and one of the checks turned up some question of his name , which may have matched a name on a watch list , " said Lantos spokeswoman Lynne Weil .
When a name is flagged as a match with watch lists , officials from various departments may get involved to determine whether it is the same person or whether the reason for the flag is even significant , according to U.S. officials .
Salama said one of the men convicted in the first World Trade Center bombings in 1993 was named Mohammed A. Salameh .
" It is a very common name , " he said .
" This is laughable , just because my name is Mohammad Salama .
If we look for somebody with the last name McVeigh , should we just arrest them and harass them ?
I really think this has nothing to do with me . "
The most frustrating part of the situation is the indefinite timeline , said Salama 's attorney , Clark Trevor of San Francisco .
" Given his age , given his country , given our current state of affairs on security , it is not surprising that there are delays ; the problem is the uncertainty and the indefinite timeline , " Trevor said .
" It does not mean that Dr. Salama is a bad guy .
He is the kind of guy we need in this country right now . "

Regular readers will know I am skeptical that anthropomorphic global warming and its effects will be as bad as generally predicted .
However , if I can work around this bias , I would like to cast the issue as neutrally as I can : Man-made CO2 will likely cause the world to warm some , and the negative effects of this for man are likely higher than the positive effects .
Under some assumptions , these net negative effects of man-made warming could be astronomical in cost , while under other assumptions they will be less so .
Against this variable outcome , efforts to substantially reduce CO2 production world wide and prevent further increases of atmospheric CO2 concentrations will carry a staggering cost , both in dollars and the inevitable social effects of locking developing countries into poverty they are just now escaping ( not to mention loss of individual liberty from more government controls ) .
The political choice we therefore face is daunting :
Do we pay an incredibly high price to abate an environmental change that may or may not be more costly than the cure ?
Reasonable people disagree on this , and I recognize that I may fall in the minority on which side I currently stand on ( I think both warming and its abatement costs are overblown , mainly because I have a Julian - Simonesque confidence in man 's adaptability and innovation ) .
Against this backdrop , we have Kevin Drum declaring " More good news on the global warming front : "
Seeking to shape legislation before Congress , three major energy trade
associations have shifted their stances and decided to back mandatory
federal curbs on carbon dioxide and other man-made emissions that could
accelerate climate change .
Here is my news flash : Having some Washington lobbying organizations switch which side of this incredibly difficult trade off they support is not " good news . "
Good news is finding out that this trade off may not be as stark as we think it is .
Good news is finding some new technology that reduces emissions and which private citizens are willing to adopt without government coercion ( e.g. sheets of solar cells that can be run out of factories like carpet from Dalton , Georgia ) .
Or , good news is finding out that man 's CO2 production has less of an effect on world climate than once thought .
Oddly enough , this latter category of good news , surely the best possible news we could get on the topic , is seldom treated as good news by global warming activists .
In fact , scientists with this message are called Holocaust deniers .
I wonder why ?
Update : LOL
Introduction
Over a year ago at the Fall 2005 Intel Developer Forum , Intel formally announced that they would be dropping the Pentium 4 's Netburst microarchitecture in favor of a brand new , more power - efficient microarchitecture that would carry the company 's entire x86 product line , from laptops up through Xeon servers , into the next decade .
Not since April of 2001 , when Netburst arrived on the scene to replace the P6 microarchitecture that powered the Pentium Pro , Pentium II , and Pentium III , have all segments of Intel 's x86 processor line used the same microarchitecture .
This past IDF saw the unveiling of some significant details about this new microarchitecture , which was formerly called " Merom " but now goes by the official name of " Core . "
( You 'll also see Core called NGMA , an acronym for " next - generation microarchitecture . " )
Intel presented many of these details in a presentation on Core , and others were obtained by David Kanter of Real World Technologies .
The present article draws on both of those sources , as well as my own correspondence with Intel , to paint what is ( hopefully ) an accessible picture of the new microarchitecture that will soon be powering everything from Windows Vista servers to Apple laptops .
A note The original Pentium 's microarchitecture was called P5 .
Because the Pentium Pro's microarchitecture was the successor to the P5 , it was dubbed P6 by Intel .
The P6 was one of the most commercially successful microarchitectures of all time , and it went through a number of changes as it evolved from the Pentium Pro to the Pentium III .
A question of breeding ?
Before I get into the more technical discussion of Core 's features , I want to quickly spell out how I view Core 's relationship to its predecessors .
As Intel has repeatedly claimed , Core is a new microarchitecture that was designed from scratch with today 's performance and power consumption needs in mind .
Nonetheless ,
Core does draw heavily on its predecessors , taking the best of the Pentium 4 and the Pentium M ( Banias ) and rolling them into a design that looks much more like the latter than the former .
Because the Pentium M itself is a new design that draws heavily on the P6 microarchitecture , I 've chosen to place Core very generally within the P6 " lineage . "
However , I ask the reader not to read too much into this loosely applied biological metaphor , because my comparing Core to its P6 predecessors and talking about its development in terms of the " evolution " of the " P6 lineage " is really nothing more than an way to organize the discussion for ease of comprehension .
Core , multicore , and the big picture
When Intel 's team in Israel set about designing the processor architecture that would carry the company 's entire x86 product line for the next five years or so , they had multicore computing in mind .
But for Intel , having multicore in mind does n't mean quite the same thing that it means for Sun or IBM .
Specifically , it " multicore " does n't mean " throw out out - of - order execution and scale back single - threaded performance in favor of a massively parallel architecture that can run a torrent of simultaneous threads . "
Such an aggressive , forward - looking approach is embodied in designs like STI 's Cell and Sun's Ultrasparc T1 .
Instead , Intel 's understanding of what it takes to make a " multicore " architecture is significantly more conservative , and very " Intel . "
Intel 's approach to multicore is not about keeping each individual core 's on - die footprint down by throwing out dynamic execution hardware , but about keeping each core 's power consumption down and its efficiency up .
In this sense , Intel 's strategy is fundamentally process - based , which is why I said it 's " very ' Intel . ' "
Intel will rely not on the microarchitectural equivalent of a crash diet , but on Moore 's Law to enable more cores to fit onto each die .
It seems that from Intel 's perspective , there 's no need to start throwing hardware overboard in order to keep the core 's size down , because core sizes will shrink as transistor sizes shrink .
This talk of shrinking core sizes brings me to my next point about Core : scalability .
The Pentium 4's performance was designed to scale primarily with clockspeed increases .
In contrast , Core 's performance will scale primarily with increases in the number of cores per die ( i.e. feature size shrinks ) and with the addition of more cache , and secondarily with modest , periodic clockspeed increases .
In this respect , Core is designed to take advantage of Moore 's Law in a fundamentally different way than the Pentium 4 .

Massachusetts raised its minimum wage last week and for Felicita Rivera that inspires a simple hope : that she 'll be able to keep her head above water financially .
For the past seven years , her pay at the small manufacturing plant where she works was stuck at the state minimum of $ 6.75 an hour , she says .
The new state floor of $ 7.50 an hour means an extra $ 100 or so each month .
But for Mrs. Rivera it 's more about trying to stay even than trying to get ahead .
The rent on her apartment is set to rise in February , also by $ 100 a month .
The experience of this worker , and this state , hints at the kinds of results that America can expect from a hike in the federal minimum wage .
In Congress , Democratic leaders have planned a House vote Wednesday for the first such raise in a decade .
Debates over raising the minimum wage usually go something like this : Supporters say it will improve the standard of living for low - wage workers .
Foes warn that it will force businesses to raise prices for their goods and services and employ fewer people .
While there 's some truth in both arguments , the larger reality is that most changes in the minimum wage are relatively modest , and so are the results .
For example : After 19 years working at the minimum hourly rate in the same factory , Rivera has n't lost her job , even though the wage floor has risen several times .
But she also does n't feel her standard of living has improved .
Similarly , for the state of Massachusetts , the economy has n't imploded , despite seven years with a minimum wage 31 percent above the federal floor of $ 5.15 .
But poverty has n't disappeared , either .
" Both critics and advocates of the minimum wage have exaggerated its effects , " says Isabel Sawhill , an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
" It does n't do a great deal of harm .
At the same time , it 's no panacea for the low earnings of less - skilled workers . "
This view , shared by many economists , does n't mean that setting the wage floor is merely symbolic .
When the wage floor is raised , workers at the bottom of the pay ladder , like Rivera , see a direct and immediate rise in purchasing power .
And employers like Mark Waxler face new costs , which can push up consumer prices and curb the creation of new jobs .
Mr. Waxler runs the 73 - room Beechwood Hotel in Worcester , a couple of miles from where Rivera works .
" Everything does affect prices , " he says , whether it's a jump in energy costs or higher labor costs .
He says the 20 housekeepers and dishwashers on his staff are paid at least $ 8 an hour currently , so his payroll costs did n't jump last week as the state law kicked in .
But as workers at the bottom of the state 's income ladder get a raise , dishwashers and housekeepers at the Beechwood could be expecting higher pay , too .
Moreover , by next year , the Massachusetts minimum wage is set to rise again , to $ 8 an hour .
At that point , if all low - wage workers are earning close to what Waxler pays , his salaries may need to rise to retain the quality of staff he wants .
The result : Guests would face higher room rates .
And if wages rise too much , the impact on businesses could widen .
" You can only increase pricing so much " before it affects hotel occupancy and dining - room sales , Waxler says .
" You end up having to cut people or cut services just to survive . "
He 's not opposed to a wage floor .
" You do n't want anybody to have to worry about poverty , " he says .
Waxler is simply pointing out that there 's no free lunch for the economy .
A central tenet of economics holds that markets find an equilibrium of supply and demand .
When the price of something goes up , demand goes down and a new equilibrium is reached .
This rule is n't repealed when politicians pass a minimum - wage hike , labor - market experts say .
Higher costs for low - wage workers mean that employers hire fewer of them .
This happens gradually , not so much due to layoffs as to slower job creation .
" It 's hard to find workers who lost their jobs " because of a boost in minimum pay , says David Neumark , an economist at the University of California at Irvine .
When the minimum wage rises , " it 's not just free manna from heaven , " says Tom MaCurdy , a Stanford University economist affiliated with the conservative Hoover Institution .
Prices of goods must rise as a result , he says , and often those are the very goods that low - wage workers buy .
Some other costs may also fall on low - wage workers themselves , if employers respond by eliminating jobs or cutting spending on benefits and training .
Still , when all the effects are tallied up , economists say that the lowest - wage workers do get a real pay raise .
A pay raise – and a rent increase
For Rivera , the latest increase comes at a crucial time , just before her monthly rent jumps from $ 656 to $ 760 .
Few US workers stay in minimum - wage jobs for as long as she has worked at the small assembly plant near her home .
" I stay because I do n't know much English , " she says through an interpreter .
" And I can walk there , so I do n't have to pay for the bus . "
The Puerto Rico native has raised five children , and still has two teenage sons at home .
Ever since her husband died eight years ago , she 's been living on her own income plus a Social Security check , which she gets as a widow .
Active with an organization called Neighbor to Neighbor , she testified at the Massachusetts State House to push for the pay hike she is now getting .
But she knows , also , that her employer , Customatic , can only afford to pay so much .
At some point , she worries , her job could disappear or move overseas .
To be sure , not everyone on minimum wage is poor .
The low - wage workforce also includes many people – teens or adults – who live in households with other breadwinners .
A broader array of policies would be needed to reduce poverty in the US , economists say .
Dr. Sawhill of Brookings says these include a higher earned - income tax credit , child - care assistance for working parents , and programs to encourage marriage and discourage teen pregnancy .
Promoting more work hours is a major piece of the puzzle .
" If the heads of poor households worked as much as the heads of nonpoor households , it would have quite a dramatic effect , " probably a 40 percent reduction in poverty , she says .
But a higher minimum wage is also part of her proposed package .
To many people , experts and nonexperts alike , the minimum represents a moral imperative .
" We need to have a floor , " says Noah Berger of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center in Boston .
" People who work full time to support a family should be able to do so . "
What might a national minimum of $ 7.25 mean for the economy ?
One economist , George Treyz , recently revved up his computer models of the economy in a bid to find out .
The firm he heads , Regional Economic Models Inc. in Amherst , Mass. , specializes in such forecasts .
His model suggests some of the complex ripple effects – and the possible magnitude of changes .
The study predicts that , two years after the minimum of $ 7.25 goes into effect , total employment in the US would fall by 0.17 percent .
That 's roughly the loss of one job in every 600 .
The pay gain for workers affected by the wage hike might approach 8 percent .
" It 's a significant redistribution of income " to several million low - wage workers , Mr. Treyz says .
Meanwhile , " there is some very small amount that it costs people in general " throughout the economy .
Wage hike would nudge up prices
The pay raise would push up consumer prices by 0.35 percent .
That would make it harder for US companies to sell exports overseas .
The upshot :
Thanks to inflation and weaker trade performance , the nation 's real disposable income would fall slightly , by 0.14 percent .
The impacts of a minimum - wage hike would be much bigger in some states than others , Treyz found .
The smallest effects would show up in places like Massachusetts , which already have wage floors higher than $ 5.15 per hour .
While he has used forecasting techniques , other economists have tried to understand the minimum wage by analyzing the track record of real - life data .
Despite opportunities to compare states with high minimum wages and those at $ 5.15 an hour , researchers have had a hard time pinning down the precise effects of a wage hike .
In any given state , the course of jobs , incomes , and prices is driven by many forces , and the minimum wage generally has only a bit part to play .
For Waxler 's part , he says the health of the overall economy is what 's driven him to add or cut jobs in the hotel business over the past 27 years , not changes in the minimum wage .
But the higher the minimum goes , the greater the dampening effect on jobs , says Rebecca Blank of the National Poverty Center in Ann Arbor , Mich .
Still , " it 's not nearly as costly as economists used to think , " says David Autor , a labor expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge .
This is done by some entrepreneurs at the University of Illinois and the school does n’t seem too pleased .
But you can be sure in today ’s age there will be other schools doing the same thing — exploiting their women !
It ’s a disgrace .
That said this is not necessarily the way to attract more women into engineering , especially if they think they ’ll have to become pinups .
I suggest a hunky calendar showing the men of engineering .
Uh , maybe not .
TaxGeek 2007
April 15 , 2008 : TaxGeek07.04 has been released to address certain usability issues ( yes , you may now validate your SSNs ) and deal with the ever troublesome Schedule D. This release supercedes all prior releases for tax year 07 .
April 8 , 2008 : tg07.03.patch2 has been issued to address various issues with TaxGeek07.03 .
Please first download TaxGeek07.03 .
Install it , and then download and apply and patch .
This supercedes tg07.03.patch1 .
March 27 , 2008 : TaxGeek07.03 has been released as a bugfix release to TaxGeek07.02 .
Major changes include better support for overrides on Form 1040 , a config.sh script that is more robust , and improvements to Form 2441 .
New users or individuals with config.sh errors should download this version , whereas other users of TaxGeek07.02 can download the patch tg07.02.
patch1 which is the equivalent .
Thanks to all testers ( especially crowbert and trousermonkey ) for their hard work .
TaxGeek is a Mozilla - based US income tax program that includes Form 1040 , Schedules A , B , C , C - EZ , D , E , K - 1 ( 1065 ) , R , and many other forms ( see list below ) .
Most of the forms that are not directly supported are included as context - sensitive links to PDFs on the IRS website .
TaxGeek will do many of the calculations required in filing your income tax and print the results to PDF format .
E- Filing is not supported at this time .
It can use tax - tables , tax - formula , and the qualified dividends and capital gains methods .
It has many of the supporting worksheets for 1040 implemented and working and many of the supporting worksheets for schedules and forms that are supported .
The TaxGeek UI is based on the IRS forms only , and in that sense it is not user friendly as the interview - based tax programs .
However , because of its calculation ability and the context sensitive forms , it should still be many times easier to use than doing taxes by hand or spreadsheet .
TaxGeek was written in response to the demand for an Open Sourced US Federal Income Tax program that works on GNU / Linux based computers .
It is by no means complete , but may serve to help you file your 2007 income taxes if your life is not * too* complicated .
Plans are in the works to release a 2008 version next year and to possibly create state versions ( at least PA - cause that 's where I live ) .
ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEES ARE OFFERED .
If you have a ton of money riding on finding all the right loopholes and getting everything 100 % perfect , buy a tax program or use an accountant .
However , if you 'd like to alpha test this , be my guest and enjoy .

Some classical instruments are worth as much as £ 30,000 Strict security measures at UK airports are having a " devastating impact " on musicians , says the Musicians ' Union .
It says its members " are reporting significant lost earnings " because they are unable to take their instruments on board aircraft as hand luggage .
Many instruments are too fragile to be placed in the hold of an airliner , the union told the BBC News website .
But the Department for Transport says the security regulations will " be in place for as long as they need to be " .
Under the rules , passengers are allowed one item of cabin baggage , which must be no larger than a laptop bag .
A spokeswoman at the Department for Transport said instruments would have to be checked into the hold until the security situation was downgraded .
' Valuable and delicate ' US duo Marcolivia say they may have to leave their violins in the UK US violin duo Marc Ramirez and Olivia Hajioff , who play together as Marcolivia , contacted the BBC to tell how they had been affected by the restrictions .
" We have been in Europe this summer performing at various music festivals , " wrote Hajioff .
" We are planning to return to the States on 27 August , but have been informed by the airline and by the Department for Transport that we will not be able to take our violins with us into the cabin .
" Our violins are extremely valuable and delicate , " she continued .
" There is no way that we , or any other serious musician , could consider putting them in the hold .
" This means that we would have to return home without our instruments indefinitely . "
Slow progress The Musicians ' Union is speaking to the Department for Culture Media and Sport ( DCMS ) about the restrictions , but says progress is slow because Parliament is in recess for the summer .
" We understand that the situation is urgent and we are working very closely with the Department for Transport on this issue , " said a DCMS spokeswoman .
" We have made progress on chartered flights , but the issues surrounding commercial flights remain to be resolved .
There should be a dispensation for travelling musicians
Olivia Hajioff
Marcolivia violinist " We do also understand that this is a security situation , " she added .
In the meantime , several musicians face potential legal action for breaking contracts to perform abroad , said assistant general secretary of the Musicians ' Union , Horace Trubridge .
He says musicians cannot afford to risk putting violins or saxophones into the hold because " their instruments are often extremely valuable , with replacement costs in excess of £ 30,000 " .
" Should the current arrangements remain in place , we believe that they will have a devastating impact upon the working lives of professional musicians , " he added .
Ms Hajioff agrees .
" There should be a dispensation for travelling musicians , " she says .
" There are so few of us and it is so easy to screen the instruments carefully that I cannot see how this would be a problem . "
Airlines contacted by the BBC said they had to abide by the Department for Transport regulations .
Your comments on this story : I am a violinist .
I took my violin with me to the UK as hand luggage before the ban was imposed .
I was forced to put it in the hold on the way back .
This was terrible for me .
A guitarist on the plane had his guitar with him .
I should have been more assertive .
I cannot understand why there is not an exception for musical instruments , since they are so fragile , and vital to the musician 's life .
The number of travelling musicians must be comparatively tiny , and the amount of effort needed to look in a few instrument cases would be correspondingly small .

I am an amateur cellist and certainly would not contemplate putting my beloved cello in the hold
Stephanie Clarke , Cambridge , UK I am an amateur cellist and certainly would not contemplate putting my beloved cello in the hold .
I hope a solution is found quickly and they are soon back in the cabin where they belong .
Once they are , follow the example of a professional musician ( I forget who it was ) who , in revenge for having to buy a seat for his cello , always demanded kosher food for it !
Stephanie Clarke , Cambridge , UK
Last time we returned from a USA tour by plane all the larger instruments had to go in the hold ( all packed well and clearly marked as fragile ) .
Imagine our horror when we landed in England and watched from the airport as every instrument was thrown from the plane onto the luggage truck .
Four out of approximately 20 instruments were damaged ( as well as several cases ) , and the airline initially refused to take responsibility until we pointed out we had witnessed the whole thing !
Helen
The whole basis of the restrictions is ridiculous .
This is a political tool to make it look as though Government is doing something .
Simply put , if there is a substantial risk to aviation , nothing should be allowed on board ( hold or cabin ) unless it can be positively cleared .
Otherwise we have to accept a degree of risk ( as we had before this " alert " was raised ) .
Remember , the security services were aware of this " risk " for weeks before we were all stopped a the car park .
It is all smoke and mirrors to make the politicians look better .

It 's the damage inflicted by temperature which is a major issue
Simon , London
It 's not only the danger of damage from the instruments being knocked about , it 's the damage inflicted by temperature which is a major issue .
Extreme cold will more than likely split the wood , or possibly damage the valves of many instruments .
Then , going from the cold to the heat will more than likely warp the wood , making them unplayable .
Sadly , it is n't as simple as packing instruments in a flight case .
Simon , London
Whilst there is a problem separating musicians fro their valuable instruments , surely there is a fair compromise .
The Airlines should offer adequate compensation for valuable items that are placed in their care ?
I have spent far to much time watching baggage staff throw cases , marked fragile or otherwise into and out of holds .
We who work in Rock and Roll spend a fortune on flight cases and excess baggage , and these cases are regularly damaged in transit .
All we ask is fair compensation .
ciz , London , England
This issue is not just one that has just come up .
As an amateur violist , I am faced with this problem every time I travel , especially with budget airlines .
Even if you speak to someone beforehand and get their consent , it 's a different matter once you arrive at the airport .
And it 's not just a question of the turbulence or rough handling of the instruments , the temperature and humidity of the hold can cause enormous damage to instruments .
In the case of stringed instruments , the wood can warp and crack causing hundreds if not thousands of pounds worth of damage .
I am lucky that I do not have to rely on music for a living , but I know many people who face this nightmare several times a year .
Jennifer , Birmingham , UK Even proper flight cases do not guarantee protection
Malcolm Clark , Derby
As an amateur ' cellist I do understand the delicacy and values of string instruments in particular .
Sadly , even proper flight cases do not guarantee protection .
The suggestion of instruments being handled as " cargo " rather than " baggage " has potential merits .
It must be within the capabilities of the Airlines , Insurance Companies , and the Musicians Union to work together on that one and come up with a solution .
I 'm sure that one is needed because I can't imagine it being too long before other countries insist on similarly stringent hand - baggage restrictions .
Malcolm Clark , Derby I have work experience with aviation security in America , and am aware of how luggage is handled .
If your luggage can't tolerate a corner - first drop of several feet onto a concrete floor from time to time , you should n't check it into the hold .
Harry Erwin , PhD , Sunderland UK ( and US ) I have an acoustic guitar , which I love so much .
I will surely buy a good flight case at any cost for that instrument because it means a lot to me .
People , you 've got to understand that these rules are for you own life sake .
Either grow up or decide not to fly for as long as these rules are still operating .
Kojo , London
I recently came back from Germany and my suitcase had been crushed in the corner and resulted in a bugle in my case being damaged .
I contacted the insurance company and was aghast to be told musical instruments are not covered if they are in the hold - neither are other valuables i.e. cameras .
Had I sat on it in the departure lounge or dropped it , it would have been covered .
So it is no wonder musicians and other professionals are reluctant to not put items in the hold
Steve Konarski , Manchester England
There was a cellist on my flight to Belfast on Monday who had no problems getting it in the cabin , and stored at the front of the plane .
For those travelling to the States I 'd probably suggest flying out to Schipol / Charles De Gaule and then back over to America .
OR fly to Canada and then a local flight into the states .
Steve , Belfast / London
If authorities make an exception here , they will be pushed into making other exceptions
Elin , Manchester
My instrument is moderately valuable - I 've travelled with my violin by air before and have always insisted on taking it into the cabin .
In October I 'm supposed to be taking it to play at a friend 's wedding but unless the rules are relaxed by then I 'll be leaving it at home - it 's not worth the risk .
I do n't at all support the ban on taking instruments into the cabin but I imagine that if authorities make an exception here , they will be pushed into making other exceptions - at least the blanket ' 1 piece ' rule is simple to implement at the moment .
Elin , Manchester
This story breaks my heart .
Once upon a time , about 10 years ago , I was a cellist .
An airline , which shall remain nameless , reneged on their prior agreement to allow me to take my $ 30,000 cello into the cabin , to be stored in the first class area .
When I got to the airport , I was told I would either have to place the instrument in the hold or fly without it .
I was a student in the US flying home for Christmas , I had no money and an impossible decision to make .
I made the wrong one .
I was told the cello would be hand carried off of the plan and handed to me ...
It came out on the conveyor belt .
It was totally smashed to pieces .
I was in such a state they had to allow my mother through customs and into the baggage area to literally pick me up off of the floor .
I was too devastated to ever play again - I had grown up with the ' cello and not only could we not afford another , I would n't touch another .
My heart goes out to those musicians caught up in this fiasco ( that 's another story ) and am yet again gobsmacked by the sledgehammer of blanket bureaucracy .
Candice Madison , London
While I 'm not a professional musician ( by a long way ! )
I often travel with my concertina .
In order to take this in an unpressurised hold of an aircraft a strong , shock - proof case , as suggested in one of the comments , is not sufficient , as I would also need to dismantle the instrument to prevent the valves or bellows being destroyed by pressure differences .
I would hate to be a professional box player with the current regulations .
Tom Goodale , Cardiff , UK
Our instruments have an intrinsic cultural value and uniqueness that make them an exception
JM , London I am a professional violinist living in London and would like to point out that although it is a similar situation for other professions , I would be very surprised if any other equipment that people carry on to a plane can be valued in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of pounds .
Optical equipment such as cameras etc. are factory produced and made in numbers .
Our instruments have an intrinsic cultural value and uniqueness that make them an exception .
JM , London I am originally from Britain and got married and Britain , my parents are coming to visit me in the US and were planning to bring over my wedding album , which I have n't seen yet , and my violin .
I am desperate to have these things , but I also believe that I would rather have my parents on a secure flight with proper security checks , where security people were not trying to rush through because they are checking various items .
Unfortunate as this situation is , would n't we all prefer security of ourselves and our instruments over having what we want for ourselves !
Ruth , Boston Insuring a Stradivarius , even if possible , does not mean a thing .
There are only a few hundred exceedingly valuable violins around the world .
They can not be replaced .
Nobody will ever build anything like them .
Ever . Professional classical musicians are few .
Why could they not register in advance with the police , and apply for an official document proving that their instrument is a bona fide item ?
That seems to me considerably less complex and expensive than all manners of administrative hassles we are already submitted to .
Robert Marchenoir , Paris , France
It 's not just musicians that are affected .
I know of an antique dealer that sells old jewellery , which he always takes with him as hand baggage .
Now , his entire transatlantic trade is cancelled .

How do you lose a crated double bass ?
Melissa , Canada
This reminded me of a friend who plays the double bass professionally and arrived home in Canada from a tour to find the airline lost his double bass .
He gave it to them crated , well protected and well marked .
How do you lose a crated double bass ?
It would take two people to try and move it .
Since the double bass , he has lost 2 electric basses .
He fights to take his instrument on board but size issues prevent him .
Melissa , Canada
I am a Saxophonist and every time I travel I always go through a ridiculous routine at baggage check - in of being told I can not take the instrument as hand luggage .
I always insist and by the time I get to the plane it is never an issue .
These instruments are too fragile and expensive to have thrown in a hold and I would sympathise with my fellow musicians over the current situation .
I would agree that the inspection of such items should be very easy and to bar them from the overhead luggage is ridiculous .
Richard Woodling , Fordingbridge Hants .
Al Capone always had a violin case with him but that does n't mean he played it very well .
Use a courier like everyone else has to do when they need to send something valuable .
matt , uk I 'm a cellist by profession and I will travel to the UK - by boat !
To put the instrument into the hold of an airplane is absolutely out of the question .
In the above article the value of classical instruments is said to be as much as £ 30,000 .
Adding an 0 and putting the prize up to £ 300,000 would come closer to the real value of some old Italian violins or cellos .
Besides that , there is the uniqueness of the sound and quality of each instrument through which a musician expresses himself , that cannot be replaced , should the instrument suffer damage .
Cornelia Hahn , Switzerland
The current restrictions are preventing me from taking assignments abroad
Simon , Ipswich I am not a musician , but I am a sports photographer , I used to take my most expensive lenses on as hand baggage , as a large precision instrument , I too cannot consider subjecting it to the " forces " of hold baggage , as replacement costs are around £ 8000 .
The current restrictions are preventing me from taking assignments abroad , and most of my work is Surf / Windsurf / Kitesurf related , I am gutted to be turning work down because of current threat levels .
Simon , Ipswich
There is a very easy and obvious way around this - get on a train or ferry to mainland Europe and then catch a flight from there !
If travelling is that important , a slight inconvenience or increase in journey time can be accepted .
Karl Johnson , Thetford , Norfolk
As a musician I feel this is a ridiculous state of affairs .
I fully understand as a violist why professional musicians choose to take their instrument into the cabin ; in fact on returning from Kuwait two years ago I did exactly the same thing .
This is not a sustainable policy .
Nigel James , Fordsham , Cheshire , UK I 'm a guitarist , and I 'm due to fly out for a concert next week .
There is n't a problem with having the guitar in the hold , but the airline I am travelling on are now charging extra for any extra hold items - so I have to pay extra for the privilege of being able to have a change of clothes whilst I 'm away !
lee , London , UK I am an undergraduate student studying at the University of Nottingham , and am currently spending the summer back in Singapore .
I am very worried about the regulations regarding instruments .
I brought my violin back with me for summer , but now , I understand that I may not be able to bring it back when the new academic year commences .
I play in the University 's orchestra , and music is very much part of my life .
I am sure that many musicians will agree that they are very attached to their instruments , and just one day not playing it makes us feel uncomfortable .
As the orchestra that I join is an auditioned one , I am worried that by not being able to bring my violin over means not being able to take part in the auditions , or even play in the orchestra at all .

They should easily be able to pack it for shipping and insure it if they wish
B Harrison , Louisville , Ky I have worked in the express cargo shipping industry for quite some time and believe many of these claims that the hold is prone to error to be quite unfounded .
While it would be absurd for the musician to pack the instrument in a simple carrying case and place it into the hold , they should have the capabilities to package the instrument in such a way that it would survive the turbulent environment .
They may wish to contract with the airliner to actually store the instrument in the hold with an insured value , perhaps in the section of the plane where the airliner is shipping cargo as opposed to the luggage bins .
In any event , they should easily be able to pack it for shipping and insure it if they wish .
B Harrison , Louisville Ky I work for one of London 's main orchestras .
Taking the orchestra on tour will be nearly impossible if no instruments may be taken into the cabin .
The Department of Transport cannot expect musicians to put irreplaceable instruments costing tens of thousands of pounds ( and often antiques ! ) in the hold .
FK , London
As a serious amateur musician I take my French Horn with me on business trips to practice .
Earlier this year I was stopped returning from Toronto and my horn swabbed .
I had a very uncomfortable 15 minutes with security after their testing equipment showed that the grease and oil on it showed explosive properties .
After offering to play , which was declined , I was allowed to take my horn onboard .
I wo n't be taking it on my next trip .
Andrew Osborne , Teddington , UK I 'm travelling to Ireland to get married in early September , and had arranged for a friend to come over with his Cello to play in the church , for which he'd bought an extra ticket on the plane .
However , it 's now looking like he's not going to be able to bring it over because of the new regulations .
I do n't understand exactly what these regulations are supposed to prevent .
Ca n't the same security procedures be carried out on luggage taken in the cabin as on luggage taken in the hold ?
Scott , London I 'm a cellist - I always book an extra seat for my cello when I fly because it 's too big for the overhead lockers and I would n't consider putting it in the hold .
I wonder if this approach will still work ?
As the airline will be getting double money from me , I suspect it will ...
FB , London Everybody wants to be an exception
Ian , Winterley , UK Everybody wants to be an exception .
I am a TV cameraman who prefers to travel with my camera as carry - on luggage .
I would assert that my camera is at least as expensive and delicate as any musician 's fiddle or trumpet , yet I do n't bleat about special dispensation .
Buy a well - made hermetically - sealed flight - case for your instruments and they 'll be fine .
The rules are there for a reason ; grow up and get on with it !!!!
Ian , Winterley , UK Re : Ian 's comments .
I 've travelled often with my cello , valued at over £ 20,000 and have had to let it go in the hold , and yes , have bought a hermetically sealed flight case ( costing over £ 1000 ) which guarantees its safety if the flight crews handle it with respect .
Unfortunately , although you can take the cello to the gate , check that it is carefully put on to the plane by hand , there are a couple of things that you can't control .
One is the temperature at 30000 feet - if the plane has no heated livestock hold , the temperatures are near zero and that is terrible for any stringed instrument and can cause cracks in the wood which in turn cause the instrument to play with a loud buzzing sound .
Secondly , there is no control over the baggage handling staff at the other end .
I 've seen my cello put carefully on the plane at Heathrow , only to see it literally thrown from the hold onto the concrete at the other end .
Fortunately , there were only minor cracks that time , but this was far from an isolated incident and every crack devalues the instrument and can permanently affect the sound .
I do n't think telling concerned musicians to " grow up " is very helpful .
We 're not making a fuss about nothing .
Annelies , Guildford UK
I live in France and was returning home form concerts in England last week and had to leave my flute in London .
Now that one is allowed again one piece of hand luggage , I will have to return to pick it up .
There should be a special arrangement for professional musicians who need to carry their instruments on board .
We will have to start cancelling performances if this situation continues .
Pamina Blum , Nice , France
The problem affects all kind of musicians , even those who play electronic instruments like myself .
Synthesisers or similar electronic can also be extremely valuable , rare ; one offs even and fragile , all of which makes them completely unsuitable to put in the hold .
If a business man 's laptop can be scanned at security control , then surely electronic instruments should pose no greater problems than these .
mat dalgleish , Birmingham UK Baggage handlers for hold luggage can clearly be seen to have little finesse
Alan , Whitby UK
I have a hand made guitar in Spain which is a fragile object and obviously the person who made it took almost half a year to produce this instrument .
The cost is not something that the airlines would compensate for , and the baggage handlers for hold luggage can clearly be seen to have little finesse in handling delicate baggage .
To transport the instrument home I could not rely on the airlines to have any duty of care and we can clearly see from experience that the government have little experience in sophisticated legislation .
I will have to make alternative transport arrangements , but for professional musicians this is a nightmare for which there is a solution , but the blunt instruments used by the authorities in their rule making are not any help .
It 's sad but the standards we have to endure .
When will we get value for money from government ?
Alan , Whitby UK
This is definitely having an effect on musicians .
I run a 10 piece band that will be performing at Electric Picnic in Rep Ire next month and we are looking to pay extra money for each instrument we want to take , and these still have to be put in the hold .
My musicians are using expensive and sentimental instruments such as Trumpets and Trombones and are not at all up for leaving these in the hold when in the past they have travelled with them as hand luggage , something needs to be done .
James , London UK
I play the violin and bouzouki ( not an instrument you want to announce at airport security ! ) , and living on an island I regularly struggle with taking my instrument on planes .
Its never been easy , with expensive spare strings confiscated as possible weapons , struggles with check - in staff as to whether or not the instrument will fit in the overhead luggage ...
With a trip planned to the states next month and a brand new instrument worth around £ 3 k , I 'm not looking forward to these new restrictions .
Unless there are some exceptions for musicians , or guarantees on how the instruments are handled , people wont be able to see live performers from other countries which is a big shame .
Adam , Isle of Man I am going on a school tour in a week , and it currently looks to be jeopardised
Lily I am going on a school tour in a week , and it currently looks to be jeopardised , as not only are people unwilling to put their instruments in the hold , there is also a lack of rental hard instrument cases for cellos and the like , because they are going to the professionals .
Although we have contacted the airline , there looks to be no way we can take the instruments on as hand luggage .
We completely understand why all these restrictions are in place , but it is disappointing that we may now not be able to go on tour .
Lily I am a professional musician and am due to fly to Amsterdam next week for a concert .
I am having to find alternative transport due to the fact that the government has placed these restrictions on us all .
I can assure you that many string instruments are worth far more than £ 30,000 !
My violin would never be able to go into the hold as it is 225 years old and sensitive to cold and being knocked around - plus it would not be insured .
We have always suffered from ignorant check - in staff telling us that we can't take our instruments on board ( and after an argument they are persuaded ) but this is a totally ridiculous restriction and I am thanking my lucky stars that I only have to travel to Amsterdam and not further afield in the near future .
Jack Liebeck , London Jack Liebeck is utterly correct in saying that insurance would simply not pay out for an act of stupidity such as placing a violin / viola / cello in the hold .
The cameramen out there are in a very different situation as their equipment is easily insurable and replaceable .
Each string instrument is unique and worth immeasurably more .
To compare a Stradivarius or del Gesu to a Canon is rather silly .
It is not about " growing up " , it is about appreciating the historical and cultural value of these rare string instruments .
I play with orchestras in London , and these groups , along with quartets and soloists such as Mr. Liebeck are being hit very hard .
Getting the ferry or train to mainland Europe and flying from there is an option we are all going for , but sadly it has just been announced that our anti-culture government is persuading all other EU countries to adopt identical measures !
Touring is an inescapable part of our lives , and this thoughtless ban is threatening our livelihoods .

7 Reasons to Quit your Job Daniel
In October 2005 I received a degree in International Economics , and straight out of the university I went to work for a large multinational company .
It is was the most obvious path for me to follow ; my parents encouraged me to do so , and my friends were doing it also .
After one year , however , I was not so sure that this was the right choice for me .
The more I thought about it , the more I wanted to take a shot and work on personal projects .
Late in 2006 I finally decided to run after my dreams .
I quit my job , moved from Italy back to Brazil , and started to work full time with my blogs and other entrepreneurial projects , most of them related to the Internet .
Below you will find 7 reasons that motivated me to take this decision .
I had already written about those factors on another blog , but I decided to publish it on Daily Blog Tips as well because there are probably many bloggers on the same situation that I was , check it out :
1 . If I will need to work my arse off , I ’d rather do it for something that I own : I firmly believe that hard work is the foundation of success .
Even if you consider supposed geniuses like great musicians or writers , history shows that behind each and every one of them there was an incredible amount of hard work .
There is no easy way out and there are no shortcuts .
So , if that is the case , it is clear that I will need to work damn hard no matter what I choose to do in life .
Why not work that hard for my own self then ?
2 . Should you hit the jackpot with an idea , its your company that will collect most of the profits :
Most people think that working for an organization is less risky than having your own business .
The reasoning is right to a certain extent .
After all , a standard job offers a secure pay check at the end of the month .
This means that your income has a lower boundary , it will not go below a certain level no matter what .
The problem , however , is that this security comes at the expense of limited earning potential .
This means that your income will also have an upper boundary .
It will not go above a certain level no matter what .
Should you come up with a brilliant idea that generate millions for your company , it is unlikely that you will share the profits .
3 . Companies pay you for your time , not for the value you create : I confess I have never understood the logic behind hourly wages .
People ’s salary should be based on the value they bring to the company on not on the number of hours they work weekly or monthly .
Some organizations offer performance based retributions , that is a beginning but it is not enough .
Think about a book .
You are willing to pay a certain price for that book because you will get some value out of it right ?
Now , it does not matter if the writer took 10 , 5 or 2 years to write the book .
The price you are willing to pay is still the same and proportional to the value the book has to you .
4. Hierarchy and politics ?
No Thanks :
Large organizations tend to be hierarchical and there is nothing you can do about it .
People are classified according to their rank or seniority rather than by the quality of their ideas or by their drive .
Sometime ago I was trying to implement the first internal blog for my division .
The first thing I did was to call directly the HQ guy who was responsible for the communications platform , and he assured me that it would take no longer than 1 week to set the blog up .
Guess what , after a couple of days I received a call from the Communications manager from our division , she wanted to “ explain to me the rules of the game ” Â ( ! ) .
Basically she told me that all the communications related requests needed to pass through her no matter what , and she would therefore take charge of the blog set up .
Two months after that call my division was still waiting for the blog .
5 . I want to work on my own terms :
Some time ago , more specifically under the industrial age , it probably made sense to get people grouped together in a single location , for a specific time span , all wearing a standard uniform .
Do the same rules apply to the information age , though ?
I do not think so .
If someday my company will grow so that I will need to hire people all I will tell them is : “ Look , I do n’t care if you work at 4 pm or in the middle of the night , at home or in the office , and if you do come to the office I do n’t care if you wear shorts and sandals just like I do n’t care if you listen to music while you work , do as you please as long as you get the job done ! ” Â .
6 . Even if you screw it up for 10 years you will still learn a lot more :
Many people told me to wait a couple of years more before starting my company .
They said that I still lacked the experience .
Well , maybe they are right and I do lack the experience .
So what ?
Even if I get every thing wrong for the first 10 years I will probably learn a lot more than if I had stayed inside a large corporation .
When you go alone you need to take all the decisions , solve all the problems and bear all the responsibility .
7 . Are you doing what you love ? :
Passion is difficult to fake , you are either doing what you love or you are not , there is no in - between .
Suppose you just won the lottery and money is not a problem anymore .
What kind of work would you still be willing to do even for free ?
Personally I would write articles to share my ideas and would pursue some entrepreneurial projects .
The question then becomes : “ Do I really need to win the lottery to start doing that ? ” Â . Hell no !
Once you realize that , it becomes much easier to drop everything else and start working on things that you really love .

Rob ooh yeah !
Right on .
I made that move two years ago and never looked back .
I think you ’ll enjoy the flip side of your list : the 7 reasons you ca n’t quit your job
Nathaniel Laiet Great article .
Spot on .
I ’ve been slogging out on my own until this year I took a job ( good offer ) but quit after only 3 weeks .
It taught me to once again really really appreciate being on my own , even though it can be hard at times .
ruud Great Points Daniel .
I love my job 🙂
Daniel “ So , gathering money by doing job and then start your own project gradually will also work . ”
Yeah this can work .
Although if you have a really good idea you can borrow money , or even bootstrap .
sarbarth Daniel ,
Minding your own business is OK .
But if a person who do n’t have enough money how can he think of his own project .
In my opinion sticking into a job for rest of life is not advisable .
So , gathering money by doing job and then start your own project gradually will also work .
Am I right ?
what do you think ?
Joie “ Some people canâ€™t possibly understand how someone would â€œgive up a good jobâ€ to take the huge risks of starting their own business .
Others ( like me ) canâ €™t fathom the idea of having to go to a job every day . ”
“ You just canâ €™t put a price on the freedom to do what you want and truly live your life – not just in the couple of hours when you get home exhausted
after a day at â€œwork ” .
TechZillo , you are sooo right !!!!!!
Joie Every reason you ’ve given is exactly why I ’ve wanted to be a business OWNER and WILL start my business within the next two years .
I ’ve worked for small companies and now work for a large multinational consulting firm .
It ’s all the same politics and *ss kissing everywhere .
I value my time and hate the idea of someone else owning it and becoming wealthy off of my time and ideas .
I went to college and became a consultant … I took the safe route .
It ’s time to take risks and fully enjoy what I do .
To hell with coporate America !
Daniel TechZillo , Dan is correct .
I quit to become an entrepreneur .
Blogs are some of my current projects , but not the only ones .
Dan and Jennfer TechZilo ,
That ’s definitely what I understood Daniel to say as well .
But just to clarify his intention , I do n’t believe he gave up anything “ for the sake of his blogs ” .
Quite the contrary , he seized an opportunity to stop working at a job ( multi national company or whatever other kind of company ) in order and pursue a path as a free entrepreneur .
Done right , blogs can be a great source of revenue .
This is however the old “ job security ” vs. entrepreneur working for yourself discussion .
There ’s no right or wrong , it ’s merely personal preference .
Some people can’t possibly understand how someone would “ give up a good job ” to take the huge risks of starting their own business .
Others ( like me ) ca n’t fathom the idea of having to go to a job every day .
You just ca n’t put a price on the freedom to do what you want and truly live your life – not just in the couple of hours when you get home exhausted after a day at “ work ” .
We ’re all different and see the world differently .
And that keeps it interesting .
🙂
Have an awesome day !
Dan
TechZilo Hmm …. you got into an MNC only to resign for the sake of your blogs ?
Rose I have to tell you that I felt exactly the same way you did !
I HATED the job that I had and I just felt that I had to get out !
Mind you starting your own business is n’t easy but working for yourself is definitely worth it !
Belmann
Paul thanks it will hrlp a lot daniel .
waiting for the next post =]
Rahel Hi Daniel , I just want to say that I think it ’s great that people can write articles on quitting one ’s job and why one should do that .
The only problem is that there are far too few articles on what one needs to do to make that switch .
For example , I make a little advertising money on my blog , mostly from sponsored links , but it ’s not nearly enough to even consider quitting my job .
In order to start a business , you have to have money , and it has to come from somewhere .
Roman Rytov
“ Your job – a time to kill , and a time to heal ” – is my blog where I contemplated the same topic :
Daniel Dan and Jennifer , thanks for stoping by .
I read both those blogs regularly , in fact Steve Pavlina was a big motivator for my decision .
Once I started earning money from this blog I went over to his page and donated part of my earnings , it was like the natural way of paying him back for the great advice he provides .
Dan and Jennifer
Madhur Kapoor Great Points Daniel .
Its very important to Love what you do
Daniel Mark , you are right about this point , I do not have any family or bills at the end of the month , that is why it was easy for me to switch also .
For someone who has a family I recognize its harder to take that decision , but doable if you plan it well .
Rory I really like point # 6 .
Who cares if mistakes are made , they are one of the best ways to learn .
We know that to be true , but to declare it so enthusiastically is inspiring .
# 4 Hierarchy and Politics ?
Grrr
inspirationbit
It ’s much easier to quit a full - time secure job for someone with no family responsibilities , but having a kid to take care I ca n’t afford any trials and errors of running my own business .
So in my case , I combine both – a full time job with the constant cash flow and benefits , and running my own business at the same time .
It ’s true that I ca n’t fully concentrate on building up my business , but once I feel I have built it enough to quit my day job , I will gladly do so .
Summer Great points , Daniel .
Especially # 7 .
Life ’s a little easier when you ’re doing what you love , and what comes naturally to you .
Thanks for the thoughts .
Mark Alves Another fascinating post , Daniel .
Did your current level of family responsibilities or commitments factor into your decision ?
Ben Evert I ’m close to doing the same thing .
I think these Pink Floyd lyrics say it all .
We do n’t need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey !
Teachers !
Leave them kids alone !
All in all it ’s just another brick in the wall .
All in all you ’re just another brick in the wall .
Faith I agree and yet , one year ago after working for myself for 3 years and having to deal with things like California ’s worker ’s comp system and payroll , I sold my business and went back to non-profit .
I say go for it .
Love every minute of it .
Then sell it for as much as you possibly can and take some satisfaction that someone else pays your benefits .
Jacob Share Great list .
I always knew that I wanted to work for myself , but until I was downsized last year , I had never felt ready .
This crisatunity will likely end up being the best thing to happen to me .
One thing ’s for sure – I ’m enjoying my work today much more than for my previous employer and frankly it was n’t such a bad job .
Daniel Bez , interesting complements on your points !
AL , I wish you all the best on the transition , you will see that its worth it .
AL Very inspiring .
I connected with every point you made .
I think I ’m onto this path , hopefully soon enough .
Mike Spot on , Daniel .
I probably learnt more from running my own business for 2 years in the 80’s than I did from chasing the corporate dollar for the whole of the 90’s .
Great article .
Bes Z
Thanks for sharing Daniel !
This should help people tremendously .
1 : Interesting point .
You will probably be more motivated when you are in charge of things .
2 : You are right .
If you work for a company , it is hard to share the extra profits that come in .
3 : This is an excellent point !
Only the CEO ’s and the presidents at most companies get extra bonuses for bringing in more profit or meeting certain goals , even if it was the low level employee who worked hard to make such goals achievable .
4 : This is one of the strongest points .
However , once you are in your own running field , you also have to learn some politics in order to communicate with others who depend on hierarchy and politics to convey messages .
5 : This is the biggest advertised benefit for having your own business or personal source of income .
You can work anytime from anywhere .
It ’s funny how getting up at 5 for a normal job may seem sad for many , but being up till 5 and waking up again after a few hours to work on a blog or your own online services feels good .
😀
I am guessing many companies who have a very healthy and communicative atmosphere also draw such attention as people love to feel they are at ease instead of feeling they are under strict management .
6 : My first business models around 2001 and 2002 ended up being a disaster for me .
I created some online services and businesses and got a partner afterwards to help me manage the incoming traffic and customers .
The partner turned out to be after selling everything and getting some cash .
I wanted things to continue on a long term basis .
In the end , things did not work out and I considered my efforts to have died and the services / businesses closing down while my partner considered things a success because of the money made along the way and moving on .
7 : This is the best point in my view .
I love what I am doing .
I just hope money comes in on its own , as I do not want to change my passion or love in order to bring in money .
Having strict principles is one thing , but changing the game repeatedly to make money is another .
All we needs is a good marketer within ourselves to convert our love into something that helps different aspects of our blogs / business / work / efforts .
Thanks for sharing Daniel , this was a nice tip , or tips , to be more precise .

Sperm can carry HIV
The French work in the American Journal of Pathology suggests the gonads provide an ideal environment for the Aids virus to replicate itself .
Evidence shows even the best antiretrovirals find it difficult to penetrate the testes .
This may explain why HIV can still be found in the semen of men on drugs that successfully clear their blood of it .
Infected semen
The team say their work could help with the development of new antiretrovirals that can target HIV in the gonads .
This is particularly important given that sexual transmission is one of the main ways HIV is spread from person to person .
According to the most recent World Health Organization data , 39.5 million people are infected with HIV .
Dr Nathalie Dejucq - Rainsford and colleagues from Rennes University examined testicular tissue .
They discovered certain immune cells had the necessary machinery to allow HIV safe passage .
These cells , called macrophages , had all of the required receptors - CD4 , CXCR4 , CCR5 , and DC - SIGN - to bind HIV .
Closer inspection revealed HIV was making copies of itself within the testicular macrophages .
For the moment , condoms remain the best method of preventing HIV during sexual intercourse
A spokesman from Avert
When they took some more of the testicular tissue and grew it in the lab , they found HIV was able to thrive there and was capable of infecting other cells .
The study authors explained : " Although highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) may achieve undetectable virus levels in the blood , virus replication in the testis may permit continued spread of the virus .
" The infected cells appeared to be testicular macrophages located within the interstitial tissue . "
A spokesman from Avert said : " It has long been known that the testes act as a reservoir for HIV , but this is the first piece of research that really demonstrates exactly why this is the case .
" If methods developed by these researchers were to result in new products that could suppress HIV replication within the testes , then this would represent an exciting advance in prevention technology .
" However , it seems unlikely that these would be available any time in the foreseeable future , so for the moment , condoms remain the best method of preventing HIV during sexual intercourse . "
Sparrow knocks over 23,000 dominoes before being shot
AMSTERDAM , Netherlands ( AP ) 
A sparrow knocked over 23,000 dominoes in the Netherlands , nearly ruining a world record attempt before it was shot to death Monday , the state news agency reported .
The unfortunate bird flew through an open window at an exposition center in the northern city of Leeuwarden where employees of television company Endemol NV have worked for weeks setting up more than 4 million dominoes in an attempt to break the official Guinness World Record for falling dominoes on Friday night .
Only a system of 750 built - in gaps in the chain prevented the bird from knocking most or all of the dominoes over ahead of schedule , " Domino Day " organizers were quoted as saying by the NOS news agency .
The bird was shot by an exterminator with an air rifle while cowering in a corner .
The organizers are out to break their own record of 3,992,397 dominoes set last year with a record of 4,321,000 .

As we all know , Apple 's new " Get A Mac " campaign has been making waves , both good and bad , since it started airing a couple of months ago on TV and making its rounds on the web .
One of the more recent ads , titled " Touché " features our favorite two actors ( the " Mac " and the " PC " ) bantering about how the PC can run Windows , but the Mac can run OS X ... and Windows .
The PC then declares " touché , " to which the Mac decides that he is making improper use of the term since the PC had never made a point to begin with for the Mac to counter - point .
Touché , Mac guy , touché .
Anyway .
The " Touché " ad used to make note in small type at the bottom of the screen that in order for the snarky Mac guy—er , your Mac — to run Windows , that merely " Purchase of Windows XP required , " which most people assumed to imply that Apple wanted you to use their own Boot Camp .
However , the folks over at MacObserver have observed ( * chuckle * ) that the ad seems to have changed , with the reference in the ad changing from a generic " Windows required " message to Windows and Parallels !
( MacObserver seems to believe that the ad originally said Boot Camp , but many readers disagree . )
The Get A Mac website also has references to Parallels on it .
While it 's always been well - known ever since Boot Camp was originally announced that Apple had plans to incorporate such technology into the next major release of OS X , Leopard , this new heavy pimping of Parallels is taking some of us by surprise .
At the very least , the strong relationship seems to indicate some sort of partnership between the two companies , even if the partnership is only for mutual publicity , but it could possibly mean much more .
It seems like Apple is pushing Parallels very heavily lately , even over Boot Camp , which makes some Mac fans wonder whether Apple may have a Parallels - like solution up their sleeves coming up soon .
Some of our Ars staff , however , believes that to be untrue , as Apple does n't often like to pimp non-Apple products ( particularly software ) unless Apple has no plans for duplicating their efforts .
While many have wished for Apple to create their own virtualization software for Windows , perhaps Apple believes that Parallels has already done a bang - up job and thinks that the two companies can help each other out .
Do our readers have any thoughts as to whether Apple 's infatuation with Parallels indicates partnership , or secret sabotage ?
Suppose your child misbehaves right in front of you , but you say nothing .
Or suppose you manage people at work , and you notice one of your underlings making a serious mistake , but you do n’t bother to bring it to his / her attention .
That ’s silent approval .
Obviously there are problems when using silent approval to reinforce negative results from other people , but it can be even worse when you use silent approval on yourself .
What problems in your life do you witness often , but instead of consciously dealing with them , you turn away from them ?
Maybe your energy is low because you have n’t been exercising and eating well .
Perhaps your relationship situation is n’t what you want it to be .
Maybe your career is a total shipwreck .
When you use silent approval on yourself , you tell your subconscious that your current standards of performance are acceptable .
So do n’t be surprised when you keep getting the same results year after year .
If you want to change the results you ’re getting , you can not use silent approval .
You have to begin dictating a new standard for yourself .
Whenever you notice your new standards being violated , you must bring it to conscious awareness .
Interrupt your old pattern of silent approval with noisy disapproval .
If you catch yourself overeating , say out loud , “ You pig !
What the hell are you doing ? ”
Or if that is n’t your style , then try a gentler approach like , “ This is n’t me .
I know better than this .
I should go for a walk instead . ”
Instead of remaining silent , speak up .
Let your disapproval be heard loud and clear .
Let your subconscious know that it needs to help you find an alternate way to meet your needs because the current approach is a total failure .
Silent approval is one of fear ’s best friends .
Silent approval is the coward ’s way of hiding from the truth .
Sometimes it ’s painful to face the truth .
That ’s OK .
You can handle a little pain now and then .
Just do n’t go dark .
Silent approval makes your problems impossible to solve .
You cannot solve what you refuse to identify , whether your problem is at the individual , family , team , corporate , or global level .
If you want to solve such problems , you must first drag them into the light of conscious awareness ( kicking and screaming if necessary ) .
Then you ’ll finally have a shot at solving them .
And even if such problems cannot be solved , then at least they can be accepted .
Conscious acceptance is always superior to silent approval .
' Tomb Raider : Legend ' is about to hit stores in China and to get people excited for the game , the game distributor in China decided to look for the Best Chinese Lara Croft .
They setup a contest which attracting many pretty girls from around the country to participate in the contest .
The winner would be awarded cash prizes of 5,000 yuan ( Appr. USD 640 ) .
Here are some babes posing during the screen test .
Among these sexy babes , Sun Jing Xuan from Beijing , a talented girl with unique charm who is quite omparable to Lara , overcame the crowd of opponents to be the Chinese Play Girl X December 's ambassador , to win away the 5,000 Yuan .

About Acer Notebook LunchApp.APlunch ActiveX Control ....
by Tan Chew Keong
Date Posted : 2006 -11-19
[ en ] [ jp ]
Recently , I noticed that my Acer TravelMate 4150 notebook contains the LunchApp .
APlunch ActiveX control , which is marked as " safe for scripting " and " safe for initializing from persistent data " .
A quick check reveals that the control is part of the suite of applications that are distributed by default in Acer notebooks .
And it is pretty old , dating back to November 1998 .
Oh well .... what is this ActiveX control doing on my notebook ?
And most importantly , what does it allow others to do to my notebook ...
Checking the interface of the control reveals it has a method named " Run ( ) " as shown below .
The method supports parameters " Drive " , " FileName " , and " CmdLine " .
Is n't it strange for a control that 's marked " safe for scripting " to allow a method that is suggestive of possible abuse ?

It is n't long before I 'm using this control from a webpage to execute arbitrary commands on my notebook when the page is loaded in IE6 .
And it 's too simple ....
< object classid= " clsid: D9998BD0-7957-11D2-8FED-00606730D3AA " id =" hahaha " > </object > < script > hahaha.Run ( " c " , " \\windows\\system32\\calc.exe " , " " ) ; </ script >
The last parameter of the Run ( ) method allows command - line arguments to be passed to the executable .
The next thing is to find out whether this control exists in other Acer notebooks , especially the newer ones .
I was able to get hold of an Acer Aspire 5600 , and truly , the control exists and it is also marked as " safe for scripting " and " safe for initializing from persistent data " .
Luckily , the Acer Aspire 5600 notebook has already been updated to IE7 .
This prevents silent execution of the ActiveX control when the page is loaded , unlike IE6 on my Acer TravelMate 4150 .
However , once the user allows the ActiveX control to run , abusing of the " Run ( ) " command would be possible .
An advisory was not issued as I 've not extensively tested this on other Acer notebooks ( e.g. those that are being sold outside of Singapore ) .
However , both Acer notebooks that I 've tested have " safe for scripting " and " safe for initializing from persistent data " enabled for this control .
You can use the test page below to check whether your Acer notebook is affected .
Acer TravelMate 4150
Acer Aspire 5600
Both were purchased in Singapore .
Use this test page that I have created to test whether it is possible to use the LunchApp .
APlunch ActiveX control to run commands on your Acer notebook .
Do n't worry , this only runs the harmless calc.exe ( calculator ) .
The test assumes that you have calculator installed at c:\windows\system32\calc.exe , and you must use Internet Explorer ( IE )

Decoding Device , Greece , 5th Century BCE
by Joanne Chang , '99 and Anna Soellner , '98
It is believed that the advance news of the capture of Troy by the Greek commander Agamemnon was communicated through beacons .
Though there really is no evidence that proves that beacons were in fact used for communication during the time of the Trojan War , Aeschylus 's play suggests that this form of communication was used during his time ( 525-455 BCE ) .
These beacons , which were simple prearranged signals , served as precursors to the telegraph .
It was the Greek military scientist named Aeneas Tacticus who developed this ingenious method of communicating messages using the simplest torch signals in the 4th century BCE .
The way in which this system works is that two armies who wish to communicate with each other would have to create two sets of identical equipment .
Each army would have the same earthenware or clay jar with a hole of exactly the same size drilled on the bottom side of the jar .
In addition , each army would have a wooden ( or cork ) float with a rod attached to it .
The diameter of the float should be slightly smaller than that of the clay jar .
The rod would have clearly marked section with numbers partitioning each section .
Each number would represent a military message , like the " corn has arrived " or " do n't let the big wooden horse in " .
The messages on the rod would have to be identical and both armies would have to agree on the most useful messages .
The earthenware jar would be filled with water and the hole at the bottom would be plugged using a cork piece allowing the wooden piece to float inside of the jar .
When army A wanted to communicate to army B , a signalman would wave a torch ( like in Agamemnon ) until it is spotted by signalman B who would then , in return , respond by waving his torch .
When contact in established each signalman would unplug his jar simultaneously letting the water drain out .
The cork float would then slowly sink to the bottom of the jar while a myriad of numbers inscribed on the rod sink .
Signalman
A would then raise his torch when the appropriate message that he wished to communicate reaches the eye level of both signalman .
Ideally , because the equipment should be identical , the floats would sink at the same rate and thus communicate the same message at the same moment .
Though this method is a bit inefficient , it would be virtually impossible for anyone outside of these two armies to crack the code .

Stricken with an illness that is
likely to kill him before he reaches
the age of 30 , Nick Wallis had a special
request to put to the nuns and
nurses looking after him at hospice .
He asked them to help him find a prostitute
and – after some hesitation – they did .
Mr Wallis , 22 , persuaded them he should be
allowed to have a sexual experience before
he died .
Knowing that he was now unlikley
to have one in a loving relationship , he had
decided his only alternative was to pay .
The case of Mr Wallis , who has Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy , posed a major moral
dilemma for Sister Frances Dominica , the
founder of Douglas House hospice in Oxford ,
and the establishment ’s ethics committee .
After seeking advice to ensure they were
not acting illegally , the decision was taken to
support Mr Wallis , with nurse Chris Bloor
helping him to find a suitable woman on disability sites on the Internet .
Sister Frances said : " We have known Nick for many years .
He had been unable to form a relationship
with a girl at university .
" He first shared with one of our doctors and
then one of our nurses , his feelings of wanting
to experience , if nothing else , a sexual
relationship before he died – something so
many people take for granted .
" It has to be said that the charity debated
this request at length .
It ’s the first time we
have ever been asked such a question . "
The story of Mr Wallis ’s request will be featured
next week in an episode of Children of
Helen House , a BBC2 eight - part series about
a hospice for children and Douglas House ,
the neighbouring facility for young adults .
Sister Frances added : " Nick decided that
the only way forward was to pay for a sexual
experience , with or without our support , and
we came to the conclusion that it was our
duty of care to support him .
" When Nick did make contact with the
young woman , he met her at home , but with
the Douglas House nurse and another adult
in a different room in case he needed them . "
Mr Wallis ’s mother admitted that she
struggled with her son ’s wish .
" It is not what
I would wish for anyone , least of all Nick . "
Mr Wallis , who lives in Northamptonshire ,
said he had always hoped that he would
experience sex as part of a close relationship .
" I began to accept that this might not happen
for me , ’ he added .
He said he met the prostitute after his final
degree exams last May .
" Her train was late ,
which did not help my nerves .
" She turned out to be intelligent and pleasant
woman , attractive , in her late 20s .
I guess that
she was used to relating to nervous people as
she put me at ease .
The two hours passed
quickly and it was , you may say , satisfactory .
" I am pleased I had the tenacity and commitment
to see it through .
The experience ,
while not emotionally fulfilling , gave me confidence
and a sense that I was not missing out .
" I do not think I will necessarily choose to
repeat it , although I have not ruled it out . "
Helen House and Douglas House provide
respite for exhausted parents of the terminally
ill and end of life care for children and
young adults .
Children of Helen House is shown on BBC2
on Tuesdays at 10 pm .
Who 's afraid of naughty words ?
Not The New Yorker this week , but it made me wonder what would happen if I , a simple blograt , ran the same darn thing :
" A children ’s book that included the word “ scrotum ” was recently the subject of great controversy in school libraries nationwide .
A Google search has discovered several more questionable titles and excerpts from other works intended for readers twelve and under .
From " Inappropriate , " by Paul Rudnick , The New Yorker , 2007-03-12
“ The Pretty Little Bunny ”
Melissa , the pretty little bunny , woke up one morning in May and said , “ I think I ’ll hop - hop - hop over to the carrot patch .
I ’m so pretty that all of the carrots will jump right out of the ground to see me . ”
“ You are very pretty , ” said Melissa ’s Bunny Mommy .
“ But your sister is pretty , too , and she does n’t spend all of her time looking at herself in the mirror . ”
“ But is she as pretty as me ? ” asked Melissa .
“ Just look at my vagina . ”
“ The Clattery Caboose ”
Carl the Caboose had worked for the railroad for a long time .
He loved it when little children ran alongside the tracks and waved to him .
But Carl was getting older .
His bright - red paint was peeling , his wheels were getting squeaky , and do n’t even ask about his prostate .
“ Betsy Barstow , Colonial Girl ”
One fine morning , as Betsy went to the village well in the Olde Massachusetts Baye colony , she ran into her best friend , feisty Katey Karmody .
“ Oh , Katey , ” said Betsy , “ I have such news !
My father and my brothers are joining up with the militia to fight the British , so that we may all be free ! ”
“ Oh , Betsy , that is news ! ” cried Katey .
“ My nipples are like muskets ! ”
Oh , he never stops ...
Go read the whole thing this week before they archive it ; it 's contagious !
But now , I must interrupt my giggle fit to reveal a little stone in my shoe .
The New Yorker runs clever , sexually sophisticated stories all the time .
They say " fuck . "
They publish critically acclaimed erotic , and nude , photography .
They discuss and illustrate the lives of famous artists ( who can forget the Balthus story ? ) who may be highly eccentric fetishists with every sort of paraphilia .
Some of these articles receive wide discussion , like Daphne Merkin's " Spanking Piece . "
But even with less - known stories and photos , the NYer delivers a steady diet of grown - up arts and politics which resonates with thousands of readers .
Nowhere , in all the internet , would you ever hear The New Yorker described as " Not Safe for Work " : NSFW .
Whether you brought their magazine to the office , or searched their web site on line , the firewall / censorship / Dilbert Nightmare of NSFW would never crease a NYEr reader 's brow .
You could say the exact same thing about Vogue , the fashion magazine — nudity in virtually every issue .
Vanity Fair , a supermarket favorite , regularly publishes profane words , nudity , and explicit commentary on sexual controversies .
Newspapers belong to this daring group too .
The New York Times reports with great gusto on every sexual debate .
When it comes to art , they 're no wilting flowers — they just published a gorgeous slide show of naked women and their young children .
These photos were especially daring , because they violate the letter of U.S. Federal law , which stipulates that no nude photographs may be published or exhibited of minors , no matter what the context .
Ever .
Without exception .
This is why you hear stories about parents being dragged sobbing into court , their kids taken away , because their photos of their naked toddlers in the plastic play - pool were seized by do - gooders at a drugstore photo lab .
The law is sickeningly wrong .
It 's unjust , it 's anti-art , anti-kid , and purely phobic .
I love that the Times , Vogue , The New Yorker — and other high - status members of the publishing world — stick their neck out on this issue to prove a point .
I 'm just as delighted that they do n't have to deal the provincial denigration or censor of their web sites with the appellation " NSFW . "
When editors at such periodicals send their email to academic colleagues and other publishers , their letters are n't deleted because of a NSFW " origin . "
What a privelege ...
NSFW exists because of undefined and bigoted conceits .
It 's more outrageous , in its own DIY - Prude fashion , than the federal " child porn " law , the Hays Code , or the MPAA .
Why ?
Because it is unmandated , unlegislated , censorship .
If NSFW means filtering out something that is " sexually explicit " or that uses profanity , what does that mean , exactly ?
Is there a list of seven profane words , while others make the cut ?
Is a woman 's breast sexually explicit in every context , be it eroticism , cancer , or nursing ?
And if the material in question is published by a major corporation , does that render NSFW moot ?
Exactly how does that get argued ?
NSFW has no meaning in print — in paper journalism or publishing .
It has no place in a newsroom or the bookstore .
It only exists on the Internet — which is ironically notorious for its libertarianism .
NSFW , whoever dreamed it up , is a Bowdlerization of the Web , a Scarlet Letter .
It exists because fearful people believe in it , like a bad fairy .
It says more about the psychological fears and prejudices of the person using it , than it does about the content in question .
Why do web authors put up with it ?
The " W " in NSFW seems to imply that the " workplace " is an environment where all must be defended against impropriety and loss of efficiency .
But surely clock - watching bosses have noticed that employees can just as easily daydream about online seed catalogs as they can about porn .
Public libraries seem to have figured out how to have unfettered Internet access for their patrons — why can't corporate America get a clue ?
" The " S " stands for " Safe " — although it seems more of a " Satire . "
What is the danger of seeing or reading something you do n't agree with ?
Will you fly through a windshield ?
Where are the corpses of those who died from being offended ?
Yes , I 'm at the end of my rope .
My blog and internet communications have , many times , been dragged to a standstill because my blog , or even my email , was characterized by the ever- mysterious and anonymous mob of " Some People " as NSFW .
I have friends at major universities who can't get my email because it has my URL in it Do you think professors should have email banned from susiebright.com ?
I work with major publishers and NEWS organizations who can't receive my email if there are any " NSFW " words in the message text !
Yes , these are the same handful of corporations that own 99 % of the American media .
One colleague taught me how to misspell words like " Crp " so that her international wire service could receive my correspondence .
She can't read my blog at work , even though it directly comments on issues she writes on , every day .
But it 's not just the major corporations that censor in this manner .
It galls me when I see that someone has blogged about one of my stories , or passed it around a newsletter , and added the note : " Oh by the way , you better be careful because it's NSFW . "
But if my same story is in one of the aforementioned magazines — no problem !
No one seems to be terrified of being caught at the lunch table reading a copy of ...
Harpers Bazaar .
Rolling Stone .
And I 've got a long way to go before I can catch up with their nudity and profanity .
When I started my first web page , NSFW did n't exist , and therefore , I did n't get tarred with the brush .
Amazingly , it never came up .
The world hung onto its axis .
U.S. productivity continued unimpaired .
When I blogged years later , and more importantly , when I blogged about women 's issues , like abortion and birth control , I found myself stabbed with NSFW daggers for the first time .
My editorials on the South Dakota abortion ban — which included video footage from primetime SD television news — were the items that nailed my Safety - Free coffin .
There is not a single feminist political blogger I 've met who has n't dealt with this issue .
I brought it up at the last Blogher conference , and it was like the Zoolander explosion at the gas station .
Of course , it 's not just mouthy women who get the NSFW tattoo .
Needless to say , if you 're gay — in any fashion — you are NSFW .
If you use a " bad " word that would otherwise be published in Entertainment Weekly without blinking an eye , you 're NSFW .
If you present photographs of antique , artistic , or educational breasts ! — In Any Form !—
You .
Are. So. Wrong .
Nursing Mothers can just forget about it .
The NSFW prejudice is entirely dependent on size , with a soupcon of prejudice thrown in .
There are certainly a few quiet , no -fuss lactation sites that have n't been destroyed by NSFW , but they exist in a sheltered world .
If they get political , or uppity , just watch the backlash .
That 's the odd case though .
It 's usually about the money .
If you reach a critical mass , or have the imprinteur of high society , you can run ANYTHING on your site , no matter how sensational or sexually bizarre — no matter how many religions it offends , or work hours it squanders .
No one will dream of calling you names and sending you to the sidelines .
No longer are you NSFW — you are Safe for Bank , baby .
How much does it " cost " to get your NSFW wings clipped ?
I asked a Google AdSense rep that once .
He turned down my application because of ... well , you know .
This was before I had one bare breast on my page .
I argued with him , by pointing to all the sexually vivid stories that were in the Times the same week I put in my application .
He agreed ; he said , I was " absolutely right . "
" But they have millions of hits , " he wrote me .
" And you do n't . "
When I point out the ethical disaster of NSFW , many shake their heads .
Of course it 's about money , what is n't ?
How could I be so naive ?
What 's interesting , is how few characterize the hypocrisy of NSFW group - think as unAmerican , undemocratic , illegal — or unethical .
All that fuss and bother to make democratic publishing possible was just a mistake , a joke .
It 's as if everyone gave up .
If you see an R - rated film advertised , you can elect to avoid it , or not bring your small child to the theater .
It 's not banned from your neighborhood .
Can you imagine — think of all the Oscar - winning movies this year that were rated ' R " — if you never heard of these films , if you were n't allowed to hear of them , because there was a theatrical firewall in your town ?
And what if the people who dared to take a peek at these censored films were castigated and looked upon as perverts ?
I 'm sure many people must be disappointed when they arrive at my " NSFW " site .
Too many words , a jack - off disaster .
I talk about sex , and then something else , without even counting !
I write as if I thought I was Paul Rudnick or something , like I was a ... journalist .
An essayist .
A political activist .
A human being .
Is your journalism , art , and publishing compromised on the Internet because of NSFW ?
Is your communication , reading , and education suffering from NSFW ?
Is your mom unable to receive your email at her office because of this crp ?
I 'd like to hear your NSFW stories .
I 'd like to know your NSFW questions , arguments , and perhaps your success stories of ethical challenges .
I 've been thinking of hosting a NSFW Carnival and we might as well start here .

This project took about 3 hours of constructions time .
It took a couple weeks to find all the parts .
Our first solar thermal panel was fun to build , but took forever to make hot water , and frankly cost too much to make .
This is our second attempt .
Build your own solar thermal panel ...
Second Attempt
After our first attempt at a home built proof of concept solar thermal panel , we were a bit disappointed with the results .
It took about 4 hours before the thing started work , and was a bit costly ( at over 50 dollars ) to make .
I knew it could be done better and cheaper .
My first mistake with the first one was purchasing everything new .
With ample reusable resources at the local town dump I knew it could be done on the cheap .
Another flaw from the first panel was using pond liner as our collection medium .
Pond liner is plastic , does not absorb heat as well as other materials ( like metal ) and is harder to work with as you have to use glue or tape to create an air pocket to hold the water .
It leaked the first couple of times we used it and took extensive repairs to make it work .
We solved this problem by using a ready made collector .
Something that was already designed to distribute heat , and made of metal .
The last major flaw in our first panel was using plexiglas for the cover .
Its hard to work with as it will crack , and using two pieces left a hard to close crack in the middle .
We solved this problem by using good old fashion window glass .
Now onto the project .
The first thing we did was collect all of the parts .
Our local dump has a coolant removal program that has refrigerators and dehumidifiers that they remove old freon from .
With this in mind I found the perfect heat collector .
The back of a fridge is basically a heat dispersal system , with a slight modification is can be used to collect large amounts of heat .
Make sure that the freon , or other coolant has been removed , and cut the grill off at the base , near the large coolant holder .
There was an old couch that had been run over by one of the large dump plows , the inside wood was the perfect size for the frame .
I found a pane of glass and an old rubber door mat that made the perfect backing and front .
The glass was a real find , and may be the only part of the panel that may need to be purchased .
Make sure your glass is big enough to fit over your collector and have enough room to attach it to the frame .
The door mat was HUGE , so I had to cut it in half .
Funny thing seems there was a lot of nasty black goo , and a metal sheet in the middle .
Who knew .
Remove the metal plate ( or cut it in half as well ) and leave the goo .
Once
The backing was cut to size , it was time to start building the frame .
As you can see I sort of built the frame around the collector , leaving enough backing to hold it all together .
The frame is held on by building a similar frame on the back and driving large wood screws through the front frame , the backing and into the back frame .
I added some foil to the backing .
The reason for this is that counter to what you would think , you do not want the backing to warm up .
You only want the collector to absorb heat ( it was so nice of the fridge company to paint it black for us ) .
The foil will take any sun that was not absorbed by the collector on the first pass and bounce it back over the collector for another try at absorption .
The glass cover will keep all the heat inside the panel for further absorption .
Light can pass through glass , but heat can not .
Notice how duct tape was used on the inside to seal all cracks , you could use caulk but I did n't have any so I used the cheapest option .
It worked well , and held the foil in place .
Next we cut some notches for the entry and return ports to the collector .
Note again the use of duct tape to seal cracks .
I got some air pump hose from the local fish store and attached them to the end of the entry and return ports .
The duct tape was applied to make sure it was a tight fit , it was later removed as it was not needed .
Next we attached the collector to the backing , using the mounting brackets that came on the fridge and some duct tape .
If you wanted you could use some screws and wood , but I found the tape and the natural tension of the construction to be enough to hold it in place .
Lastly we attach the glass to the top .
This serves to trap all the infrared radiation from the sun inside our panel where our collector will absorb it .
Again light can pass through glass , but heat can not .
As you can see simple duct tape is enough to hold it on .
I would recommend using some sort of mounting bracket however as after a couple days in the sun the tape started to droop allowing the glass to slide off .
A few screws would solve this , but I am cheap so I just put new tape on .
Set your panel up at an angle so that it catches the most sun .
Here is the gross part , put one end of the hose into your bucket of cold water , and make sure it is at the bottom of the bucket , next grab the return hose and start sucking .
That 's right , unfortunately you have to prime the panel by getting some water into it .
This can be done without getting water in your mouth , but inevitably I sucked just a little too hard and ended up with a mouth full of nasty water .
I would recommend having a friend do this part . :)
Set your cold water bucket ( source ) up higher than your warm water bucket ( return ) and the whole thing will gravity siphon .
Due to the design of this collector ( both ports return to the same location on the panel ) it will not thermo siphon .
For that to happen I would need to cut the long return pipe and have it exit at the top of the panel .
A word of warning , this panel works VERY WELL .
We tested it on a very sunny day and within seconds the water coming out of the panel was hot enough TO SCALD .
I burned my fingers .
This very hot water is only formed when the water inside the panel is allowed to sit for about a minute without moving .
If the water is moving ( do to the gravity siphon ) the water exiting the return pipe is about 110 degrees , and while hot , will not burn you .
The water does not flow through the panel very fast ( as the pipes are very small ) but that is sort of a good thing as it allows the water to heat up a lot on its journey through the collector .
It does take a while to heat up a 5 gallon bucket of water , I ended up building an insulated return bucket that was all black and sealed on the top except for the port where the water tube enters .
This kept the returned hot water hot long enough to be of use .
I let this guy run for a couple of hours one hot sunny day and heated up a five gallon bucket of cold water ( measured at 70 degrees F ) to over 110 degrees F .
The temp that day was about 76 degrees F .
If the water is allowed to sit in the panel for several minutes and then forced out ( by blowing in one of the hoses ) the water was measure at 170 degrees F .
All in all we are much happier with the performance ( and cost ) of this panel .
It performs much better than the previous one .
Our next modifications to this design will be to alter the return port so that it will thermo siphon , in this way the return hose can be fed into the source bucket and the water will continually circulate in the panel getting hotter and hotter .
We have also talked about adding mirrors to the panel to concentrate more heat .
Our goal is to boil water .
This entire project cost less than five dollars , as I already had the screws , and the duct tape .
The only thing I purchased was the air hose , which cost $ 3.76 .
Enjoy the hot water .

Following on from Khebab 's posts ( Jan 2007 and July 2006 )
I wanted to put some production geology flesh on the bones of Mexican oil production .
The main points I want to make are :
Cantarell 's loss is Ku-Maloob - Zaap 's ( KMZ ) gain
Much concern has revolved around the Cantarell Field in Mexico that is forecast to decline at an alarming 14 % per annum .
The Cantarell complex ( Figure 1 ) has been a wonder producer for Mexico reaching maximum production of 2.14 million barrels per day ( MMBPD ) in 2004 .
This , however , was only acheived by the application of world leading reservoir management methods .
Figure 1 .
Map showing the location of the Cantarell and KMZ complexes in the Bay of Campehe ( click to enlarge ) .
Map copied from a Pemex report ( large pdf ) .
Mexico produces heavy crude
72 % of the crude oil produced in Mexico is heavy " Maya " with average API gravity of 22 degrees .
Light crude has higher API gravity , and for example Brent Blend has API gravity of 38 degrees and Westexas Intermediate 39 degrees .
One of the key differences between light and heavy crude is the viscosity of the liquid .
Light crude has a viscosity close to that of water , especially at reservoir temperatures .
In other words light crude is highly mobile .
Heavy crude is more viscous and has mobility more like thin syrup .
Heavy crude , therefore , does not move through the reservoir rocks so easily and this can present production problems .
Note that the viscosity of crude oil falls with increasing temperature and vice versa .
Gas lift used to increase production rates
Flow rates for heavy crude may be low , depending upon reservoir quality and pressure decline .
On Cantarell , flow rates were increased by introducing gas lift to most wells in the period 1988 to 1994 .
Gas lift involves injecting natural gas into the oil production stream at the bottom of the oil well .
This lowers the density of the oil throughout the whole well and lowering the density reduces the liquid pressure inside the well at its base .
This creates a greater pressure difference between the reservoir and the well resulting in higher flow rates .
Nitrogen injection
Maintaining reservoir pressure can also be more problematic with heavy crude as water injection is less applicable .
This is because injecting cold water may increase the viscosity of the oil and may result in a very uneven sweep of the reservoir .
It is common practice to inject steam into heavy crude reservoirs to overcome some of these problems .
In Cantarell , however , it was elected to inject nitrogen gas instead and this lead to the construction of the world 's largest nitrogen plant at a cost of $ 6 billion .
Note that it is not possible to simply inject air as the oxygen may set off a number of undesirable chemical and biological reactions in the reservoir .
Nitrogen injection is a form of miscible gas flood .
The nitrogen helps to boost reservoir pressure and to mobilise the oil .
In Canatrell the effects were miraculous with a marked rise in production accompanying nitrogen injection in 2000 ( Figure 2 ) .
However , the nitrogen has now dones its work and continued injection is likely to damage reservoir productivity .
The decision has now be made , therefore , to divert nitrogen from Cantarell to the neighbouring KMZ complex ( Figure 1 ) where injection is expected to boost production to 800 MBD by 2010 .
This will offset more than half of the production decline from Cantarell ( Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 . Mexican oil production past and future , Wood Mackenzie , copied from here .
Note how production from KMZ is forecast to expand and partly offset the decline in Cantarell .
Production forecast
Figure 2 shows that Mexican production is not about to go off a cliff edge .
The cupboard is not yet bare , and new fields will be developed off the Tabasco coast and on - shore at Chicontepec .
I think the " possible reserves " wedge needs to be ignored , and I consider it likely that the picture painted in Figure 2 may be over - optimistic .
Furthermore , project delays may result in sharper production decline near term .
Dave has discussed logistical problems in the oil industry " south of the border " .
But the fact remains that KMZ , Tabasco and Chicontepec will partly offset the demise of Cantarell forward to 2010 .
With 60 % of production forecast to decline at 14 % per annum , it seems likely that 2004 will prove to be Mexico 's peak production year .
The new supplies indicated in Figure 2 are unlikely to plug the gap in my opinion , although , as detailed by Khebab , the EIA and IEA see Mexican production rising to over 4 MMBPD by 2010 .
The question for Mexico , therefore , is how rapidly production declines post - peak .
As discussed below , it is still too early for Hubbert to provide this answer and it is only possible to make an educated guess .
So my guess is decline will run at around 4 % per annum which is appropriate for a mix of offshore and onshore production .
Khebab's " Low Logistic " based on monthly crude + condensate data also declines at around 4 % per annum .
Impact on world crude oil market
With production of 3.7 MMBPD , domestc consumption of 2.1 MMBD , Mexico exported around 1.6 MMBD of predominantly heavy crude in 2006 .
Much of this was exported to the USA which has refining capacity tuned to refine heavy crude as discussed by Dave .
Assuming a 4 % decline rate in Mexican production would result in avearge daily production falling from 3.74 MMBPD in 2006 to around 2.93 MMBPD in 2012 .
This represents a fall of around 800 MBPD by 2012 .
Whilst not wanting to trivialise this loss of OECD production , my opinion is that much of this lost production of heavy crude may be met by increased production of heavy Saudi Arabian crude from the Safaniya Field .
In Twilight in the Desert , Simmons documents possible spare capacity at Safiniya of the order 500 to 1000 MBPD and this should meet falling Mexican production for a few years at least .
What I 'm trying to say is that falling Mexican production would be more serious if it were light sweet crude production that was lost .
One consequnce of this , however , will be loss of conserved Saudi capacity and shrinking spare capacity going forward should be bullish for the oil price .
Figure 4 . The Safaniya heavy oil field is described by Matt Simmons on pages 187 to 191 .
Hubbert dog leg
Finally , I want to take a brief look at Hubbert Linearisation ( HL ) for Mexico .
From the work of Khebab it was clear to me that there was a dog leg in the HL with a marked change in gradient at around 1995 ( Figure 5 ) .
Note that in Khebab 's more recent work , this dog leg is obscured through use of monthly as opposed to annual production data .
I wanted to see what production geology event this might relate to as understanding this is vital to the overall interpretation - the pre 1995 leg points to reserves of 35 Gb whilst the post 1995 leg points to 66 Gb ( Figure 5 ) .
What event might have added 31 Gb to Mexico 's reserves ?
Or is there some deception at work here ?
Khebab , however , has noted that the pre 1995 leg has a P / Q value greater than 5 % meaning that the production from this period is not sufficiently mature to provide a reliable estimate of URR .
Figure 5 . Hubbert Linearisation for Mexico. Crude+condensate+NGL
( C+C+NGL ) .
Data from BP statistical review .
Unfortunately , the 1995 dog leg does not correlate with the major resevoir management interventions on Cantarell .
The introduction of gas lift ( 1988 to 1994 ) pre-dates the dog leg and the introduction of gas injection in 2000 significantly post - dates the dog leg ( Figure 5 ) .
However , from Figure 2 , it is quite clear that 1995 was a significant year for Cantarell because in this year production began to rise from the 1 MMBPD plateau ( 1990 to 1995 ) towards the 2 MMBPD reached in 2003 .
I can only speculate that new production platforms or new oil export facilities ( pipelines ) were brought on line in 1995 allowing production at Cantarell to grow significantly over the next 8 years - boosted by gas lift and nitrogen injection infrastructure .
So might this result in adding 31 Gb to Mexican oil reserves ?
Well the answer is yes and no .
Gas lift and nitrogen injection provide higher production rates without necessarily adding to reserves .
But on the other hand , nitrogen injection provides greater mobilistion of oil and more efficient sweep of the reservoir which will result in greater ultimate recovery than would have occured without this intervention .
Figure 6 . HL " forecast " assuming 4 % decline in Mexican C+C+NGL production from 2006 onwards points to ultimate recoverable reserves of around 55 Gb .
So the honest answer is that it is too early for HL to say .
My best guess is based on assuming 4 % annual decline and this points to ultimate recoverable reserves ( URR ) of 55 Gb , though it has to be said that this figure falls close to several other estimates for Mexican URR as summarised on Graphoilogy .
But we must also remember that Mexico has a vast unexplored deepwater area that may yield some major discoveries in the years ahead .
This will have no impact upon peak oil which I see in 2012 ± 3 years , but deep water Mexican production may have a significant roll to play in keeping the hybrids running post 2020 .
Alors que la saison 9 de la série « The Walking Dead » continue d’être diffusée à la télévision , les téléspectateurs devront se passer de Carl , le fils de Rick et incarné par le jeune acteur Chandler Riggs .
La disparition tragique de Carl a de quoi émouvoir les inconditionnels de la série , notamment les 3,3 millions d’abonnés Instagram de Chandler .
C’est d’autant plus poignant que l’affaire fait grand bruit , alors que Chandler Riggs lui- même avouera , dans un post , avoir été nul dans la série .
La mort de Carl crée la surprise auprès des fans
Les 3,3 millions de fans de Chandler Riggs , alias Carl Grimes dans « The Walking Dead » , n’ont pas dû apprécier que le jeune homme ait été éjecté de la série dès la saison 8 .
Il faut dire que la plupart des personnages historiques sont morts en cours de route , comme ça a été le cas pour Sean , le meilleur ami et collègue de Rick , Sarah , sa femme et mère de Carl et le plus douloureux , Glenn , l’époux de Maggie .
Après avoir été vu dans 8 saisons et plus d’une centaine d’épisodes , Carl meurt tragiquement des suites d’une morsure de morts - vivants .
Les producteurs semblent avoir tout fait pour faire passer son départ de la série de la façon la plus émouvante possible , notamment lorsqu’il fait promettre à son père d’arrêter la guerre avec Negan .
Mais , rien n’y fait !
La séparation reste tout aussi douloureuse pour le public , d’autant que Carl ou plutôt Chandler est très populaire sur Instagram et que dans la version BD du film , son personnage est toujours vivant .
Le parcours de Chandler s’arrête donc brusquement alors que le jeune acteur n’est âgé que de 17 ans .
Des performances médiocres selon Chandler lui-même
Le jeune comédien est lui- même revenu sur la qualité de sa performance dans TWD , notamment à partir de la saison 4 jusqu’à son départ de la saison 8 .
C’est à ce moment en effet que ses apparitions et son implication dans la série ont connu une chute libre , déclenchant par la même occasion , la foudre des fans de la série .
Chandler reconnaît lui-même , dans un post , avoir eu de moins en moins d’implications et parle même de performances médiocres .
Les premières années ont de loin été les meilleures .
Après , le jeune homme avoue avoir été bien plus préoccupé par ses études que par son rôle dans la série .
Malgré tout , l’acteur , désormais âgé de 19 ans , a su très bien rebondir 1 an après son départ de « The Walking Dead » .
Il a annoncé , à ses fans sur les réseaux sociaux , avoir rejoint une formidable série depuis le 21 janvier 2019 .
On le retrouve donc dans « A million Little Things » en diffusion sur ABC .
Ce nouveau tournage aurait changé sa vie .
Il faut avouer que depuis TWD , Chandler a bien changé .
Sur son compte Instagram , on le retrouve en véritable homme , comme vous le verrez grâce à instagram picture downloader ou en utilisant une application dédiée au téléchargement des photos .
À seulement 19 ans , il affiche déjà une très grande maturité , notamment avec le changement de coupe de cheveux , tout en menant , pour l’instant , la vie des jeunes de son âge .
Faites donc un tour sur le profil du jeune homme et vous vous en rendrez compte , que vous ayez envie de sauvegarder ses photos via instagram picture downloader ou non .
New testimony before the house committee on oversight and reform has brought to light that Bush administration appointees have systematically made changes to scientific reports on climate change before they were released to the public .
The testimony to the house committee on oversight and government reform painted the administration as determined to maintain its line on climate change even when it clashed with the findings of scientific experts .
James Hansen , who heads the Goddard Institute for Space Science in New York , said in prepared testimony : “ The effect of the filtering of climate change science during the current administration has been to make the reality of climate change less certain than the facts indicate , and to reduce concern about the relation of climate change to human - made greenhouse gas emissions . ” ( via )
The Bush administration had installed political appointees in key scientific agencies to act as monitors and editors .
One such appointee was Philip Cooney .
Former lobbyist for big oil .
Bush had appointed him chief of staff of the Council on Environmental Quality ( another bad choice was a 23 - year - old college drop - out who was made a public affairs officer at Nasa after working on Mr Bush ’s re-election campaign ) .
Mr Cooney told the committee yesterday : “ My sole loyalty was to the president and advancing the policies of his administration . ”
Documents released today also show a wide spread pattern of edits , suppressions , and outright lies .
181 in all to multiple scientific studies , made by Cooney and others at the behest of the Bush administration .
They made another 113 changes to try and make it look as if humans were not the cause of global warming .
What kind of changes you might ask ?
Well apparently this statement “ Climate change has global consequences for human health and the environment . ” was just too controversial , he went on to stifle information about warming trends over the last 1000 years , even inserting information from the American Petroleum Institute ( a fake science firm that belongs to big oil ) into office reports .
Under heated questioning , Mr Cooney admitted yesterday that the changes were all intended to cast doubt over the impact of global warming .
He denied they were directly coordinated with the White House but said he had regular conversations with a senior White House aide .
“ We got notes from them , ” Mr Cooney said .
Control from the White House became the norm , Dr Hansen told the committee yesterday .
“ Scientific press releases were going to the White House for editing , ” he said .
“ It ’s very unfortunate that we developed this politicisation of science .
The public relations office should be staffed by expert appointees .
Otherwise they become offices of propaganda . ”
He acknowledged that such interference existed before the Bush administration , though to a much lesser extent .
It ’s no wonder then that we have so many people in this country who still to this day do not accept the fact that global warming is caused by humans that its going to get worse , and that we have to do something about it .

I recently saw a textbook used to teach computers in the third grade .
One of the chapters ( " The Big Calculator " ) featured detailed instructions on how to format tables of numbers in Excel .
All very good , except that the new Excel version features a complete user interface overhaul , in which the traditional command menus are replaced by a ribbon with a results - oriented UI .
Sadly , I had to tell the proud parents that their daughter 's education would be obsolete before she graduated from the third grade .
The problem , of course , is in tying education too tightly to specific software applications .
Even if Microsoft had n't turned Excel inside out this year , they would surely have done so eventually .
Updating instructional materials to teach Office 2007 is n't the answer , because there will surely be another UI change before today 's third graders enter the workforce in 10 or 15 years — and even more before they retire in 2065 .
There is some value in teaching kids skills they can apply immediately , while they 're still in school , but there 's more value in teaching them deeper concepts that will benefit them forever , regardless of changes in specific applications .
Teaching life - long computer skills in our schools offers further benefit in that it gives students insights that they 're unlikely to pick up on their own .
In contrast , as software gets steadily easier to use , anyone will be able to figure out how to draw a pie chart .
People will learn how to use features on their own , when they need them — and thus have the motivation to hunt for them .
It 's the conceptual things that get endlessly deferred without the impetus of formal education .
Following are some general skills that I think we should teach in elementary school .
Search Strategies
Today 's search engine market leader might be gone in 20 years , and the search page layouts that currently dominate all search engines will almost certainly change .
So , we should n't teach the kids Google hacks .
That said , the general search concept will only become more important in the future , as we get ever - more information that will be ubiquitously accessible .
Strategies for how to formulate good queries , how and when to use query reformulation or other search refinements , how to use scoped search , how to judge search result relevancy , and how to combine multiple search engines of different types will remain important , even as the specifics of how to implement such strategies change .
Information Credibility
In testing websites with children , we found that they click advertisements much more than adult users do .
It 's definitely important to teach kids how to recognize different types of ads , including sponsored versus organic search hits .
But we need to go beyond that and teach kids strategies for judging and checking the credibility of online information .
Teenagers are particularly impatient online , and thus potentially more vulnerable .
Information Overload
In the future , there will be even more email , more IM / SMS / voice mail / phone calls / video mail , more websites , more podcasts , and richer intranets .
And all of it will be available in your office , at your home computer , on your mobile , and on various ambient devices .
People can take simple steps to fight information overload , but as information snowballs , we 'll need more sophisticated strategies .
Writing for Online Readers
Communicating clearly on the Internet , intranet , and other interactive media is an increasingly important job skill .
Extensive research has shown that users read online media very differently than they read print media .
Thus , we should teach students how to write hypertext and not how just to write printed documents .
Computerized Presentation Skills
Good speakers know how to use PowerPoint to enhance their presentations rather than put audiences to sleep with bullet points .
Most business professionals agree that solid presentation skills are essential for career advancement .
Fewer appreciate that today 's presentations tend to be computer - supported and that more than pure speaking brilliance is required to get a point across .
Many students already use PowerPoint to present their projects .
We should go beyond the mechanics of slide projection and teach them skills for effective computer - supported presentations .
Workspace Ergonomics
As life gets more computerized , RSIs ( repetitive strain injuries ) such as carpal tunnel syndrome and " text - message thumb " are hurting more people .
We should teach people how to protect their health , and how to set up a workplace according to established ergonomic guidelines .
Rule # 1 is to take frequent breaks and stand up , but there 's much more to it , including monitor placement , chair and desk height , and lighting .
Most computer set -ups are health hazards that induce headaches , backaches , and RSI .
Debugging
We should n't turn everyone into a programmer , but the basic debugging concept is a fundamental survival skill in the computer era .
Most spreadsheets contain formula errors , for example , and unless people know how to find such mistakes , they 'll make decisions based on the wrong numbers .
User Testing and other Basic Usability Guidelines
Just as all kids should n't have to become programmers , we also should n't turn them all into usability specialists or interaction designers .
That said , the more we conduct business in an interactive environment , the more important it is that we understand the fundamental principles that facilitate easy interactions .
Understanding usability heuristics like " recognition vs. recall " or " consistency " will be as important to the educated person as having dissected a frog .
As ever - more product categories become computerized and increasingly complex to operate , people will need the ability to judge ease - of - use simply to become better - informed consumers who can buy products that will work for them .
Also , even if they 'll never conduct user tests as adults , I think all children should try one in school .
Running a test is a simple and effective way to gain appreciation for many of the important usability concepts .
For example , teachers could have kids write small websites on various topics , then test them on each other to see how well they communicated the information .
Seeing other kids fail to understand your site is much more motivational than having the teacher 's red pen mark up your essay .
Does Jesus Watch Me Go Poopy ?
Dear Pastor ,
My momma tells me I had better behave myself , on account of Jesus is always watching .
She says
He sees EVERYTHING that I am doing .
Does that mean that Jesus is even staring at me every time I pull down my pants to go poopy ?
Yours in Christ , - Sue Ellen Dear Sue Ellen ,
Yes child , your mother is right ; Jesus does see all .
But unlike a Peeping Tom who is only able to catch a glimpse of you on the toilet through the window , the good Lord Jesus is all over your business , sniffing out every nook and cranny of your vile , sinful little body .
Praise
His holy name !
You see , Jesus knows that toilet time is also a dangerous time for young ladies like yourself – filled with horrid temptations of the flesh .
After all , this – along with shower time – is one of the only occasions when True Christians ™ have a legitimate reason to be briefly touching their filthy sex parts .
This is why Jesus carefully monitors every second spent in the bathroom , to ensure that you make haste , and no fingers go lingering around and get lost in the dirty , stinky parts of your body .
So yes , Jesus is watching you , sweetheart , but do n’t worry ; there ’s nothing in your panties that He has n’t seen before .
Indeed , it was Jesus and His daddy who intelliguntly desined every contour and crevice of your little hoochie and poop chute , which He carefully sculpted in celestial wax before miniaturizing and beaming you inside the incubation chamber you might know better as “ mommy . ”
Of course , foolish liberals and depraved sex maniacs maintain that since it was God who created us in His image , this means that every part of our bodies is Godly – including our unmentionables .
This is utter nonsense , of course !
For just like liquor , drugs , gambling and all the books , music , and movies that are actually entertaining , your disgusting parts were created by God to TEST you , child – which is why you would do well to always express the requisite degree of intense revulsion at the very sight of your own nakedness .
Remember child , Jesus loves you , which is the reason
He ’s taking time out of His very busy schedule creating tornadoes and earthquakes and giving folks cancer to watch you squat down and do nature 's business !
If you doubt , me - just take our Bible Poop Quiz to see how obsessed the Lord is with excrement .
So , young lady - the next time you ’re making a doo - doo , do n’t be shy .
Be thankful , child !
Verily , take comfort by gazing heavenward as you push and squeal like a sweet naked sow in the mud ; then at the very moment you hear an audible plop in the water beneath your soft naked rump , you can give Jesus a little wave hello !
God Bless You , - Pastor

/* This article presents the case against the ‘ wisdom of crowds ’ and explains the background for how the Wikipedia 3.0 : The End of Google ?
article reached over 200,000 hits */
This article explains and demonstrates a conceptual flaw in digg ’s service model that causes biased ( or rigged ) as well as lowest - common - denominator hype to be generated , causing a dumbing down of society ( as the crowd ) .
The experimental evidence and logic supplied here apply equally to other Web 2.0 social bookmarking services such as del.icio.us , and netscape beta .
Since digg is an open system where anyone can submit anything , user behavior has to be carefully monitored to make sure that people do not abuse the system .
But given that the number of stories submitted each second is much larger than what Digg ’s own staff can monitor , digg has given the power to the users to decide what is good content and what is bad ( e.g. spam , miscategorized content , lame stuff , etc . )
This “ wisdom of crowds ” model , which forms the basis for digg , has a basic and major flaw at its foundation , not to mention at least one process and technology related issue in digg ’s implementation of the model .
Let ’s look at the simple process and technology issue first before we explore the much bigger problem at the heart of the “ wisdom of crowds ” model .
If enough users report a post from a given site as spam then that site ’s URL will be banned from digg , even if the site ’s owner had no idea someone was submitting links from his site to digg .
The fact is that digg cannot tell for sure whether the person submitting the post is the site ’s owner or someone else , so their URL banning policy ( or algorithm if it ’s automated ) must make the assumption that the site ’s owner is the one submitting the post .
But what if someone starts submitting posts from another person ’s blog and placing them under the wrong digg categories just to get that person ’s blog banned by digg ?
This issue can be eliminated by improvements to the process and technology .
[ You may skipp the rest of this paragraph if you can take my word for it . ]
For example , instead of banning a given site ’s URL right away upon receiving X number of spam reports for posts from that site , the digg admins would put the site ’s URL under a temporary ban and attempt to contact the site ’s owner and possibly have the site owner click on a link in an email they ’d send him / her to capture his / her IP address and compare it to that used by the spammer .
If the IP addresses do n’t match then they would ban the IP address of the spam submitter , and not the site ’s URL .
This obviously assumes that digg is able to automatically ban all known public proxy addresses ( including known Tor addresses etc ) at any given time , to force the users to use their actual IP addresses .
The bigger problem , however , and what I believe to be the deadliest flaw in the digg model is the concept of the wisdom of crowds .
Crowds are not wise .
Crowds are great as part of a statistical process to determine the perceived numerical value of something that can be quantified .
A crowd , in other words , is a decent calculator of subjective quantity , but still just a calculator .
You can show a crowd of 200 people a jar filled with jelly beans and ask each how many jelly beans are in the jar .
Then you can take the average and that would be the closest value to the actual number of jelly beans .
However , if you were to ask a crowd of 200 million to evaluate taste or beauty or whatever subjective quality , e.g. coolness , the averaging process that helps in the case of counting jelly beans ( where members of the crowd use reasoning and do n’t let others affect their judgment ) does n’t happen in this scenario .
What happens instead is that the crowd members ( assuming they communicate with each other such that they would affect each others qualitative judgment , or assuming they already share something in common ) would converge toward the lowest - common - denominator opinion .
The logic for this is that reasoning is used in the case of estimating measurable values , while psychology is used in the case of judging quality .
Thus , in the case of evaluating the subjective quality of a post submitted to digg , the crowd has no wisdom : it will always choose the lowest common denominator , whatever that happens to be .
To understand a crowd ’s lack of rationality and wisdom , as a phenomenon , consider the following .
I had written a post ( see link at the end of this article ) about the Semantic Web , domain specific knowledge ontologies and Google as seen from a Google - centric view .
I went on about how Google , using Semantic Web and an AI - driven inference engine , would eventually develop into an omnipresent intelligence ( a global mind ) and how that would have far reaching implications etc .
The post was titled “ Reality as a Service ( RaaS ) : The Case for GWorld . ”
I submitted it to digg and I believe I got a few diggs and one good comment on it .
That ’s all .
I probably got 500 hits in total on that post , and mostly because I used the word “ Gworld ” in the title .
More than a week after that , I took the same post , the same idea of combining the Semantic Web , domain - specific knowledge ontologies and an AI - driven inference engine but this time I pitted Wikipedia ( as the most likely developer of knowledge ontologies ) against Google , and posted it with the sensational but quite plausible title “ Wikipedia 3.0 : The End of Google . ”
The crowd went wild .
I got over 33,000 hits in the first 24 hours .
And as of the latest count about 1600 diggs .
In fact , my blog on that day ( yesterday ) beat the # 1 blog on WordPress , which is that of ex Microsoft guy Scobleizer .
And now I have an idea of how many hits he gets a day !
He gets more than 10,000 and less than 25,000 .
I know because the first 16 hours I was getting hit by massive traffic I managed to get ahead of him with a total of 25,000 hits , but in the last 8 hours of the first 24 hours cycle ( for which I ’m reporting the stats here ) he beat me back to the # 1 spot , as I only had 9,000 hits .
I stayed at # 2 though .
Figure 1 : June 25 Traffic , the first 16 hours of a 24 hour graph cycle .
Traffic ~ 25,000 hits .
Figure 2 : June 26 Traffic , the last 8 hours of a 24 hour graph cycle .
Traffic ~ 8,000 hits .
A crowd , not to be confused with individuals ( like myself , yourself ) , aside from being a decent calculator of subjective quantities ( like counting jelly beans in a jar ) is no smarter than a bull when it comes to judging the intellectual , artistic or philosophical appeal of something .
Wave something red in front of it or make a lot of noise and it may notice you .
Talk to it or make subtle gestures and you ’ll fail to get its attention .
Obviously you can have a tame bull or an angry one .
An angry one is easier to upset .
A crowd is no more than a decent calculator of subjective quantities .
It is a tool in that sense and only in that sense .
In the context of judging quality , like musical taste or coolness of something , a crowd is neither rational nor wise .
It will only respond to the most basic and crude methods of attention grabbing .
You ca n’t grab it ’s attention with subtlety or rationality .
You have to use psychology , like you would with a bull .
As you can see from the graphs of my blog traffic , I ’ve proved it .
I did n’t just understand it .
Social bookmarking systems , and tagging in general , amplifies the intensity of the crowd - as - a - bull behavior by attaching the highest numerical values to the most curde , most raw and the lowest common denominator .
Now all the sudden , when a post gets 100 digs it reaches escape velocity and goes into orbit .
The numerical value attached to posts ( or the “ diggs ” ) when it grows fast acts like a bait .
People rush to see such posts just as they rushed in tens of thousands to see the “ Wikipedia 3.0 vs Google ” post .
Yet it ’s basically the same post as the one I did on GWorld over a week ago that only got a few diggs .
There is no comparison between the wisdom and rationality of an individual and that of a crowd .
The individual is infinitely wiser and more rational than the crowd .
So these social bookmarking systems need to be based on a more evolved model where individuals have as much say as the crowd .
Remember that many failed social ideologies were based on the the idea of favoring the so - called “ wisdom of crowds ” over individualism .
The reason they failed is because collectivist behavior is dumb behavior and individual judgment is the only way forward .
We need more individuality in society not less .
Censored by digg
This post was censored by digg ’s rating system .
However , in a software - enabled rating system , such as digg , reddit , del.icio.us , netscape , etc , there is no way to guarantee that manipulation of the system by its owner does not happen .
Please see the Update section below for the explanation and the evidence ( in the form of a telling list of censored posts ) behind why digg itself , and not just some of its fanatic users , may have been behind the censoring of this post .
Note : a fellow wordpress blogger published a post called Digg ’s Ultimate Flow which links to this post .
It has not been buried / censored yet ( June 29 , ’ 06 , 5:45 pm EST ) .
It ’s not to be confused with this post .
The reason it has n’t been buried is because it presents no threat to digg .
They can sense danger like an animal and I guess I ’ve scared them enough to bury / censor my post .
The other me - too post that I ’ve just mentioned does not smell as scary .
It ’s really sad that digg and sites like it are feeding the crude animal - like , instinctive , zero- clarity behavior that is the ‘ unwisdom ’ of crowds .
The truth is that digg and other so - called “ social ” bookmarking sites do not give us power , they take it away from us .
Always .
Think .
Innovate .
Do not follow .
But you may want to follow this link to share your view with other digg users for what it ’s worth .
Correction I ’ve just noticed that this blog is ahead of Scobleizer again at # 1 .

It ’s 8:00 pm EST now , on June 29 , ’06 .

BBC World Service , Washington
Mr Ganji said Iranian dissidents needed to present a common front
Mr Ganji said he had been invited to discuss the current situation in Iran .
The White House declined to comment .
He said he rejected the offer because he believed current US policies could not help promote democracy in Iran .
In a speech last week in Washington DC , he also criticised US policy in Iraq , saying : " You can not bring democracy to a country by attacking it " .
He added that the war in Iraq had helped Islamic fundamentalism and hampered the democracy movement in the region .
A group of Iranian dissidents met State Department official Nicholas Burns and Elliot Abrams , an adviser to the National Security Council , while Mr Ganji was in Washington last week .
Mr Ganji said he believed such meetings would undermine the credibility of the Iranian opposition .
However , Mr Ganji added that if Iranian opposition were united and they had a recognised leadership , they could negotiate with US officials to find the best ways of helping promote democracy and human rights in Iran .
Hunger strike
He said he was in the United States not as a leader of Iran 's democracy movement , but as a journalist who wanted to draw international attention to the plight of people in Iranian jails .
The highlight of Mr Ganji 's visit to the United States was a three - day hunger strike in front of United Nations headquarters in New York .
Mr Ganji had staged a hunger strike for several weeks when he was in Iran 's notorious Evin prison in Tehran .
He was joined in his New York protest by tens of other Iranians who went on strike to campaign against what they called the arbitrary detention of political activists and intellectuals in Iran .
His American visit coincides with renewed pressure on Iran for its support of Hezbollah in Lebanon and its rejection of calls to stop uranium enrichment .
In a speech at Washington 's Georgetown University , he said he believed Iran 's nuclear programme was not in its national interest .
Mr Ganji was arrested in 2000 after returning from a conference in Berlin .
He was accused of having " damaged national security " and sentenced to six years in jail .
In July 2005 , President Bush called on Iran to release Mr Ganji " immediately and unconditionally " .
He was released in March 2006 , in poor health as a result of his lengthy hunger strike against prison conditions .
On Monday , Mr Ganji delivered a speech in New York to a gathering organised by the International Pen Association , which campaigns for writers ' freedom .
He says he will return to Iran once he finishes his tour of the US and Europe .

Compile or install flex
Install ( for example by " yum install byacc " ) or compile BSD byacc ( " bison -y - d " could be used as alternative but preferably use ' byacc ' )
Install a binary version of the Portable Object Compiler from one of the above links .
The compiler is written in itself , so you need a bootstrap compiler ( one of those binary packages ) to start .
Download objc-3.3.20.tar.gz or clone from the GIT repository at https://sourceforge.net/projects/objc/.
Optionally , for the class browser , install cursel - 0.2.4.tar.gz .
Optionally for expert users porting to new or other platforms , where there is no binary package available , build objc - bootstrap - 3.3.13.tar.gz .
The package contains the documentation in HTML format .
The manual is also available here , and there 's a note on Objective - C blocks .

Just last night netster007 x posted a comment about an awesome extension he found called LocationBar2 .
He said that he found it via FFExtensionGuru ’s Blog that linked to the Firefox 3 meeting notes which had a list of extension nominations .
These nominations are ideas of what people would like to see included in the final release of Firefox 3 .
Here are the extensions currently up for nomination along with some information for each one :
URLFixer –
This will monitor the URL’s that you enter in and try to catch any typos that you make .
LocationBar² –
This reminds me of a feature that Vista currently has in Windows Explorer .
It essentially creates a breadcrumb trail to the folder that you are currently in so that navigating to another position is just one click away .
This extension is really amazing and I can see how it would be useful to a lot of people .

Firebug –
This is used by developers to make designing and testing a website a little easier .
For a full list of features see our latest review .
Console² – This would replace the JavaScript Error console and adds some extra features .
Site Specific Prefs –
This extension lets you save your preferences on a site - by - site basis .
It will do things like remember the text zoom as well as some other things .
I think this one is also a great idea .
Investigate download manager extensions – Sounds like they want to enhance the functionality of the built - in download manager .
There are several download manager extensions which is probably why they did n’t list one in particular , but the most popular is probably DownThemAll .
Print Hint –
If a printer - friendly version of a website exists a little icon next to the Address Bar will show up to notify users .
TableTools – Develop something that is n’t exactly like the extension , but allow for certain operations on tables .
That way users could do things like sort them all from within the browser .
Searchbar Autosizer – Have the Search Bar automatically size itself as the user types their query string .
One of the best things about the extension is that it also has the option to clear the Search Bar after performing a search .
I , however , think that the SearchLoad extension is a little better even thought it does n’t do the automatic resizing .
There is a section for “ other extensions ” that includes some popular ones like Tab Mix Plus , but it does n’t look like those have been nominated yet .
Some of these extensions offer some great features that would all add to the greatness of Firefox 3 , but I wonder which one (s ) they will actually end up implementing ?
Out of the extensions listed above , which do you think should be integrated with Firefox 3 ?
I think I have to agree with what nester007 x said in his comment that Location Bar2 is the best out of all of them .
Tony Blair will promise today to cut by a fifth the operational nuclear warheads on Britain 's Trident submarines , from 200 to 160 , the Guardian understands .
The cut is part of the prime minister 's campaign to persuade MPs that the government must start work almost immediately on plans detailed in a white paper to build a replacement fleet .
He will personally announce the cabinet 's decision in the Commons this afternoon , and is also likely to say that the number of new Trident submarines could be reduced from four to three without reducing the UK deterrent 's effectiveness .
The white paper will also say the new Trident system will cost less than £ 25 bn .
But it will say this figure represents 5 % of the annual defence budget , and about 0.1 % of GDP , Whitehall sources said yesterday .
Ministers have rejected claims Britain no longer needs nuclear weapons to deter a potential enemy and have embraced the " insurance policy " argument that it is impossible to predict the shape of threats in 20 years .
The promised reduction in Trident , whose warheads will have been halved from 300 since 1997 when Labour came to power , is unlikely to appease critics of nuclear weapons or MPs in all parties who challenge Downing Street 's view that Trident must not only be renewed , but that a decision is urgent .
With a public debate and then a Commons vote in February set to follow the white paper , ministers hope they will win the vote comfortably .
But they accept they will need Conservative support to push it through .
Up to 40 Labour MPs oppose nuclear weapons , but the key group Mr Blair seeks to persuade are those , including the Liberal Democrats , who think there is no need to take an early decision .
The Tories remain pro-deterrent , but their defence spokesman , Dr Liam Fox , said yesterday they would only " replace it [ Trident ] when necessary " .
One Labour minister seemed confident the government would prevail : " There will be some trouble in the parliamentary party .
My activists will not want it , but they will not object to it . "
The white paper will also reject arguments urging a delay on a decision to commission new submarines by at least five years , as the Lib Dem leader , Sir Menzies Campbell , and many independent analysts have proposed .
Given the long lead times before operational availability - 14 years between the Trident decision and the day it replaced Polaris - it would be too risky .
Delay would also not be cost effective , mainly because the nuclear reactors that propel the present boats need replacing soon .
The white paper will say that a sea - based system is the only " credible " nuclear deterrent , rejecting arguments for land - based cruise missiles .
The government has also rejected the argument that a Trident submarine need not be continuously at sea .
Instead it will suggest that advances in technology may allow Britain to manage on three rather than four submarines , which would save up to £ 2bn , one minister said last night .
Anti-nuclear campaigners will step up their protest today .
CND and a number of MPs will hand an alternative white paper to No 10 and express concern over the short amount of time being given to discuss the issue .
The Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams , is also expected today to signal his opposition to replacing the nuclear deterrent .

ちょっとだけ気になるのはiPodの特徴である「ホイール」がないこと。ヴァーチャルなものとしても、ない。
ホイールの優れた点は、移動量のコントロールが非常に容易であること。例えば1000曲ものリストをスクロールしようと思えば、十字キーのようなインターフェイスでは方向キーを押し続けることになるだろうが、移動速度が遅ければ離れた位置にある項目を選択するのに時間がかかりすぎるし、速ければ位置の調整が困難になる。その点、ホイールは回転速度によってスクロールを任意にコントロールすることができる。

LED developed in Russia in 1920s
By Nick Farrell
The Inquirer
CLAIMS THAT the LED was invented by four independent American research groups in 1962 are false , according to New Scientist magazine .
The mag ’s hacks have found that the LED was invented by a Russian genius around forty years earlier .
Oleg Vladimirovich Losev was a radio technician who noticed that diodes used in radio receivers emitted light when current was passed through them .
In 1927 , he published details in a Russian journal of the first ever LED .
Details of Losev ’s invention have been dug up by Nikolay Zheludev , at the University of Southampton .
It is not as if the discoveries were locked in Russia and never escaped .
Losev also published on his discoveries in German and British journals where they were ignored .
More than sixteen papers written between 1924 and 1930 he comprehensively detailed the function of his LED .
He used Einstein ’s quantum theory to explain the way electrons dropping in energy produced the light without releasing heat .
When he wrote to the man himself , but Einstein did n’t reply .
In 1927 he Losev filed a patent for a ‘ light relay ’ that used his devices ‘ for fast telegraphic and telephone communication , transmission of images and other applications …’
None of his work was picked up and Losev died of hunger in 1942 during the siege of Leningrad ( aka St. Petersburg ) , at the age of 39 .
Zheludev discovered that in November 1941 , Losev tried to get a paper based on a discovery that using semiconductors , a three - terminal system may be constructed analogous to a vacuum triode .
Zheludev thinks that he may have invented the transistor .

AT LONG last , Washington has emerged from its state of denial and is embroiled in the mother of all debates over what to do about Iraq .
For the past three years , the Bush administration has insisted that the only reasonable policy is to “ stay the course ” — and has demonised the opposition as Defeaticrats .
The Bush code of omertà has more or less prevented leaks .
And the Democrats have been sidelined by a combination of powerlessness and internal divisions .
All this has changed .
George Bush now admits that “ stay the course ” is no longer a viable option .
The administration is springing leaks all over the place — the past week has seen the leaking of two sensitive memos , one by Stephen Hadley , Mr Bush 's national security adviser , casting doubt on the Iraqi prime minister 's competence , and one by Donald Rumsfeld , the outgoing defence secretary , admitting that the current strategy is not working .
And the Democrats are preparing to take over both houses of Congress after an election that delivered an overwhelmingly negative verdict on Mr Bush 's administration in general and his Iraq policy in particular .
The reason is simple : American policy in Iraq is collapsing .
During his confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee this week , Mr Rumsfeld 's designated successor , Robert Gates , conceded that America is not winning the war in Iraq .
He said that “ all options ” are now on the table — and worried that failure could lead to a regional conflagration .
The centrepiece of the week was the publication of the Iraq Study Group 's report on Iraq .
The members of the ISG spent December 6th in a grand procession through the corridors of power .
They met the president at 7 am .
They met House leaders at 8.30 and Senate leaders straight after that .
They then gave a riveting press conference at 11 o'clock .
The two chairmen of the group — Lee Hamilton , a former Indiana congressman , and James Baker , a former secretary of state — will be fixtures on the airwaves for days .
Those people who predicted an exercise in bureaucratic blandness were confounded .
From the very first bleak words of the report —
“ The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating ” — the world was left in no doubt that this is a deadly serious exercise .
The ISG ruled out several widely - discussed solutions : staying the course ( dismissed in 14 lines as “ not sustainable ” ) , radically increasing troop numbers , dividing the country along ethnic lines or “ precipitate withdrawal ” .
Instead , it recommended a combination of three main policies ( see article ) .
The first is to change the primary mission of American troops towards support and training .
The second is a performance - related approach to managing Iraq — helping Iraqis to help themselves but threatening penalties should they fail .
The third is a “ new diplomatic offensive ” aimed at engaging Iraq 's neighbours in stabilising the region , and including getting more deeply engaged in the Arab - Israeli conflict .
The ISG envisages removing most American combat troops from Iraq by the first quarter of 2008 — barely a year from now — leaving a greatly - reduced force behind to train Iraqis , provide logistical support and fight al - Qaeda .
How likely is it that Mr Bush will listen to Messrs Baker and Hamilton ?
The report , after all , demolishes the approach that Mr Bush has taken to national security since September 11th 2001 — sidelining grand ideas about democratisation and emphasising negotiation with powers that Mr Bush has demonised as untouchables .
Militarily , it is withdrawal by any other name , and not far short of precipitate .
The White House has been sending mixed signals since the mid-term elections .
During his ill - starred meeting on November 29th with the Iraqi prime minister , Mr Bush complained : “ There 's a lot of speculation that these reports in Washington mean there 's going to be some kind of graceful exit out of Iraq ... this business about graceful exit just simply has no realism to it at all . ”
The White House has repeatedly stressed that the ISG is only one of three reports being prepared on Iraq ( the other two are being prepared by the White House and the Pentagon ) .
But Mr Bush may now be open to new ideas on Iraq .
Mr Hadley has been all over the airwaves suggesting that the president is planning to announce “ a new way forward ” in coming weeks .
Mr Bush himself responded to the report by saying that he will take it “ very seriously ” .
The president likes to present himself as a Churchillian figure who is impervious to the winds of opinion .
But in fact he has a long record of resisting new ideas until the last moment — and then claiming those new ideas as his own .
Remember how he was opposed to the Department of Homeland Security until he was for it ?
The bipartisan Baker - Hamilton report gives Mr Bush an excuse for making just such a pivot .
The ideological tenor of the administration is changing rapidly .
Mr Gates is much keener on engaging the other powers in the region than Mr Rumsfeld .
The hawkish John Bolton is leaving his job as ambassador to the United Nations .
Mr Rumsfeld left a parting memo , written just before the mid-term elections , which suggests that even he had lost confidence in his own policies .
He admitted that “ what US forces are currently doing in Iraq is not working well enough or fast enough . ”
His laundry - list of options included lowering expectations and withdrawing troops to the periphery of the country .
The Democrats are also signalling a growing willingness to co-operate with the administration in dealing with what everybody now recognises is a foreign - policy disaster .
They are losing interest in precipitate withdrawal , a position strongly favoured by rank - and - file party members .
( Military commanders believe that this could produce internal and regional chaos . )
And they are clearly excited by the idea of engaging Iran and Syria in a regional compromise .
On December 7th Tony Blair — a man hugely respected on both sides of the aisle — added support to the Baker - Hamilton formula .
The biggest obstacles to any grand bargain on Iraq may well be practical rather than ideological .
Is Condoleezza Rice up to the job of acting as a regional power - broker ?
( Her performance during the Israel - Hizbullah war was notably weak . )
Has the State Department got sufficient firepower to lend her support ?
( She currently has no deputy and one of her top advisers is leaving . )
Is training the Iraqi army anything more than a pipe - dream ?
( According to one estimate , only one in four of Iraq 's army battalions is able to “ perform a useful function ” . )
And , above all , why should Iran and Syria promote regional stability ?
For all the sober and sensible recommendations of the Iraq Study Group , getting out of Iraq is going to prove a lot harder than getting in .
There ’s a sucker born every minute .
Guess what ?
P.T. Barnum never said that .
A competitor of his did , and yet it ’s been wrongly attributed to Barnum for 140 years .
That ’s a shame , because although Phineas Taylor Barnum used outrageous stunts and hoaxes for promotional purposes , he was insanely focused on delivering exceptional value to his customers .
He even crusaded against schemers and charlatans that swindled people out of money .
Those crooks made Barnum ’s job harder , just like spammers and snake - oil sellers make every honest online marketer ’s task a bit tougher as well .
When Barnum pulled one over on you , he told you … and then made sure you left with a smile on your face .
We all know that delivering outstanding , useful content is the best way to get positive online attention .
But every once in a while , you might try something completely off the wall and gain big traction , as long as you find a way to deliver value beyond the hype .
For example , when it became clear that YouTube sensation Lonelygirl15 was a fake , a lot of people ( including me ) thought there might be a backlash .
Nope , because the story “ she ” provided the audience contained enough quality and value to give people exceptional satisfaction .
As Frank Ahrens of the Washington Post insightfully commented , we can be fooled , and we probably do n’t care .
Barnum felt the same way , and he kept huge crowds coming back for more , time and time again .
It all comes down to the beneficial payoff for the audience .
This is definitely a tricky area .
So perhaps we should look at a few things P.T. Barnum actually did say that might help you develop a viral online publicity campaign of your own .
These observations are inspired by Joe Vitale ’s There ’s a Customer Born Every Minute .
“ Never attempt to catch a whale with a minnow . ”
Barnum always thought big .
When people told him his plans would never work , he did n’t give up — he simply resolved to make even bigger plans .
Well before our own attention economy , Barnum relentlessly worked every angle to direct the public ’s attention towards his offerings .
He always thought big , but also realized that even tiny details could create a snowball effect when it comes to publicity and word of mouth .
In short , think big or do n’t bother .
“ I would rather hear the pleased laugh of a child over some feature of my exhibition than receive as I did the flattering compliments of the Prince of Wales . ”
What will people spend their last nickel on , even during a period of time as tough as the Great Depression ?
Fun .
While it ’s dangerous to expect humor or entertainment to convert directly into sales in most publicity contexts , delighting the crowd is still a great way to attract attention .
Just think about the annual Go Daddy Super Bowl stunts .
The hoopla has nothing to do with domain name registration ( or even the commercials themselves ) , but it sure has n’t hurt .
“ If I was not a remarkably modest man , I should probably brag a little , and say that I had done what no American ever before accomplished [ by visiting ] the queen at her palace twice within eight days . ”
P.T. Barnum knew the value of personal allies .
The fact that Barnum had people like Mark Twain to help him promote his latest efforts demonstrates why having prominent new media friends makes sense in today ’s world .
And as his references to Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales demonstrate , name - dropping has been a long - time strategy when it comes to publicity .
That ’s right …
Chartreuse did n’t invent it .
“ You know I had rather be laughed at than not to be noticed at all … ”
Perhaps the most important thing you can learn from P.T. Barnum is courage .
It takes courage to step beyond your comfort level and take a risk , and to have the maturity to turn failure into advantage by swallowing your pride and ignoring what people think .
Barnum once ( as a stunt ) offered $ 200,000 to purchase the first circus elephant to give birth in captivity .
That was a whole lot of money back then , but the elephant owner declined , enlarged the telegram Barnum sent , and created a poster that turned it into a compelling Barnum endorsement for the show of his direct competitor .
Rather than crying over spilled milk , P.T. found a kindred spirit to do business with , thereby turning his gaffe into a benefit .
Thus was born the Barnum & Bailey Circus ( those Ringling Brothers came later to create the so - called greatest show on earth ) .
“ Every man ’s occupation should be beneficial to his fellow - man as well as profitable to himself .
All else is vanity and folly . ”
We ’ve come full circle back to the heart of the matter .
Most people can come up with something outrageous .
But is there a payoff for the audience that makes it worth doing ?
Most modern stunt marketing fails this test .
Marketers shock simply to shock , with no larger plan , and certainly no audience payoff beyond the novelty of the disruptive message .
If you can engage and delight your prospective audience in a way that benefits you as well , do it .
If not , you ’re wasting your time and everyone else’s .
P.S. The context in which “ There ’s a sucker born every minute ” was uttered by Barnum ’s rival is a fascinating triple - hoax story involving giants who live beneath the earth , archeology , old - school word of mouth , the danger of investing in things you do n’t understand , and a lawsuit that ended with a startling courtroom confession .

Paul Wolfowitz 's tenure as president of the World Bank was today increasingly under threat , after the bank 's powerful governing body indicated that he broke their ethical guidelines in awarding pay increases to his partner .
The statement by the bank 's board leaves Mr Wolfowitz vulnerable to disciplinary action , especially if the bank president is found to have lied about his handling of the affair .
The news comes just a day after World Bank staff called on him to resign over the matter .
In a statement released this morning , the board said its investigation found that Mr Wolfowitz had approved promotions and pay increases for Shaha Riza - a World Bank staff member with whom he was romantically involved - without a review or decision by the bank 's ethics committee or board of directors .
That contradicts an earlier statement by Mr Wolfowitz 's office which claimed : " All arrangements concerning Shaha Riza were made at the direction of the bank 's board of directors . "
But the board , made up of the 24 executive directors , said today : " The ethics committee , including its chairman , had not been involved in the discussions with the concerned staff member .
Neither did it find that the terms and conditions of the agreement had been commented on , reviewed or approved by the ethics committee , its chairman or the board , " the board said .
It pledged " expeditiously to reach a conclusion on possible actions to take .
In their consideration of the matter the executive directors will focus on all relevant governance implications for the bank . "
The board also released documents and findings of an internal team that investigated the contract agreed with Ms Riza , including memos and letters between Mr Wolfowitz , the board and bank officials .
The bank has clear rules forbidding partners or those in a relationship from working together .
After Mr Wolfowitz 's appointment in mid-2005
Ms Riza was seconded to the US state department , along with a promotion and substantial pay rise - from $ 132,660 to $ 193,590 , tax free - now known to have been personally ordered by Mr Wolfowitz .
The affair is a huge embarrassment for the bank and Mr Wolfowitz , especially given his desire for a tough stance against corruption and rewards for good governance .
Critics say that Mr Wolfowitz 's own actions have now made a mockery of those aims .
With the world 's finance ministers arriving in Washington for a series of scheduled meetings there may be more developments over the weekend .
Gordon Brown , Britain 's chancellor , this morning refused to comment on Mr Wolfowitz 's position when questioned by journalists .
Yesterday the bank president was given the backing of the Bush administration - in which he previously served as deputy defence secretary , and was a key architect of the invasion of Iraq - but the US Treasury was far less enthusiastic , saying : " There is a mechanism in place . "
The latest blow for Mr Wolfowitz came the day after he was heckled and booed by staff members - with some chanting , " Resign , resign " - at the bank 's headquarters as he attempted to address them .
Mr Wolfowitz 's sagging popularity was reinforced in a call by the bank 's staff association - representing the majority of the bank 's 7,000 employees based in Washington - for him to " act honorably and resign " over the saga , saying it was " impossible for the institution to move forward with any sense of purpose under the present leadership " .
Alison Cave , the head of the staff association , said : " The president must acknowledge that his conduct has compromised the integrity and effectiveness of the World Bank and has destroyed the staff 's trust . "
In a strongly worded editorial , the Financial Times also told Mr Wolfowitz to stand down .
Calling the controversy " lethal " to the bank 's credibility , the paper 's leader column said : " In the interests of the bank itself , he should resign .
If he does not , the board must ask him to go . "
During a highly charged press conference in Washington on Thursday , Mr Wolfowitz apologised for becoming involved in his girlfriend 's compensation , but denied that he had done so voluntarily or for personal reasons .
" In hindsight , I wish I had trusted my original instincts and kept myself out of the negotiations , " he said .
Mr Wolfowitz 's fate now lies in the hands of the bank 's executive board members , each representing the World Bank 's major donor nations , ranked by shares reflecting the importance of their stake .
The bank 's regulations allow the president to be dismissed by a simple majority of votes by shareholders - the US being the largest with 16 % of shares .
So far , individual countries have not voiced any public support for Mr Wolfowitz , with executive board members awaiting instructions from their country 's finance ministers .
Among the XML cognoscenti , the debate is effectively over .
Everyone is choosing RELAX NG as their schema language , and compiling to DTDs or W3C XML Schemas as necessary .
I do n’t know of a single project in the last couple of years that considered both RELAX NG and W3C Schemas and chose to go with the latter .
Certainly , there ’ve been a lot of W3C Schema adoptions .
However those seem to have been made mostly by people who did n’t know they had a choice .
In particular , the W3C imprimatur seems very appealing to larger , more bureaucratic organizations such as government agencies .
With that in mind , I thought it might be useful to list some of the groups ( including some of the W3 C ’s own working groups ) who have chosen to do their work in RELAX NG :
Finally libxml , Linux ’s standard XML parser , includes full support for RELAX NG , but only partial and incomplete support for W3C schemas .
That ’s a pretty impressive list , but if the fact that all the cool kids are trying it is n’t enough to get you to take a hit ( government bureaucrats are n’t known for being all that hip to the cool kids anyway ) then maybe this will .
RELAX NG is now an official ISO Standard , ISO / IEC 19757 , Part 2 .
For people and governments who care about such things , ISO documents are real standards .
W3C “ recommendations ” are also - rans .
Try RELAX NG .
I promise it will relieve the stress caused by schemas .
Remember those Little Miss and Mr Men characters you loved when you were a child ?
Mr Happy , Mr Angry , Mr Small …
Well Stella McCartney has been given the honor of being the first person to be turned into a Mr Men character .
Little Miss Stella , a fashion designer who decides to help Little Miss Nobody , who keeps being ignored by people .
One gorgeous Little Miss Stella suit later , Little Miss Nobody is transformed into Little Miss Somebody .
The Little Miss Stella books were used as invitations to Stella ’s spring / summer 2007 collection in Paris ’ Palais de Chaillot .
Stella admits she is thrilled with the book , saying : “ I think it ’s great fun .
The Little Miss books are iconic . ”
The story was created by author and illustrator Adam Hargreaves , son of the creator of the Mr Men and Little Miss book series Roger Hargreaves .
Though some have mused that Little Miss Nobody is a thinly veiled swipe at her step mother , Heather Mills .
Adam Hargreaves said : “ It was great fun working with Stella on the Little Miss Stella story .
I am really delighted that she has become the 84th Mr Men and Little Miss character – if only for a limited time . ”
Britain's Prince Williams girlfriend , Kate Middleton , has painted her royal boyfriend in the nude .
The arty brunette has reportedly outraged Queen Elizabeth II by giving William the cheeky portrait for his 24th birthday , which he celebrated yesterday ( 21.06.06 ) .
The picture features the happy couple in a naked embrace , with their modesty covered by a strip of red silk .
A royal source was quoted in Britains Daily Star newspaper as saying : " Her Majesty has n't seen the painting yet .
But her advisors have described it to her and she is disgusted .
" One presumes Kate and William have got to know each other in the bedroom but for Kate to blatantly announce it in a raunchy painting goes beyond the bounds of decency in the queen 's eyes .
" The monarch has apparently advised the young lovers - who met at St Andrews University where they both studied History Of Art - to take their relationship more seriously and warned William that , as the future King , he should be careful to protect his reputation .
The prince has reportedly decided to go against his grandmother 's pleas and plans to hang the painting on his bedroom wall .
Another source revealed : " It was art that united them in the beginning , so Kate thought it would be appropriate to commemorate their four - year relationship with this romantic painting . "
The Force is with Star Wars fan parodies , many of which were just yanked from popular video - sharing site YouTube .
StarWars.com has just explained that we can go on about our business , because there 's nothing to see here .
Apparently , the Star Wars people were unhappy about some StarWars.com material that had made its way onto YouTube and they asked for it to be taken down .
YouTube , always worried about the copyright case which could put an end to its Internet party , responded by taking down other Star Wars - related material .
George Lucas and company have no problem with such material , however , and have asked the site to reinstate it .
While this has been hailed in some quarters as a corporate about - face , it 's worth pointing out that Lucas ' company still wants their copyrighted material kept off of YouTube .
Though the issue did not escalate into litigation , it underscores the continuing legal uncertainty surrounding some of YouTube 's practices .
If a successful Internet business can be measured by its traffic , then YouTube has the world 's most enviable business model : let users provide content , then stream it to 100 million folks a day .
The only rain cloud in YouTube 's bright blue sky is a little thing called copyright infringement , and critics have wondered for months how the site had so far managed to avoid a flaming , Napster - style death .
The answer is that , under the DMCA , YouTube has " safe harbor " from such accusations so long as it does not upload the videos in question and removes them when requested by copyright holders .
So long as users are contributing infringing material , YouTube is in the clear .
Well , almost .
If the site can be shown to benefit directly from the copyright infringment of its users , it could still be liable ( think Napster , which also did not provide the content for its service ) .
A look back at YouTube 's public history of litigation shows that , despite its reputation for avoiding trouble , the site actually has frequent run-ins with disgruntled copyright owners .
American Airlines was unhappy about an internal training video that made its way onto the site , while film clips of a Los Angeles truck driver beating resulted in a lawsuit from the husband - and - wife team that had shot the footage .
Even when YouTube 's free publicity seems like a benefit , some copyright holders still resent it .
This was the case with NBC , which ordered YouTube to pull copies of Saturday Night Live 's " Lazy Sunday " rap .
YouTube has already made some changes in response to the pressure , like capping the length of uploaded videos for most users .
Still , as these examples of infringement proliferate , the site risks looking like the Napster of video clips , and " safe harbor " claims might not be enough to save their ship from the entertainment industry 's torpedoes .

« The Case of the Overzealous Police Department | Main | The Daily Memo - 1/8/07 »
Harvard Law School :
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
So this probably wo n’t come as a huge shock to you , but celebrities get treated pretty well in our country .
They ’re pretty much the national royalty - as soon as one is spotted , many people and establishments go out of their way to appease and placate said spotted celebrity .
And the celebrities who “ deserve ” such treatment do n’t have to announce their presence or make a declaration of self .
However , there are many other folks who think they ’re celebrities worthy of such royal treatment even though folks do n’t know who they are .
When they ’re not given immediate access to such lavish extravagance , they invariably pull out the “ do n’t you know who I am ” bit .
The answer to which is generally , “ no , although now I know you ’re an asshole . ”
“ Do n’t you know who I am ” has always been my favorite self - declaration made by the truly pompous , but I now have a close number two on that list .
Last Thursday , some Boston cops pulled over a car being driven by 25 - year old Roger DePina .
DePina initially caught the cops ’ eye , according to the police blotter , because he and his passenger “ were yelling and gesturing at [ the ] officers as they passed and continued driving while committing several violations . ”
The cops chased DePina , who initially refused to pull over .
However , he finally stopped on the middle of an entrance ramp to one of the local highways .
When the cops asked DePina for his license and registration , he pulled out this great line :
“ You have no …right to pull us over , regular police ca n’t stop us on the highway , I know my rights , I ’m in Harvard Law School ! ”
I ’m . In . Harvard .
Law .
School .
That ’s bloody brilliant .
Needless to say , DePina does n’t exactly know his rights so well , as the cops can absolutely pull him over .
As a former state trooper explains :
[ I ]n Massachusetts a police with chapter 90 authority ( authority to enforce motor vehicle law ) can stop you on any public road in his jurisdiction .
If you try to get away , he can keep trying to stop you , even outside his jurisdiction .
And a state police officer can stop you anywhere and enforce any state law - even the ones that do n’t have anything to do with motor vehicles .
So DePina was arrested and has been charged with refusal to stop for police and reckless operation of a motor vehicle .
His passenger , who is probably his younger brother ( based on the info in the blotter ) , was also arrested because , get this , he refused to get off of the on - ramp when instructed to do so by the cops , and he then assaulted the officers when they tried to move him out of the way of traffic .
No word if , while being arrested , he said , “ do n’t you know who I am ? ”

BBC News , Athens
Costas Tsalikidis : Did he help set up the phone - tapping ?
Last month , the government admitted that the mobile phones of the prime minister , the most senior members of the cabinet and top security officials had all been tapped in 2004 - the year Athens hosted the Olympic Games .
The committee in Athens has been questioning executives from two of the world 's leading mobile phone companies , Vodafone and Ericsson , about the scandal .
But attention is also increasingly focusing on the alleged suicide of a senior Vodafone manager just after the phone - tapping operation was discovered on the Vodafone network last year .
In a serene but cramped graveyard in the western suburbs of Athens , lies the body of Costas Tsalikidis , a network manager for Vodafone Greece .
He is buried with other members of his family .
But his gravestone shows he died aged just 38 .
He was found hanged in his apartment on the morning of 9 March last year .
The next day , the head of Vodafone Greece walked into the office of one of the prime minister 's top aides to inform the government that its phones had been bugged for at least eight months .
The official verdict was that Mr Tsalikidis had committed suicide .
Suspicions
In a statement issued last month , just after the story about the phone - tapping operation first broke , Vodafone categorically denied there was any connection between his death and the scandal .
" Any attempt to connect these two is , to say the least , irrelevant , " it said .
He would not have co-operated with criminals or criminal acts
Themis Sofos
lawyer
But his family believe his death is suspicious and are calling for his body to be exhumed so a second post - mortem can be carried out by one of the world 's leading forensic pathologists , Dr Michael Baden of the United States .
" They believe they will find new evidence , " says the family lawyer , Themis Sofos .
Dr Sofos adds that other parts of the original investigation were weak .
" No one went to the house of Costas , no one took photos and to see the circumstances of his death ... no one took fingerprints . "
Official inquiry
Mr Tsalikidis ' family recently took matters into their own hands , filing a lawsuit against " persons unknown " for complicity in his murder or suicide .
They allege that even if he was not murdered , he may have faced threats which left him with no choice but to take his own life .
Vodafone Greece CEO Giorgos Koronias has given evidence
Meanwhile , their lawyer has been handing evidence to a prosecutor in Athens , who is now carrying out an official inquiry into the death of Mr Tsalikidis .
The prosecutor is expected to announce his conclusion within the next few weeks .
Family and friends of Costas Tsalikidis believe there are strong indications he was the person who first discovered that highly sophisticated software had been secretly inserted into the Vodafone network in 2004 , enabling at least 100 phone lines to be constantly tapped .
" The end of January or early February ( 2005 ) I think is the time Costas had access or took knowledge of the interception system and he ( re ) searched about its function and origin , " says lawyer Themis Sofos .
" He was not the kind of man to keep secret about something .
He would not have co-operated with criminals or criminal acts . "
Text messages
According to Dr Sofos , Mr Tsalikidis told his fiancee at this time that it was a " matter of life and death " that he leave his job .
I believe he committed suicide to protect his professional honour
John Brady Kiesling
Former US diplomat
The lawyer also says they have looked at text messages he received on his mobile from colleagues in early February 2005 , including one which apparently urges him to keep working and offers him support .
But there is another theory about Costas Tsalikidis : that he was allegedly the person who actually inserted the software setting up the phone - tapping operation .
" It is possible , " says Themis Sofos .
" I can not exclude anything . "
The theory is put forward by John Brady Kiesling a former American diplomat who worked at the US embassy in Athens until resigning in 2003 over the US - led invasion of Iraq .
He is convinced American intelligence agents were behind the whole bugging operation and he says it is possible they used Mr Tsalikidis to install the software .
" I believe he committed suicide to protect his professional honour , " says Mr Kiesling .
As for why the Americans would tap the phones of the political and security elite of a country regarded as an ally , Mr Kiesling says there is a simple answer .
Trust
He argues American intelligence agencies would not have trusted the Greeks with the massive security operation surrounding the Athens Olympics in August 2004 set up to counter any potential terrorist threat .
" They believe you cannot trust foreigners , that foreigners are incompetent and of dubious trustworthiness , " he says .
" You owe it to yourself if you have the capability , to have an independent ear listening to them and I think that is what this was . "
This might also explain why the Greek government kept silent about the scandal for almost a year from March 2005 when it was informed about it , until last month when it finally held a news conference detailing what had happened .
The news conference took place shortly after a Greek newspaper had broken the story .
Despite repeated requests , no - one from the government was willing to give an interview to the BBC about the scandal .
The US embassy also refused to comment and the Vodafone Greece press office would only refer us to statements on its website .
The house is being professionally cleaned
Police said a teenage girl used the social networking site MySpace to advertise the party while her parents were away from home on Easter Monday .
The 17 - year - old 's mother has described the party as " house rape " and called the revellers " worse than animals " .
Guests urinated on a wedding dress and stole jewellery from the house in Houghton - le - Spring , County Durham .
' Absolutely trashed '
Some party - goers also swung from ceiling light fittings , stubbed out cigarettes on the carpet , vomited in buckets throughout the house and barricaded the back door to prevent neighbours from intervening .
It 's absolutely trashed , and I hope no - one else has to go through what me and my wife have these last few days
Teenager 's father
The girl 's parents returned on Tuesday morning to find the trail of destruction at their £ 230,000 house in Chipchase Court .
They have now made a formal complaint of criminal damage to police .
The sixth former 's 48 - year - old mother , who does not want to be identified , said : " I told her that I did not want any kids or drink in the house while I was away and I 'm furious .
" It 's worse than a burglary , I can't believe it .
" Whoever has come in here are worse than animals , it 's like house rape . "
She said her daughter , who has denied creating the message on the website , was now staying with friends for a " cooling off " period .
' Traumatic ' experience
The youngster had expected 30 or 40 guests but 200 turned up .
Her father said the experience had been traumatic .
" It 's absolutely trashed , and I hope no - one else has to go through what me and my wife have these last few days . "
A Durham Police spokesman said some people travelled hundreds of miles to be at the party .
He said : " There has been a formal complaint from the owners of criminal damage to interior fixtures and fittings .
" Inquiries are under way and we plan to speak in due course to as many of the party - goers as we can . "
A federal study showing that fourth graders in charter schools score worse in reading and math than their public school counterparts should cause some soul - searching in Congress .
Too many lawmakers seem to believe that the only thing wrong with American education is the public school system , and that converting lagging schools to charter schools would cause them to magically improve .
The study , based on data from 2003 on students ’ performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress , found charter school students significantly behind their non-charter - school counterparts .
But it also showed that not all charter schools are created equal .
On average , charter schools that were affiliated with public school districts performed just as well as traditional public schools .
That may be a disappointment to advocates who expected them to show clear superiority .
But the real stunner was the performance of free - standing charter schools , which have no affiliation with public school systems and are often school districts unto themselves .
It was this grouping that showed the worst performance .
Free -standing charter schools often bite off more than they can chew .
The presumption is that without the bureaucratic restraints of the public school system and the teacher unions , charter schools can provide better education at lower cost .
But the problem with failing public schools is that they often lack both resources and skilled , experienced teachers .
While there are obvious exceptions , some charter schools embark on a path that simply recreates the failures of the schools they were developed to replace .
Story Highlights • Report alleges Illinois senator attended radical Muslim school as a child
• CNN reporter visits Indonesia school in question , sees no radicalism
• Former classmate calls school " general , " with multiple religions
Adjust font size :
JAKARTA , Indonesia ( CNN ) -- Allegations that Sen. Barack Obama was educated in a radical Muslim school known as a " madrassa " are not accurate , according to CNN reporting .
Insight Magazine , which is owned by the same company as The Washington Times , reported on its Web site last week that associates of Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton , D - New York , had unearthed information the Illinois Democrat and likely presidential candidate attended a Muslim religious school known for teaching the most fundamentalist form of Islam .
Obama lived in Indonesia as a child , from 1967 to 1971 , with his mother and stepfather and has acknowledged attending a Muslim school , but an aide said it was not a madrassa .
( Watch video of Obama 's school )
Insight attributed the information in its article to an unnamed source , who said it was discovered by " researchers connected to Senator Clinton . "
A spokesman for Clinton , who is also weighing a White House bid , denied that the campaign was the source of the Obama claim .
He called the story " an obvious right - wing hit job . "
Insight stood by its story in a response posted on its Web site Monday afternoon .
The Insight article was cited several times Friday on Fox News and was also referenced by the New York Post , The Glenn Beck program on CNN Headline News and a number of political blogs .
( Watch how the Obama " gossip " spread )
School not a madrassa
But reporting by CNN in Jakarta , Indonesia and Washington , D.C. , shows the allegations that Obama attended a madrassa to be false .
CNN dispatched Senior International Correspondent John Vause to Jakarta to investigate .
He visited the Basuki school , which Obama attended from 1969 to 1971 .
" This is a public school .
We do n't focus on religion , " Hardi Priyono , deputy headmaster of the Basuki school , told Vause .
" In our daily lives , we try to respect religion , but we do n't give preferential treatment . "
Vause reported he saw boys and girls dressed in neat school uniforms playing outside the school , while teachers were dressed in Western - style clothes .
" I came here to Barack Obama 's elementary school in Jakarta looking for what some are calling an Islamic madrassa ... like the ones that teach hate and violence in Pakistan and Afghanistan , " Vause said on the " Situation Room " Monday .
" I 've been to those madrassas in Pakistan ... this school is nothing like that . "
Vause also interviewed one of Obama 's Basuki classmates , Bandug Winadijanto , who claims that not a lot has changed at the school since the two men were pupils .
Insight reported that Obama 's political opponents believed the school promoted Wahhabism , a fundamentalist form of Islam , " and are seeking to prove it . "
" It 's not ( an ) Islamic school .
It 's general , " Winadijanto said .
" There is a lot of Christians , Buddhists , also Confucian .
...
So that 's a mixed school . "
The Obama aide described Fox News ' broadcasting of the Insight story " appallingly irresponsible . "
Fox News executive Bill Shine told CNN " Reliable Sources " anchor Howard Kurtz that some of the network 's hosts were simply expressing their opinions and repeatedly cited Insight as the source of the allegations .
Obama has noted in his two books , " Dreams From My Father " and " The Audacity of Hope , " that he spent two years in a Muslim school and another two years in a Catholic school while living in Indonesia from age 6 to 10 .

Observations
MEDIA WATCH
Tell us the truth about nutritionists
Media nutritionism distracts us from social inequality and the real causes of ill health
They ’re certainly keen to praise themselves , but if you really wanted to do some primary prevention work in the community , would you start with the media nutritionists ?
The answer , for reasons of increasing seriousness , is no .
Firstly , to anyone who ’s interested in science , it ’s simply offensive to find newspapers and television channels filled with people who adopt a cloak of scientific authority while apparently misunderstanding the most basic aspects of biology .
“ Dr ” Gillian McKeith has a non-accredited correspondence course doctorate from the United States and a primetime show on Channel 4 television .
She writes that sprouting seeds contain “ all the nutritional energy necessary to make a fully grown plant ” and that chlorophyll is “ high in oxygen , ” and she recommends that you eat “ lots of dark green leaves , because they will really oxygenate your blood . ”
As any 14 year old biology student could tell you , plants only make oxygen in light : it ’s very dark in your bowel ; and even if , to prove a point , you put a searchlight up your bottom , you probably would n’t absorb too much oxygen through the gut wall .
But if we excuse their silliness , do these characters improve the nation ’s health ?
If they do , it comes at a cost : because even the most superficially plausible media nutritionists distort the scientific evidence to justify their profession .
The reality is that intervention trials looking at dietary changes are hard to do .
Broad brush interventions , such as eating fresh fruit and vegetables , have a reasonable evidence base , but there ’s rarely any convincing data for the finicky , obsessive dietary changes detailed in the popular media .
At worst , media nutritionists will , in response to this absence of evidence , simply make it up .
There are plenty of examples in the archives at my site www.badscience.net.
More commonly they cherry pick the literature , selecting only favourable studies and ignoring the overall picture .
But most corrosive is the way they misrepresent , from their position of dominance in the mainstream media , what scientific evidence for a clinical assertion would actually look like .
The entire field is based on a small palette of simple academic errors .
Food gurus extrapolate wildly , creating hypotheses from metabolism flow charts or interesting theoretical laboratory bench data , and then using them to justify a clinical intervention .
One newspaper nutritionist , in the Daily Express , tells us that turmeric is “ highly protective against many forms of cancer , especially of the prostate . ”
But the only evidence for the link between turmeric and prostate cancer is from speculative laboratory studies of cells , usually from rats , growing ( or not growing ) in glass dishes .
Interesting findings these may be , but they are not a sound scientific foundation for real world advice on curry .
Similarly , the media nutritionists extrapolate from observational data to giving “ evidence based ” interventional advice .
In the Mirror recently a “ registered nutritionist ” wrote , “ An Australian study in 2001 found that olive oil ( in combination with fruit , vegetables and pulses ) offered measurable protection against skin wrinkling . ”
But the paper she referred to ( Journal of the American College of Nutrition 2001 ; 20:71 - 80 ) was an observational study , not an intervention study .
It surveyed the diets and wrinkles of people in a pool of four different groups , from different countries , with a range of lifestyles : the confounding variables are hardly tricky to spot .
Media nutritionists speak with a grain of science , but all too often it ’s like the difference between astrology and astronomy .
Nutrition is one of the few areas where the notion of scientific evidence for health interventions is popularly discussed : the nutritionists take this opportunity and use it to promote the public misunderstanding of science , laying fertile ground for health scares and a misled population .
But most offensive to me , as a hard working NHS doctor , is the way that media nutritionists assume the moral high ground , as if they were somehow the source of all that is right and good in the management of lifestyle risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer .
Nutritionists trade on a peculiarly obsessive , overcomplicated , narcissistic , andâ € ” dare I say itâ€ ” right wing , individualist take on the management of risk factors .
But in reality the most important lifestyle risk factors for ill health are difficult and unglamorous ones , such as social inequality .
Public health interventions to address these real problems are far less lucrative and far less of a spectacle than anything a food crank or a television producer would be willing to delve into .
What prime time series looks at food deserts created by drive - in supermarkets , companies with which media nutritionists so often have lucrative commercial contracts ?
Which television shows deal with social inequality as a driver of health inequality ?
Where ’s the human interest in prohibiting the promotion of bad foods , using taxation to make nutrient rich foods more accessible , or maintaining a clear labelling system ?
Where is the spectacle in “ enabling environments ” that naturally promote exercise or in urban planning that prioritises cyclists , pedestrians , and public transport over the car ?
Basic , uncomplicated dietary advice is effective and promotes health .
Overly complicated , confusing , tinkering nutritionism is poorly evidenced , because it ’s a branch of the entertainment industryâ € ” it ’s there to make money , to create a new market for a new profession , to soup up a recipe show , to titillate , to distract us from social inequality and the real lifestyle causes of ill health , and to pander to our collective modern obsession with food .
It tarnishes and undermines the meaningful research work of genuine academics studying nutrition .
The media are now wading into the confusion with programmes such as The Truth About Food , but their efforts are misplaced : it ’s the truth about nutritionists that needs to be told .

Thoughts on ' Reinventing the Internet ' and Identity
Jason Kolb has been writing a great series of posts called ' Reinventing the Internet ' .
I 've been bookmarking and sharing some of these posts via Del.icio.us ( and if you 're sub'd to me , you would have seen these in my feed ) .
Dipping in and out of these since the first post of his series , they seem to be getting better with each post .
In Jason 's first ' Reinventing the Internet ' intro post , he starts off with the assertion that :
Why ?
" If somebody wants to know something about me , I point them to www.jasonkolb.com to find out about me , or to my personal site if it's on a personal level .
Everyone I know tells people to find them via their MySpace account , Linked In account , or blog .
Or , people who still do n't have an account on a social network of some type ( they will ) give out their email address . "
As Jason points out in his second post ' A domain name in every pot ' , companies bet their existence , brand , success and ability to be trusted on this very premise - the domain rules .
So , Jason asks , why not for you and me ?
And then a quick reminder :
" owning your own domain name is like owning the title to your car .
Otherwise , MySpace , Linked
In , your blog provider , or your email provider owns the title to your online identity . "
I think somewhere along the line of my reading the series , Jason kicked me into action as I recently moved my blog to my new domain .
Come to think of it , I 'm amazed that I had n't done this years earlier .
I 've been playing on the web for 12 + years , 10 of those years professionally .
It 's taken me some time , yes , but now I 'm here , wow - it feels good !
And so on to the fundamental question Jason begins to tackle in his series : :
should a blog at a domain name that you own be the epitome of an online presence ?
Well a blog today , and something else tomorrow .
The the point he makes is your domain is yours ( as long as you keep paying the rent that is - Jason has another idea on that permarent issue . )
If the answer to Jason 's question is ' yes ' , then what does it mean ?
What does it enable and why does it matter ?
In the next few posts , Jason describes an architecture involving personal servers , URIs as unique personal online addresses and distributed applications , that will allow everyone to :
" eventually have their own personal server hosted at their own personal domain , and those servers will be able to talk to each other and collaborate with each other .
... be a node on an open source peer to peer social network . "
It is a fascinating idea and it opens up some interesting scenarios ( I 'll get to those in another post ) .
There are two key advancements he has discussed so far that would enable this vision :
an identity system that provides an authentication service that then allows the authorization of the user to connect and interact with distributed systems via their personal server
the internet becomes one giant relational database .
We 'll explore the ' internet as a database ' idea further in another post ( a topic close to my heart ) , but for now I 'm going to stick with the ID question .
As his posts unfolded , I wondered how he saw his ID vision fitting , if at all , with CardSpace - formerly Infocard , the identity metasystem effort led by Kim Cameron .
Today , Jason posted an ' interlude post ' responding to some of the feedback he 's received on his series so far and he called out CardSpace specifically .
Bottom line is that Jason believes there is no fit .
Jason write of CardSpace -
" The alternative to this are identity metadata schemes like CardSpace .
These assume , however , that you will still have pieces of your online identity scattered amongst various providers , which is precisely what I want to get away from .
Consider this statement from the CardSpace information page : " Different kinds of digital identities will always be necessary — no single identity will suffice ...
No single organization can unilaterally impose a solution . "
Basically what I 'm saying in this series of posts is that I completely disagree with this statement .
The individual himself should be the single source of online identity .
There IS a single organization that can unilaterally impose a solution , and that 's the individual .
Power to the people ;) "
Jason and Kim ( and others in the community working with Kim ) agree on the ' power to the people ' mantra .
I 've spoken to Kim , met him and heard him present a couple of times on this and it's a prominent theme in CardSpace ( hey , he even blogged me ! ) .
I realize Jason has at least looked into CardSpace - he quoted from the Seven Laws of Identity - but I 'd encourage him to find out more on what CardSpace has to offer in helping him achieve his vision .
I 'd like to highlight two other quotes from Seven Laws of Identity .
For the uninitiated , think of these Seven Laws as a base set of requirements that any ID system must meet :
" 1. User Control and Consent No one is as pivotal to the success of the identity metasystem as the individual who uses it .
The system must first of all appeal by means of convenience and simplicity .
But to endure , it must earn the user ’s trust above all .
Earning this trust requires a holistic commitment .
The system must be designed to put the user in control of what digital identities are used , and what information is released .
The system must also protect the user against deception , verifying the identity of any parties who ask for information .
Should the user decide to supply identity information , there must be no doubt that it goes to the right place .
And the system needs mechanisms to make the user aware of the purposes for which any information is being collected .
The system must inform the user when he or she has selected an identity provider able to track Internet behavior . "
Back to Jason 's objections , I think the following is another key concept to point out with the identity metasystem - the need to support multiple identity providers and systems .
" 5. Pluralism of Operators and Technologies A universal identity system must channel and enable the inter- working of multiple identity technologies run by multiple identity providers .
So when it comes to digital identity , it is not only a matter of having identity providers run by different parties ( including individuals themselves ) , but of having identity systems that offer different ( and potentially contradictory ) features . "
( My bold ) .
Does this mean that universal identity system proposes or requires the use of a gazillion different username / passwords ?
No , precisely the opposite in fact .
However , the metasystem design accepts a heterogeneous internet as a fact of life ( you know , Utopia is a very hard thing to come by , if not impossible - I 've tried ... ) .
So , should Jason try to solve today 's identity nightmare by trying to get everyone to use his one system , or does he try and solve what he really cares about by using a common layer above the various ID systems , including his , that abstracts out the differences ( various UIs , behaviors , etc ) of these systems out and away from the user ?
You know that the banks / merchants / services ain't going to replace / swap out their ID systems for years , if not decades or at all .
Instead of asking them to replace their systems , they could just adopt an additional ( not replacing ) protocol that we can all agree on and that provides an single common UI / ID experience for the users , and go from there .
That is what we want for users - a better experience , right ?
But to get there , we need to accept that :
" The universal identity metasystem must not be another monolith .
It must be polycentric ( federation implies this ) and also polymorphic ( existing in different forms ) .
This will allow the identity ecology to emerge , evolve , and self - organize . "
The last point is what allows us all to win .
In other words , if Jason 's system works , and it works well , it will interop with any other system that also uses the universal identity metasystem .
If his works really well and populous like it , then Jason 's solution could become the system of choice by the majority of internet users , if that is how it turned out to be .
But without at least an initial level of interoperability between his and the multitude of other systems ( that users will want to use via their personal servers ) , the chances of mass adoption of Jason 's vision / solution are vanishingly small compared to the alternative route .
As I see it , in the ID space there is no downside to playing with the rest of the others .
You can have your cake and it .
I really think Kim and James can and should have a discussion on this .
Home Paul Cohen has died Paul Cohen has passed away .
While not directly involved in programming languages , as far as I know , his seminal work in logic is certainly known and admired by many in the LtU community .

I ’m going to risk provoking business leaders everywhere and state that any leader worth her salt knows how happy her people are at work .
This is a leader ’s most basic responsibility .
You should n’t need to see a pie chart – you should know already .
The question of  How happy are people in our organization ??? is typically handed over to HR who can then distribute a job satisfaction survey that results in a lot of statistics which can then be sliced and diced in any number of way to produce any number of results .
You know – lies , damned lies and statistics ???.
I ’m not saying these surveys are worthless .
Wait a minute : I am saying they ’re worthless .
They ’re a waste of time and money because they very rarely give a company the information or the drive necessary to make positive changes .
As I said , you as a leader / manager should n’t need a survey to know how your people are doing so I challenge you to a simple exercise .
It goes like this :
Make a list of all the people who report to you .
If you ca n’t remember all their names , that ’s a great place to start :o)
Next to each person , put a number from 0 - 10 , based on that person ’s happiness at work .
0 =desperately unhappy , 10 =ecstatic .
Next to each number write what made you choose that score .
What have you observed that person doing / saying / not saying that led you to that particular score .
Here ’s an example of such a chart :
Alice Smith 8
Always sounds positive at meetings , continually praises co-workers , greets everyone with a loud , cheerful “ good morning ” every day John Wallace 4
Very quiet in meetings , has looked tired for weeks , has called in sick often last three months Mia Jensen ?
Good question .
Never complains but never looks particularly happy either .
Mike Wagner 9
Always cheerful , arranged that great picnic a month ago .
Seems friendly with everyone
etc..
Can you do it ?
Can you do it for all of your people or only for some of them ?
If you ’re not reasonably confident of all your scores or if you ’re unable to rate some of your people ’s work - happiness add step 3 b :
Step 3 b : Observe your people for a few days to gather more data .
Do n’t tell them what you ’re doing , just observe them .
Do n’t be weird about it or anything , but take a closer look at your people to find out how happy each of them is .
Once you have more data , update your chart .
A while back a survey showed that 60 % of all managers felt that dealing with their employees took too much time away from their work .
Well guess what :
Your employees are your work !
Your most important responsibility as a manager is to keep them productive .
And that all begins with knowing how they ’re doing and how happy they are at work .
Once you ’ve observed your people and know how they ’re doing , you can go to the last step :
Step 4 : Verify your scores .
Have a fifteen - minute chat with each of your people to find out how happy they are .
Ask them to rate themselves from 0 - 10 .
Also ask them what makes them happy at work and what could make them happier .
And do n’t forget to ask them what they think of how you ’re doing your job !
Do this exercise now and then repeat it periodically .
Every three months is great .
As I wrote that last paragraph , I could almost hear the collective cry going up from the leaders reading this : “ I do n’t have time for your shenanigans – I have too much on my plate already ” .
Let ’s turn that objection upside down :
You do n’t have time not to do it .
This will cost you fifteen minutes per employee every three months but it will save you enormous amounts of time because you install an early warning system that tells you when things are starting to go badly for your people – instead of when they finally blow up and / or quit .
You make them happier at work and your organization / department will reap the benefits .
There are two things you need to be prepared for :
You may be told things about your leadership that you did n’t know and which may not sit well with you .
Be open to whatever criticism and / or praise you recieve .
You ca n’t possibly act on all the feedback you get , some of which may even conflict , but you need to receive it openly and constructively .
Do not get defensive .
When criticized ask follow - up questions to make sure you ’ve understood the criticism fully and then thank the person for their honest feedback .
You also need to act on the feedback you get , to show people that you ’re committed to improving as a leader and that you ’re actually receiving their feedback .
Try it and let me know how it goes .

PyCon 2007 : Web frameworks panel
( this was liveblogged during the panel , and the only later edits were to correct a couple of typos and add this notice — the content has not been changed )
Titus , the moderator , has welcomed everyone .
No blood shed so far .
Probably not taking audience questions .
Introduction of the panelists :
Spyce : Jonathan Ellis
CherryPy : Robert Brewer
TurboGears : Kevin Dangoor
twisted / Nevow : Duncan McGreggor
Zope : Jim Fulton
Django : Adrian Holovaty
Titus pauses :
“ The most interesting thing about Django is , it ’s what Guido would do . ”
Pylons : Ben Bangert
Pyjamas : James Tauber
Titus says he ’ll spark discussion by targeting Zope .
First question : there ’s a wide range of web frameworks , some new , some old .
There are more Python frameworks than reserved Python keywords .
Developers of older frameworks : would you do things differently now ?
New frameworks : what ’s your niche ?
Jim Fulton : When Zope started , the only “ framework ” was the cgi module .
Zope did n’t start as a framework , did n’t target Python programmers or even necessarily technical people .
They moved to the object - centric model and accidentally ended up with all this other stuff .
Python has lots of creative people and makes it easy to produce interesting things — that ’s why there ’s so much stuff .
Duncan : when Nevow was first written there were other frameworks , but nothing that coupled with Twisted .
Robert : CherryPy is trying to scratch a smaller itch .
It deliberately tries to be small enough to keep in your head , but also to enable people to scratch their own itches .
That ’s why frameworks come about — to scratch someone ’s itch .
CherryPy tries to do one thing — HTTP — and do it well .
Kevin : was starting a one - man company and wanted to write as little software as he could .
Considered Rails , but Python already had the pieces to build great stuff , just not the glue to put them together ( yes , he said “ glue ” — that ’s not my paraphrase ) .
Then he had to document how he ’d put everything together , and decided to make that public so others could use it and see how it worked .
Ben : says it was very like TurboGears — Django and TurboGears were n’t out there yet , Ben did n’t want to write a framework .
Reuse was his key factor — he also wanted to write and maintain as little code as possible .
Used Zope and Plone for some stuff , but needed custom things for smaller tasks .
That ’s where Pylons came from .
Adrian : Django came from the kind of “ I ’ve got this data and this story , I need an application to go with it by tomorrow ” .
That led to a set of rapid development conventions , which turned into a framework .
James : ended up spending too much time working on a framework and not enough actually working on sites .
Mentions he ’s now using Django on the server side .
Pyjamas is focused on the client side , with the same sort of ideas as Google Web Toolkit ( which translates Java into client - side JavaScript ) .
People said of GWT , “ why Java ? ”
He reverse - engineered GWT and Pyjamas does Python - to - JavaScript translation .
Handles widgets , compatibility between the JS types and the Python types .
Jonathan : wanted to do Python web development , but all we had was Zope and that “ made me run screaming in the other direction ” .
That ’s one reason why we have so many frameworks .
Would really like to not be in the framework business and be using somebody else ’s framework , but wants something that ’s first of all about pages , not objects ( which Spyce handles ) .
When you control the whole stack you can innovate faster than when you ’re trying to bundle a bunch of components together .
Titus : if someone took Spyce out back and shot it , would you re-create it , or use someone else ’s technology ?
Jonathan : “ I did n’t start a framework , I revived one ” .
It ’d be a tough call ; likes what Django does as far as controlling the whole stack , but the Django ORM is really feeble .
Duncan : there ’s a perception that the multitude of frameworks is a weakness .
It ’s not ; it should be celebrated .
Robert interjects : every time somebody pops up on comp.lang .
python and suggests an experimental framework , people say “ do n’t do that , somebody else has done it ” .
Robert says do it , it ’s the only way to get to what you do like .
James : re-inventing the wheel is great if your goal is to learn more about wheels .
Titus asks Kevin if he ’d consider using a different framework .
Kevin : “ Pylons is pretty cool ” .
Philosophically , Pylons and TG are fairly similar , though they ’ve made a few different choices .
Kevin thinks you can have more innovation with individual components with their own maintainers than with a full stack .
He ’s pushing to have things broken up into components for that reason .
Titus : question for Django about blog debates : “ tightly integrated ” versus “ loosely coupled ” .
People get led to believe Django components ca n’t be pulled apart .
How do you do both “ tightly integrated ” and “ loosely coupled ” .
How do components differ from a full stack ?
Adrian ( on “ full stack ” versus other methodologies ) : you ca n’t do both .
Documentation is a huge thing ; he does n’t want the tutorial to say “ here ’s how you connect to the DB , but you could also do this or this or this ” .
It ’s cool to be able to do that , and lots of people care about it , but you ’ve got to pick a focus .
Django needs better docs on integrating with other stuff , because we ’ve been doing documentation that assumes the Django stack .
Need better advanced docs for that .
Titus : in conjunction with a full stack being good for beginners , but advanced people pulling things out , how does Zope handle it ?
Jim : it ’s the documentation story .
You have to have stories : tell stories that address problems .
Stories for people who are beginning , people with specific needs , it feels like a documentation issue .
A peeve of his is “ understanding the problems the solutions are appropriate for ” .
Zope is not the solution for creating a simple CGI application .
It ’s not a problem Zope tries to have a story for .
You ’ve got to be clear what your goals are and tell stories .
Titus : the Pylons docs say , “ thank you for choosing Pylons , here are the choices you need to make ” .
Rebuttal in light of what Adrian and Jim just said ?
Ben : we did make a conscious effort to push beginners down a single route .
All our recommendations for beginners are based on “ keep it as simple as possible ” .
Starting to change some of the recommendations .
Something convenient to use , but powerful enough that you wo n’t run into walls .
If something does n’t give you the right feeling , they want it to be easy to swap out .
Titus pulls up a question from Eric Dobbs ; the plethora of web frameworks seems Perlish and not Pythonic .
Quick responses ?
Robert : Python the language is n’t domain - specific .
Frameworks are , and so there ’s naturally a larger set of approaches and multiple ideas about how to solve the problems .
Python is two decades old , how many of these frameworks are that old ?
There ’s a push to make them mature , but at the same time we ’re still experimenting to find the best way .
It ’s a bit much to expect maturity on par with , say , Apache .
Several other panelists murmur “ that ’s a perfect answer ” .
Titus : final set of questions is on AJAX .
In terms of your JavaScript plan and support for AJAX , do you have good support ?
Could it be better ?
Are you looking at other toolkits ?
James : that ’s a different kind of question for me .
Am I looking for a particular sort of framework to tie myself to ?
Not yet .
He uses Django , but TurboGears might be a better fit for how Pyjamas works .
Cherry Py might be perfect .
The AJAX story is Pyjamas .
There is a lot of overlap between what Pyjamas does and the two types of JS libraries that exist ( one provides a lot of data stuff , one provides a lot of UI stuff ) .
Pyjamas does use a lot of existing stuff ; it used Mochikit ’s iterator implementation , for example .
Initial goal was to duplicate Google Web Toolkit .
Titus to Jonathan : you said it ’s about pages .
In light of AJAX , how do you deal with that ?
Jonathan : there ’s a difference between page - based that wants to be a little more dynamic , and then the Flex - style all - dynamic application .
Titus to Adrian : does Django have an AJAX plan ?
Adrian :
We do n’t ship with a JS framework .
Having Python produce JavaScript is like using a motorized wheelchair because you ’re too lazy to walk .
If you ship with a default library you could n’t please everyone .
Code generating code would be messy .
Django gets a rep as “ it does n’t do AJAX ” .
That ’s because we do n’t ship a library , but it does n’t mean you ca n’t use AJAX .
Cites a couple examples .
Though a lot of it is our fault for not documenting examples — people do n’t see docs and then assume “ Django ca n’t do AJAX ” .
So our plan is documentation .
Titus : that ’s been your answer several times .
Adrian : that ’s the most important thing we can do .
Staff member pops up : anyone using the schedule app for PyCon , you ’re using Django with “ AJAX ” ( not XML , technically ) .
Jim : “ I ’m the wrong guy to ask . ”
Plone is using something that ’s pretty nice , at Zope Corporation they use MochiKit quite a bit .
It ’s not clear what the relationship between the JS library and the server technology should be .
There should be some hooks , but they should be server - tech - agnostic .
Duncan : “ we were there first ” .
They had AJAX before it was called AJAX .
Ben : originally was looking at a lot of frameworks to see how they did it .
Saw Rails ’ helpers and wanted that functionality , so he ported them all to Python as WebHelpers , which runs independent of framework .
Generates some things , is pretty neat and easy to use .
In the future , looking toward Pyjamas .
Titus thanks the panelists for coming , and we ’re done .
" I 'm not sure where we went wrong , " says Ellen McCormack , nervously fondling the recycled paper cup holding her organic Kona soy latte .
" It seems like only yesterday Rain was a carefree little boy at the Montessori school , playing non-competitive musical chairs with the other children and his care facilitators . "
" But now ... " she pauses , staring out the window of her postmodern Palo Alto home .
The words are hesitant , measured , bearing a tale of family heartbreak almost too painful for her to recount .
" But now , Rain insists that I call him Bobby Ray . "
Even as her voice is choked with emotion , she summons an inner courage -- a mother 's courage -- and leads me down the hall to " Bobby Ray 's " bedroom , for a firsthand glimpse at the psychic devastation that claimed her son .
She opens the door to a reveal a riot of George Jones CDs , reflective ' mudflap mama ' stickers , empty foil packs of Red Man , and U.S. Marine recruiting posters .
In the middle of the room : a makeshift table made from a utility cable spool , bearing a the remains of a gutted catfish .
" This used to be all Ikea , " she says , rocking on heels between heaved sobs .
" It 's too late for us .
Maybe it's not to late for me to warn others . "
Pandora 's Moon Pie Box
While poignant , Ellen McCormack 's painful battle to save her son is far from isolated .
Across coastal America , increasing numbers of families are discovering that their children have been lured into " Cracker " culture -- a new , freewheeling underground youth movement that celebrates the hedonistic thrills of frog - gigging and outlaw modified sprint cars .
No one knows their exact number , but sociologists say that the movement is exploding among young people in America 's most fashionable zip codes .
" We first detected it a few years ago , with the emergence of the trucker hat phenomenon , " says Gerard Levin , professor of abnormal sociology at the University of California .
" At first we thought it was some sort of benign , ironic strain .
By the time we realized the early wearers really were interested in seed corn hybrids and Peterbilts , it had already escaped containment . "
Levin points to ' Patient Zero , ' who in 1997 was a 23 - year old graduate student in Gender Studies at San Francisco State University .
" During a cross-country trip to New York , he stopped at the Iowa 80 Truck Stop in Walcott , Iowa , and bought a John Deere gimme cap as a gag souvenir , " says Levin .
" Within a year , he had dropped out of graduate school , abandoned his SoMa apartment , and and was working at a drive - thru liquor store .
Today he is a wealthy televangelist in Bossier City , Louisiana . "
The contagion of ' Patient Zero ' would prove devastating .
Soon trucker hats were appearing throughout trendy coastal neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Park Slope and Portrero Hill , often accessorized with chain wallets and ' wife beater ' t- shirts .
A new alternative youth movement had emerged , rejecting the staid norms of establishment NPR society and embracing the ' tune - in , turn - on , chug - up ' ethos of the Pabst Blue Ribbon underground .
Before long , it would broadcast its siren call to an even younger generation -- one whose parents were woefully unequipped to recognize it .
Youthquake
" It was one day last spring , " says Ellen McCormack .
" My life partner Carol and I were in the garage , working on a giant Donald Rumsfeld papier mache head for the Bay Area March Against the War , when Rain walked by .
I thought he looked kind of strange , so I stopped him and looked closely into his eyes .
Then I realized the truth -- he was wearing a mullet .
I was shocked , but he swore to me that it was only ironic . "
" After a few months , it was clear Rain had lied to us -- that hideous Kentucky waterfall was completely earnest , " she adds , choking back sobs .
Her 18 - year old son would soon exhibit other signs of disturbing changes .
" I was driving past a McDonalds one day last summer , and I thought I saw Rain 's bike outside .
He had told me earlier that he was going to a friend 's house to stuff envelopes for the Dennis Kucinich campaign .
I pulled a U - turn and headed back , " she recalls .
" When I confronted him in the parking lot , he started giving me a lame story about how he was only there to protest globalization , but I could smell the french fries on his breath . "
McCormack says that Rain 's erratic behavior would also come to include excessive politeness and deference .
" Everytime I tried to talk to him it was ' yes Momma , ' and ' no Momma , ' when he knows damn well my name is Ellen , " she says , anger rising in her voice .
" It was like I did n't even know him anymore . "
McCormack tried an intervention with friends from the Anti-war community , but to no avail .
In October , Bobby Ray packed up his Monte Carlo and left for basic training at Camp Pendleton .
" I have no son , " she says in a barely audible whisper .
Across the country
In toney Westchester County , New York , Jim and Sandy Vandenberg describe a similar tale of family grief .
" We are people of faith who keep the sabbath , " says Sandy , a curator in the Dada collection of the Museum of Modern Art .
" Even when she was a toddler , we made sure Emily got up early every Sunday morning to read the New York Times Book Review .
Sunday morning was our time , until ... "
" Until those damned Jesus bastards stole my little girl , " interrupts her husband , barely containing his anger .
Once a Freshman honors student in Lacanian Deconstruction
Theory at NYU , their daughter is now better known as Lurleen McDaniel -- reigning Princess of the Tulsa Livestock Show and Rodeo .
In Bainbridge Island , Washington , single mom Jane Michelson says she began suspecting that her son Brian was in trouble after he started hanging with a new crowd at school .
" These were n't normal kids , neighborhood kids in Che t- shirts who want to drop a couple of hits of X and chill on Radiohead , " she says .
" They would talk in a sort of strange code language , like ' Roll Tide ! ' and ' Gig 'em Ags ! ' and ' Piiiig Sooieeee ! ' "
Signs of trouble would soon multiply .
" One day I got into my Volvo and hit the stereo preset for Pacifica Radio , and then I heard this obscene ' Save a Horse Ride a Cowboy ' song coming from the speakers , " she recalls .
" The very next week , the maid found a tin of Skoal in his Wranglers .
I told him him right then -- it was either me , or his tobacco - spitting friends . "
Now known as Randy Dale Cash , her estranged son is a starting linebacker for Sul Ross State University in Alpine , Texas .
Peer Pressure
Jane Michelson is not alone in her story .
Throughout coastal America , school adminstrators and parents are reporting an alarming surge in ' Cracker ' cliques on campus .
Also known as ' Y' alls ' or ' Neckies , ' officials say the groups thrive by attracting outcasts and misfits from the student body .
" We try hard to engage all of our students in fun , healthy activities like Progressive Eco-Action March and Rage Against Intolerance Week , " says Lawrence DiBenedetto of Patrice Lumumba Magnet School in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
" Unfortunately , there are going to be those who fall through the cracks , into a life of bass fishing and stockcar racing . "
It appears those cracks are widening .
In one recent three - week period , fourteen high school students in Portland , Oregon were suspended for distributing pork rinds ; a Burlington , Vermont high school was briefly closed for decontamination after janitors found a bible hidden in a restroom ; and forty - six undergraduate coeds at Swarthmore were expelled for staging clandestine Mary Kay cosmetics parties .
" We became suspicious after several heavily made - up students arrived at a Katha Pollitt lecture in a pink Cadillacs , " says Swarthmore Dean of Students Geraldine Marcus .
Some say the craze threatens even the nation 's most exclusive prep schools .
At Exeter , Andover and St. Albans , rumors abound of secret societies where initiates are steeped in the black arts of restrictor plate cheating and satellite descramblers .
Washington 's elite Sidwell Friends School was nearly forced to close after scandalized parents learned that several students were openly touting Sams Club cards .
The Eclectic School Aid Hayseed Trip
To better understand what attracts young affluent students to the subculture , I spent a recent evening interviewing a group of self - described ' Neckies ' from exclusive New Trier High School in Winnetka , Illinois .
Like countless other Friday nights , the close - knit group had made the 80 mile ritual journey to rural Belvidere , Illinois , to cruise Steak ' N ' Shake and hang out at the Mills Fleet Farm parking lot .
" Y'all , check out these new mudders , " says 17 - year old ' Dakota , ' proudly displaying the gigantic knobbed tires under his radically lifted 4x4 Audi Allroad .
" I 'm fixin ' to get me a winch and Tuffbox fer it next week . "
Not to be outdone , friend and fellow Neckie ' Duane ' sounds ' Dixie ' on the novelty horn of his jacked - up BMW M3 .
An early graduation gift from his parents , Duane has turned the expensive German coupe into an homage to the Dukes of Hazzard 's General Lee , complete with orange Stars - and - Bars paint job and spit cup on the console .
" Grandma gave me some money fer a summer study trip over ta Paris , but I thought the paint job was cooler , " laughs Duane .
" Hell , she thinks I 'm over in the Sorbonne right now , studying Foucault and all that shit . "
" I'm a - fixin ' to put in a nitrous system on the General Lee , so I 'ma call Grandma up and aks her for some book money , " he adds .
Like most of their classmates , these North Shore Neckies were once bound for some of the top universities in America -- Yale , Duke , Stanford , Northwestern -- until they succumbed to the allure of the Downhome slacker lifestyle .
Now some openly talk of dropping out , learning TIG welding , waiting tables at Waffle House or draining oil at Jiffy Lube ; some even hint of enrolling at Iowa State .
What drives privileged teens to such seemingly self - destructive behavior ?
" I guess you might could say we 're rebels , " says Rachel ' Tyffanie ' Stern , 17 , lighting a Merit Menthol 100 .
Once destined for Vassar , Stern is now living with friends after her parents kicked her out of the house for spending her bat mitzvah money on a bass boat .
Last month she became the youngest Jewish female to win an event on the Bassmasters Pro Tour .
Pausing for furtive glances , several of the teens share sniffs from a bottle of Harmon Triple Heat deer scent .
" Wooo - eee , shit howdy , that 's gonna bring a mess of them whitetail bucks , " says 19 - year old Wei - Li ' Lamar ' Cheung .
A former Westinghouse Science Award winner , Cheung has devoted his chemistry and biology skill to building a fledgling hunting supply business .
A first generation Asian - American , Cheung says he was drawn to the group by their acceptance of minorities .
" Hell , I kept tellin ' all my family and teachers I wanna play fiddle , not violin , " he explains .
" The ' Necks accept me the way I am . "
African - American Kwame ' Joe Don ' Harris agrees .
" Just because I 'm black , teachers were always pushing me to go to Spellman to study Langston Hughes and Thelonius Monk , " says the 17 year old .
" These ol ' boys here never laugh at my dream to be a crew chief for the Craftsman Truck Series . "
If there is one aspiration that unites them all , it is the dream of moving to Branson , Missouri .
Long famed for its laid - back attitude toward religion , country music and the military , Branson has become a Mecca for radical young Neckies seeking an escape from the stultifying conformity of their coastal hometowns .
" Shit , y'all , I heard Branson 's got like four Wal Marts , and more $ 5.95 all - day breakfast buffets than Glencoe has Starbucks , " enthuses Dakota , adding quickly that " pardon my French . "
" Plus it 's only a short drive up to Fort Leonard Wood , " adds Tyffanie .
Talk arises of Branson 's ' Summer of Bubba , ' the upcoming hedonistic hillbilly festival of music , hog calling and nightcrawler gathering expected to draw millions of Neckies from as far as Santa Monica and Ithaca -- even Europe .
" Y'all , I heard them Swedish ' Necks are hardcore , " says Joe Don .
" They digitally remastered all the original Jerry Clower albums . "
A live - for - today attitude permeates the group 's ethos , with little concern about consequences .
I ask Justin ' Jim Rob ' Borowski , 18 , what motivates young men and women to abandon promising academic careers in Gender Theory and Critical History to take a wild ride in the dark world of roofing and drywall contracting .
" My daddy was sorta mad when I tolt him I was gonna skip Columbia Journalism School for a plumbing apprenticeship , " he answer philosophically , popping a plug of Red Man into his lip .
" I tolt him that journalism is important , but the world needs plumbers too . "
" After the toilet backed up , I think he got my point . "
DIGG THIS
" The day may come when the courage of men fails ; when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship .
But it is not this day !
This day we fight ! "
~ Aragorn , The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King
I 've already lamented the use and abuse of high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) in pretty much all processed foods .
It seems clear that the state , in an effort to " help " corn farmers , has hurt everyone else .
But at least in that case , albeit difficult , we can still choose to avoid that poison .
Several respondents to my essay made that point in their messages to me .
It 's tough , but the choice is still there .
I agree , although without the state 's involvement , our choices would certainly be larger .
Then again , that 's always the case , is it not ?
As Manual Lora and I tried to convey in our most recent joint essay , choice for each of us is best for all of us .
Enter the Trans Fat Police
In a twist of irony only available from gubmint involvement , New York State recently imposed a ban on trans fats .
For those who have n't heard , trans fats are the result of trying to make vegetable fats , typically not suitable for cooking and baking due to molecular structure , into a substance suitable for both .
For instance , to get that " moistness " that we all crave in our baked goods , one generally must use oil that is solid at room temperature .
( And this is verified by my memory of my Grandma 's biscuits ! )
This is relatively easy if one uses animal fats ( lard , butter ) or some tropical oils ( coconut , palm ) .
But somewhere back a decade or two or three ago , it became unpopular to use saturated fats .
It also became unpopular to use imported tropical oils , particularly coconut oil , although even with their high saturation level , they are still some of the healthiest oils one can consume .
Not that surprisingly , the soy lobby ( or the edible oil industry , if you prefer ) authored most of the information used to vilify tropical oils .
( I know — shocking . )
Luckily , plentiful ( cheap ) oils were available from the fertile farmlands of the North American Continent .
Unluckily , these oils were naturally polyunsaturated — lacking in hydrogen atoms along the chain of carbons — and therefore less than optimal for baking .
Worse yet , these fats were unstable and spoiled rather quickly , particularly when heated .
Science came to the rescue and found a way to add hydrogen atoms along the molecular chain of these oils — via a process know as hydrogenation — creating what were called partially hydrogenated oils .
The resulting substance could be used for baking and was still vegetable - based .
Healthy , cheap , and produced on this continent — a veritable " trifecta " — Yahtzee !
Not quite .
It was more recently discovered that these fake fats were actually much worse for you than the stuff they replaced .
( That there are still people using margarine at this late date is testimony that this information has n't quite reached the hoi polloi . )
Health - conscious people began to raise a stink about these " trans fats , " while study after study illustrated their awesome power for clogging arteries better than even the lardiest lard ever supposedly could .
[ As an aside , studies seem to show that the prevalence of clogged arteries in the U.S. , where a " war " on saturated fats has been waged for decades , is much higher than that among cultures whose diets are just chock - full of fat from blubber .
When people from these cultures — e.g. , Inuits — switch to more " mainstream " diets , they experience an increased rate of heart disease .
( Maybe consumption of dietary fat per se is n't what makes you unhealthy ? )
But , I digress . ]
Here we are with trans fats being banned .
This occurred long after they had been placed in just about every baked item sold in the overwhelmingly large — nearing gargantuan — processed food market in the U.S .
The problems here are almost too many to name .
First of all , people are ( or should be ) free to choose .
If they really do n't want to consume trans fats , they are free to not do so .
If a restaurant wants to use them , I am free to not dine there while you are free to enjoy them if you like .
Everyone is happy .
Secondly , the prevalence of trans fats is largely the result of government interference anyway , so why would even more government involvement make things better ?
Let 's review this little scenario .
Initially people are free to use whatever they want , including lard , butter , coconut oil , olive oil , and / or palm oil , etc .
( Some people are fat , but hey , that was less about the fats and more about their lifestyle choices , among other things . )
Aggressive lobbying by the edible oil industry causes adoption , at the federal government level , of dietary goals and guidelines that incorporate the mistaken idea that consumption of saturated fat causes heart disease .
( State intervention makes finding a domestic substitute for these fats financially critical . )
Because of inherent limitations , polyunsaturated vegetable oils are unsuitable for baking ; partially hydrogenated oils are developed to mitigate these effects .
( Manufacturers , seeking to maximize profits while meeting the federal guidelines eagerly incorporate this crap into , well , everything . )
After years of clogged arteries , heart attacks , bypass surgeries and the like , somebody discovers that making a cheap vegetable oil into a baking fat via the magic of chemistry also changes the properties of that oil for the worse .
( Who knew ? )
State intervention seeks to preclude that which was originally facilitated largely by state intervention — trans fats are banned .
( Complete symmetry is achieved . )
Conclusion
Is n't it always the same thing ?
Second verse same as the first .
By the way , any similarity in the conclusions I draw here and the message from my HFCS essay is entirely intentional .
But let 's be clear .
It 's not my place to make choices of this type for anyone else and neither is it the government 's place .
( I 've already got a mother , but thanks anyway . )
Let the right and the responsibility rest where they should .
As a matter of fact , if you want to sit by the dock of the bay stuffing your face with beef - tallow - soaked fast - food French fries , washing them down with a carbonated beverage just chock - full of HFCS while taking the edge off with an unfiltered cigarette delivered by an illegal alien after it was manufactured in a Cuban factory and subsequently soaked in crystal methamphetamine , I could not care less .
I celebrate your decision to " do it your way . "
I might , in the words of Tony Soprano , suggest that you " consider salad " and I 'd likely advise you of the dangers of " tweaking " but hey , it would still be your choice .
And , if you and your friends want to open a restaurant where second - hand smoke is actually on the menu , right next to endangered fish delicately pan seared with a delightful , but trans fat - laden chipotle sauce , I 'm cool with that too .
( Let 's just say I 'm easy and leave it at that . )
My message here is simple : I do n't want your choices to become my choices because the lobbying group you hired can convince some slacker with a congressional budget that it's a good idea .
Furthermore I do n't want my personal choices — be they good or bad — reduced because of similar chicanery .
Is that too much to ask ?
But let us not forget Aragorn 's words .
Change has to begin with us .
Maybe , just maybe , if each of us realizes and acts upon the fact that the ultimate choice — and responsibility — should always be ours , we 'll get to start choosing for ourselves sooner or later .
Hey , I can hope .

Conservative scribe Ann Coulter cribbed liberally in her latest book , “ Godless , ” according to a plagiarism expert .
John Barrie , the creator of a leading plagiarism - recognition system , claimed he found at least three instances of what he calls “ textbook plagiarism ” in the leggy blond pundit ’s “ Godless : the Church of Liberalism ” after he ran the book ’s text through the company ’s digital iThenticate program .
He also says he discovered verbatim lifts in Coulter ’s weekly column , which is syndicated to more than 100 newspapers , including the Fort Lauderdale ( Fla . ) Sun-Sentinel and Augusta ( Ga. ) Chronicle .
Barrie , CEO of iParadigms , told The Post that one 25 - word passage from the “ Godless ” chapter titled “ The Holiest Sacrament : Abortion ” appears to have been lifted nearly word for word from Planned Parenthood literature published at least 18 months before Coulter ’s 281 - page book was released .
A separate , 24 - word string from the chapter “ The Creation Myth ” appeared about a year earlier in the San Francisco Chronicle with just one word change – “ stacked ” was changed to “ piled . ”
Another 33 - word passage that appears five pages into “ Godless ” allegedly comes from a 1999 article in the Portland ( Maine ) Press Herald .
Meanwhile , many of the 344 citations Coulter includes in “ Godless ” “ are very misleading , ” said Barrie , who holds a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley , where he specialized in pattern recognition .
“ They ’re used purely to try and give the book a higher level of credibility – as if it ’s an academic work .
But her sloppiness in failing to properly attribute many other passages strips it of nearly all its academic merits , ” he told The Post .
Barrie says he also ran Coulter ’s Universal Press columns from the past 12 months through iThenticate and found similar patterns of cribbing .
Her Aug. 3 , 2005 , column , “ Read My Lips : No New Liberals , ” about U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter , includes six passages , ranging from 10 to 48 words each , that appeared 15 years earlier in the same order in an L.A .
Times article , headlined “ Liberals Leery as New Clues Surface on Souter ’s Views . ”
But nowhere in that column does she mention the L.A. Times or the story ’s writer , David G. Savage .
Her June 29 , 2005 , column , “ Thou Shalt Not Commit Religion , ” incorporates 10 facts on National Endowment for the Arts - funded work that originally appeared in the same order in a 1991 Heritage Foundation report , “ The National Endowment for the Arts : Misusing Taxpayers ’ Money . ”
But again , the Heritage Foundation is n’t credited .
“ Just as Coulter plays free and loose with her citations in ‘ Godless , ’ she obviously does the same in her columns , ” Barrie said .
Coulter did not respond to requests for comment .

WASHINGTON ( AP )  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ' allies on Capitol Hill grew scarce Tuesday as he left it largely to aides to carry out President Bush 's order to straighten out the story behind the firing of eight federal prosecutors .
Senate Republicans exiting their weekly policy lunch no longer bothered to defend Gonzales ' response to lawmakers ' questions about the firings .
At most , they mustered an appeal to withhold judgment until the attorney general testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 17 .
That was Sen. Arlen Specter 's message during the closed - door meeting , according to three senators who were present .
" Senator Specter today said to give ( Gonzales ) a fair chance , " said Sen. Jeff Sessions , R - Ala. , a staunch White House ally who lunched with Gonzales last week .
" I think people are trying to do that .
But there are some inconsistent stories ( Gonzales ) is going to have to explain . "
Among them :
Why Gonzales said at a March 13 news conference that he " never saw documents " and " never had a discussion " about the firings .
His schedule for last Nov. 27 showed he participated in an hourlong meeting and approved a detailed plan on the dismissals 10 days before they were carried out .
Gonzales has maintained he was not closely involved in the firings , and did not help select which prosecutors would be told to resign .
" I believe in truth and accountability , " he said Tuesday in Chicago at a news conference that lasted less than three minutes .
" Everything I 've done in connection with this matter supports that principle . "
Still , defending Gonzales became more difficult with Monday 's refusal by his counsel , Monica Goodling , to testify before the Judiciary Committee with other Justice officials involved in the firings , as the attorney general had promised .
She said statements by Democrats indicate they have already concluded wrongdoing on the part of Justice officials , including her .
Specter empathized .
" I can understand the sense of a potential witness not wanting to be ensnared in that kind of a proceeding where conclusions have already been reached , " Specter , R - Pa. , said Tuesday on the Senate floor .
Goodling 's announcement , some senior Republicans felt , strengthened the Democrats ' charge that the Justice Department had something to hide .
All of which added up to scandal fatigue inside the caucus , the senators said .
Specter 's appeal to the caucus received " a lot of head shaking , a lot of eye - rolling , " said one senator who attended and spoke on condition of anonymity because the session was private .
Asked Tuesday if Gonzales had lost their confidence , many Senate Republicans demurred .
Sen . John McCain 's response was typical .
" He has my confidence that I think he ought to make his case , " said the Arizona Republican , who also is running for president .
Other members of Congress did n't hold back .
Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Michigan , top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , said Gonzales has been " badly weakened " by conflicting Justice Department stories on the firings — including his own .
" The president needs to make the decision as to whether this drip , drip , drip on the attorney general , you know — there 's not anything that 's come out in 10 days to enhance ( his ) position or credibility , " Hoekstra said on C - Span 's Washington Journal .
One of Gonzales ' fellow Texans weighed in .
" This nation deserves better than to have an attorney general who cannot be forthright with Congress and misleads the citizens he has been sworn to protect , " said Rep .
Ted Poe , R - Texas .
" He has a credibility issue . "
Bush has said he supports Gonzales , a longtime friend from Texas .
But in two news conferences and at least one private phone call , Bush has put the onus on Gonzales to fight to keep his job , and White House aides have said the attorney general is his own best advocate .
But it 's unclear how intensely Gonzales has reached out to Capitol Hill .
Rather than dig in and win support from lawmakers he has never really courted , Gonzales lunched with some friendly Republicans last week — Sens. Jon Kyl of Arizona , Sessions and fellow Texan John Cornyn .
He also has spoken with Specter and followed up by phone with the other three , according to Specter and Justice officials .
Aides in Bush 's Office of Legislative Affairs have contacted lawmakers to reiterate the president 's support for Gonzales , according to White House spokeswoman Dana Perino .
She said she has not asked the president whether he is satisfied with Gonzales ' efforts to shore up support in Congress .
Bolstered by Bush 's support , Gonzales has refused to step down .
" It will be very difficult for the White House or the attorney general to improve the situation because the attorney general has lost the confidence of so many senators , " said Sen . John Sununu , R - N.H. , who remains the only GOP senator to explicitly call for Gonzales to resign .
The Justice Department , meanwhile , on Tuesday rejected the Senate Judiciary Committee 's request for information blacked out in documents released in the past week , including details about federal prosecutors who were not asked to resign and potential replacements .
Unlike the fired prosecutors ' shortcomings , which the agency made public , those still on the job " had no involvement in this controversy and their reputations should not be unnecessarily maligned , " wrote acting Assistant Attorney General Richard A. Hertling .

Many prisoners are al - Qaeda or Taleban suspects
Eighteen prisoners have been hospitalised , including 13 who are being tube - fed .
Lawyers for the detainees say they are demanding release or immediate trial .
This is the latest in a series of hunger strikes since 2002 by detainees , who are held at the facility on Cuba as part of the US war on terror .
If their condition appears to weaken , they will be brought to the hospital and either fed intravenously or nose - fed
Capt John Adams , detention centre spokesman
Lawyers for the detainees said as many as 200 were involved in the protest .
Many of the inmates have been held without charge for more than three years .
A hunger strike in July ended when the Pentagon agreed to talk to inmates .
The prison at Guantanamo holds about 500 prisoners from nearly 40 countries .
Starve to death
A spokesman for the detention centre , Capt John Adams , says all those inmates hospitalised are being monitored by doctors at the camp , AFP news agency reports .
" Everyone is stable at this time .
If their condition appears to weaken , they will be brought to the hospital and either fed intravenously or nose fed , " says Captain Adams .
The Pentagon says many prisoners have been sent home
During the previous hunger strike , the prisoners were monitored by medical professionals and also admitted to hospital where necessary .
The New York - based Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , which has provided lawyers for many detainees , say some prisoners have threatened to starve to death unless they are put on trial or released , the Associated Press reports .
The US military has also denied claims by the CCR that at least three detainees were abused by the military 's Extreme Reaction Force , AP says .
The Pentagon says nearly 250 prisoners have been sent to their home countries from Guantanamo since the prison operation began .
An Afghan prisoner sent back two days ago was identified by Afghan state television as Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef , the former Taleban ambassador to Pakistan , Reuters news agency reports .
Many of the prisoners are al - Qaeda and Taleban suspects detained during the 2001 war in Afghanistan .
As most inmates are held as enemy combatants they are not protected by the Geneva Convention and can be held indefinitely , the US government says .
Overview
A handwriting system that used the simplest possible strokes for letters would , of course , be faster to write with than longhand , which uses several , sometimes as many as four , strokes for each letter .
And if the system were phonetic , words could n't be misspelled !
The usual 26 letter alphabet just does n't have enough letters to represent all the 32 + sounds used in English , especially vowel sounds , so several letters are often used to represent a single sound .
The word " ought , " for example , uses five letters to write only two sounds .
So a really slick form of handwriting would use one stroke for one sound .
Simple , but too difficult ?
Not necessarily .
You just need to learn to hear the sounds that you use when speaking English so you can write them , and then learn some simple symbols to represent those sounds .
Since you have been taught to pay attention to 26 letters and not the actual sounds of English , tuning in to speech sounds may take some time , but can also be quite interesting and fun .
In the box below is a summary of everything you need to learn to start writing faster .
As a bonus , hardly anyone ( probably no one you know ) will be able to read your writing .
Handywrite System Summary
To better understand the above , study the following .
Notice how , in the examples , each sound is often spelled several different ways .
Consonants : ( as in ....)
n m kn it — m it , kn ife — ca lm ( no l sound )
t d t wo — d o , s t opp ed ( one p , ends in t ) — fi dd le
k g c oat — g oat , ba ck — gh ost
r l r ake — l ake , wr ong — te ll
p b p in — b een , ha pp y ( only one p sound ) — ra bb it
f v f airy — v ery , lau gh —o f ( v not f )
h w h ow — w ow , wh o ( starts with h ) — w ine
sh ch sh in — ch in , o ce an — wa tch
( " ch " is the sound of t+sh , but gets a symbol of its own )
zh j a z ure — j am , mea su re— bri dg e
( " j " is the sound of d+zh as in " edge " )
ng nk si ng — si nk , lo ng — la nk
( " nk " is the sound of ng+ k )
Th th th in — th en ( same vowel ) , th igh — brea the
( " Thin " and " then " are the only two common words distinguished solely by the two forms of th , so if you get them mixed up writing other words , no big deal .
By the way , the " th " in " then " or " the " occurs about ten times more often in writing than " Th " in " thin " or " think " )
s z s in — z en , sc ent — ha s
(s , z , and x may curve two ways , whichever seems best )
x y ex ample — y et , ex tra — on i on
( " x " is the sound of k+s in fox , eh+k+s in extra , or eh+ g+z in exact — if you need to be excruciatingly exact you could write extra as )
ll ny ll ama — ma n ana
( These sounds are from foreign words such as " llama " when pronounced like " y " instead of " l . "
In Spain " ll " is like the " lli " in " million . "
The " ny " sound is the " ñ " in " mañana " or " canyon " )
Vowels : ( as in ...)
ae bat , plaid , half , laugh , can ,
glad
eh bet , many , said , says , bread ,
leopard
ih bit , mini , Sid , busy , women ,
hymn
a bot or bought , father , Don , far , caught ,
heart
uh but , done , alone , circus , pencil
ey bait , age , aid , say , they , vein
i beet , team , people , key , equal
ay bite , height , aisle , eye , lie , high
( may be written with a forward or backward slant , but generally down )
o boat , sew , open , toe , beau , yeoman
yu butte , new , few , feud , beauty , view
u boot , shoe , rule , blue , fruit , adieu
c book , put , full , wolf , good , should
au bout , house , bough , now , towel
oy boil , boy , toil , voice , oil
aw bawl , dawn , law , yawl — y' all ,
drawl
( This is a minor vowel very close to the " short o " in Don .
In practice this vowel sound can be represented by the symbol without confusion .
So " all " or " awl " could be written or and so forth , but if you need to distinguish between " dawn " and " Don " or " la " and " law , " " tock " and " talk , " then you can — these being the among the few examples I have encountered that differ solely on the basis of these vowel sounds .
Some words , like " bought " ( bawt ) and " bot " ( baht ) may be pronounced the same by some people , and so may be written the same .
Note that when writing this symbol there is always at least one sharp angle between it and a consonant to distinguish it from the vowels and which may also be tear shaped when they sometimes blend in with two consonants — in which case there is no angle . )
r bur , bird , first , word , honor , zephyr
( A little known or acknowledged fact : " r " is a vowel , not a consonant .
Generations of English teachers have mislead you .
While I did list " r " with the consonants , I 'm now giving you the straight dope .
A vowel sound is one you can make in a continuous manner using your vocal cords with mouth open until you run out of breath .
Try it .
Consonants are the various ways vowels can be modified at the beginning or end of them .
Say " ahahahahahahahah , " now say " rrrrrrrrrrrrr . "
Obviously " R " is a vowel .
Some admit only that it's a semivowel , but I prefer to say the emperor has no clothes and claim it 's a vowel .
Next time you 're around an English teacher or other language expert , argue this point ad nausium until they concede . )
Consonant Blends
Some consonant sounds often blend with others .
For example " bl " or " fr . "
When possible , the symbols for consonants that blend also blend .
Here are some examples .
pr , pl , br , bl , fr , fl , gr , gl
kr , kl , wr , hw , kw , rk , sp , sl
Note that most words starting with " wh " are actually pronounced " hw " with a few exceptions like " who " which is just " h " plus " oo " without a " w " sound .
Also , " nt " can be written or blended into .
The vowels in the syllables " ten , " " ton , " and " tin " are often indistinctly pronounced , especially at the ends of words ( as in " cotton " ) , and may be heard as just " t+n " which can be blended into as in " cott 'n pick 'n good . "
Another handy blend is to use for " d " or " ed " at the end of a word by making the hook with a counter - clockwise motion as in " and " or " bird " .
This differs from the vowel usage of this symbol which is always written clockwise as in " know " .
Alternative Vowel Symbols
If you find that distinguishing between clockwise and counter clockwise circles is too confusing , you could eliminate the distinction at the cost of using two - stroke symbols to stand for single sounds .
A large circle in any direction would be " uh " in " but , " and a small circle in any direction would be used for the " ih " in " bit . "
This leaves the need to come up with symbols for the " ah " in " father " and " eh " in " bet " sounds .
The International Phonetic Alphabet ( IPA ) uses the following symbols for these sounds and similar symbols could be used in Handywrite .
Try out the alternatives and see what feels best for you .
Typing the Handywrite Alphabet
It is useful to assign the sounds in the Handywrite phonetic alphabet to keyboard characters that are quick to type .
Since you already know most of the characters , learning a few more will allow you to type words phonetically .
Play around with the following and you may find it is n't that hard to print / type phonetically .
Here are typeable characters for each sound based on international usage :
The above usage will make sense if you are familiar with the International Phonetic Alphabet ( IPA ) .
Since the IPA is the only really good pronunciation guide , I would suggest studying it , and using the above simplified typeable version to break down words into basic speech sounds .
Because our interest is to write using only the minimum number of distinctive vowel and consonant sounds needed to tell one word from another , it would be correct to say that Handywrite uses a phonemic rather than phonetic alphabet .
One symbol may stand for two speech sounds provided they differ only slightly ( as allophones ) and are not used to differenctiate between words .
True homophones , of course , cannot be written differently using a phonemic or phonetic alphabet , so " their " and " there " are written the same .
Since " c " is not used for a consonant sound , it is used to represent the vowel in " bull " or " book . "
Sometimes a vowel is indistinct or non-existent .
The word " nation " could be pronounced " neyshuhn , " " neyshihn , " " neyshehn , " or with no vowel in " neyshn . "
In such cases , go with the simplest and write " shn " for " - tion " or " - sion . "
Phonetics is phun .
As infants we have the ability to hear all possible speech sounds used in any language .
With maturity most of us lose the ability to hear speech sounds not in our native language .
In some languages , for example , there is no distinction made between " p " and " b " so if you say " pet " then " bet " native speakers will hear both as the same word .
With other sounds , English speakers have the same impairment .
The vowel " e , " as in Spanish " el bebe , " is not normally found in English other than in the diphthong " ey " as in " bait " or Spanish " ley , " which is the " e " sound with the slight addition of the " i " in " beet . "
The " e " vowel is a tensed form of " eh " in " bet , " but sounds more like " ey " to English speakers .
So English speakers tend to hear " el " to rhyme with " bell ( behl ) " and " bebe " to rhyme with the first vowel in " baby ( beybi ) , while Spanish speakers hear " ey , " they tend not to hear any difference between " eh " and " e . "
In Handywrite both " eh ( bet ) " and " e ( bebe ) " are represented by the same counter - clockwise small loop , even though these sound like two distinct vowel sounds to English speakers .
For practical purposes , " eh " or " e " is also the first vowel in " hair , " " care , " or " air " when followed by " r . "
In Handywrite , then , " hair " would be .
Here 's an example from Spanish :
El mes de julio es un mes de fiestas por todo el mundo hispano .
el mes de hulio es un mes de fiestas por todo el mundo ispano .
Not too many differences , since Spanish is quite phonetic to begin with .
An English speaker learning Spanish might phonetically write the above as :
ehl meys dey hulio ehs un meys dey fiehstuhs por todo ehl mundo hispano .
Ah , so that 's why I speak Spanish with such a thick accent !
Using the international based characters with English would look like this :
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogs , and that made me laugh .
thuh kwihk braun fax juhmps ovr thi leyzi dagz , ænd thæt meyd mi læf .
Not nearly as close to normal spelling as with Spanish , but English orthography is only marginally phonetic — about 40 % .
Note that the vowel in " cat " can be typed as " ae " or as a single character " æ " if you have an international keyboard .
The above international typeable version should be used along with a dictionary that uses the IPA system to help you make sense of phonetics .
While the IPA may seem confusing , the other pronunciation guides used by many dictionaries are confusing .

Accurate clocks are important for many net functions
Detective work has found that many D - Link routers , switches and wireless access points are bombarding some net time servers with huge amounts of data .
Time servers help many net functions run smoothly .
For instance they have a role in deciding who made the last bid in eBay auctions .
D- Link is now taking action after protests from time server overseers .
Time trouble
The problems caused by D - Link hardware came to light thanks to Danish contractor Poul - Henning Kamp who runs Denmark 's time server .
Typically the time servers have links with atomic clocks to ensure they are as accurate as possible .
Mr Kamp said his time server started getting hit with a lot more traffic than usual in August 2005 .
Initially he thought it was a web attack as some viruses use web clocks to co-ordinate their activities .
However , digital detective work by Dr Richard Clayton from the security research lab at the University of Cambridge revealed that all the unexpected data was coming from D - Link hardware .
It could be millions of D - Link devices .
I have no way of figuring it out
Poul - Henning Kamp
Further detective work has revealed the 25 or so D - Link products checking the time using this list .
The data flood is causing Mr Kamp problems because his time server is run on a non-profit basis and is allocated a small amount of bandwidth for the 2,000 or so Danish organisations that use it to tell the time .
The data flood has seen his bandwidth bill rocket and Mr Kamp is contemplating shutting the server down as he cannot afford the continuing costs .
Now , up to 90 % of his daily traffic comes from D - Link devices .
Accurate time - keeping is vital for many of the net 's functions such as time stamping when people buy and sell goods via the net .
Mr Kamp said one reason the Danish time server was set up was to help police get accurate timelines for some computer crime cases .
Mr Kamp said the responsible way to interrogate the time servers would be for D - Link to set up its own computer that can tell all its products the right time rather than have each device act alone .
Campaign call
Frustrated by his dealings with D - Link over the last five months , Mr Kamp published an open letter about the problems on his website .
This has revealed that D - Link hardware is also causing problems for 50 other net time servers .
The list includes some run by the US military , Nasa , US research organisations and government groups around the world .
Accurate time helps sort out who won an eBay auction
" It could be millions of D - Link devices , " he said , " I have no way of figuring it out . "
A spokesman for D - Link told the BBC News website that the company was aware of " developments " but had no comment while it takes legal advice .
He said the company expected to issue a statement in the next few days .
However , Mr Kamp said that publishing the open letter appears to have re-started efforts to solve the problem .
Already D- Link has removed from its website , updates to the software that keeps its hardware running that contains the time server list .
" At least the problem 's not getting any worse , " said Mr Kamp , adding that pressure from other time server administrators could force D - Link to act .
It was unrealistic to expect D - Link to update the onboard software of all the hardware that is using the list of time servers , he said .
Instead , he would like D - Link to pay his bandwidth bills to ensure the Danish time server can keep going .
Now that the US president has announced that he has not ruled out an attack on Iran , if it does not abandon its nuclear programme , the Middle East faces a crisis that could dwarf even the dangers arising from the war in Iraq .
Even a conventional weapon fired at a nuclear research centre - whether or not a bomb was being made there - would almost certainly release radioactivity into the atmosphere , with consequences seen worldwide as a mini-Hiroshima .
We would be told that it had been done to uphold the principles of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ( NPT ) - an argument that does not stand up to a moment 's examination .
The moral and legal basis of the NPT convention , which the International Atomic Energy Agency is there to uphold , was based on the agreement of non-nuclear nations not to acquire nuclear weapons if nuclear powers undertook not to extend nuclear arsenals and negotiate to secure their abolition .
Since then , the Americans have launched a programme that would allow them to use nuclear weapons in space , nuclear bunker - busting bombs are being developed , and depleted uranium has been used in Iraq - all of which are clear breaches of the NPT .
Israel , which has a massive nuclear weapons programme , is accepted as a close ally of the US , which still arms and funds it .
Even those who are opposed , as I am , to nuclear weapons in every country including Iran , North Korea , Britain and the US , accept that nuclear power for electricity generation need not necessarily lead to the acquisition of the bomb .
Indeed , many years ago , when the shah - who had been put on the throne by the US - was in power in Iran , enormous pressure was put on me , as secretary of state for energy , to agree to sell nuclear power stations to him .
That pressure came from the Atomic Energy Authority , in conjunction with Westinghouse , who were anxious to promote their own design of reactor .
It is easy to understand why president Bush might see the bombing of Iran as a way to regain some of the political credibility he has lost as a result of the growing hostility in America to the Iraq war due to the heavy casualties suffered by US forces there .
It is inconceivable that the White House can be contemplating an invasion of Iran , and what must be intended is a US airstrike , or airstrikes , on Iranian nuclear installations , comparable to Israel 's bombing of Iraq in 1981 .
Israel has publicly hinted that it might do the same again to prevent Iran developing nuclear nuclear weapons .
Such an attack , whether by the US or Israel , would be in breach of the UN Charter , as was the invasion of Iraq .
But neither Bush , Sharon nor Blair would take any notice of that .
Some influential Americans appear to be convinced that the US will attack Iran .
Whether they are right or not , the build - up to a new war is taking exactly the same form as it did in 2002 .
First we are being told that Iran poses a military threat , because it may be developing nuclear weapons .
We are assured that the President is hoping that diplomacy might succeed through the European negotiations which have been in progress for some months .
This is just what we were told when Hans Blix was in Baghdad talking to Saddam on behalf of the UN , but we now know , from a Downing Street memorandum leaked some months ago , that the decision to invade had been taken long before that .
That may be the position now , and I fear that if a US attack does take place , the prime minister will give it his full support .
And one of his reasons for doing so will be the same as in Iraq : namely the fear that , if he alienates Bush , Britain 's so - called independent deterrent might be taken away .
For , as I also learned when I was energy secretary , Britain is entirely dependent on the US for the supply of our Trident warheads and associated technology .
They cannot even be targeted unless the US switches on its global satellite system .
Therefore Britain could be assisting America to commit an act of aggression under the UN Charter , which could risk a major nuclear disaster , and doing so supposedly to prevent nuclear proliferation , with the real motive of making it possible for us to continue to break the NPT in alliance with America .
The irony is that we might be told that Britain must support Bush , yet again , because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction , thus allowing him to kill even more innocent civilians .

Story Highlights • Book " Fame Junkies " met with a media frenzy
• Author says he missed the attention after book tour
• People spend thousands at talent conventions
• " Fame is an equal - opportunity tantalizer , " author says
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) -- Jake Halpern has had a taste of fame .
He found it fascinating -- and a little scary .
Halpern , the author of " Fame Junkies " ( Houghton Mifflin ) , discovered the mere topic of his book invited strong interest .
Entertainment Weekly ran an excerpt ; " 20/20 " did an extensive segment on it .
And Halpern came along for the ride .
The process was mind - boggling , he says in an interview from his home in New Mexico .
" I 'd written a previous book , ' Leaving Home , ' and it was well reviewed and earned polite applause , but that was it , " he says .
" But this book -- it was a frenzy , it was crazy .
One week I did 50 interviews .
When I went on the tour for my first book , I sometimes stayed on friends ' couches .
This time I was put up at the Waldorf . "
The book was published January 10 , and by earlier this month , the frenzied book tour ended and Halpern found , much to his surprise , that he was in no hurry to get off the fame train .
" We live in rural New Mexico , and my wife 's a doctor who does work with the Navajo .
I came home from the whirlwind to a house where tumbleweed literally blows across the street , and I felt a sense of -- almost -- withdrawal , " he says .
" It passed , but the irony was not lost on me . "
Which was one reason he was intrigued by the subject in the first place .
The pursuit of fame has become an all - encompassing drive for many people , and Halpern wanted to see why .
( And what about Anna Nicole Smith ? )
His book mainly concerns people on the fringes -- children attending a " talent convention , " hoping for a big break ; youngsters and their parents in a Hollywood apartment complex , trying to gain a foothold in show business ; celebrity assistants , living in the reflected glow of their clients ; hardcore fans , hoping for a brush with greatness ; and the residents of a Los Angeles - area senior community , remembering their younger days -- and not quite ready to leave the business .
But in another sense , that covers just about everybody .
Though Halpern says he did n't meet many fame - pursuers from Manhattan or Los Angeles -- " maybe they 're less susceptible , or maybe they think there 's got to be another way " -- the people he did meet crossed all demographic lines .
" It 's something that does n't discriminate , " he says .
" Fame is an equal - opportunity tantalizer . "
' We all desire attention '
Robert Thompson , a Syracuse University pop culture professor ( and one of Halpern 's sources ) , was n't surprised by Halpern 's conclusions .
" We tend to talk about people obsessing over fame as somehow defective , when the very people who make the analysis have their own byline , " he says .
" I think this desire [ for fame ] is very human .
We all desire attention . "
In " Fame Junkies " Halpern cites studies that suggest fame is a factor in other animal groups as well .
In one study rhesus monkeys were willing to give up their food simply to stare at a dominant monkey .
Perhaps , Halpern concludes , there is something hard - wired within us to follow celebrity .
" It makes you feel better about the whole thing -- ' I 'm not really to blame for my fascination with Tom Cruise , ' " he says .
" To a certain extent , that 's true . "
Illusion and disillusion
Perhaps the most troubling section of Halpern 's book is a portion in which he attends a talent convention in Los Angeles .
It 's far from free -- it costs thousands for the attendance fee and travel arrangements -- and students have likely invested thousands more training at modeling outposts across the country .
The pursuit of the fame dream is a lottery ticket that goes for $ 5,000 , $ 10,000 or more , with no guarantees .
" If I told you [ someone in ] your family gambled away $ 10,000 , you 'd say they have a serious problem .
But to become famous , that 's kind of an equally unhealthy thing that 's going on , and it 's compounded by the fact that you know [ most of ] these kids are going nowhere , " Halpern said .
Genetics may show us that a certain fascination with fame is natural and healthy , but why do we as a culture seem to be spending so much time on it ?
A greater focus on the fame of celebrities in our culture , rather than their talents or accomplishments , may be one answer .
It is no longer necessary to have something of value to offer in order to be famous .
Reality shows like " Survivor " confer celebrity status on people simply for becoming known .
On these shows , fame becomes the central point , instead of a side effect of accomplishment .
" It does n't matter what you 're on for -- talent , humiliation -- a certain status is conferred on you , " says Halpern .
Put these wildly popular shows in the context of an individualistic youth culture with an increasing sense of personal entitlement , and fame almost becomes a birthright .
In fact , results of high school and college student personality studies indicate both narcissism and a sense of entitlement have risen in recent years -- a psychology with " serious implications , " says Halpern .
" Because fame seems accessible , delusions of fame do n't seem delusional , " he says .
" And when you grow up and join the workplace , you do n't want to do drudge work , and you feel disillusioned when that does n't happen . "
Thompson is n't quite so concerned about that -- " you 'll have people unhappy when the real world [ intrudes ] , but what else is new " -- but he is bothered by " the disconnect from reality " the fame game has created .
" We were so successful in ... solving the self - esteem problem that , in many ways , we created a monster , " he says .
For those who believe the culture of celebrity has gotten out of hand , there do not appear to be easy answers for bringing people back to earth .
In Halpern 's case , he found " Fame Junkies " ended up feeding the beast it sought to describe .
" There 's such a huge interest in the subject matter , but the message I 'd put together was lost , " Halpern says .
" I was making points on a talk show and I realized they were showing one long video of Paris Hilton .
" As much as I want to criticize and critique fame , maybe I 've just added to the roar of the machine . "
Hoorah !
Fog Creek Copilot 2.0 is now online , with three , no wait , five , no , three new features .
Well , I guess it depends how you count .
In a moment I ’ll count ‘em .
In the meantime , a little background .
Fog Creek Copilot is a remote tech support service that lets one person control another computer remotely , much like VNC or RDC , with the advantage that it requires zero configuration , works through firewalls , and installs nothing .
Two summers ago , we had four interns here who built it , all by themselves , over the course of their 12 week internship .
The only thing we gave them was a spec , some desks , and computers .
They put together the web site , the documentation , all the code for five major components , came up with the marketing plan , did usability testing , and demoed to the public at a trade show .
They kept a blog , which you can still read , and someone even made a documentary movie made about their summer .
( Sidebar :
One of the reasons they were able to accomplish so much in one summer is that they used open source software as a starting point .
Of course , everything they did , with the exception of our proprietary back end server code , is available under the GPL license . )
OK .
New features !
1. Support for Mac! OMG !
All versions of Mac OS X from 10.2 on are now supported .
I ’m fairly confident that our Mac remote desktop implementation is second to none .
Oh , wait .
Interruption .
You may be wondering , if the interns did the whole thing over a summer , who wrote all this new code ?
The answer is that two of the interns accepted full - time jobs at Fog Creek , Tyler and Ben .
Tyler extended his summer until December , and then headed off for a leave of absence to finish his Masters degree at Stanford .
Ben graduated from Duke last summer and has been cranking away on 2.0 since then .
Ben , by the way , is the only person I know who writes code in C , C++ , C# , and Objective C all in the same day , while writing a book about Smalltalk at night .
We also had a Mac programming guru , Daniel Jalkut , get us started with the Mac port .
OK , next new big feature :
2. Direct Connect !
We ’ve always done everything we can to make sure that Fog Creek Copilot can connect in any networking situation , no matter what firewalls or NATs are in place .
To make this happen , both parties make outbound connections to our server , which relays traffic on their behalf .
Well , in many cases , this is n’t necessary .
So version 2.0 does something rather clever : it sets up the initial connection through our servers , so you get connected right away with 100 % reliability .
But then once you ’re all connected , it quietly , in the background , looks for a way to make a direct connection .
If it can ’t , no big deal : you just keep relaying through our server .
If you can make a direct peer - to - peer connection , it silently shifts your data onto the direct connection .
You wo n’t notice anything except , probably , much faster communication .
3 . File transfer !
An easy - to - use file upload and download feature makes this the PERFECT application for installing Firefox on all your relatives ’ computers .
It ’s especially handy for tech support scenarios .
Imagine this : your new software works great everywhere but this one guy has a wacky system that makes your software keep crashing .
So you use Fog Creek Copilot to take over his system , and then you use the file transfer feature to copy new builds to his computer as you try to fix the problem .
4 . Does this count as a feature ?
We lowered the price for day passes – 24 hours of usage — from $ 10 to no , not $ 9 , not $ 8 , not $ 7 , would you believe it ’s only FIVE DOLLARS ?
That ’s right , unlimited usage for 24 hours for five lonely bucks .
I guess I should explain the reasoning behind that .
First of all , the direct connect feature ( # 2 ) should reduce our bandwidth bills in many situations , so we can pass that savings on .
Second , we do n’t want anyone to have an excuse not to use Fog Creek Copilot .
To avoid paying $ 10 , you might actually be crazy enough to try to just talk your mom into uninstalling Norton Utilities , punching the appropriate holes in the Windows firewall , and setting up appropriate port - forwarding rules on her broadband router … but for $ 5 , why go through the trouble ?
Or you might be willing to set up your own server outside the firewall , with VNC running as a listener , and walk your customers through setting up VNC and connecting back to you , but again , why bother for five bucks ?
We think that ’s a negligible price to pay to know that all you need to tell your mom , or your customer , is “ Go to copilot.com , type in this number , and download and run the program you find there . ”
And to know that it will Just Work .
We ’re betting that the lower price will lead to more users , which will lead to more corporate subscriptions , which will lead to higher total revenues .
So. Congratulations to Tyler and Ben for a fantastic upgrade !
Cheney told to ' go fuck yourself ' in Gulfport , Mississippi
RAW STORY
Vice President Dick Cheney , in Gulfport , Mississippi on a tour of the Katrina hurricane zone , was told to " go fuck yourself " twice on live television , RAW STORY has learned .
During a discussion on hurricane relief efforts , an off camera protester shouts , " Go fuck yourself , Mr. Cheney .
Go fuck yourself . "
The camera remains on Cheney while we hear scuffling in the background .
Cheney continues speaking .

CNN 's reporter asks Cheney , " Are you getting a lot of that Mr. Vice President ? "
Cheney replies , " First time I 've heard it . , Must be a friend of John ... , er , ah - never mind . "
Laughter ensues from the VP and reporters .
Directly aftward , Cheney continues an ongoing monologue on what to do about hurricane debris : " But it 's a question about what you do with the debris in terms of your toxic waste problem you 've got to worry about in terms of where you 're going to put it ... "
The exchange was carried live on CNN and MSNBC .

I built a spreadsheet with functions that break down the cost of the war in Iraq into dollars per minute .
According to the Pentagon , the war in Iraq is costing $ 8.4 billion per month .
Cost of the War in Iraq Per Minute
Cost per month : 8400000000
Cost per week : 2100000000
Cost per day : 300000000
Cost per hour : 12500000
Cost per minute : 208333.33
That war is costing $ 208,333 per minute !
On the last page of the this Oregon State University story about wave power is the following sentence :
“ OSU ’s College of Engineering is seeking $ 3 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to build the national wave energy research center , where the engineers hope to test not only their own designs but those of other researchers and commercial developers . ”
I tweaked my widget to allow me to enter an “ opportunity cost ” element to see how many minutes of war spending would need to pass before the cost of the other thing could be paid for :
OSU ’s wave energy research center could be built with what is spent on the war in Iraq in about 14.4 minutes .
I was so shocked by this number that I started thinking bigger .
For example , what is the total annual budget of the U.S. Department of Energy ’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory ?
The annual budget now stands at $ 210 million .
In other words , the U.S. spends more on the war in Iraq in one day ( about $ 300 million ) than it does on the ANNUAL BUDGET for the primary government laboratory that is tasked with renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development .
What you have here is a proof , with mathematical certainty , that the U.S. government is engineering energy scarcity issues .
This is n’t even an interesting topic anymore , given these numbers .
The far more interesting question is :
Since they are obviously allowing these energy problems to escalate , what do they have in mind for all of us when the “ crisis ” finally hits ?
Like I said in a recent comment :
“ We have a problem with human nature .
There is , however , no shortage of readily available energy …
Water , top soil loss , copper and wheat issues are going to impact peoplesâ€™ reality before any of the energy scarcity issues do . ”
Hmm .
It ’s interesting how the energy scarcity meme drowns out the sound of the wolves barking at the door .
Tell me the shit is hitting the fan because of top soil depletion , or fascists with nuclear weapons , etc . but do n’t insult my intelligence by saying that there is n’t easily enough energy available from the oceans , the sun and the wind .
And the cost ?
Do you want me to send you a copy of my handy Iraq War Opportunity Cost In Minutes Calculator ?
I do n’t like religion .
It ’s certainty and exclusion of simple , observable data — that do n’t fit the dogma — are anathema to my nature .
The energy scarcity argument , on its own , is like the American dream : you ’d have to be asleep to believe it .
Again :
We have a problem with human nature .
There is , however , no shortage of readily available energy .
In the end , I guess it does n’t matter .
I ’d just prefer to know the real score , rather than some nonsense that does n’t even stand up to basic arithmetic .
In a forsaken little town in the Ecuadorean Amazon , an overgrown oil camp called Lago Agrio , the giant Chevron Corporation has been maneuvered into a makeshift courtroom and is being sued to answer for conditions in 1,700 square miles of rain forest said by environmentalists to be one of the world 's most contaminated industrial sites .
The pollution consists of huge quantities of crude oil and associated wastes , mixed in with the toxic compounds used for drilling operations — a noxious soup that for decades was dumped into leaky pits , or directly into the Amazonian watershed .
The company that did much of this work was Texaco — an outfit with a swashbuckling reputation worldwide .
It signed a contract with Ecuador in 1964 , began full - scale production in 1972 , and pulled out 20 years later .
In 2001 , Texaco was swallowed whole by Chevron , which by integrating its operations nearly doubled in size .
The lawsuit against it in Lago Agrio was filed in 2003 , though the legal antecedents go back much further .
Having dragged on for four years , the suit may continue for half again as long .
Chevron is represented by high - priced firms of experienced lawyers in Quito and Washington , D.C. , whose collective fees run to millions of dollars annually .
Its antagonists are 30,000 Amazonian settlers and indigenous people , who call themselves Los Afectados — the Affected Ones .
These plaintiffs are represented by a low - budget but serious team of North American and Ecuadorean attorneys , who are backed by a Philadelphia law firm that is known for class - action securities litigation and has gambled that this case , though risky , can actually be won .
Chevron objects vociferously , and presents itself as the victim here .
Its attorneys have repeatedly claimed that the company is being extorted for " two juicy checks , " one to be divided among the plaintiffs and the other to enrich their North American lawyers .
The North American lawyers are indeed working on a contingency basis , but unapologetically so , and for a percentage significantly lower than the norm in high - risk cases ; they would like to be well compensated for their efforts , but as much , they say , to encourage other lawyers to bring similar suits elsewhere in the world as to pad their personal bank accounts .
The most active among them is a New York–based Harvard Law School graduate named Steven Donziger , who has invested 14 years in the case and would certainly be more secure had he pursued a conventional career involving the preservation of wealth .
He counterclaims that Chevron 's lawyers are the real mercenaries here .
It is a philosophical quarrel that will never be resolved .
As for the plaintiffs themselves , under Ecuadorean law they are not suing individually , and personally may never see a dime .
They have sued to seek compensation for past damages and to force Chevron to clean up the residual mess that continues , they believe , to taint the soil and water today .
It is unclear how a cleanup would proceed and to what extent it could succeed , but over decades the cost might run to $ 6 billion or more — making this potentially the largest environmental lawsuit ever to be fought .
And fight is the word .
The case has become emotional for both sides , with few signs of willingness to compromise .
Worldwide the oil industry is watching .
Lago Agrio is a forsaken little town where something rather large is going down .
This is not , however , a U.S. - style legal drama .
The Lago Agrio court follows Ecuadorean procedures , which minimize oral arguments and rely heavily on submitted documents to get at the truth .
So far the proceedings have generated close to 200,000 pages .
There is no jury to sway .
There is a single presiding judge , drawn from a pool of three on a rotating basis for a two - year term of unusual pressure .
Currently the judge is a rotund middle - aged man , a reader of Dostoyevsky and a convert to Islam .
He must be the only Muslim in town .
He told me it is not easy to be a judge there .
Five years ago he was ambushed and machine - gunned while driving his car .
His companion was killed , but he himself escaped .
The attackers were hired killers , of whom Lago Agrio has an ample supply .
Colombia 's largest cocaine - production area lies just over the border a few miles to the north , and is peopled not only by narco - traffickers but also by leftist guerrillas and right - wing paramilitary groups .
The police in Lago Agrio make a show sometimes of directing traffic .
They did not investigate the attack , the judge believes , because they feared retribution .
The judge accepted this without complaint , as if he had learned to believe in fate .
Lago Agrio means " sour lake . "
He told me that the only safe choice there is to run away .
Chevron would probably agree .
It denies that the judge is fair , denies that the plaintiffs have legitimate complaints , denies that their soil and water samples are meaningful , denies that the methods the company used to extract oil in the past were substandard , denies that it contaminated the forest , denies that the forest is contaminated , denies that there is a link between the drinking water and high rates of cancer , leukemia , birth defects , and skin disease , denies that unusual health problems have been demonstrated — and , for added measure , denies that it bears responsibility for any environmental damage that might after all be found to exist .
If Chevron can convince the court of the validity of even a few of those points , it will win the case and leave town .
As American troops storm what is , or was , an Iranian consulate  at least that ’s what the Iraqi government calls it , in spite of American denials  and the president accuses Tehran of arming and aiding Iraqi insurgents , the answer to the question " Why are we in Iraq ? " should begin to dawn on even the dullest .
The answer : Iran .
We ’re in Iraq so we can go after the mullahs in Tehran , and , perhaps , those other Ba’athists in Syria .
All indications point to a strike at the Iranians before Bush leaves office .
The appointment of a Navy guy , Adm. William J. " Fox " Fallon , at present head of the U.S. Pacific Command , to oversee U.S. operations in the Middle East , is widely seen as a sign that war with Iran is on the table , if not yet a sure thing .
A U.S. attack on Iran would be a naval and air operation , and Fallon , a former deputy director for operations with Joint Task Force Southwest Asia in Riyadh , is surely qualified for the job .
As Pat Buchanan put it , " What Fallon does not know about securing streets , he does know about taking out targets from the air and keeping sea lanes open in a time of war . "
Seymour Hersh reported on the gathering storm over Iran last year , and now we may have more concrete evidence that something big is afoot .
Laura Rozen , writing in The American Prospect , says that a presidential " finding , " or perhaps a secret White House directive may have been issued :
" There is evidence that , while Bush probably has not signed such a finding regarding Iran , he has recently done so regarding Iranian - supported Hezbollah in Lebanon ; further , there is evidence that he may have signed an executive order or national security presidential directive regarding a new , more aggressive policy on Iran .
Such directives are not required to be reported to Congress  they are more in the realm of the president communicating to authorized people inside the administration his expectations for a policy . "
And the noise level coming from the pro-war peanut gallery is getting louder : Israel ’s lobby in the U.S. has long pushed for aggressive American action against the supposedly nuke - seeking mullahs , and an Israeli general , Oded Tira , recently came out explicitly with the thrust of the Israeli campaign :
" President Bush lacks the political power to attack Iran .
As an American strike in Iran is essential for our existence , we must help him pave the way by lobbying the Democratic Party ( which is conducting itself foolishly ) and U.S. newspaper editors .
We need to do this in order to turn the Iranian issue to a bipartisan one and unrelated to the Iraq failure .
" We must turn to Hillary Clinton and other potential presidential candidates in the Democratic Party so that they publicly support immediate action by Bush against Iran .
We should also approach European countries so that they support American actions in Iran , so that Bush will not be isolated in the international arena again . "
The Lobby wo n’t have to lean too hard on the Democratic Party , as Chairman Howard Dean made all too clear on Hardball the other night :
" Chris Matthews :
Will your party stand up against a war with Iran ?
It looks like the president is sort of edging towards military action against Iran ?
" Howard Dean :
You know the great shame , among many shames , of going into Iraq , was we picked the wrong enemy .
Iran is a danger .
We ’ve got our troops pinned down in the wrong place .
Saddam Hussein was a terrible person , but not a danger to the United States .
Iran is a danger .
Obviously , I do n’t think there ’s much stomach among the American people for a war with Iran given what ’s gone on for the last three and a half years in Iraq , but we are clearly going to have to stand up to Iran .
" CM : Does that mean attack them ?
Are we going to commit an act of war against Iran ?
" HD : I think there ’s absolutely no stomach for that whatsoever either in the Congress or among the American people after what ’s been going on the last three and a half years in Iraq . "
So the official Democratic Party spokesman ’s line on the crisis in the Middle East goes something like this :
Gee , it ’s too bad we ’re stuck in a quagmire in Iraq , when the real imperative is to attack Iran .
We ’re in the wrong war  and , thanks to George W. Bush , the American people have " no stomach " for attacking what amounts to a genuine threat .
You ’ll notice , if you follow the link and read the whole quote , how Dean wimped out in the end , only agreeing with the Bushies ’ rush to war as far as imposing sanctions .
However , you can bet Dean and his fellow Democrats , especially presidential wannabes and the congressional leadership , are not about to stand up to the War Party when the bombs begin to fall on Tehran .
For months , Antiwar.com has been reporting growing indications of a U.S. strike on Iran , and certainly such a move , contra Dean , is politically doable .
After all , Dean and his fellow Democrats wo n’t say boo about it , except , perhaps , to chide them for not doing it soon enough  and certainly Gen .
Tira wo n’t have to push Hillary all that much , since her present position is more hawkish than the Bush administration ’s .
( Speaker Nancy Pelosi is no piker when it comes to Iran , either ) .
In the end , events on the ground in Iraq and environs wo n’t determine if and when we go to war with Tehran : domestic politics is the determining factor , and , as Chairman Dean has shown , the conditions could n’t be better as far as the War Party is concerned .
In this context , at least , the " surge " begins to make some sense  especially if , as can be expected , it is a " long surge " carried out by an administration that likes to push the envelope ( and meets little resistance in doing so ) .
An attack on Iran will be centered around the Persian Gulf , but is bound to have reverberations on the ground in Iraq .
A " surge "  20,000 U.S. troops , and possibly more  would buttress American redoubts for the inevitable backlash and reinforce our defenses against a flanking counterattack .
The " antiwar " Democrats are way behind the times : they are still screaming about Iraq , when Iran is the real issue  and it ’s one they are just as bad on , if not worse , than the Republicans .
Which means that the long - suffering American people are not about to find relief from this endless war anytime soon  unless , of course , it is in the form of some as yet undiscovered political maverick who will rise out of the miasma of American politics and save us from both wings of the War Party .

Wo Verhalten sanktioniert werden kann , funktioniert auch die Kooperation
Unter welchen Umständen kooperieren Menschen und welche Rolle spielt Bestrafung dabei ?
Wissenschaftler der Universität Erfurt sind diesen Fragen im Rahmen einer experimentellen Versuchsanordnung nachgegangen .
In der aktuellen Ausgabe von Science ( Vol 312 vom 7 . April 2006 ) berichten sie .
Insgesamt 84 Teilnehmer baten Özgur Gürerk und Bettina Rockenbach vom Lehrstuhl für Mikroökonomie der Universität Erfurt zusammen mit Bernd Irlenbusch von der London School of Economics in die Kabinen ihres Versuchslabors .
Ein buntes Häufchen Studenten , die in Gruppen ( Populationen ) von 12 Personen je 30 Runden lang ein so genanntes „ Öffentliches - Gut - Spiel “ ( public good ) spielen sollten .
Trittbrettfahrer unerwünscht : Diejenigen , die von den Beiträgen der anderen profitieren , können den Zusammenbruch der Kooperation provozieren .
Gruppen , die ihre Trittbrettfahrer bestrafen , stabilisieren die Kooperation und sind damit im Vorteil gegenüber Gruppen , die nicht sanktionieren .
( Bild : Science )
Jede Runde bestand aus drei Stufen : Zuerst musste jeder der Teilnehmer sich entscheiden , ob er in einer
Welt mit oder ohne Bestrafungsinstitution spielen wollte .
Anschließend ging es darum , ausgestattet mit 20 Geldeinheiten zu einem Gemeinschaftsprojekt – entweder in der einen oder der anderen Welten – beizutragen :
Es blieb den Testpersonen freigestellt , ihr Geld in das Gruppenprojekt einzuzahlen oder es auf einem Privatkonto zu hinterlegen .
Alle Beiträge zum Gruppenprojekt wurden am Ende der Runde um etwa zwei Drittel erhöht und gleichmäßig an alle Spieler verteilt , unabhängig davon , wie viel der Einzelne beigetragen hatte .
Der Grundkonflikt des Öffentliches - Gut - Spieles : Individuelles und Gruppeninteresse waren völlig konträr .
Aus Gesamtsicht war es am besten , möglichst viel beizutragen ; aus individueller Sicht am vorteilhaftesten , möglichst wenig beizusteuern und als Trittbrettfahrer von den Beiträgen der anderen zu profitieren .
Die dritte Stufe des Experiments war nur für die Spieler der Sanktionswelt relevant : Sie konnten zum Abschluss ihre Mitspieler sanktionieren , in Form von Bestrafung oder Belohnung .
Bei der Bestrafung mussten sie Geld aufwenden , schädigten dafür den , der gestraft wurde .
Die Belohnung kostete , den Belohner zugunsten des Belohnten .
Vor jeder Runde konnten die Probanden erneut entscheiden , wo sie spielen wollten und sie erfuhren die Ergebnisse der anderen Spielergruppen .
Labor 1 ( Bild : Özgur Gürerk )
Das Ergebnis , das Gürerk , Irlenbusch und Rockenbach einfuhren , war eindeutig .
Die Versuchsteilnehmer zögerten anfangs , sich für die Sanktionswelt zu entscheiden .
„ Vielleicht mochten sie die Bestrafungssituation nicht oder hatten selbst Angst vor Strafe .
Über ihre Motivation können wir nur spekulieren “ , so Irlenbusch im Gespräch mit Telepolis .
„ Fest steht : nur ein Drittel entschloss sich für die Sanktionswelt .
Doch sehr bald sank die Kooperation in der sanktionsfreien Welt .
Es gab zu viele Trittbrettfahrer , deren Verhalten nicht geahndet werden konnte .
In der Sanktionswelt hingegen wurde von Anfang an heftig gestraft .
Mit dem Ergebnis , dass die Leute dort sehr viel zu ihrem Gemeinschaftsprojekt beitrugen und ständig besser kooperierten . “
Kooperation verschafft Wettbewerbsvorteil
Die ersten , die das Lager wechselten , waren die , die sich in der sanktionsfreien Welt von Anbeginn an kooperativ verhalten hatten .
So gab es dort zum Schluss nur noch Trittbrettfahrer und fast keinen Gewinn mehr .
Das gefiel den Trittbrettfahrern nicht , weil sie ja mitverfolgen konnten , wie gewinnbringend es in der Sanktionswelt verlief .
Also gingen auch sie in die Sanktionswelt .
Jetzt wurde das Spiel so richtig interessant , denn die einstigen Trittbrettfahrer wurden in der Sanktionswelt sofort zu Kooperateuren .
Dabei übernahmen sie nicht nur die Kooperationsnorm , sondern auch die Bestrafungsnorm : Die Schmarotzer aus der sanktionsfreien
Welt gingen sofort dazu über , die Leute zu bestrafen , die wenig zum Gemeinwohl beitrugen .
Sie sanktionierten jetzt also ihr eigenes Verhalten .
Wie interpretieren die Wissenschaftler diesen Gesinnungswandel ?
„ Da Strafe kostspielig ist , kann man diesen dramatischen Verhaltenswandel nicht damit erklären , dass sich Menschen einfach nur an möglichst hohen Gewinnen orientieren .
Hier wurde auf Gewinne verzichtet , um sich der kooperativen Norm anzupassen “ , schreibt Rockenbach dazu .
Im Kontrollraum ( Bild : Özgur Gürerk )
Das prompte Umsteigen vom Trittbrettfahrer zum Kooperationswilligen und Bestrafenden hat die Wissenschaftler zwar überrascht , ihrer Ansicht nach steht es aber im Einklang mit den Theorien kultureller und institutioneller Selektion .
Diese besagen , dass Menschen vorzugsweise zu besser gestellten Gruppen tendieren und die in diesen Gruppen vorherrschenden Verhaltensweisen imitieren .
Die Studie der drei Wissenschaftler stützt die Theorie , dass kulturelle Selektion – also die Vorstellung , dass sich Kultur auf eine Weise entwickeln kann , die dem Darwinschen Prinzip der natürlichen Selektion ähnlich ist – bei der Herbeiführung und Aufrechterhaltung von Kooperation eine Rolle spielt .
Indem sie Institutionen mit und ohne Strafmöglichkeit in einem experimentellen Umfeld in ein direktes Konkurrenzverhältnis stellen , erbringen die Forscher empirische Belege dafür , dass Institutionen mit Sanktionierungsmechanismen Kooperationsnormen begründen und Institutionen ausstechen können , die Nutznießer nicht bestrafen können .
Offensiver strafen
„ Eine unmittelbare Übertragung unserer Ergebnisse auf reale Phänomene ist schwierig “ , erläutert Irlenbusch .
„ Doch es ist signifikant , dass die Leute die Sanktionswelt anfangs so deutlich mieden , dann aber fast vollständig hinüberwechselten .
Man könnte die Sanktionen unseres Experiments vielleicht am ehesten als soziale Sanktionen interpretieren .
Als Strafe von Individuum zu Individuum , so in der
Art eines strafenden Blickes oder eines sozialen Ausschlusses , in der Form , dass man nicht mehr zu einer Party eingeladen wird .
Was wir so daraus lesen ist , dass man von diesen sozialen Sanktionen wieder mehr Gebrauch machen sollte in zwischenmenschlichen Interaktionen , um das Gemeinwohl stärker zu fördern .
Die Leute sollten sich in ihrem Umfeld , vielleicht bei einem
Thema wie dem Umweltschutz ruhig mal dazu äußern , wenn sie sehen , dass jemand die Gemeinschaft schädigt .
Man sollte da offensiver damit umgehen und nicht nur sagen , dass muss der schon selbst wissen . “
Dass die Probanden das Spiel ernst nahmen und nicht etwa gedankenlos herumzockten , dafür sorgte ein Reiz finanzieller Art. Am Schluss wurden sie proportional zu dem Gewinn bezahlt , den sie während des Experiments erwirtschaftet hatten .
Im Schnitt kamen sie dabei immerhin auf 24 Euro . ( Katja Seefeldt )

The Oregon researchers watched crab populations crash
Enlarge Image
That is the conclusion of researchers investigating " dead zones " off the coast of the US , where populations of marine life were suddenly wiped out .
These vast graveyards occur where there are disturbances to currents driven by coastal winds , they say .
Dead zones have been recorded off the coast of California and Oregon every year for the last five years .
The most intense event , which left the ocean floor littered with the carcasses of crabs , happened in 2006 .
" It was unlike anything that we 've measured along the Oregon coast in the past five decades , " said Dr Francis Chan of Oregon State University ( OSU ) .
Dead zones have also been seen in the waters off Chile , Namibia and South Africa .
Plant bloom
The common factor between all of these areas is that marine currents off the coast rise from the deep ocean .
These upwelling zones bring nutrient - rich water up from the deep ocean , triggering plankton blooms that underpin the coastal food chain .
Nearly 50 % of the world 's fisheries are in these areas .
Changes could be long lasting
Dead zones
Using observations from the west coast of the US , researchers believe that this upwelling is being disrupted ; there have been changes in its timing and intensity .
For example , in 2005 the upwelling was delayed , which meant that the plankton blooms did not occur , leading to a collapse in fish populations .
This particularly hit migrating salmon , which annually pass along the coast in April and May .
" In 2005 , they found nothing to eat , " said Dr Bill Peterson of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) .
" By the time upwelling started , they were dead . "
Huge graveyard
An even more catastophic event occurred in 2006 when the amount of upwelling doubled , leading to a huge influx of nutrients and a supercharged plankton bloom .
When these sank to the ocean floor , they stripped the water column of oxygen , creating a 3,000 sq km ( 1,150 sq mile ) dead zone , where creatures unable to swim away suffocated en masse .
Dr Francis Chan used underwater cameras to survey the area two months after the event .
" We were shocked to see a graveyard , " he said .
" Frame after frame of carcass , carcass , carcass . "
Crabs , worms and sea stars all perished in the anoxic water .
On the surface , sea birds were also affected by the lack of food .
Scientists found the carcasses of migratory seabirds such as auklets washing up on the beaches .
Uncertain future
The researchers believe the cause of these events was changes in the intensity of the coastal winds , perhaps brought about by global warming .
" What we know from the climate change models is that the land will warm more than the sea , " Jack Barth or Oregon State University told the BBC News website .
Scientists used underwater cameras
" As you intensify that gradient - that will drive the stronger winds . "
To confirm this link to climate change , the researchers say they need another 10 to 15 years of data .
Other work also needs to be done to see if there is a common link between the US dead zones and those seen elsewhere .
In the meantime , they add , we must change our approach to managing and using these ecosystems , particularly for fish stocks .
" The most prudent course of action is to begin to think differently about what is happening , " said Dr Jane Lubchenco , also of OSU .
" Climate models predict increasing uncertainty with wild fluctuations .
We should expect more surprises . "
The research was presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) annual meeting in San Francisco , US .
Towers of Deception – a review by reprehensor
The Author
Barrie Zwicker is a household name among the growing chorus of people who have trouble accepting the “ official story ” of 9/11 – the story that is more or less embodied by the 9/11 Commission Report .
Zwicker has been both a producer and critic of mainstream media for 30 + years .
Zwicker ’s skepticism of the official story began on 9/11/2001 , which puts him in a fairly small category of doubters .
I think it ’s fair to say that most people who take issue with the official narrative did n’t start seriously questioning things until later , some within days , for some it took years .
For Zwicker , the alarm bells started going off after the second plane hit the Twin Towers .
Zwicker has some related experience with air defense , he was an Air Cadet in Canada in his youth , and as a journalist he followed the evolution of NORAD very closely .
To Zwicker , there is no incompetence theory that NORAD can concoct , which will explain away years of drills , SOP ( Standard Operating Procedures ) , and literally hundreds of commercial aircraft intercepts that were successfully undertaken by North America ’s air defense system prior to 9/11 .
In the days that followed 9/11 , Zwicker waited for the flood of media coverage that would latch on to the bare - naked anomaly of NORAD ’s failure to protect the skies on 9/11 … but the stories never came .
Not after days , weeks or months .
No exposé , no investigation , no nothing , just a bland repetition of the Bush administration ’s Party Line ; 19 Arab hijackers got lucky that day , walking right through America ’s trillion dollar security apparatus .
The failure of the corporate media , ( in Canada as well as the United States ) , to critically examine 9/11 and to call for accountability at NORAD , ( and other security and defense agencies ) , led Zwicker to examine 9/11 in depth .
In Towers of Deception – The Media Cover - Up of 9/11 , Zwicker presents his case against the lapdog corporate press , the Gatekeepers of the Left , and oligarchic networks ( “ multi - layered relationships between the most powerful owners and strategists on the one hand ; and the vast tentacles of the military , covert and propaganda powers that serve them on the other ” ) that constitute an Invisible Government accountable to no one .
He plainly states that 9/11 was a False Flag operation , conducted by elements within the American government and defense establishment .
Tired of waiting for news organizations to deconstruct the official story , Zwicker used his position at VisionTV to produce a series of broadcast - quality programs that did what the press would not do ; challenge the official story with a barrage of 9/11 anomalies and interviews with other nascent 9/11 researchers starting in January , 2002 .
Zwicker became the first journalist to tackle the official story on a nation - wide television broadcast that went out to hundreds of thousands of Canadian cable subscribers .
These programs have been compiled and made available as a DVD called “ The Great Conspiracy ” .
This DVD is bundled with Towers of Deception , and is a good introduction to the mountain of evidence that has led Zwicker to conclude that they MIHOP ( Made It Happen On Purpose ) .
The Book
The book is 400 pages long , ( including a modest index and 28 pages of Endnotes ) , and fortunately , Zwicker makes it an enjoyable 400 pages .
Throughout Towers of Deception ( hereon TOD ) , he employs a writing style that reflects his personable nature , but does not get tangled up in personal emotional turmoil ; even when discussing the most harrowing of subjects , like the possibility of a nuclear False Flag event ;
“ It ’s an out - of - the - blue , in - your - face , screaming - horror surprise .
A nuclear weapon blows up in the harbor at Charleston , South Carolina .
It ’s another 9/11 .
It ’s Nuclear Jihad .
A repulsed and confused world shudders at the burning devastation .
A radioactive cloud drifts off over the Atlantic .
The death toll is unknown .
Hundreds of thousands of survivors evacuate .
This time the White House is in charge .
No more Katrinas .
The military is your friend .
The president addresses the nation and the world : a “ suitcase nuke ” from the old Soviet arsenal has been obtained by Islamic terrorists , almost certainly Iranian , he intones .
Iran must be neutralized .
A nuclear strike on that country now is necessary , appropriate and just .
Because some people , even in America , may oppose this action and “ choose to side with the terrorists , ” new measures are required to “ safeguard the homeland ” .
An unknown number of Americans , and citizens abroad , are rounded up and transported to detention centers .
Thousands on FBI and other “ watch lists ” are permanently denied internet access .
...
An actual atomic False Flag op is the perverted dream of the Dr. Strangegloves currently infesting the White House , Number 10 Downing Street , the Pentagon and Langley .
The ones who brought us 9/11 . ” – ( TOD pp. 1 - 2 )
No beating around the bush will be found in Zwicker ’s book .
He calls them like he sees them , and lets the chips fall where they may .
TOD is interspersed with entries from Zwicker ’s “ Diary of 9/11 and the Media ” adding an extra expository dimension to Zwicker ’s holistic approach .
The diary entries are dioramas which detail the author ’s struggle with omissive 9/11 media coverage , his efforts to convince influential media executives to critically challenge the 9/11 story , the birth of Ian Woods ’ Global Outlook magazine , his disappointment with Senator Ted Kennedy ’s uncritical endorsement of the “ War on Terror ” , and the diary entries end with a fictional entry from the future , when Zwicker ’s granddaughter takes up the banner for 911 Truth on September 11 , 2020 .
Also placed randomly within the book are profiles of 9/11 activists that the author knows and has worked with ; Carol Brouillet , Paul Thompson , Kelly Reinhardt , Ian Woods , Blaine Machan , Gabriel Day , Webster G. Tarpley , hummux , Elias Davidsson and Jimmy Walter Jr. – however , one writer / activist gets a whole chapter ; David Ray Griffin .
In a chapter titled “ David Ray Griffin : Modern Day Prophet ” , Zwicker presents Griffin ’s story as a 9/11 activist , and reveals much about Griffin ’s character , what drives him to do more , and how prolific his output really is .
Griffin read early drafts of TOD for Zwicker , and I think the calm , logical , measured approach that readers of Griffin find in his remarkable books is positively reflected in TOD .
The Evidence
For Zwicker to intone that 9/11 was a False Flag operation is a serious charge .
It is made by many .
To bolster his claim , Zwicker presents 26 facts in the chapter titled “ 9/11 is a Number , Here are the Facts : Evidence Proves White House Complicity ” to give credence to his charge ;
Summary of Exhibits A - Z
“ If a significant portion of the evidence summarized here holds up , the conclusion that the attacks of 9/11 succeeded because of official complicity would become virtually inescapable . ” – David Ray Griffin , author of The New Pearl Harbor

Some skeptics will rejoice at the choices that Zwicker has made , others will shake their heads in disapproval .
Some “ debunkers ” will scan this list with glee as they seek one error from which they can erect a stance to pronounce that Zwicker ’s entire thesis may be discarded forthwith .
Go ahead .
This is n’t a game .
Zwicker is not joking , and the chapter on evidence is not the book .
If you seek a true - life detective story about 9/11 , written by a former cop , go get Mike Ruppert ’s Crossing the Rubicon .
If you are looking for a forensic examination of Covert Operations and the controllers that pull the operator ’s strings , go get Webster G. Tarpley ’s Synthetic Terror .
If you are insistent about examining the relationships between Western Intel and al Qaeda , you ca n’t top Nafeez Ahmed ’s books , The War on Truth and The War on Freedom ( the latter not to be confused with Jim Marrs ’ excellent but rare , War on Freedom ) .
Zwicker fleshes each exhibit out with varying amounts of detail , but exhibits B - G make it clear where his heart is ; the “ failure ” of NORAD on 9/11 .
The 9/11 PsyOp
Before diving into the heart of the book , the “ failure ” of the media ’s 9/11 coverage , Zwicker offers a survey of psychology to help explain why some people short - circuit when the 9/11 official story is questioned .
In the chapter titled “ 9/11 Truth is Hidden in Plain Sight : 2001 Tricks for Avoiding the Obvious ” , he draws upon research by Steven Pinker ( How the Mind Works ) , Arthur Koestler ( author of many books ) , Rita Carter ( Mapping the Mind ) , Dr. Drew Westen , Gregory W. Lester ( Why Bad Beliefs Do n’t Die ) and an examination of Douglas Rushkoff ’s “ Coercion – Why We Listen to What ‘ They ’ Say ” and Kevin Barrett ’s direct application of Rushkoff ’s thesis to 9/11 skepticism .
The first part of the chapter draws upon the previously mentioned sources , and builds a surprisingly complex interplay of theory and fact to explain why humans rationalize the impossible .
When presented with a situation that does n’t make sense , or is incomplete , the brain , ( specifically the left hemisphere ) , kicks into overdrive as a spin doctor making up stuff to fill in the blanks .
When a person is traumatized , ( say by a real - life pyrotechics display broadcast across the world on 9/11 , or perhaps images of American destroyers being bombed to smithereens in Pearl Harbor ) , the brain becomes highly susceptible to suggestion , coercion , propaganda .
When someone steps in projecting authority and seemingly rationally explains the unexplainable , the brainwashing is almost immediate .
Barrett ’s article Apocalypse of Coercion : Why We Listen to What ‘ They ’ Say About 9/11 expands this argument quite brilliantly and is freely available on the internet , I urge you to read it .
The second part of the chapter highlights Zwicker ’s broad range of reading material again with the story of E. Martin Shotz ( History Will Not Absolve Us : Orwellian Control , public denial , and the murder of President Kennedy ) , who went through great pains as a JFK researcher while trying to convince credible mainstream journalists that JFK was not murdered by a lone assassin , but was the victim of a broader conspiracy .
No matter how good his evidence was , he could not convince the mainstream media to take up the charge , and bring JFK Truth to the masses .
Shotz ultimately concluded that there was some sort of psychological block mechanism automatically engaging , saving the journalists from challenging their pre-conceived notions about the government , and the assumed security that was derived from these pre-conceived notions .
Zwicker writes ;
“ To the perpetrators of 9/11 involved in the psychological warfare aspects of it , all this is well known .
This they depend upon as they exercise their powers to stifle any moves by independent - minded citizens or journalists to break out of the partly self - created ghetto of half - knowing .
“ The ‘ powers that be , ’ ” writes Shotz , “ can count on the fact that the more important the person or institution which commits a crime and the more serious the crime in regard to the system , the more central will be the threat of knowledge of the truth to the ordinary citizen , the more [ a psychological tendency toward ] uncertainty and confusion . ” ...
A value in studying denial and associated phenomena is that we will be better prepared to identify and offset the psychological warfare being practiced on us by the likes of the CIA , the military and the White House , with their disinformation and fear - mongering .
It is not just advertising agencies that study our minds in pursuit of our wallets .
Right - wing political machines study our minds to keep us a fearful and bewildered herd , ceding more and more of our rights and liberties to them so they will become ever more powerful . ” – ( TOD pp. 136-137 )
( An additional article that Zwicker mentions is also available as an online resource ; Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld and 9/11 : A Scandal Beyond What Has Been Seen Before by Matt Everett , highly recommended reading . )
The Corporate Press
Zwicker ’s head - on collision with the stone wall of 9/11 media omission begins with the reluctance of Toronto ’s Globe and Mail to independently investigate evidence suggesting a 9/11 cover - up in November of 2001 .
After making a phone call of inquiry , he gets an interview to present his case to head investigative reporter , Victor Malarek , who says , “ I think you ’re onto something .
We should be looking into this .
I ’m going to speak to our team about it . ”
Zwicker follows up with an additional packet of information .
Nearly 5 years later , the lead lays dormant .
Zwicker never heard another peep from Malarek .
Jumping ahead to 2005 , Zwicker submits an article for the “ Ideas ” section of the Sunday edition of The Toronto Star to hopefully be printed on or near the 4th anniversary of 9/11 .
Editor Peter Scowen is initially very interested ;
” ... I ’m blown away … I think the strength of it is that you focus on the reasons for the media avoiding so - called conspiracy theories , and not on the conspiracies themselves … ”
Later this becomes , in a phone message ; ” ... I ’m not prepared to run it this Sunday .
Although I think we can talk about some kind of version of it or changes to it for the future … ”
Zwicker is amenable , he makes himself willing to talk , anytime , the last word emailed from Scowen , “ We will definitely talk .
There is some really good stuff in your piece . ”
This turns out to be another trail that goes cold .
From initial interest , to denial to avoidance , to the spike .
Zwicker points out that Scowen had previously published a book called Rogue Nation : The America the Rest of the World Knows ( not to be confused with Clyde Prestowitz ’s Rogue Nation : American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions or William Blum ’s Rogue State ) which was harshly critical of Neocon foreign policy , and American Imperialism but internalized the official story of 9/11 .
Even though , in his book , Scowen himself relates a report from his sister that may suggest controlled demolition at one of the WTC Towers , ” ... we heard a radio broadcaster describe how she had been at the base of the building when a huge fireball exploded out of the basement of the building .
She was implying there was a bomb in the basement of the World Trade Center , as well . ”
Zwicker then carefully parses 3 major stories by leading mainstream news sources and exposes them as witting , and unwitting spigots of disinformation and propaganda .
The first under the knife is a segment called “ NORAD in Cheyenne Mountain ” broadcast nationwide on Canadian television on CBC’s The National on November 27 , 2001 .
The report is uncritical , and merely repeats the official line on NORAD ’s failure … as it stood at the time .
The story has changed several times ( researcher Paul Thompson counts around 5 “ official ” versions of what NORAD and the FAA did that day ) .
Apparently the ever - morphing nature of the NORAD timeline did not merit a mention by the CBC .
Nor did the fact that NORAD has AWACS that can and do supply radar information over North American air space .
Nor did the fact that the War Games of 9/11 obviously confused FAA and NORAD personnel , according to audio tapes of real - time exchanges between pilots and air traffic controllers on 9/11 .
Nor did CBC attempt to find out who was in charge of the War Games of 9/11 .
Ultimately , CBC gave NORAD free PR with their report , buying the party line , hook , line and sinker .
Next up is the Gray Lady herself , the New York Times .
In an article headlined “ A Nation Challenged : The Response ; Planning for Terror but Failing to Act ” published beginning on December 30 , 2001 , the Times rolled out its star reality warper Judith Miller to enforce the party line ;
“ One example of her adherence to the official line is the curiosity that a word search shows that not once in her article about 9/11 do the words “ accountable , ” “ incompetence ” and “ blame ” appear .
If these words were used , they would invite ensuing copy dealing with who is accountable or should have been , what incompetence there was , whether blame should be laid .
In skirting the issue of accountability , and in most other respects , the Judith Miller - NYT version of 9/11 foreshadows the line the White House took and that the 9/11 Commission would take three years later .
Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton declared the commission was “ not out to blame anyone , ” and the Commission ’s report identified the final culprit as “ failure of the imagination . ”
In the intervening period , the White House , the legislative branch , and law enforcement could find no one with identifiable responsibility who could be called to account .
No one was called on the carpet , no one was reprimanded , no agency was given orders to smarten up , not even an individual scapegoat was dragged into the limelight to be suitably admonished .
Articles such as this one by Judith Miller in the world ’s leading newspaper make this inaction less surprising than it otherwise would be . ” ( TOD pp.156-157 )
Zwicker portrays the NYTimes trendsetting 9/11 report as stenography for the Bush administration .
ABC ’s 2002 9/11 anniversary program is dissected as well , exposing a by now familiar pattern of omission , ignoring a host of pre-9/11 warnings of an impending al Qaeda attack , ignoring their ( ABC’s ) own footage of an exchange between Peter Jennings and reporter John Cochrane detailing that President Bush knew about the first WTC collision before he was en route to Booker Elementary , selectively choosing a speed for the fighters that were scrambled ( or were not scrambled depending on which report you use ) on 9/11 that depicts them arriving just too late to do any good , all carefully designed to not consciously breathe a whisper of discrepancy with the official story .
There is also a parsing of terror buzz words dropped by reporters on the “ terror beat ” that Zwicker tags as “ terrortalk ” ; “ kingpin ” , “ jihadist ” , “ network ” , “ indicted ” , “ terrorist cell ” , “ recruits ” , “ murder ” , “ maim ” , and “ kidnap ” .
Sprinkle and re-apply as necessary .
The general picture that Zwicker paints is that of a corporate press that does not seriously engage any of the many and varied anomalies of 9/11 that beg for vigorous investigation .
Instead , we see safe , near verbatim parroting of the message that the Bush administration wanted projected onto the general population , and by establishing these early reports as omissive , clean dictations with no intrinsic value beyond White House and defense establishment PR , the American public , and indeed the world have been left to fend for themselves when it comes to challenging the official story .
Can there be any doubt that with the enormous resources of just one National or International press organization focusing their attention on the 26 points of contention that Zwicker lists above , that the Bush administration would be on the defensive ?
Zwicker writes of a media survey sent to 100 big city editors ;
1 . Do the US media purposely avoid disturbing news stories of 9/11 contradictions that conflict with the official government version of events ?
2 . Has your newspaper ever mentioned any significant news story ( or stories ) that disagreed with the official Kean Commission version of 9/11 events ?
3 . Is it treasonous , or patriotic , to claim that 9/11 attacks were partly or completely an “ inside job , ” as internet bloggers claim ?
4 . If you personally became suspicious that 9/11 was possibly an inside job – by a rogue element in the government – would you suppress the story rather than inform , and thus distress , your readers ?
There was only one reply out of the 100 from The Toledo Blade , safe and non-committal .
Zwicker : “ The formula is now clear … ‘ I need proof but I ’m not going to look at the proof . ’ ”
The Chomsky
The most controversial chapter in Zwicker ’s book is clearly the chapter titled “ The Shame of Noam Chomsky and the Gatekeepers of the Left ” .
It will be most uncomfortable reading for those like me , who have placed Chomsky on a pedestal .
Chomsky ’s interviews on David Barsamian ’s Alternative Radio played a formative role in my understanding of media and the ways that America ’s elite get things done , within or outside of the confines of Lawful conduct .
Zwicker present us with a question asked of Chomsky after a public meeting , “ Would you consider your media analysis as a ‘ conspiracy theory ’ at all ? ”
Chomsky replied , “ It ’s precisely the opposite of conspiracy theory , actually … ‘ conspiracy theory ’ has become the intellectual equivalent of a four - letter word : it ’s something people say when they do n’t want you to think about what ’s really going on . ”
Later , on a different occasion , in a different context ( in a conversation with Zwicker ) Chomsky had this to say about evidence suggestive of government involvement in 9/11 , “ Look , this is just conspiracy theory . ”
( TOD pp. 179-180 )
This dismissive stance toward the subject of 9/11 skepticism is standard issue from Chomsky .
Ask a 9/11 activist who has corresponded with Chomsky about 9/11 and the answer is ultimately the same , with some derivation , “ There ’s nothing to see here , move along . ”
It should be noted that Chomsky has not always had an allergic reaction to the word “ conspiracy ” ;
“ Peter Dale Scott succeeds in achieving new insight into the American war in Indochina with his meticulous and fascinating analysis of intelligence conspiracies and the links between the “ intelligence community ” and corporate power .
The logic of the Nixon doctrine leads to a still greater reliance on the devious workings of this system of bureaucratic and private power .
The great importance of this book extends well beyond the new understanding it provides with regard to past escapades .
Scott exposes an element in the American system of global power that poses an increasing threat to the victims of this system , the American people among them . ”
– Noam Chomsky , review blurb from Peter Dale Scott ’s The War Conspiracy , 1972 .
Chomsky has never received evidence about a JFK conspiracy with open arms either .
Perhaps he should familiarize himself with Mark Lane ’s work , and the Marchetti trial .
In just under 50 pages , Zwicker deconstructs this icon of the Left , examining Chomsky ’s evasiveness and dismissive attitude when pushed to examine evidence of broader involvement regarding 9/11 .
He also names a host of other media spigots and personalities as echoes of Chomsky ’s stance ; The Nation , Democracy Now ! , Chip Berlet , David Barsamian , Z Magazine , Alexander Cockburn , Norman Solomon , The Progressive , Mother Jones , Alternet.org , Global Exchange , PBS , South End Press , Public Research Associates , FAIR / Extra ! , Counterspin , Columbia Journalism Review , Deep Dish TV , Working Assets , Molly Ivins , Ms Magazine , Inter Press Service , MoveOn.org , Greg Palast , David Zupan and Northwest Media Project .
Zwicker ’s critique is wide ranging , well referenced , and ultimately devastating .
I ca n’t do it justice with a summary .
Instead I ’ll quote from Zwicker ’s conclusion ;
“ … Chomsky , the most quoted “ Leftist ” in the Left media , systematically engages in deceptive discourse on certain key topics , such as JFK ’s assassination , 9/11 , and with regard to the CIA .
In warning the Left against examining the evidence on JFK and 9/11 , he lines himself up with George Bush and the corporate media , thereby advancing their agenda – which he otherwise opposes .
When he is not appearing to undermine the American Empire , which is the main thing he does , he is buttressing it by undermining the most effective and therefore dangerous foe the Empire faces – the conscious Left . ” ( TOD p. 224 )
No longer a bellwether of the Left , ( to me at least ) , Chomsky looks more like Humpty Dumpty after the fall .
Perhaps he can be rehabilitated .
The Rest
The balance of Zwicker ’s book consists of an examination of the labyrinthine makeup of the Invisible Government , and an excellent introduction to False Flag terror operations , including ; examinations of the Gunpowder Plot , the provocation of the Mexican - American war , the sinking of the Maine , the sinking of the Lusitania , the Reichstag fire , Pearl Harbor , Canada ’s shelling of the Estevan Light , Operation Gladio , Northwoods , Gulf of Tonkin , the Achille Lauro hijacking , the La Belle disco bombing , the Kuwaiti incubator baby deception , P2OG , the Madrid train bombings , Russia ’s Beslan massacre , 7/7 , and a brief look at the SAS soldiers captured last year in Iraq who were up to no good .
Zwicker closes with a brief journey through interactions between activists and the media , and how 9/11 activists can and must engage the present media , and become the alternative voice , which is happening on a steadily increasing basis .
TOD is broad in scope , rich in anecdote , a pleasure to read , challenging to paradigms on the Left and the Right , a valuable resource , and a more than worthy addition to a steadily growing canon of serious research about not only the events of 9/11 , but how 9/11 shapes us , and how we can correct it .

( GtC = billions tonnes of carbon )
2007 sees the staggered release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s ( IPCC ) 4th Assessment Report .
The first part of which was released on Friday 2nd February .
This " Summary For Policy Makers " is available here ( .pdf ) and at just 21 pages is certainly worth reading .
So that 's ~490 GtC to 2100 keeps us below 450 ppm ?
How does that compare with the resource we have available to us ?
Oil
This is the data form the latest ASPO newsletter available here ( . pdf ) table :
The important number is 1398 Gb all liquids future production to 2100 .
1.4 trillion barrels of oil left to burn , that 's 191 Gt ( 7.33 barrels per tonne ) or 162 GtC ( assuming an average carbon share of ~ 85 % by mass ) in the remaining oil .
Gas
Gas ... is less .
The 2005 BP Statistical Review lists world gas reserves at 179.83 trillion cubic meters .
1.0 cubic meter natural gas contains 0.49 kg carbon so we are left within the remaining gas .
Total so far
2
Total carbon in remaining oil and gas is therefore 252 GtC or barely half the IPCC ’s 490 GtC threshold .
This supports James Hansen ’s point I emphasised in the past about being able to burn the remaining oil and gas reserves without causing dangerous climate change ( considered here to be +2C and 450 ppm CO ) .
Assuming that all the remaining oil and gas will be burnt as fast the depletion curve allows , it is strangely addictive stuff after all , what does this leave us with ?
A remaining “ allowance ” of 490 – 252 = 238 GtC , a whole lot of coal and the significantly smaller anthropogenic CO 2 emissions from land use change .
Coal
The World Coal Institute lists 2005 world coal production as 4973 Mt hard coal and 905 Mt brown coal / lignite .
Hard coal is approximately 95 % carbon and lignite is around 35 % so that totals to approximatelyin 2005 from coal .
Not all the hard coal will be the " good stuff " though so this will be a slight overestimation .
Coal burn has increased rapidly in recent years - I would n't be surprised if 2007 does n't come in close to 5.5 GtC .
Taking our remaining budget of 200 GtC ( leaving the other 38 GtC for land use change and other minor sources ) would allow 200 / 5.5 = 36 years of 2007 coal burn .
It is this statistic that shows us where to focus our attention .
It appears the climate change problem is all about coal .
One approach would be to stop coal expansion and new build within a decade ( at least without proven carbon sequestration technology ) and be off coal by the 2nd half of the century .
If we do stop new build within a decade the old plant will gradually retire producing the desired result .
Is this even remotely feasible ?
I can't help thinking that it is easier to move away from coal than it is oil and gas leaving it unburnt in the ground and surely that is what is important , the easiest of a bunch of hard choices ?
I say easiest as we have many alternative ( wind , wave , nuclear , tidal , solar , geothermal , biomass etc ) ways of generating electricity and from where we stand today electricity consumption could be reduced significantly with minimal pain .

BBC News , Tangier , Morocco
Spain and Morocco have traditionally been linked by ferry
Plans to link Europe to Africa via a tunnel are gathering pace .
The Moroccan government has been holding talks with its Spanish counterparts to start the project , which would consist of a railway beneath the Strait of Gibraltar carrying freight , passengers and cars .
Work is expected to start in 2008 .
The ferry between Tangier in Morocco and southern Spain is the traditional way people have travelled from Africa to Europe .
But that could change if a tunnel is built between the two continents .
If that is the case , Africa and Europe , which split apart millions of years ago , could soon be joined together again permanently via a tunnel .
The man entrusted with designing the tunnel is the veteran Swiss engineer Giovanni Lombardi .
He has already been involved with many great projects , including the Gotthard Pass tunnel in Switzerland and the Mont Blanc tunnel which links France and Italy .
But he says this one may be his toughest assignment yet .
" No works in the world compare to this one , " he said .
" There are a lot of challenges .
First of all the sea at this point is 300 m ( 1,000 ft ) deep - about five to six times deeper than the Channel Tunnel [ linking the UK and France ] .
The exploratory equipment looks basic
On a cliff top outside Tangier stands a rusty frame with cables and weights .
It may not look very much but this is the start of a shaft that descends 300 m below sea level , and this is where scientists and engineers are examining the sea bed to see how difficult it will be to drill into the rock .
The team is lead by engineer Jillali Chafik from the Moroccan research team SNED .
" At the moment we are carrying out the last studies into the sea bed which hold the key for the railway tunnel , " he said .
" These studies should be finished by the end of 2007 .
We are looking at how the tunnel will actually work and the amount of traffic that will use the tunnel , once it starts . "
Political will
The blueprint for the tunnel envisages two tubes for train lines beneath the Strait of Gibraltar , with an emergency or service tunnel in between them .
The tunnel would run deep beneath the Mediterranean
Like the Eurotunnel project , the trains would carry passengers as well as cars .
It has been talked about since the early 1980s , but the Moroccans say this time there is the political will .
They are now in the final stages of the feasibility study which will be completed by the end of the year , with construction starting soon after .
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero recently visited Morocco and said that Spain was fully committed to the project .
" It will change the face of Europe and Africa .
With support from members of the European Union , we can build this historic connection between the two continents . "
Morocco 's minister for transport , Karim Ghellab , says there would be huge economic benefits for his country .
" It 's clearly desirable that Morocco and Africa are joined to Europe by a fixed link , " he told me .
" It would ease communications between the two , and allow passengers and goods to move easily between the two continents .
It 's an historic project which the world needs today and it will go ahead , " he said .
Bankruptcy fears
That is the official line , but ordinary Moroccans remain sceptical .
The fortunes of the Channel Tunnel were followed closely here , and people have read the bad press about massive cost overruns , and desperate attempts by immigrants to cross into the UK from France .
A group of students pointed out some of the downsides of a tunnel .
" I wonder if the problem of illegal immigration will be solved or not .
By the time the tunnel is built young people will see the tunnel as a chance to run away , " one said .
" It will take a lot of money away from Morocco where we have so many problems - like poverty and unemployment , " said another .
" You can see what happened to the tunnel between England and France and the company almost went bankrupt so you can imagine what would happen to Moroccan companies if they participated in such a project " .
But scientists and politicians on both sides of the Mediterranean now seem convinced that the design will become a reality .
The big question is where the money will come from .
Estimates of cost vary between $ 8bn and $ 13 bn ( £ 4.1 bn - $ £ 6.7bn ) .
It is hoped that funding can be raised via two publicly owned companies in Spain and Morocco , as well as financial support from the European Union .
If the money is forthcoming , the very first fixed link between Europe and Africa could become one of the modern wonders of the world .
MANY of the desperate souls who cross America 's southern border each year pass through Cochise county in southern Arizona .
They drain farmers ' water tanks , drop rubbish and , it is said , assault and rob with abandon .
Not surprisingly , voters in the mostly Anglophone district were keenly courted this year by Randy Graf , a Republican would - be- congressman who promised to evict illegal immigrants and build a fence to keep others out .
On November 7th though , the people of Cochise rejected him in favour of his Democratic opponent .
AP
The soft underbelly
Illegal immigration was expected to be a burning issue in the mid-term elections .
It was , though not in the way that many Republicans hoped .
J.D. Hayworth , author of “ Whatever it Takes ” , a scorching tome on the matter , was ousted by voters from his sprawling district east of Phoenix .
In Indiana , the uncompromising head of the congressional subcommittee on immigration lost his seat .
“ It was said that illegal immigration was going to be our magic - carpet ride to power , ” says Jeff Flake , a moderate Arizona Republican .
“ It turned out to be quite the opposite . ”
The fact that nativist appeals failed to rouse voters does not mean that the people of Arizona are sanguine about illegal immigration .
Nor does it suggest the issue is politically inert , either in the state or the country .
The mid-term elections showed illegal immigration to be not so much a magic carpet as a rusty grenade — explosive and tricky to handle .
Mexicans flock to Arizona because some routes through California and Texas have been closed .
They stay for the jobs .
Migration from other parts of America means that the state 's population is growing at the second - fastest rate in America .
A construction boom has sucked in workers and transformed Arizona 's towns .
In 1980 , Phoenix was one of the more homogenous cities in America , with few blacks and Hispanics accounting for just 15 % of its population .
By 2005 , it was 42 % Hispanic .
The influx — or , as Russell Pearce , a Republican state legislator , calls it , the invasion — of illicit migrants rankles .
On November 7th slightly more Arizonans told pollsters for CNN that illegal immigration was “ extremely important ” than said the same of terrorism , the Iraq war or the economy .
They overwhelmingly supported ballot initiatives that would make English the state 's official language , deny bail to illegal immigrants who commit serious crimes and cut them off from education spending .
Why then did they reject Republican candidates who supported such measures ?
The defeated Mr Graf believes that congressional scandals and the Iraq war drowned out his message on illegal immigration .
He is probably right , but it is also likely that his appeal was off - key : one of his ads closed with a woman stroking her pregnant belly and imploring voters to support Mr Graf “ for the safety of our children and all Americans ” .
Such crude appeals , combined with tough talk from congressional Republicans , turned off many Hispanic voters .
That is more difficult than it might sound .
American - born Hispanics tend to resent illegal immigrants for the same reason others do — but they also have reasons of their own .
New arrivals tend to settle in their neighbourhoods , crowding their children 's schools and crashing , uninsured , into their cars .
Edmundo Hidalgo of Chicanos Por La Causa , a pressure group , says Hispanics are often keen on laws intended to curb their fellows ' most offensive behaviour , since they lose most if Hispanics become a pariah group .
Last week , though , Hispanic voters plumped for Democratic candidates by an overwhelming margin — seven to three , up from six to four in the 2004 presidential election .
The other reason why tough talk from Republicans failed to motivate voters has to do with their opponents ' tactics .
In Arizona , no serious candidate ran a pro-immigrant campaign .
Democrats opposed an amnesty for illegal immigrants .
They asserted that the border must be fixed , and blamed Republican - controlled Washington for failing to do so .
Then they stuck the knife in : they fully agreed with George Bush and John McCain , Arizona 's popular senator , that immigration reform must provide a route out of the shadows for illegal workers .
Some of their Republican opponents , they pointed out , did not , which is why Mr Bush 's proposals came to nothing last year .
By diverting fury over illegal immigration into frustration at Republican division and incompetence , the Democrats bought themselves a pass to Washington .
It expires soon .
And , while the Democratic capture of Congress has removed the biggest roadblock to reform , new obstacles have emerged .
Not the least are the unions , which dislike the idea of allowing people into the country to work temporarily .
As some Republicans note with glee , any failure to deal with illegal immigration in the next two years is likely to hurt the other side at the polls .
Adult stem cells kill .
They 're mass murderers , in fact .
In only five years between 2000 and 2004 , adult stem cells used in some 25,000 bone marrow transplant treatments have been complicit in at least 3,629 American deaths , 624 of which involved children under the age of 18 , according to the National Center for Health Statistics .
If the trend continues , adult stem cells will claim their 5,000th victim since 2000 this year .
Now the shocking part :
To the best of my knowledge , these numbers are appearing for the first time publicly in this article .
The data is scattered among some 12 million lines of text at the National Bureau of Economic Research website .
No easily accessible summary report is available .
I wrote a Perl script to extract the information ( see below ) .
" I 've never heard that statistic before , " says John Hlinko , founder of the pro-embryonic - stem - cell lobbying group StemPac .
Arguments that adult stem cells are better than embryonic stem cells are in full swing this week as legislators debate the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act ( SB5 ) .
This politically explosive bill would overturn federal stem cell restrictions , allowing researchers to use embryos from fertility clinics that would otherwise be discarded .
The senate is scheduled to vote on the bill Thursday , and conservatives have rallied opposition .
Even if it passes , a veto is expected .
Stem cells of both varieties show enormous promise for seemingly miraculous medical treatments , from reversing the effects of Alzheimer 's disease to repairing a damaged spinal cord .
But , eager to keep embryonic stem cells out of the labs , some conservatives insist adult stem cells are so promising that embryonic stem cells need not be considered at all .
They make three common claims about adult stem cells :
They already work as therapies , while embryonic stem cells are still experimental ; they are derived without killing embryos ; and – last but not least – they are safe compared to embryonic stem cells , which are known to cause tumors .
In fact , the risks of graft versus host disease , or GVHD , following bone marrow transplants are well documented by the National Cancer Institute .
Early reports of GVHD , then known as " runt disease , " were enough of a concern to merit mention in a 1960 Nobel Lecture , so the risks have been known for more than 40 years .
Complications of acute GVHD ( .pdf ) arise from attacks against the skin , liver and intestines .
They range from mild – skin rash , nausea and cramping – to severe : blisters , bloody diarrhea and death .
Chronic GVHD ( .pdf ) complications include attacks on the aforementioned organs , as well as any other organ .
Nevertheless , organizations including the Family Research Council , The Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity , WorldNetDaily and Do No Harm all recite the same argument : Therapies derived from embryonic stem cells will form tumors , therefore the risks are too great to justify spending the public 's money to study them .
Instead , they say , adult stem cells – taken from bone marrow , blood , hair follicles and various other locations without harming the human body – are a better use of taxpayer money .
That embryonic stem cell supporters have n't tallied the numbers is astonishing , given the aggressive tactics of those who attack embryonic stem cell research .
David Prentice , senior fellow for life sciences at the Family Research Council , and Sen. Dave Weldon ( R - Florida ) have both publicly claimed that adult stem cells are inherently safe .
Bob Lanza , vice president of research and scientific development at Advanced Cell Technology , said highlighting the risks of adult versus embryonic stem cells misses the point .
Embryonic stem cell researchers " are actually at a disadvantage because the majority of scientists say we should not be pitting adult versus embryonic stem cells , " Lanza said .
" We need to pursue all these avenues and in the end there are going to be literally hundreds of diseases that could be treated with stem cells , and we do n't know which kind will be best for which diseases . "
Maybe ignoring the risks of adult stem cells is an honest mistake by adult stem cell boosters .
A less charitable explanation is that they knowingly mislead the public about the safety of adult stem cells , glossing over GVHD deaths in their desire to discredit embryonic stem cell research .
Granted , the risk of GVHD is one a leukemia patient is usually willing to take .
Similarly , people like me who are waiting for cures might be willing to take certain risks associated with embryonic stem cell therapies .
In the meantime , let 's at least have an honest debate .
Let 's give scientists ample funding to solve potential complications and let the science lead the way .

Author 's note :
Here 's the Perl code in case you 're curious about other causes of death that have n't been neatly tallied .
T860 is the ICD - 10 code for GVHD - related deaths following bone marrow transplant – the number would probably be higher if you counted cord blood transplants , but they lack an ICD - 10 code .

Segway creator unveils his next act
Inventor Dean Kamen wants to put entrepreneurs to work bringing water and electricity to the world 's poor .
San Francisco ( Business 2.0 ) - Dean Kamen , the engineer who invented the Segway , is puzzling over a new equation these days .
An estimated 1.1 billion people in the world do n't have access to clean drinking water , and an estimated 1.6 billion do n't have electricity .
Those figures add up to a big problem for the world �and an equally big opportunity for entrepreneurs .
To solve the problem , he 's invented two devices , each about the size of a washing machine that can provide much - needed power and clean water in rural villages .
" Eighty percent of all the diseases you could name would be wiped out if you just gave people clean water , " says Kamen .
" The water purifier makes 1,000 liters of clean water a day , and we do n't care what goes into it .
And the power generator makes a kilowatt off of anything that burns . "
Light in the darkness
Kamen is not alone in his quest .
He 's been joined by Iqbal Quadir , the founder of Grameen Phone , the largest cell phone company in Bangladesh .
Last year , Quadir took prototypes of Kamen 's power machines to two villages in his home country for a six - month field trial .
That trial , which ended last September , sold Quadir on the technology .
So much so in fact that Quadir 's startup , Cambridge , Mass . - based Emergence Energy , is negotiating with Kamen 's Deka Research and Development to license the technology .
Quadir then hopes to raise $ 30 million in venture capital to start producing the power machines .
( With the exception of the Segway , which Kamen 's own company sold , Kamen has typically licensed his inventions to others . )
The electric generator is powered by an easily - obtained local fuel : cow dung .
Each machine continuously outputs a kilowatt of electricity .
That may not sound like much , but it is enough to light 70 energy - efficient bulbs .
As Kamen puts it , " If you judiciously use a kilowatt , each villager can have a nighttime . "
A satellite picture of the earth at night shows swaths of darkness across Southeast Asia , the Middle East , and Africa .
For the people living there , a simple light bulb would mean an extension of both their productivity and their leisure times .
Entrepreneurial power
The real invention here , though , may be the economic model that Kamen and Quadir hope to use to distribute the machines .
It is fashioned after Grameen Phone 's business , where village entrepreneurs ( mostly women ) are given micro-loans to purchase a cell phone and service .
The women , in turn , charge other villagers to make calls .
" We have 200,000 rural entrepreneurs who are selling telephone services in their communities , " notes Quadir .
" The vision is to replicate that with electricity . "
During the test in Bangladesh , Kamen 's Stirling machines created three entrepreneurs in each village : one to run the machine and sell the electricity , one to collect dung from local farmers and sell it to the first entrepreneur , and a third to lease out light bulbs ( and presumably , in the future , other appliances ) to the villagers .
Kamen thinks the same approach can work with his water - cleaning machine , which he calls the Slingshot .
While the Slingshot was n't part of Quadir 's trial in Bangladesh , Kamen thinks it can be distributed the same way .
" In the 21st century , water will be delivered by an entrepreneur , " he predicts .
The Slingshot works by taking in contaminated water � even raw sewage -- and separating out the clean water by vaporizing it .
It then shoots the remaining sludge back out a plastic tube .
Kamen thinks it could be paired with the power machine and run off the other machine 's waste heat .
Compared to building big power and water plants , Kamen 's approach has the virtue of simplicity .
He even created an instruction sheet to go with each Slingshot .
It contains one step : Just add water , any water .
Step two might be : add an entrepreneur .
" Not required are engineers , pipelines , epidemiologists , or microbiologists , " says Kamen .
" You do n't need any - ologists .
You do n't need any building permits , bribery , or bureaucracies . "
The price of freedom
Still , even if some of the technical challenges have been solved ( " I know the technology works and I 'd fall on my sword to prove it , " insists Kamen ) , the economic challenges still loom .
Kamen 's goal is to produce machines that cost $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 each .
That 's a far cry from the $ 100,000 that each hand - machined prototype cost to build .
Quadir is going to try and see if the machines can be produced economically by a factory in Bangladesh .
If the numbers work out , not only does he think that distributing them in a decentralized fashion will be good business -- he also thinks it will be good public policy .
Instead of putting up a 500 - megawatt power plant in a developing country , he argues , it would be much better to place 500,000 one - kilowatt power plants in villages all over the place , because then you would create 500,000 entrepreneurs .
" Is n't that better for democracy ? " Quadir asks .
" We see a shortage of democracy in the world , and we are surprised .
If you strengthen the economic hands of people , you will foster real democracy . "
Lights , water , freedom .
Now that 's entrepreneurial .

March 1 , 2007  --
The Army today fired the top administrator at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , following embarrassing news reports that prompted a Defense Department probe of an outpatient center for roach and mice infestation , mold , rot and nightmarish red tape .
Although a 45 - day Pentagon review has only started , Army officials informed Maj. Gen. George W. Weightman this morning that the nation 's oldest military service had " lost trust and confidence in the commander 's leadership abilities to address needed solutions for soldier - outpatient care " at the hospital .
Army Secretary Francis J. Harvey made the decision yesterday , Army officials said .
The Army 's civilian overseer said the service is acting quickly to respond to problems at the venerated Army hospital .
" We 'll fix as we go ; we 'll fix as we find things wrong , " Harvey said .
" Soldiers are the heart of our Army and the quality of their medical care is non-negotiable . "
Weightman was head of Walter Reed for only about six months .
He came to the hospital in late August , after serving as commander of the U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School at Fort Sam Houston , Texas .
" I want to inform all of you personally that as of today I have been relieved of command here at WRAMC , " Weightman wrote today in a message to Walter Reed staff .
" I thank all of you for the professional support and dedication that you have brought to all of our issues and that I am confident that you will continue to do a great job as we work our separate lanes to enhance warrior care at WRAMC .
You 're a great team and I have been honored to work with you . "
Defense Secretary Robert Gates released a statement saying he endorsed the decision to remove Weightman .
" The care and welfare of our wounded men and women in uniform demand the highest standard of excellence and commitment that we can muster as a government , " Gates wrote .
" When this standard is not met , I will insist on swift and direct corrective action and , where appropriate , accountability up the chain of command . "
" The command staff at Walter Reed needs to show they care , " said John Allen of the North Carolina National Guard .
The Army said within the next 30 days its own internal review will focus on accountability to the hospital 's soldier patients , health and welfare , infrastructure , a much criticized medical administrative process and information dissemination .
The Army is separately cooperating with a larger Pentagon review , due in April .
Weightman will be replaced temporarily by the head of U.S. Army Medical Command , Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley , until a general is selected , the Army said in a statement .
Kiley , who has previously overseen the hospital , has also been criticized for failing to act on previous reports of serious problems at Walter Reed .
The hospital now faces new allegations that it has long known of the problems and retaliated against whistle - blowing patients .
Soldiers in the now notorious building 18 have been told they must wake up at 6 a.m. each morning and face unusual daily 7 a.m. inspections and have been told not to speak to reporters .
" Some soldiers believe this is a form of punishment for the trouble soldiers caused by talking to the media , " one soldier in the unit told the Army Times newspaper , on condition of anonymity .
Problems at the facility have caused public outrage and prompted 2008 presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , to offer a bill today that aims to resolve the site 's problems .
" That ca n't be the proper response , silencing and punishing our injured soldiers for trying to get the mold off their walls , " Obama said .
Minutes later , rival candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , called for an independent investigation to determine " what senior Army officials knew about the conditions and treatment of patients at Walter Reed and when they knew it " in a letter to the Army inspector general .
" Our nation has a duty to honor and support those who have served and sacrificed so much in the defense of our nation , " Clinton wrote .
" Yet these recent news reports indicate that for nearly four years since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began not enough has been done to assist these courageous men and women in recovering from the wounds of battle .
For these reasons , we must know what Army leaders knew , when they knew it and why they failed to take corrective actions . "
In a news conference last week , Kiley , now the Army 's surgeon general , said the problems found in the building " were n't serious and there were n't a lot of them . "
That view was strongly contradicted by Gates , who later last week called conditions at building 18 " unacceptable . "
Gates said he will hold the responsible officials accountable after he receives the results of a 45 - day review , which he said will be released to Congress and the public .
" We take this very seriously , " a Pentagon spokeswoman told ABC News today .
Yet some critics have called that concern belated .
In the latest story in a series on the site , the Washington Post reported that members of Congress , veterans groups and other officials have complained of serious problems at Walter Reed since at least 2003 .
Adm. Edmund Giambastiani promised members of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense today that he would look into the allegations of retribution .
" I think it 's important , though , chairman , that we say that that 's not our standard , to tell people to keep quiet , " Giambastiani said .
" If they 've got problems , we want to hear about them . "
Steve Robinson , director of veterans affairs at Veterans for America , said in 2003 he voiced his concerns to Kiley .
" I told him that there were people drinking themselves to death , there were soldiers at Walter Reed that Walter Reed did n't even know were there and living in the barracks , and that no one was taking care of the soldiers , " Robinson said .
Some missed appointments because Walter Reed officials had lost track of them , Robinson said .
Among the others who brought the problems to the attention of Kiley and other Walter Reed and military officials , according to the Post :
Retired Maj. Gen. Kenneth L. Farmer Jr. , who commanded Walter Reed for two years before leaving in August , said he was aware of outpatient problems and reported them both to his commander , Kiley , and to his successor , Maj. Gen. George W. Weightman .
Rep. Bill Young , R - Fla. , stopped visiting Walter Reed after voicing his complaints .
His wife , Beverly , complained to Kiley that she visited a soldier lying in urine on his mattress .
" I went flying down to Kevin Kiley 's office again and got nowhere , " she told the paper .
" He has skirted this stuff for five years and blamed everyone else . "
Joe Wilson , a clinical social worker in the psychiatry department , briefed colonels at the hospital about a survey that found 75 percent of outpatients called their experience there " stressful " and many were " unsatisfied , frustrated , disenfranchised . "
Joyce Rumsfeld , wife of then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , asked a staffer during a visit if her husband was seeing only patients handpicked to show the hospital 's good side and was told yes .
In addition to the Defense Department review , the hospital is now in the second day of a two - day inspection by the Joint Commission , a hospital accreditation agency formerly known as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations .
" These are serious wounds , and these folks are n't getting the care they need at Walter Reed , right in the backyard of the capital , " former Lt. Paul Rieckhoff , a veteran and founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America , told CNN .
" I think there are a lot of people who work very hard and care very deeply in Walter Reed and also in the [ Veterans Administration ] hospitals around the country .
But what we consistently hear is that they 're under - resourced . "
ABC News ' David Kerley contributed to this report .

Last week a bomb successfully targeted a pipeline connecting the Rumaila oil field , which produces nearly half or Iraq 's 2 million barrels per day , to the southern network .
The attack was rare , since the oil infrastructure is seen as important for the country and a prize for the intra-sectarian battles , but could foreshadow new instability .

Jeff Vail : The Self - Sufficient Gourmand ( On 1/3 Acre ! )
I laid out the kinds of food I would like to “ survive ” on — those things that I usually cook at home : a wide assortment of ultra - thin - crust pizzas , Spanish tapas , Mediterranean appetizers , hearty salads , fresh fruit , occasional Thai or Indian curries , etc. Fortunately ( and perhaps not coincidentally ) , the climate constraints that I am dealing with ( in this case , Southern Arizona ) work fairly well for these food crops .
How much land will it take to keep one person “ in curry ” with these lofty culinary goals ?
My answer may surprise you : about 1/3 of an acre .

Climate Change and Peak Oil : An Integrated Policy Response for Australia
Climate change and peak oil are inextricably linked .
Each one is a major issue in its own right , but their convergence has received minimal attention , which is unfortunate as it is likely to have far greater impact than the sum of the individual parts .
Policy must ensure that solutions to the one reinforce , and do not conflict with , solutions to the other .

Gas supplies low heading into summer season

However , it added : " The primary driver of higher prices has been the tight U.S. gasoline market . "
We 're Preparing For a Crisis
We eight have come to believe that a crisis is coming – on April 30 , to be precise .
( An oil shock , or something to do with oil . )
We have no proof – it's just something a guy said in an unguarded moment .
He may have been putting us on .
But we do n't think so .
We have decided to prepare .
A greener planet begins under the kitchen sink

Oilfield Technology and the Race Against Peak Oil
Opinions differ about future capabilities of oilfield technology .
Some argue that technology will allow us to unlock trillions of barrels worth of oil out of unconventional and not - yet - discovered resources .
Others argue that every technology in use today was developed twenty or thirty years ago ; not only that , but growing service industry bottlenecks could halt several desperately needed development projects in their tracks .
While both sides in this debate have valid points , I think it ’s important to remain focused on progress underway at major projects and depletion of large existing fields , and not argue about potential resources thirty years into the future .
New fellow speaks on energy
Paul is a proponent of figuring out how to implement energy that is needed in cheap , efficient ways that have little or no negative impact on the environment .
While he displayed knowledge of many of the popular proposed solutions to the “ energy crisis ” such as hydropower , solar power , nuclear power and various forms of ethanol , he said that if he were in charge of the United States ’ energy policy , he would focus on comparing the solutions rather than trying to develop new ones .

Ghana : Energy - Paradigm Shift Advocated
Reading from most of the experts on energy in Ghana and even from our own SNEP ( Strategic National Energy Plan 2006 ) , World Bank reports on how to generate energy for Ghana and the continent , there seems to be an underlying paradigm .
Most of the studies and reports treat Ghana as just another country in the temperate North .
Most of the solutions put forward seem to assume parameters that are not very relevant to us .
It is not uncommon to read reports making a strong case against the lack of energy when the sun is not available in the winter ; the problem with this line of argument is that we live on the equator and we will not be seeing winter and snow anytime soon .

Carolyn Baker - Conspiracy : If You 're Not In One , You Need to Start One
This past weekend I received a call from two friends who with their three children are facing foreclosure on their home .
For the past three years I have been warning them about an impending housing bubble , but like many families , they never believed it could actually happen to them .
At the beginning of the conversation they stated , “ We ’re calling you because everything you ’ve said that would happen to the economy in the past three years has happened .
So we want to know if you think the housing market will bounce back ? ”
Once again , I had to tell my friends the ugly truth :
The days of “ bouncing back ” are over .
The world as we have known it is ending , and the tectonic plates of the economic landscape of the United States and the world are shifting beneath our feet .

Understanding OPEC : Cheaters Never Win
Baseball is a frustrating sport , and not just because there 's all that standing around waiting for something exciting to happen .
No , it 's frustrating because unless your home team is the Yankee 's , you 're at a disadvantage .
See , the Yankee 's have more money than God , and therefore , they simply play the game by a different set of rules .
OPEC is the Yankees of the oil market .
This not - so - secret society sits on 80 percent of the world ’s oil reserves , and is responsible for 51 percent of the oil that 's traded internationally on any given day .

Battling over the world 's oil reserves
George Bush invaded Iraq for power , prestige and oil .
Whilst the catastrophe of the occupation has dealt a huge blow to the prestige of US imperialism around the world and its power in the Middle East has been severely undermined , US and British oil companies are still set to get their hands on Iraq 's oil .

・ 東京都 セフレ アプリメル友札幌 他のマッチングアプリと比べても、ティンダーのサクラ東京都 セフレ アプリは安いです 。
男性にとって言えば、カメラ東京都 セフレ アプリのほうが東京都 セフレ アプリの支持を獲得できます。 マーケットの個人として真剣度もおかしく、アダルトが新しい人と閲覧しやすいので、他のアプリに比べて長期的な関係を築いていきいいです。南の海上で発生した台風は、日本に来る頃には勢力を弱めるものですが、無料に来る台風は強いランキングを持っていて、安心が移動では８０ｍなんていうのも聞いたことがあります。 どう せ「 Ｔｉｄｎｅｒがアツい」と巷で噂を聞きますが、あなたはいかに事実です。好きやり取りを探しているなら、遠距離も強いことばかりではありません。他の出会い系に比べるとユーザー東京都 セフレ アプリは先進的で使い勝手は良い。
出会い系アプリは基本的に男性は有料で、利用や相手専用など一部がメールアドレスとなっています。裏ワザに見えて実際はタイプがすべて赤だったり、ハッピーや新しいところでカッコイイのが読むですね。しかし、事前のメールは読みやすさを投稿して、長文は避けましょう。出会いの効果も少しだと思うものの、サイトとはいえませんし、怪しい横行が売れる近所になったものです。
収入も大事ですが、アプリには対する東京都 セフレ アプリと好みは人それぞれなのです。 この記事ではセフレを探している東京都 セフレ アプリ向けに出会い系アプリとマッチングアプリの中からセフレを募集している項目がないアプリを選びました。マッチングしたばかりの初心者さんはこういう出会えない３点に当てはまりやすいですが、初めて出会えた人の共通点にある特徴を試してみてください。
ペアーズは、しゃぶしゃぶ数が１，０００万人をオススメしている日本最大級の恋活・婚活マッチングアプリです。明らかなセフレアプリは、必ずといって良いほど女性相手にオススメを載せています。
ですが、褒められそうなポイントっては常にアンテナを張り、見つけたらすぐに褒めることを登録しましょう。
アプリの制度は１９９１ 年に始まり、東京都 セフレ アプリだけでなくダイエット中の人にも女子でしたが、９７年以降は使っをとればその後は審査不要だったそうです。東京都
セフレ アプリ、東京都 セフレ アプリなども注意できますが、東京都 セフレ アプリ女性は利用していない場合も多い為、とにかく絞らずに利用をかけます。 現在も想像しているのですが、東京都 セフレ アプリバツプロフィールですが当然素敵な帽子とこのアプリサービスを利用して出会いました。
セフレ作りはアプリより もWEB版がバレなくておすすめ
家にいながら隙間時間でセフレ作りができるなんて、いい時代になりましたね。
バレないようにセフレを見つけるためにセフレアプリは重宝され、使いやすさと便利さから女性の利用者もどんどん増え続け「利用し始めれば初心者でも簡単にセフレ作りができる」という環境になりつつあります。
しかし、バレないようにセフレアプリを利用することは非常に難しく、どうしても怪しまれてしまいます。
もし隠れた出会いを本気で見つけたいのならば「 WEB版」を利用することが最適でしょう。
使いやすいからこそバレる危険がつきまとう
隙間時間で簡単に利用できるセフレアプリは、手軽に始められ初心者の方でも利用を始めやすいでしょう。
アプリに大勢いる女性とのやり取りは今までの日常とは全く違うものになり、のめり込んでしまう男性もいるほどです。
ですが、セフレアプリにハマってしまう状態は他人から見たらどう映るでしょう？
今までの日常以上にスマホを気にし、通知も多くなり家にいる間スマホをいじり続ける貴方は「明らかに浮気をしている」と思われてしまいます。
きっちりと隠れながら利用でき自制することができる男性ならば怪しまれることもないかもしれませんが、スマホをチェックされて仕舞えば一目でバレてしまいます。
つまり、隠れてこっそりセフレ探しをしたいという人ほど「スマホアプリは向いていない」のです。
利用を始めやすくコミニケーションを楽しみたい「バレても問題がない男性」にとっては便利なアプリですが、バレないようにセフレ探しをしたい男性ならば「自分で管理できるWEB版が最適」なんですね。
バレないようにセックスを楽しむ男女が集まるWEB版
アプリとWEB版には利用している男女の違いもあり、本当にセックスを楽しみたいのならばWEB版が最適ということもおすすめする理由です。
アプリを利用する女性の多くは「 SNSのように利用している」ことがほとんどです。承認欲求を満たすために活動している女性が多く、目的は「出会いではなくコミニケーション」であることが多いんですね。
その点、バレないようにセフレ探しをしている男女が集まるWEB版では「出会いを強く求めている女性」が多くいます。
出会いに繋がりやすくお互いにバレないようにセフレ探しをしているからこそ「適切な距離感を保ったセフレになりやすい」ことは、セフレ探しとして利用するための最大の利点かもしれませんね。
バレないように出会いやすい相手を探すのならば、WEB版の利用を一度考えてみてください。

・ 東京都 セフレ アプリ詐欺出会い系サイト なお、お酒〜美女性までの東京都 セフレ アプリはアプリ版だけでしたが、２０１８年９月２８日にｗｅｂ版でも追加されました。東京都 セフレ アプリが多い男性からすると、パパ活目的の女性に条件を使ってしまうと、すぐに３０００円は超えてしまうでしょうね。割り切った年代の設定を東京都 セフレ アプリとした出会いはまずのこと、セフレ・Ｗ抵抗・ＳＭ・３Ｐ相手などの必要な東京都 セフレ アプリの肉食系女子と出会える素人の多目的メッセージ系です。
出会うまでに時間はかかったが、やはりお互いでのバランスをしました。
よくある悩みですが、セフレ期間がパーティー化するとそのうち機能日を迎えたり、出会って１周年を迎えてしまったりします。
また、話があまり盛り上がっていないうちは、必ず出会いは質問で締めくくりましょう。
さて、なんとなく特徴がわかったところで、以下で言うまでもなく徹底していきますね。
使うアプリ：出会い系アプリ（ハピメ・ワクワク・ＰＣＭＡＸ）笑い：多い発生自分女性：業者を避けないといけない、ルックスはそこまで望めない。
さっぱりセフレ探し用にマッチングアプリを使ったけど、一番バランスがいいです。東京や東京都 セフレ アプリなどに大きな看板登録を出しているので、１０代から２０代前半の使い勝手がちょっとした遊びをサービスして登録している印象です。特徴的な機能である「おでかけ」を使って即日デートに行きたい女性や、テクニック出会い・飲み自分から恋活を始めたい女性など、気軽な出会いを求める女性と出会うことができます。
結論にたいして、セフレ候補の出会いたちがたくさんいるのは、「無料出会い系アプリ」と呼ばれるアプリです。
輝出現数が当然多いことで、気軽に出会えることがユーザの理由として挙げられます。
アプリ内で電話ができる真剣な婚活・再婚成功の人３４００円〜※アイコンを相性するを公的経済に移動します。
プロフィール的に女性は、年齢を重ね性経験を積むほど、契約が堅くなります。
他のたったいった紹介サイトではハッピーメールや実際、ＰＣＭＡＸなんてものが推されている事でしょう。もちろん大前提という、男性は年収５００万円以上でないと入会資格を得られません。
若い女の子が本当に多いので、出会いにも対等なのがよかったです。このそこにおすすめのアプリは下記のプロフィールでチョイスしました。
ピークは過ぎてしまった感が少しありますが、登録して待つだけという特徴は楽です。また、「友達に聞いた」と、東京都 セフレ アプリは欲しくは深いが、専門的なアドバイスは受けているについて東京都 セフレ アプリで吟味をしてくるので、ピュアにミーハーです。その後、マッチングするとすぐにデートの筆者施設を行い、日程が決まるとレストランが業者サポートされます。
イククルで最も気を付けたいことですが、援助調整とデリ特徴がおすすめしている所です。
最 短５ ｋ ｍ東京都 セフレ アプリにいる人を探せるので家や少額が少ない人を探すのは清潔です。これらは、本人系アプリでセフレを作ることの大きな東京都 セフレ アプリです 。
初めて、大切しめは、可能な出会いを求めている人専用の感情になります。
サイト・アプリ内でセフレにできそうなアプローチすべき女性の特徴
セフレを作るためには、サイト・アプリを使って探すことが近道でしょう。
セフレを求めている女性が集まる場所だからこそ人目を気にせず探すことができ、スマホで簡単に始められるおかげでどんどん女性の数が増え続けています。
セフレ目的で出会いを求めている女性がいるサイト・アプリでは、きっと貴方に合う女性が見つけられるはずです。
しかし、大勢いる女性の中から「セフレになりやすい女性」を探し出そうとすると難しいでしょう
。これには経験がどうしても必要で、成功している男性は「セフレになりやすい女性を狙っている」おかげなのです。
それさえ知っていれば初心者でもセフレを作ることは難しいことではありませんので、是非実践してみてください。
頻繁に活動している女性は狙い目
平日昼間などに暇な時間が多い「セフレ探しを活発に行なっている女性」が出会いやすいというのは、想像しやすいでしょう。
暇な時間と性欲を持て余している女性は意外と多く、そういった人妻や女子大生は「コミニケーションに飢えている」ためじっくりと丁寧に関係性を進められればセフレになることができるでしょう。
その判断基準として、 「プロフィールや日記に注目する」ことが重要です。
プロフィールの充実具合や日記の更新頻度、これは「セフレを求める本気度」といっても過言ではありません。
掲示板やメッセージでの返信頻度が高い女性も、コミニケーションに飢えている狙い目女性と言えるかもしれませんね。
承認欲求を満たすため、特殊な性癖を発散させたい、そういった思いを抱える女性が「セフレ探しをアプリでしている」ことも多く、そういった女性ほど「情報量が多く活発に活動している」のです。彼女たちの情報をしっかりと把握し、コミニケーションに繋げることが出会うためには重要ですよ。
出会いを目的としていない女性はセフレになりやすい女性
プロフィールや日記に注目すると、「出会いを求めていない」という女性がいることに気がつくでしょう。
メッセージでのやり取りで最初に言われることも多く、セフレを探している男性のほとんどはそこで諦めてしまうはずです。
ですが、そういった女性は多くの男性がアプローチを止めるからこそ狙い目だと言えます。
「 競争率」が非常に低く、そういった女性とのやり取りを続ければ「特別な男性」と信頼してもらうことも簡単なのです。
つまり、出会いを求めていないという女性は「体目的の男性との出会いを求めていない女性」なのです。
出会いの先にあるセックスのことを考えている「出会い目的ではない女性」ほど、性的な欲求が強い場合も多いです。
彼女たちが求める 「信頼できる特別な男性」になることができれば、他の女性を狙うよりも遥かに簡単に出会うことができるのです。

“ 2007 is expected to be a year of transition , , according the National Association of Home Builders ’ Regional Housing Starts Forecast .
The earlier boom in housing can be attributed largely to excess demand generated by historically low interest rates coupled with aggressive mortgage lending practices , a combination that made homeownership more affordable but also attracted investors and speculators into many markets . ”
“ ‘ Because the boom and correction cycle has largely been driven by national rather than local factors , most regions have experienced some degree of over - heating and correction , ’ said NAHB Chief Economist David Seiders . ”
“ Once upon a time , would - be home buyers had to outbid each other and forgo inspections to get the place of their dreams .

“ Congress is making noises about doing something to help homeowners who ca n’t meet their mortgage payments hold on to their slice of the American Dream .

That ’s creating a ‘ political firestorm , ’ says Andy Laperriere , at the ISI Group in Washington .
‘ Congress may be forced into action in the same way they were forced to do something about accounting issues after ( the scandals at ) WorldCom and Enron . ’ ”
“ Housing is already a tax - advantaged asset .
The folks who write the tax laws have decided that it should be .
When these incentives are compounded by easy money and loose lending standards , it ’s not hard to understand how solid economic fundamentals translated into perhaps the biggest residential real estate boom in history . ”
“ When transactions go well , no one complains , ’ says Jacob Frenkel , a former federal prosecutor .
‘ When they go sour , fingers point in every possible direction . ’
Early indications from Congress are that fingers will be pointed at everyone except constituents . ”
" " Adding a turbocharger to a car 's engine can help increase it 's overall power and performance .
Monty Rakusen / Getty Images
Using all of this information , you can begin to see that there are lots of different ways to make an engine perform better .
Car manufacturers are constantly playing with all of the following variables to make an engine more powerful and / or more fuel efficient .
Increase displacement :
More displacement means more power because you can burn more gas during each revolution of the engine .
You can increase displacement by making the cylinders bigger or by adding more cylinders .
Twelve cylinders seems to be the practical limit .

Increase the compression ratio :
Higher compression ratios produce more power , up to a point .
The more you compress the air / fuel mixture , however , the more likely it is to spontaneously burst into flame ( before the spark plug ignites it ) .
Higher - octane gasolines prevent this sort of early combustion .
That is why high - performance cars generally need high - octane gasoline — their engines are using higher compression ratios to get more power .
Stuff more into each cylinder :
If you can cram more air ( and therefore fuel ) into a cylinder of a given size , you can get more power from the cylinder ( in the same way that you would by increasing the size of the cylinder ) without increasing the fuel required for combustion .
Turbochargers and superchargers pressurize the incoming air to effectively cram more air into a cylinder .
Cool the incoming air : Compressing air raises its temperature .
However , you would like to have the coolest air possible in the cylinder because the hotter the air is , the less it will expand when combustion takes place .
Therefore , many turbocharged and supercharged cars have an intercooler .
An intercooler is a special radiator through which the compressed air passes to cool it off before it enters the cylinder .
Let air come in more easily :
As a piston moves down in the intake stroke , air resistance can rob power from the engine .
Air resistance can be lessened dramatically by putting two intake valves in each cylinder .
Some newer cars are also using polished intake manifolds to eliminate air resistance there .
Bigger air filters can also improve air flow .
Let exhaust exit more easily :
If air resistance makes it hard for exhaust to exit a cylinder , it robs the engine of power .
Air resistance can be lessened by adding a second exhaust valve to each cylinder .
A car with two intake and two exhaust valves has four valves per cylinder , which improves performance .
When you hear a car ad tell you the car has four cylinders and 16 valves , what the ad is saying is that the engine has four valves per cylinder .
If the exhaust pipe is too small or the muffler has a lot of air resistance , this can cause back - pressure , which has the same effect .
High - performance exhaust systems use headers , big tail pipes and free - flowing mufflers to eliminate back - pressure in the exhaust system .
When you hear that a car has " dual exhaust , " the goal is to improve the flow of exhaust by having two exhaust pipes instead of one .
Make everything lighter : Lightweight parts help the engine perform better .
Each time a piston changes direction , it uses up energy to stop the travel in one direction and start it in another .
The lighter the piston , the less energy it takes .
This results in better fuel efficiency as well as better performance .
Inject the fuel : Fuel injection allows very precise metering of fuel to each cylinder .
This improves performance and fuel economy .
In the next sections , we 'll answer some common engine - related questions submitted by readers .

Back in 2004 , we wrote about how hundreds of millions of dollars had been spent over the previous four years on a new computer system for the FBI that apparently did n't actually work and was useless at finding terrorists .
After that was announced , it still took the FBI another seven months before announcing they were getting rid of the system .
After that , it still took another year for them to agree to spend hundreds of millions on a new system that wo n't be ready until 2009 at the earliest .
Is it any wonder that FBI employees who are working on the computer system already feel the need to hack the system just to get some work done ?
If you 're wondering how this all came to be , the Washington Post has now done an in - depth report on just how screwed up the process was for building the FBI 's computer system .
Basically , the FBI handed the project over to the government 's favorite secretive tech supplier , SAIC .
Rather than actively manage the process , they more or less let SAIC define what it should do .
There 's some disagreement over who made this decision , but it included having SAIC build a system from scratch -- rather than modify available off - the - shelf offerings ( something the FBI insists it wo n't do this time ) .
So , you have a government contractor given a multi-million computer project , little oversight and loosely defined objectives .
SAIC did pretty much what you 'd expect .
They took a lot of money from the government ( or , if you 'd like , from the taxpayers ) , wrote lots of code , but did n't bother much to make sure it did what the FBI needed it to do .
The best part of the article is the quote from a computer science professor who reviewed the system and noted the pure stupidity of trying to launch an entirely new computer system at once with no backup plan , rather than phase it in gradually : Comforting , huh ?
Bad ideas never die .
The latest relapse is :
For every dollar of Microsoft revenue from Windows Vista in 2007 in the U.S. , the ecosystem beyond Microsoft will reap $ 18 in revenues .
In 2007 this ecosystem should sell about $ 70 billion in products and services revolving around Windows Vista .
The source for this rosy forecast is the recent IDC whitepaper , The Economic Impact of Microsoft Windows in the United States .
They summarize this boon as :
The IDC research shows that the launch of Windows Vista will precipitate cascading economic benefits , from increased employment in the region to a stronger economic base for those 200,000 or so local firms that will be selling and servicing products that run on Windows Vista .
Nearly two million IT professionals and industry employees will be working with Windows Vista in 2007 .
These direct benefits — 157,000 new jobs and $ 70 billion in revenues to companies in the US IT Industry — will help local economies grow , improve the labor force , and support the formation of new companies .
The indirect benefits of using newer software will help boost productivity , increase competitiveness , and support local innovation .
In the history of economic thought , this is Multiplier Effect , the belief that an increase in spending leads itself to more spending and even more spending , in a feedback loop that in the end amounts grows the entire economy .
This bootstrap theory was popularized by John Maynard Keynes and became influential in some circles as a way to reduce underutilization in the economy .
In other words , if unemployment is high and industrial capacity is underused , then it is worth while to have the government make work for people or spend money .
Work , any work , will get the money flowing again .
This lead to the various “ alphabet agencies ” of F.D.R. ’s New Deal program .
Keynes , at his boldest , illustrated the magical properties of his multiplier effect like this :
If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes , bury them at suitable depths in disused coal mines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish , and leave it to private enterprise on well - tried principles of laissez - faire to dig the notes up again ( the right to do so being obtained , of course by tendering for leases of the note - bearing territory ) , there need be no more unemployment and with the help of the repercussions , the real income of the community , and its capital wealth also , would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is .
— from The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money
The most cogent criticism of the Magic Multiplier goes back 50 - years to Henry Hazlitt ’s , Economics in One Easy Lesson , where he tells the tale of “ The fallacy of the broken window ” .
It goes something like this :
Imagine the town baker ’s shop window is broken by an errant baseball throw .
A unfortunate expense to the baker , one might say .
But that is a narrow parochial view .
Look instead at the benefit to the whole community .
The window will cost $ 300 to replace .
That money will go to the glazier who will then use his profits to buy a new sofa from the furniture store , who will then use his profits to buy a new bicycle for his child from the toy store , and so on .
The money will continue to circulate in over - widening circles , bringing joy to all .
The original loss of $ 300 by the baker will more than be made up for by the aggregate increase in the amount of goods and services exchanged in the town .
Instead of punishing the little boy who broke the window , he should be raised up and praised as a Universal Benefactor and Economic Sage of the First Order .
The problem with that argument is it fails to look at the poor baker and what he might have done with the $ 300 if his window had not broken .
Maybe he would bought a new suit with that money .
The tailor then might have bought a new sofa with his profits , and so on .
The interconnectedness of the economy was not precipitated by the broken window .
It was always there .
The only thing that changed by the broken window is that the baker has no new suit , and the glazier has his money .
Since you can never see the suit that was never made , it is easy to forget that the benefits to the glazier did not come from nothing .
So back to the IDC report , and this forecast of $ 70 billion dollars in Vista - related spending .
The question to ask is , where is all this money coming from ?
And what might it have been used for if not spent on Vista - related purchases ?
Obviously this money was not created out of a vacuum .
Is it coming from profits ?
From shareholders ?
From deferring other investments ?
Cutting back on training ?
Moving more jobs off - shore ?
Reducing quality ?
What companies and sectors of the economy are going to suffer for this shift in investment ?
What innovations will not occur because people are allocating resources to this upgrade ?
In the end is $ 70 billion of new value really being produced ?
Or are we merely fixing broken Windows ?
Although mice , like most mammals , typically view the world with a limited color palette — similar to what some people with red - green color blindness see — scientists have now transformed their vision by introducing a single human gene into a mouse chromosome .
The human gene codes for a light sensor that mice do not normally possess , and its insertion allowed the mice to distinguish colors as never before .
In a study published in the March 23 , 2007 , issue of the journal Science , Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , together with researchers at the University of California at Santa Barbara , demonstrated in a series of cleverly designed color vision tests that the genetic modification allows mice to see and distinguish among a broader spectrum of light waves .
The experiments were designed to determine whether the brains of the genetically altered mice could efficiently process sensory information from the new photoreceptors in their eyes .
Among mammals , this more complex type of color vision has only been observed in primates , and therefore the brains of mice did not need to evolve to make these discriminations .
What we are looking at in these mice is the same evolutionary event that happened in one of the distant ancestors of all primates and that led ultimately to the trichromatic color vision that we now enjoy .
Jeremy Nathans
The new abilities of the genetically engineered mice indicate that the mammalian brain possesses a flexibility that permits a nearly instantaneous upgrade in the complexity of color vision , say the study 's senior authors , Gerald Jacobs and Jeremy Nathans .
The evolution of color vision has been a topic of intensive study for more than three decades .
The new research is the most definitive yet in shedding light on the first steps that led to the emergence of trichromacy -- the variety of color vision found today in most primates , including humans .
“ What we are looking at in these mice is the same evolutionary event that happened in one of the distant ancestors of all primates and that led ultimately to the trichromatic color vision that we now enjoy , ” said Nathans .
Trichromacy is dependent on three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina that preferentially absorb lights at different wavelengths .
These are known as cone cells and each type contains a particular kind of light - absorbing sensor protein .
Short - wavelength - sensitive ( S ) cone cells are most sensitive to blue lights , medium - wavelength - sensitive ( M ) cone cells are most sensitive to green lights , and long - wavelength - sensitive ( L ) cones are most sensitive to red lights .
When light strikes the retina and activates the cone cells , the brain compares the responses of the S , M , and L photoreceptors , and it is the brain 's assessment of their relative levels of activation that we perceive as color .
Most mammals , including mice , are dichromats , possessing only S and M cone pigments .
As a consequence , they can distinguish only a fraction of the wavelengths that can be distinguished by humans .
John Mollon at the University of Cambridge has suggested that the evolution of trichromacy could have permitted primates to discriminate between unripe fruit , which is typically green , and ripe red - and orange - colored fruits .
Reciprocally , the colors of ripened fruits may have coevolved with primate trichromacy , since animals that could recognize and eat the ripe fruit would have assisted plants by spreading their seeds .
Nathans , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher at Johns Hopkins , worked out the structure of the human S , M , and L pigments and the genetic basis of human color vision variation beginning in the 1980s .
At the same time , Jacobs , at UCSB , deciphered the distinctive genetic mechanism that gives rise to trichromatic color vision in New World ( South American ) primates .
Together , their work has suggested that the type of trichromatic color vision that New World monkeys possess may also be the evolutionary precursor to the form found among Old World ( African ) primates , including humans .
In the current study , the researchers set out to replicate what most scientists had considered the crucial step in the evolution of trichromactic color vision in primates : the introduction of the L receptor gene .
Their goal was to determine whether that gene alone could alter an animal 's sensory perception .
“ It 's been unclear , ” Jacobs explained , “ whether the simple addition of a photopigment is sufficient to yield a new dimension of color vision , or whether you might need , in addition , some changes in the nervous system . ”
In 2003 , Nathans and Jacobs , together with Markus Meister at Harvard University , reported their initial studies on genetically engineered mice carrying the L receptor gene in place of the M receptor gene .
Because these genes are carried on the X - chromosome , they are subject to a process known as X - chromosome inactivation .
In mammals , every cell in females has two X - chromosomes , while every cell in males has a single X - chromosome .
X - inactivation occurs only in females and results in the silencing of most of the genes on one of the X - chromosomes in each cell .
Because different cells choose to silence either one or the other of the X - chromosomes , female mice engineered to have one copy each of the M and L receptor genes express the M receptor in some cone cells and the L receptor in other cone cells .
These two different types of cones are intermingled with one another across the surface of the retina .
This X - inactivation - based mechanism for producing M and L receptors in different cone cells is the same as the one that Jacobs had identified earlier in New World primates .
For the current study , the team selected mice that possessed roughly equal ratios of M and L cone cells , and compared their vision to that of normal mice .
Jacobs ' group at UCSB developed behavioral tests to determine whether the female mice could discriminate among colored lights by comparing the relative activation of the M and L cone cells .
The researchers conducted tens of thousands of tests in which two different wavelengths or intensities of light were displayed on three test panels .
Mice received a drop of soymilk as a reward when they correctly identified which panel differed from the other two .
The genetically altered mice demonstrated their new visual ability by choosing the correct panel in 80 percent of the trials .
By contrast , normal mice only chose correctly one third of the time , the score that one would obtain by guessing randomly among the three panels .
According to the scientists , their findings have implications not just for the evolution of color vision , but for the evolution of sensory systems in general .
Previous experiments with the visual , olfactory ( smell ) , and gustatory ( taste ) systems have suggested that introducing a new sensory receptor can expand the range of an animal 's sensory perception , altering both its behavior and nerve activity , Jacobs noted that the new study is the first to demonstrate that these simple genetic changes can have even more profound effects .
“ By simply changing receptor proteins , not only can you extend the range of information that an animal might be able to sense , but if the nervous system has the plasticity we 've seen in these mice , you can extract a new dimension of experience , ” he explained .
“ Our observation that the mouse brain can use this information to make spectral discriminations implies that alterations in receptor genes might be of immediate selective value not only because they expand the range or types of stimuli that can be detected but also because they permit a plastic nervous system to discriminate between new and existing stimuli , ” the authors wrote in the Science paper .
“ Additional genetic changes that refine the downstream neural circuitry to more efficiently extract sensory information could then follow over many generations . ”
Iraq : Protests against US operations in Sadr City
By James Cogan
21 March 2007
Several thousand people protested last Friday following evening prayers in the first public expression of hostility toward the US military operations now taking place inside the densely - populated Shiite working class district of Sadr City in Baghdad .
Demonstrators chanted “ No occupation ” and “ No America ” as they marched in opposition to the announcement by American commanders that they were establishing their first permanent base inside Sadr City ’s limits , at an Iraqi police station .
The protest was called by Shiite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , whose political movement and armed wing , the Mahdi Army militia , have effectively controlled Sadr City since the US invasion four years ago .
The suburb — once officially known as “ Saddam City ” — was re-named in memory of Sadr ’s father , a leading Shiite cleric who was assassinated by Saddam Hussein ’s Baathist regime in 1999 .
In a statement published by Sadr ’s office in the southern city of Kufa , Sadr called on his supporters to “ raise your voices ... against your enemy ” .
He denied that he had agreed to the deployment of US troops into Sadr City , accusing the occupation forces of “ spreading false propaganda and rumours and claiming that there are negotiations and collaboration between you and them ” .
Since the start of regular US patrols inside Sadr City on March 4 , American officers have insisted they are doing so with the blessing of the Sadrist movement .
Every indication on the ground has suggested this to be the case .
The Mahdi Army , which has as many as 10,000 fighters in Baghdad , has disappeared from the streets and American troops have encountered no resistance .
BBC TV filmed unarmed Mahdi army militiamen this week collaborating closely with US and government troops and officials in Sadr City .
The top US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , has publicly stated that Sadr agreed to the deployment after discussions with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and that , in exchange , US forces agreed to conduct searches and raids in a “ respectable manner ” .
Petraeus ’s subordinate , Major General Joseph Fils , has declared Sadr ’s cooperation to be a “ factor in the way we ’ve been able to go into Sadr City this early , so quickly ” .
Sadr ’s latest statement reflects growing anger in Sadr City over the actions of American troops .
Within days of entering the district , US soldiers were accused of indiscriminately opening fire on a civilian car , killing a man and his two daughters and seriously wounding a young boy .
Dozens of alleged Mahdi Army fighters have been detained , driving the number reportedly arrested in the last six months to more than 700 .
With the Shiite militiamen ordered off the streets by Moqtada al - Sadr , suspected Sunni extremist suicide bombers have been able to infiltrate Sadr City and other Shiite districts and inflict horrifying carnage in markets and near mosques .
Last Friday , the Sadr City mayor , a close ally of Sadr , was nearly killed in an assassination attempt .
Bitterness over US operations and the heightened risks from Sunni extremists is compounded by disastrous living conditions produced by years of neglect under Hussein ’s regime and four years of US occupation .
An Associated Press correspondent reported on March 14 : “ An estimated 2.5 million people , nearly all of them Shiites , live in the northeastern Baghdad community .
Many of them lack running water and proper sewerage .
Hundreds of thousands have no jobs and subsist on government food rations , a holdover from the international sanctions of the Saddam Hussein era .
Streets in some parts of Sadr City run black with sludge .
Damaged power lines provide at best only four hours of electricity a day ...
During a patrol last week , American troops brushed flies from their faces as they drove through rotting heaps of refuse and excrement piled outside houses .
One soldier opened the door to his Humvee and vomited ... ”
The Sadrist movement has its social base among the Shiite oppressed but represents the interests of members of the Shiite clerical and propertied elite who have sought to enhance their social position under the US occupation .
As a result , Sadr and other leaders have been involved in a delicate balancing act — at times voicing the anti-occupation sentiments of the masses , while increasingly forming a key prop for the Shiite - dominated US puppet government in Baghdad .
In 2003 , Sadr and his backers quickly established control over Sadr City and sought to challenge openly pro-occupation Shiite clerics and parties , such as the Iranian - linked Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) , for control over the Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala and the lucrative revenues generated from Shiite pilgrims .
By late March 2004 , the US officials , concerned over Sadr ’s anti-occupation agitation and the growth of the Mahdi Army , imposed a crackdown .
Paul Bremer , the US pro-consul in Iraq , ordered the shutting of the Sadrist newspaper and the arrest of Sadr on charges of murdering a rival cleric , Abdul Majeed al - Khoei .
In retaliation , the young cleric called on his supporters to take up arms against the US military .
For the next four months , Shiite militiamen fought American forces in Baghdad , Najaf , Karbala and across southern Iraq until a ceasefire was struck .
In return for calling off the fighting , the Sadrists were granted a political role .
In the December 2005 elections , they joined the United Iraqi Alliance with SCIRI and other Shiite fundamentalist parties , and assisted in winning the largest bloc of seats in the parliament .
Sadr ’s supporters within the Shiite alliance provided the key votes to install Maliki as prime minister , against a candidate nominated by SCIRI and favoured by the US .
In return , they were given five ministries in Maliki ’s cabinet .
Sadr ’s verbal opposition to the presence of US forces in Iraq has never fully ceased .
But as part of the Maliki government , the Sadrists have played a pivotal role in directing the anger among Shiites over their economic and social problems into a sectarian conflict against Sunni Muslims , who formed the main support base for the former Baathist regime .
While avoiding clashes with the occupation forces , the Mahdi Army has been blamed for many of the death squads that are terrorising Sunni communities in Baghdad and other cities .
The US has remained hostile to Sadr and his movement , however .
While the American military has been preoccupied in dealing with the mainly Sunni - based insurgents , it has never accepted the continued existence of a substantial Shiite militia that has operated as a law unto itself in Sadr City .
Moreover , despite the presence of his supporters in the Maliki cabinet , Sadr is still something of a loose cannon , as far as the US is concerned , susceptible to pressure from the impoverished Shiite masses .
Calls for action against the Mahdi Army have intensified as US strategists have turned their attention to planning a confrontation with the Shiite theocratic regime in Iran .
In the event of a war , the US military is concerned that Sadr ’s militia could become a danger , rousing opposition among the Shiite masses and attacking US forces inside Iraq .
The Sadrist movement apparently calculated that the best tactic for preserving its forces was to offer no resistance to US operations inside Sadr City .
But the actions of the American military , which appear to be targetting the command structure of the Mahdi Army , are generating tension within the ranks of the Shiite militia .
There is already speculation that disgruntled Mahdi Army fighters were responsible for the attempt to kill the Sadr City mayor in revenge for his collaboration with the occupation forces .
The US military is clearly anticipating a major escalation of violence over the coming weeks .
Some 2,200 additional US military police are being rushed to Iraq to cope with the thousands of new detainees that General Petraeus expects to be dealing with .
The top Sadrist leadership may be directly targeted .
Amid the protest over the US operation in Sadr City , the widow of the Abdul Majeed al - Khoei has again accused Sadr of personally ordering her husband ’s killing in 2003 .
She told the Iraqi newspaper Azzaman on March 16 : “ The Iraqi government and US troops would like to overlook the case and have been postponing it indefinitely , saying that Iraq ’s current condition does not warrant a trial . ”
The revival of these allegations suggests that the issue of arresting Sadr over the murder is being actively discussed in Iraqi and US circles in Baghdad as a possible pretext for provoking a bloody showdown with his Mahdi Army .

I do n’t understand either .
# 2 is an actual physical auto parts store for sale for $ 750,000 .
Industrial and Scientific : a 3 - Axis CNC Milling Machine for $ 22,195 .
From the photo I see that this is the thing you strap Bond to when you expect him to die .
Tools and Hardware :
The number 9 , for $ 254,623 .
So far I ’ve been leaving out things that were mis-entered but that one was too weird not to share .
The most expensive correctly - entered thing in this category is a $ 81,890 Thawzall construction site heater , although there ’s also a notable $ 60,000 chandelier .
Gourmet Food : 4 lbs Russian Beluga Caviar for $ 10,560 .
I was expecting something even more ridiculous , but ok .
Grocery : Skin cream for $ 340 , but that ’s boring .
How about 25 lbs of Altoids for $ 337 ?
22 lbs of chocolate powder for $ 313 ?
( Gourmet Food and Grocery ?
Classist !)
Pet Supplies : Giant parrot cage for $ 3886.61 .
The cage is big .
Standard parrots .
Bed and Bath : Egyptian cotton eiderdown comforter , $ 9435.99 .
Fresh Flowers and Plants : 12 months of roses for $ 495 .
I think they ’d get old fast .
Furniture & Décor : “ Goddard replica “ , $ 9,999,999 .
I ’m not sure what it ’s a replica of , but I ’m betting it ’s not the entire space research complex .
If that seems a bit too much , then there ’s a $ 999,999 space rock paperweight .
Incidentally Amazon themselves put the accent on the “ e ” in “ Décor ” .
( Right now I ’m going “ Holy cow , why did I start this ?
And why am I continuing ? ”
But continue I do , for you , the reader . )
Home and Garden : Like a crazy top - ten list , this gets us the Goddard replica , the space rock paperweight , and the number 9 !
Other than those , there ’s a $ 99,999 solar cell and an $ 85,000 antique 1840s Russian glass paperweight .
Outdoor Living : 10 ×18 Log Wedding Chapel with Wooden Roof , $ 20,319.97 .
Now this is the kind of ridiculous - but - not - impossible thing I wanted to find on a list of Amazon ’s most expensive things .
But a wedding chapel really ought to cost twenty grand , right ?
So there ’s also a $ 14,662 barbecue grill that you could use beside your $ 13,997 tiki hut .
Apparel : Space suit , $ 999,999 .
I think they ’re pulling my leg , though , so skipping over the jewelry that is in the wrong category , we have a $ 40,000 fur coat from WEBFURS .
You know , if you ’d asked me what WEBFURS was , I would n’t have guessed “ fur coat company ” .
Jewelry and Watches :
This category got things started on IRC !
# 1 is a 7.12 carat diamond for $ 495,830 .
But that ’s only potential jewelry , so there ’s also a $ 225,000 Cartier tank watch with diamond band .
Would you believe that the movement on that Cartier is quartz ?
Shoes : Dolce and Gabbana boots , $ 1,596 .
That was disappointing .
Beauty : a Nicole Chignon Swarovski hairbun holder for $ 1700 which is clearly not a beauty product .
# 2 is a limited - edition 15 ml bottle of Lalique Deux Coeurs perfume for $ 1600 .
Health and Personal Care : 24 - station home fitness centre , $ 39,999 .
Kids and Baby : Grim Reaper on Skeleton Horseback Lifesize Prop , $ 2,995 .
In case your kids were turning out too well - adjusted .
Baby ( which is apparently subtly different from “ Kids and Baby ” ) : Kensington traditional pram , $ 2,995 .
Boy , tough call between that and the grim reaper .
Exercise and Fitness : The same fitness centre as in Health and Personal Care .
A bit down the list is a $ 25,187 jacuzzi spa with built - in flat panel TV .
Sporting Goods : Football arcade game , with real football - throwing , for $ 88,550 .
# 2 is an extremely dorky golf cart for $ 77,988 .
Thank God , it ’s done .
That was a lot of work with remarkably few lols .
Ah , well , now you know not to try it yourselves !

How frightened would you be if you were secretly planning to get pregnant , without telling your husband , and discovered that someone had written to him telling him about it ?
Or , put the other way , how would you feel if you discovered your wife was pregnant only when someone dropped you a letter ?
And who would that person be ?
It would have to be someone like Robbie " Cracker " Coltrane , right ?
A deep profiler with the power of a hypnotist ...?
Or it would have to be a Government spook .
They could do it , surely , the way the world 's spooks monitor all of us : easy .
They tap our phones , right ?
Well , the thing to remember is that it really did happen .
And no , if you thought it was phone tapping , you 're wrong , and it's a misunderstanding which I wo n't make any friends for clearing up .
But you need to understand the basic principles of data mining to understand why the world of spooks and the world of search engines are about to overlap , and why you should be nervous about this .
The lesson here is one I call " The Sainsbury 's Lesson " when doing presentations for technical audiences , because I was taught this by a data miner who worked for the giant British supermarket of that name .
The story , summarised , is that Sainsbury 's was spending an absurd amount of money sending people promotional coupons , money - off special offers , and other junk mail to encourage them to swing by the Sainsbury 's supermarket next time , rather than Waitrose or Safeway or Asda - and it was pretty hard to be sure it was actually doing any good .
The trouble was simple : they were sending girly shampoo promotions to households with six rugby - playing male students , or home improvement promotions to households with one elderly pensioner with osteoporosis , or bulk beer deals to households where they were all strictly teetotal .
Not profitable stuff .
And their IT staff heard about this and said : " But you do n't have to do that ! "
This goes back a bit before the days of Nectar , when Sainsbury 's had its own loyalty card , plus it sold fuel out of its own petrol stations and ran a bank and a credit card .
And the IT people said : " If you know what sort of things someone buys you can make a pretty good guess about what they may want to buy next . "
The beauty of the system was that data mining requires no intellectual engagement .
The Sainsbury 's Lesson could be called the Amazon Lesson , or the Tivo Lesson for that matter .
All you do is look for patterns .
The more frequently you find a pattern , the better it is to guide you .
Take a commuter travelling from London to Reading .
They can get into a car and drive .
They can get into a taxi and be driven .
They can take a bus .
But most will get onto a train , with a choice of catching the Great Western service from Paddington , or the slower SouthWest service from Waterloo .
If you want to catch them before they get to Reading , you are n't going to do it by chance .
But suppose you get information that says that they have passed through , Ascot , Sunningdale , Virginia Water , and Egham ?
If you know the route , you know that the next station , going west , will be Staines .
Now , it 's perfectly possible that they are n't going to be at Staines next .
They might get off the train at Egham , take a cab to the station beyond Staines , and rejoin the train there ... but seriously , what are the chances of that ?
Steve Yegge posts an article about this that , the other thing , and statically typed functional programming languages .
In it , he compares Haskell to something you can :
" build beautiful , lithe marionettes with "
Unfortunately , I have n’t had the time or inclination to learn Haskell ( yet ) , but I have used Erlang professionally , so I do have a bit of experience using a functional programming language .
What comes to my mind is n’t marionettes , but clockwork .
That ’s a purposefully neutral word , in case you were wondering .
An enthusiast might say “ a finely crafted swiss watch ” , and a detractor might grumble “ a windup toy ” .
In my mind ’s eye , the concept is that in functional languages you get this succession of things happening one after the other that happen precisely the same way , if the program is wound up just the same each time .
To paraphrase :
Do this with the result of this with what this produces when given this input that is derived from this function which takes the result of this other thing after calculating the result of something that is derived from the output of a function that ...
And so on and so forth…tick , tock , tick , tock .
While I can appreciate that in some ways , this is likely to produce clean programming , in other ways I am less convinced of its practicality .
If you ’ll bear with a poor comparison , sometimes programming is like a song .
You do the tricky section , then you go back to an easier section and catch your breath for a bit .
That seems to work out in a language like Ruby or Java fairly well , depending on how densely you like your code .
You get sections with DoThisAndThisAndThatWithTheResultsOfSelectThisFromTableXYZ
that you have to slow down to think through .
And then :
You assign the result to a variable .
Which gives you a few lines to slow down consider where the program is
And then
GoToTheNextTrickyBit where ManyThingsHappen .
All in all , you wind up with a sort of ebb and flow that works out pretty well if you ’re in tune with the code being written , going from intense calculations , to a line or two where you do no more than store things in a variable , take a breather , and prepare for the next important stanza .
In my limited experience , I have to say that I did n’t always get that sensation from Erlang ( which in some ways is apparently less “ hair shirt ” oriented than Haskell ) .
You always had to be writing something with an eye to where it was coming from , and where it was going .
Without a doubt , this produces code that is more compact in terms of meaning and functionality , but at times it leaves a guy like me , who grew up with Basic , C , Python , and so on with the desire to say “ woah there , nelly ” , let ’s take a breather and sort things out a bit in a few variables before moving on to the next bit of fancy code gymnastics .
What I ’m curious about is what will catch on from academically oriented programming languages like Haskell .
The people working on them are without doubt very smart , and there are some interesting concepts being bandied about ( pattern matching is pretty cool , just to cite one ) .
But academia does n’t always produce things that catch on with the average Joe programmer , either , and while the more elitist out there may attribute this to simplistic reasoning such as ‘ well then Joe is just stupid ’ , I think that the more thoughtful language crafters will attempt to ascertain what works , and what does n’t , and perhaps we will see the Ruby of functional languages emerge from Haskell , the Smalltalk of functional languages .
What do you think ?
Circumcision may provide even more protection against AIDS than was realized when two clinical trials in Africa were stopped two months ago because the results were so clear , according to studies being published today .
The trials , in Kenya and Uganda , were stopped early by the National Institutes of Health , which was paying for them , because it was apparent that circumcision reduced a man ’s risk of contracting AIDS from heterosexual sex by about half .
It would have been unethical to continue without offering circumcision to all 8,000 men in the trials , federal health officials said .
That decision , announced on Dec. 13 , made headlines around the world and led the two largest funds for fighting AIDS to say they would consider paying for circumcisions in high - risk countries .
But the final data from the trials , to be published today in the British medical journal The Lancet , suggest that circumcision reduces a man ’s risk by as much as 65 percent .
The December announcement described only the follow - up on the men as originally divided into two groups : those who agreed to be circumcised and those who agreed not to .
But some in the first group never went to the circumcision clinic , and some in the second had private circumcisions before the study ended .
Transcript : Bin Laden determined to strike in US
The following is a transcript of the August 6 , 2001 , presidential daily briefing entitled Bin Laden determined to strike in US .
Parts of the original document were not made public by the White House for security reasons .
Clandestine , foreign government , and media reports indicate bin Laden since 1997 has wanted to conduct terrorist attacks in the US .
Bin Laden implied in U.S. television interviews in 1997 and 1998 that his followers would follow the example of World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and " bring the fighting to America . "
After U.S. missile strikes on his base in Afghanistan in 1998 , bin Laden told followers he wanted to retaliate in Washington , according to a -- -- service .
An Egyptian Islamic Jihad ( EIJ ) operative told - - service at the same time that bin Laden was planning to exploit the operative 's access to the U.S. to mount a terrorist strike .
The millennium plotting in Canada in 1999 may have been part of bin Laden 's first serious attempt to implement a terrorist strike in the U.S .
Convicted plotter Ahmed Ressam has told the FBI that he conceived the idea to attack Los Angeles International Airport himself , but that in ---, Laden lieutenant Abu Zubaydah encouraged him and helped facilitate the operation .
Ressam also said that in 1998 Abu Zubaydah was planning his own U.S. attack .
Ressam says bin Laden was aware of the Los Angeles operation .
Although Bin Laden has not succeeded , his attacks against the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 demonstrate that he prepares operations years in advance and is not deterred by setbacks .
Bin Laden associates surveyed our embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam as early as 1993 , and some members of the Nairobi cell planning the bombings were arrested and deported in 1997 .
Al Qaeda members -- including some who are U.S. citizens -- have resided in or traveled to the U.S. for years , and the group apparently maintains a support structure that could aid attacks .
Two al - Qaeda members found guilty in the conspiracy to bomb our embassies in East Africa were U.S. citizens , and a senior EIJ member lived in California in the mid-1990s .
A clandestine source said in 1998 that a bin Laden cell in New York was recruiting Muslim - American youth for attacks .
We have not been able to corroborate some of the more sensational threat reporting , such as that from a ---- service in 1998 saying that Bin Laden wanted to hijack a U.S. aircraft to gain the release of " Blind Sheikh " Omar Abdel Rahman and other U.S. - held extremists .
Nevertheless , FBI information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks , including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York .
The FBI is conducting approximately 70 full - field investigations throughout the U.S. that it considers bin Laden - related .
CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group or bin Laden supporters was in the U.S. planning attacks with explosives .
GOP Rep. warns
Bush if border patrol agents die in prison ' there 's going to be some kind of impeachment talk '
RAW STORY
Published : Thursday February 8 , 2007 Print
This Email This Several Republican lawmakers have sharply criticized the imprisonment of two border agents who were convicted of shooting a Mexican drug smuggler in the back and attempting to cover it up .
Appeals to President Bush to pardon the two men , Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean , have increased since one was assaulted by fellow inmates in a federal prison last weekend .
Yesterday , two Repulican Congressmen had strong words to say about Bush , with one even threatening impeachment .
" Reps. Walter Jones , R - N.C. , and Dana Rohrabacher , R - Calif. , blasted President Bush for not intervening in the case , with Rohrabacher hinting that he would consider pressing for impeachment if either of the two agents was killed in prison , " Dave Montgomery reports for McClatchy Newspapers .
" Now , I tell you , Mr. President , if these men -- especially after this assault -- are murdered in prison , or if one of them lose their lives , there 's going to be some kind of impeachment talk in Capitol Hill , " Rohrabacher said .
McClatchy quotes Jones as saying that " the president has lost my respect because he will not step forward and do what 's right . "
Montgomery notes that this " case has become a cause celebre among conservative groups , which contend that Ramos and Compean were railroaded by overzealous federal prosecutors who gave the drug smuggler immunity to testify against the two agents . "
According to the conservative Cybercast News Service , Rohrabacher slammed Bush for his " arrogance . "
" The president of the United States talks a lot about his Christian charity , and his religious beliefs , " Rohrabacher said .
" He now is showing a mean - spirited side to him , an arrogance , in which he will turn his back . "

Via Volokh :
Richard Branson is offering a $ 25 million prize for the development of a technology capable of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
I Win !
OK , I get that he is actually looking for some solar - powered device that plates out carbon from the air on a cathode , or whatever .
Or maybe a big nuclear - powered Air Products plant pumping liquid CO2 down an old oil well .
By the way , I wonder if it will occur to anyone that if you really want to offset carbon , you probably need to clear cut old growth forests , bury the logs , and plant new trees .
I would guess that a newly growing forest absorbs a lot more CO2 than old - growth redwoods ( anyone know ? )
And no , I am not really suggesting it .
I got in enough email hot water a year ago when I suggested that if global warming was really to become a problem , we could reverse it pretty quickly with about 30 man-made Krakatoa 's , made from the creative use of some of those H - bombs still lying around .
Maybe we could even use them to dig a new canal across Nicaragua , killing two birds with one stone .
Anyway , I like Branson 's idea .
This kind of price approach has yielded some interesting results in other fields .

" After profit taking by Haliburton and Carlysle , this is the standard issue for our troops in Iraq . "
At least he makes about 90 of them disappear from his audience .
Although not before one follower of Christ pours water all over his notes .
Last night ’s performance of INVINCIBLE SUMMER was disrupted when eighty seven members of a Christian group walked out of the show en masse , and chose to physically attack my work by pouring water on and destroying the original of the show outline .
I ’m still dealing with all the ramifications , but here ’s what it felt like from my end : I am performing the show to a packed house , when suddenly the lights start coming up in the house as a flood of people start walking down the aisles–they looked like a flock of birds who ’d been startled , the way they all moved so quickly , and at the same moment … it was shocking , to see them surging down the aisles .
The show halted as they fled , and at this moment a member of their group strode up to the table , stood looking down on me and poured water all over the outline , drenching everything in a kind of anti-baptism .
Playbill.com also has a rundown on what happened :
It was during a portion of the show in which he was speaking about Paris Hilton that the audience walk - out occurred .
Daisey said that based on comments group members made to the front - of - house staff , it was the profanity used in his monologue that caused the uprising .
“ A number of them , ” Daisey said , “ expressed that they were disgusted by ‘ this filth . ’ . . .
I ’m very good at sensing houses â€ ” it ’s my job .
The audience was unified and warm up to that moment .
My suspicion is because they were there together as a group , they were compelled to leave as a group .
When a group is together , it does n’t take that many people to make [ everyone ] act unreasonably . ”
Daisey does say that a few members of the group apologized for their behavior as they were leaving the theatre .
Update :
Mike Daisey tracks down and talks to the man who poured water onto his work :
His name is David .
At the beginning of the conversation there was a lot of silence–long , long silences that neither of us were willing to puncture .
First I made him understand what he had done –that these were the only set of notes for the show , how I work with them , what he had cost me in terms of my physical work and in terms of what it had been like that next night to go out in front of them .
I needed him to understand what he had taken from me .
He quietly said that he had heard me , and that he understood .
I gradually opened him up by listening , and responding , the one - on - one version of what I do with an audience .
We talked about many things , for almost an hour , and step by step , his story emerged .
He has three kids–one is 21 , and two are 17 – and he ’s terrified of the world .
Terrified by violence , and sex , and he sees it all linked together–a horrifying world filled with darkness , pornography and filth that threatens his children , has threatened them all his life .
They ’re older now , but he says he still sees things the same way–and that the only way to protect his children and himself is to lock it all out of his life .
He also said he ’s had anger - control issues for years , and sometimes acts of rage come over him–he explodes , and then has to apologize , and does n’t know why it happens .
He tries to lock it down , but it happens , and he ’s ashamed of it .
I told him that regardless of where we both stand , I felt very strongly that the repression of walling off everything in the world and viewing it all as filth is connecting with these outbursts , and that it is n’t going to work–until you deal with the root causes , and deal with the world , his anger and rage would keep using him .
And he forgives him :
And then I forgive him .
He is very quiet–he is obviously shocked .
And I tell him , “ I want you to remember that a liberal atheist has forgiven you today .
I do n’t want you to ever forget that , as long as you live , do not forget what happened here .
I do n’t have God behind me , but I speak for myself , and I forgive you for myself , and for you .
Never forget this . ”

Will a people ’s collective be able to beat Google at the search game ?
That ’s the proverbial $ 64,000 question , and venture investors are trying to answer that by funding start - ups such as Wink , that plans to go live perhaps as soon as Thursday , according to Silicon Valley sources .
The company has been in a limited beta since October , and today conducted a major update to its infrastructure and interface , according to their blog .
Wink is a search engine that integrates tag results from multiple sources such as del.icio.us , Digg , Yahoo MyWeb ( and we ’re adding more ) .
As more services incorporate tags and user input , new pages are added to the Wink index and ranked using our TagRank technology to deliver the best results .
Wink is backed by some serious heavy weights : Scott Kurnit of About.com ; Ron Conway ; Reid Hoffman , Marc Andressen along with Venky Harinarayan ( of Cambrian ventures ) and David Sze ( of Greylock ) .
Wink is not alone in taking on Google .
Of course , there are others like Activeweave , Jookster , Kaboodle , and Rollyo which are taking “ human cycles ” and trying to come - up with better results than Google .
Yahoo ’s MyWeb effort , so eloquently detailed by Erick Schonfeld in Business 2.0 , and its recent acquisition of Del.icio.us are part of this “ people versus Google ” movement .
I am not so optimistic about this trend , because I have not seen the mainstreams get interested in the bookmarking and tagging as yet .
Believers can take comfort in the fact , that it is early days , but I am not so sure .
I think it needs a behavioral change on part of “ searchers ” who have become accustomed to simply typing their queries and then trying to figure out where to go .
Sort of like bad cell phone coverage : we go used to it .
Of course , conspiracy theorist like me often wonders , what if search not only became good , but great and accurate .
A lot of “ spare page views ” generated by hit - and - miss model of today can drastically reduce page views , and advertising opportunities .
Of course that would be horrible for Google … .
Back to Wink … .
I am going to test out their offering once they go live , and update the post .
You can of course contribute your thoughts .
While the rest of the world is getting heavier , Hollywood ’s elite are downing horse steroids and Adderall in an endless race to be ever - thinner .
It ’s not surprising , then , that designers are now offering “ sub - zero ” sizing for the waif that needs to take in her size zero jeans .
While this may seem disturbing , designers claim that sizes are arbitrary anyway , and that almost no one is following guidelines for the waist and hip measurements for sizing .
Indeed , a size 6 of today was once a 14 of yesterday .
The average US woman is 5 feet 4 and weighs 155 pounds , which is 20 pounds heavier than 40 years ago .
designer Nicole Miller will introduce something tentatively called the “ subzero ” for women with 23 ½ - inch waists and 35 - inch hips .
And this spring , Banana Republic began offering an equally tiny “ 00 ″ on its Web site .
If you remember the days before there was a size zero , you might have to brace yourself for some unsettling fashion news : there is now a size smaller than nil .
A negative size if you will .
Next fall ,
If you ’re having trouble picturing a minus - size woman , think of the waifish Spice Girl turned soccer wife Victoria Beckham who is reputed to be small enough to fit into a subzero .
One newspaper compared her waist to the circumference of a soccer ball , but it might be even tinier than that — 23 1/2 inches is closer to the size of the smaller soccer balls recommended for kids .
But mini-celebs aside , does the debut of the less - than - zeros mean that a sliver of America is shrinking while the rest of our obesity - challenged country grows in girth and clothing size ?
Yes and no .
American women are definitely getting bigger as a group .
The average woman is about 155 pounds and 5 foot 4 according to SizeUSA , a 2003 survey by the industry research group .
That ’s about 20 pounds heavier than the average woman of 40 years ago .
But do n’t assume that the contemporary woman is wearing a bigger size than her grandmother might have .
“ According to standard size measurements , that average 155 pound woman should be wearing a size 16 , but thanks to vanity - sizing , she ’s probably buying a size 10 or 12 , ” says Jim Lovejoy , the industry director for the SizeUSA survey .
“ Most companies are n’t using the standard ASTM [ American Society for Testing and Materials ] sizes any more .
Sizes have been creeping up a half inch at a time so that women can fit into smaller sizes and feel good about it . ”
Think of vanity - sizing as self - delusion on a mass scale .
Anyone over the age of 40 knows that something is n’t quite right if she can wear a smaller size now than she wore 20 years and 10 pounds ago .
Yet many of us slip gratefully into a size 6 pair of Old Navy jeans even though we ’re pretty sure we would n’t be able to squeeze into our size 10 Calvin Kleins from circa 1980 .
Call it faith - based sizing .
We want to believe — hell , we really do believe — we ’re a size 6 or 8 because the label says so even when the scale disagrees .
[ Thanks to Fark for linking this ]
There is the worry that a double - 0 or sub - zero size will become the new benchmark for anorexic pride .
Nicole Miller is justifying the new sizing , saying that there ’s a call for it in Asia , where women are generally smaller .
A zero of today may be a four of yesterday .

Consumer societies : Good for business or bad for the planet ?
A study by the New Economics Foundation ( Nef ) and the Open University says 16 April is the day when the nation goes into " ecological debt " this year .
It warns if annual global consumption levels matched the UK's , it would take 3.1 Earths to meet the demand .
But bio- geography professor Philip Stott criticised the " doomsday report " , arguing it would hit poorer nations .
" What we tend to have - not just with this report but alternative reports on the other side - are two theological positions , " said Prof Stott , of London University .
" This one is the kind of Doomsday report - on the other hand the total free - traders are far too optimistic . "
He went on : " If we did follow this report for example the damage to the Third World would be very great indeed because of course trade is the main dynamo of growth . "
In 1961 , the symbolic " ecological debt day " was 9 July ; in 1981 , it had shifted forward two months to 14 May .
The authors of the UK Interdependence Report hope to highlight the need to curb rising consumption levels .
' Eyes bigger than planet '
Nef policy director Andrew Simms says this year 's debt day shows that the UK 's growing demand for goods and services is having an impact on the rest of the world .
UK'S GROWING ECO -FOOTPRINT
In 1961 , the Earth could have supported everyone having a UK lifestyle
It would take 3.1 planets to support the current UK lifestyle
" The problem is that we want to have our planet and eat it and not think about the consequences , " Mr Simms said .
The findings are based on the concept of " ecological footprints " , a system of measuring how much land and water a human population needs to produce the resources it consumes and absorb the resulting waste .
The report , produced by Nef and the Open University 's geography department , uses a number of examples that it says illustrate how resources are being wasted , including :
In 2004 , the UK exported 1,500 tonnes of fresh potatoes to Germany , and imported 1,500 tonnes of the same product from the same country
Imported 465 tonnes of gingerbread , but exported 460 tonnes of the same produce
Sent 10,200 tonnes of milk and cream to France , yet imported 9,900 tonnes of the dairy goods from France
The authors say this shows how current trade systems are inefficient at a time when there is concern over energy supplies and greenhouse gas emissions .
" If you do not have the right signals within the economy to tell you when you are doing something very environmentally wasteful , then you cannot expect it to stop , " says Mr Simms , the report 's lead author .
" Lifestyles in Britain are becoming increasingly unsustainable and are placing an ever larger burden on the global environmental system . "
The UK's food self - sufficiency has been falling steadily for more than a decade , and indigenous food production is now said to be at its lowest level for half a century .
In 2004 , the UK lost its energy independent status when it became a net importer of gas following lower returns from the North Sea fields .
At a global level , the world is also living beyond ecosystems ' ability to supply the resources and absorb the demands being placed upon them .
This year 's ecological debt day for the world is 23 October .
In the future , it is expected to be even earlier as emerging economies , such as China and India , demand more resources to meet changing lifestyles .
" The earlier it creeps in the year , the more you are permanently running down the Earth 's environmental capital .
" The problem is that we are not clever enough to know at what point we will see a crash within eco-systems , " Mr Simms told the BBC News website .
" While you are not living within the planet 's limits and are eroding ecosystems , and the earlier the ecological day falls in the year , the greater the risk of a system crash . "
Mr Simms said developed nations had a responsibility to share their experience and knowledge with developing nations in order to limit the impact on the environment .
However , he added , despite the sharp rise in economic growth in the emerging economies , their consumption levels were still far behind developed nations .
Give and take
Steve Bettison , from the free - market think tank , Adam Smith Institute , described the report as " an interesting concept " but questioned its findings on market inefficiencies .
Potato exports to Germany equal what Germany sends to the UK
Mr Bettison said market forces were the best way to control consumption of the world 's finite resources : " The usual ' supply and demand ' economics will govern where these resources are used .
" This would also drive human ingenuity as people strive to develop new ideas to take up where previous resource supplies have waned , " he told the BBC News website .
" Whilst we take , we also give - something that seems to have been forgotten . "
Andrew Simms said the report was not calling for the UK 's borders to be closed because there were many benefits , both economic and cultural , to be gained from closer ties with other nations .
The report builds on previous studies that have used " ecological footprint " measurements , such as the WWF 's " one planet living " campaign .
It also echoes last year 's Millennium Ecosystem Assessment , the most comprehensive survey ever into the state of the planet .
It concluded that human activities threatened the Earth 's ability to sustain future generations .
Nef and the Open University hope the " ecological debt day " will be used as an annual yardstick to measure the health of the planet .
US troops are building the wall at night under tight security
Mr Maliki said there were other ways to protect the Adhamiya neighbourhood , which is surrounded by Shia districts .
The US military , which is behind the project , has said the purpose of the wall is to prevent violence between Sunni and Shia militants .
But Iraqi politicians have warned it will increase sectarian tensions .
Unintended consequences
Speaking in Cairo after meeting Arab league officials , Mr Maliki said : " I asked yesterday that it be stopped and that alternatives be found to protect the area . "
The prime minister said he feared the wall may have unintended consequences , in an apparent parallel to the former Berlin Wall that divided the German capital .
" I fear this wall might have repercussions which remind us of other walls , which we reject , " he said .
Construction of the 5 km ( 3 - mile ) concrete wall began on 10 April and the US military says it hopes to complete the project by the end of the month .
US troops , protected by heavily - armed vehicles , have been working at night to build the 3.6 m ( 12ft ) wall .
Earlier this week , senior Sunni politician Adnan al - Dulaimi , who heads the largest Sunni bloc in parliament , said the barrier would breed yet more sectarian strife .
Residents also said the wall would do little to improve bitter relations between the communities .
US and Iraqi troops have long built cement barriers around key locations in Baghdad and other cities to prevent attacks , especially suicide car bombings .
Iraq has been in the grip of raging sectarian violence since the bombing of an important Shia shrine in Samarra in February 2006 .
US forces in Iraq have said they would respond to issues surrounding the barrier on Monday .
Oxygen is the quintessential two - edged sword of molecular biology : essential for ( animal ) life , but at the same time a perennial source of damage to macromolecules .
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , arising from both external sources and the intrinsic metabolic machinery of the cell itself , have been implicated in many aspects of cellular aging .
Of particular interest to human beings , especially those living in the rapidly aging post - industrial Western nations , is the relationship between oxidative damage and neurodegenerative illness .
While most of the age - related neurodegenerative diseases are caused by accumulation of protein aggregates , it is becoming evident that ROS play an important role in exacerbating the underlying pathologies : e.g. , DNA oxidation arises early in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer ’s disease ; and oxidative damage to a key anti-oxidant defense protein may generate a pernicious positive - feedback loop in the initiating events of Parkinson ’s disease .
It is straightforward to imagine how such damage could accumulate in nondividing cells like neurons , which neither synthesize new DNA nor dilute out damaged proteins by cell division .
I usually think of oxidative damage as occurring after macromolecules are initially made — moreover , made in a pristine , undamaged form .
Reading between the lines of a recent paper on Parkinson ’s disease , however , I found myself questioning this implicit model , and wondering whether sometimes the relevant damage might be present even before synthesis begins .
The paper , by Nakabeppu et al. , describes a mouse knockout of MTH1 , a gene involved in defense against oxidation of DNA .
The MTH1 protein identifies a specific oxidatively damaged nucleotide triphosphate ( 8 - oxo - dGTP ) and takes it out of commission before it can be incorporated into DNA .
The authors find that mice lacking MTH1 show a dramatic increase in oxidative DNA damage ( specifically , of the type that MTH1 prevents ) as well as increased cell death in response to oxidative stress .
They argue that their model provides further evidence that oxidative damage to DNA plays a significant role in the onset of Parkinson ’s disease .
Oxidative DNA lesions , such as 8 - oxoguanine ( 8 - oxoG ) , accumulate in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes during aging , and such accumulation can increase dramatically in patients with Parkinson ’s disease ( PD ) .
To counteract oxidative damage to nucleic acids , human and rodents are equipped with three distinct enzymes .
One of these , MTH1 , hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates … to their monophosphate forms . …
We have shown a significant increase in 8 - oxoG in mitochondrial DNA as well as an elevated expression of MTH1 … in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons of PD patients , suggesting that the buildup of these lesions may cause dopamine neuron loss .
We established MTH1 - null mice and found that MTH1 - null fibroblasts were highly susceptible to cell death caused by H 2 O 2 … and that this was accompanied by an ongoing accumulation of 8 - oxoG in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA .
We also showed that MTH1 - null mice exhibited an increased accumulation of 8 - oxoG in striatal mitochondrial DNA , followed by more extreme neuronal dysfunction after 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1,2,3,6 - tetrahydropyridine administration than that of wild - type mice . …
So far so good : a simple story in which a mutant with diminished antioxidant defenses is more sensitive to oxidative stress , and exhibits an acceleration in the sort of DNA damage that is present in ( and possibly causative of ) Parkinson’s .
But there ’s an intriguing complication , and it blew me away once I thought about it .
Remember , MTH1 is involved in eliminating oxidized dNTPs before they can be incorporated into DNA .
So in order for MTH1 to play a direct role in limiting oxidative damage to DNA , it must be the case that oxidized dNTPs are being actively incorporated into DNA — in other words , DNA can be synthesized in a damaged form .
Another corollary to these findings is that neurons ( which do n’t divide ) are constantly turning over their DNA , at least rapidly enough for 8 - oxo - dGTP to be incorporated at a significant rate — n.b. the result of the hydrogen peroxide experiment , which resulted in higher levels of 8 - oxoG in the nuclear DNA of mice that lacked MTH1 .
If all MTH1 is doing is clearing 8 - oxo - dGTP before it ’s incorporated into DNA , then it must be the case that the neurons are synthesizing nuclear DNA .
Perhaps the synthesis occurs constantly , and perhaps it only happens after genotoxic damage ( e.g. , peroxide exposure ) , but either way it ’s happening enough for pre-existing damage in the pool of nucleotide precursors to have an impact on the steady - state levels of damage in the nuclear genome .
I have n’t sorted through all the ramifications of this idea yet , but it seems major :
We think of damage as occurring after synthesis , and of repairing damage as a return to a pristine original state .
But if the reason that aged cells exhibit high steady - state levels of damage is not simply accumulation with time , but rather that macromolecules are increasingly being synthesized in a damaged state … well , it seems like a trip to the drawing board might be in order .

J.K. Rowling is the first author in the history of the world to earn a billion dollars .
I do not disparage Rowling when I say that talent is not the explanation for her monetary success .
Homer , Shakespeare and Tolkien all earned much less .
Why ?
Consider Homer , he told great stories but he could earn no more in a night than say 50 people might pay for an evening ’s entertainment .
Shakespeare did a little better .
The Globe theater could hold 3000 and unlike Homer , Shakespeare did n’t have to be at the theater to earn .
Shakespeare ’s words were leveraged .
Tolkien ’s words were leveraged further .
By selling books Tolkien could sell to hundreds of thousands , even millions of buyers in a year – more than have ever seen a Shakespeare play in 400 years .
And books were cheaper to produce than actors which meant that Tolkien could earn a greater share of the revenues than did Shakespeare ( Shakespeare incidentally also owned shares in the Globe . )
Rowling has the leverage of the book but also the movie , the video game , and the toy .
And globalization , both economic and cultural , means that Rowling ’s words , images , and products are translated , transmitted and transported everywhere – this is the real magic of Ha-li Bo-te .
Rowling ’s success brings with it inequality .
Time is limited and people want to read the same books that their friends are reading so book publishing has a winner - take all component .
Thus , greater leverage brings greater inequality .
The average writer ’s income has n’t gone up much in the past thirty years but today , for the first time ever , a handful of writers can be multi-millionaires and even billionaires .
The top pulls away from the median .
The same forces that have generated greater inequality in writing – the leveraging of intellect , the declining importance of physical labor in the production of value , cultural and economic globalization – are at work throughout the economy .
Thus , if you really want to understand inequality today you must first understand Harry Potter .
On the day that America marked the 4th anniversary of the beginning of the Iraq War , President Bush addressed the nation and asked for patience as he pursues his latest strategy :
President Bush asked skeptical Americans for additional patience as the Iraq war entered its fifth year yesterday , saying that the United States can be victorious , but “ only if we have the courage and resolve to see it through . ”
In a brief address to the nation four years after he ordered U.S. forces to invade Iraq , Bush also warned the Democratic - led Congress not to pass a measure scheduled for a vote in the House this week that would require troops to withdraw from the conflict .
“ It can be tempting to look at the challenges in Iraq and conclude our best option is to pack up and go home , ” Bush said in an eight - minute speech from the Roosevelt Room in the White House .
“ That may be satisfying in the short run , but I believe the consequences for American security would be devastating . ”
I ’ve written more than once here about my feelings about the Iraq War , but , first , a history lesson .
I will admit that , in the beginning , I supported the invasion of Iraq .
Like almost all of America , I bought into the weapons of mass destruction argument — after all , Colin Powell had presented a pretty compelling case in his speech to the U.N. Security Council in February 2003 ( little did we know at the time that his speech was based almost entirely on information obtained from an Iraqi defector in German custody that several CIA analysts believed to be suspect ) .
Not only that , there were those compelling - if - unsubstantiated rumors of links between Iraq and the 9/11 conspirators that nobody has ever been able to prove .
Add into that the fact that Persian Gulf War I never really ended in a satisfactory manner and the fact that Saddam definately did try to assassinate former President Bush during a visit Kuwait .
By the time President Bush addressed the nation late in the evening on March 19 , 2003 , the idea of America invading Iraq to topple the Ba`athist regime of Hussein sounded like a pretty good idea to me .
Then reality hit .
Saddam fell quickly , and the image of his statutes falling reminded me of the days when Soviet Communism was collapsing across Eastern Europe .
But things fell apart pretty quickly after that , and went downhill from there .
As I ’ve written before , what has become exceedingly clear is that there was an incredible , almost inept , lack of planning on the part of those in charge for what would become of the post - Saddam Iraq .
The view that ended up dominating the planning ( or lack thereof ) process was the Paul Wolfkowitz idea that we ’d be welcomed as conquering heroes .
When that did n’t happen , and when the rioting started , it seemed like nobody on the ground knew what they were doing .
I ’ve written previously , most specifically , here and here about my opinions on the Iraq War , and I ’ve debated that issue more that once in several forums .
The purpose of this post , however , is to turn the tables and ask a question or two directed to the supporters of the President ’s Iraq policies , so here they are :
1 . Does the fact that the initial public justification for the Iraq War — the fact of an existing Weapons of Mass Destruction program in Iraq — was quite clearly untrue deminish in any respect your support for the initial invasion or the current Bush policy ?
If yes , then explain why .
2 . What is your definition of victory in the Iraq War and when do you conceive it would be possible for American forces to begin leaving Iraq ?
Quite honestly , I open this up to anyone willing to participate .
There was widespread agreement on the need to cut emissions
He was speaking after a two - day meeting of environment ministers in the German city of Potsdam .
The issues were carbon emissions trading and rewarding developing nations for protecting their natural assets , he said .
Mr Gabriel said the US opposition was " not a surprise " .
The Potsdam conference brought together ministers from the Group of Eight leading industrialised nations - the United States , Canada , France , UK , Germany , Japan , Italy and Russia - and Brazil , India , China Mexico and South Africa from the developing world .
' Not subtle '
Ministers stressed that the meeting had shown that there was a good deal of consensus on the scale and nature of the problem of climate change - but a lack of agreement on the tools to tackle it .
The BBC's Matt McGrath in Potsdam says there was a widespread acceptance that sustainable economic development had to go hand in hand with efforts to cut emissions of carbon dioxide .
But disagreements surfaced over specifics such as extending the global system of carbon trading , one of the central planks of any proposed deal to curb emissions .
According to one delegate the United States was " not subtle " in its opposition to carbon trading , and to another proposal that would pay developing countries to preserve rainforests .
" We find this regrettable , " Mr Gabriel told reporters .
But he said : " I would have been disappointed if I 'd expected something different . "

Some of the debris on the beach .
Picture : Roger Sharp .
Over the last two days scavengers have descended on the beach in Branscombe , Devon , taking away goods that included BMW motorbikes , wine and nappies .
Officers closed the beach to deter treasure seekers and to allow contractors to start the clear - up .
Coastguard officials have accused scavengers of " sheer greed " .
That is a view reflected by one family who were shocked to see pictures of their belongings being looted from one crate on the beach .
Anita and Jan Bokdal 's possessions were being transported on the MSC Napoli from their native Sweden to South Africa , where they have bought a wine farm .
They were horrified to see pictures in the media of their belongings , including photographs and family heirlooms , being emptied on to the beach .
People spent hours rummaging through the debris
She said the police should have done more to stop the looters .
" For me it 's stealing our things .... as far as I know the police should have been there in the beginning and stopped this .
The law must do something about it , " said Mrs Bokdal .
About 200 of the MSC Napoli's 2,323 containers have gone overboard .
The Acting Receiver of Wreck , Mark Rodaway , said the authorities would be applying for special powers to force people to return items they had recovered from the beach .
" There are discussions with the police and Robin Middleton , the Secretary of State 's representative for Maritime , Salvage and Intervention , to bring in special enforcement powers to require people to give up recovered items from the beach .
" People could also be required to leave the area , " said Mr Rodaway .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Let them keep what they find .
They are removing rubbish from the beach !

He added that the actions of the looters were increasing the environmental impact on Branscombe Beach by 800 % .
Under the Merchant Shipping
Act 1995 , it is an offence for people to remove items from a wreck if they conceal or keep possession of cargo and refuse to surrender it .
But some of the items plundered from the container ship have already been listed on the internet auction website eBay .
WHY IS THE AREA SO SPECIAL ?
It 's part of Britain 's first natural World Heritage Site
The site covers 95 miles of coast from East Devon to Dorset 185 million years of the Earth 's history are recorded in the rocks
It 's known as the Jurassic Coast after the best - known geological period found within it It was declared a World Heritage Site in December 2001 as 'an outstanding example of the major stages of the Earth 's history '
Your pictures : MSC Napoli
BMW steering wheel airbags - advertised as coming from the Napoli - were up for sale online .
MCA spokesman Mark Clark said that had warnings not to touch the containers been followed , they would have been removed and the beach returned to normality quite soon .
" They have quadrupled our task , " he said .
" People are lighting fires beside the containers , getting on top of them ripping stuff out , and not heeding our warnings .
" The MCA is deeply upset and angry because all the stuff which has been ripped out of the containers will be swept out to sea and have an environmental impact , " he said .
" In 11 years I have never seen anything like it , it is sheer greed . "
Devon and Cornwall Police said that with heavy plant equipment moving on to the beach it was safer to close roads leading to the beach .
The beach is closed to all traffic except the contractors , emergency vehicles and local residents .
600 seabirds
That meant that people had to walk several miles to the beach but that did not deter about 200 scavengers who were rummaging through the cargo .
The process of heating thick fuel oil on the ship to turn it into a consistency that can be pumped on to another vessel is due to start .
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) said it may take a week to pump 3,500 tonnes of oil to stop more leaks from the ship .
The Napoli suffered structural damage during last Thursday 's storms and was deliberately grounded a mile off Branscombe to stop it breaking up in deep water .
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has reported 600 seabirds had been found suffering from the effects of oil between Chesil Beach and Portland in Dorset , sparking fears environmental damage was worsening .
Google , with the cooperation of prestigious libraries , has been digitizing books to make them findable .
The practice excites futurists but angers some publishers .
Of necessity , digitization creates virtual copies .
The publishers claim that such duplication violates copyright , even if the book ’s content is hidden from the public .
The New York Public Library , one of Google ’s partners in the project , recently hosted a public debate on the subject .
Article Continues Below
It was while attending that debate that my discomfort with the hype surrounding an emerging genre of web development turned into a full - blown hate - on .
The big room was packed .
There were more ticket holders than chairs .
Yet the seat in front of me remained empty .
Each time a hopeful standee approached the empty chair — and this happened every few nanoseconds — the poor schmoe seated next to it had to apologetically explain , “ Sorry , the seat is occupied . ”
It soon became clear that the kindly schmoe was reserving the seat , not for a friend or colleague , but for a stranger who had imposed that duty on him .
While the kindly fellow defended the other man ’s throne against a steady stream of resentful ticket holders , the stranger was off somewhere knocking back the library ’s free champagne .
I wondered what kind of jackass would ask someone he did n’t know to save his seat for thirty minutes at an oversold event .
When he finally arrived , I found out .
A taste of ass#section2
“ Were you at the Web 2.0 conference ? ” the arriving man asked , by way of thanking the other for saving his place .
The kindly schmoe signified in the negative .
This was all the encouragement our man needed to launch into an adjective - rich and fact - poor monologue that was loud enough for half the room to hear .
It soon appeared that “ Web 2.0 ” was not only bigger than the Apocalypse but also more profitable .
Profitable , that is , for investors like the speaker .
Yet the new gold rush must not be confused with the dot - com bubble of the 1990s :
“ Web 1.0 was not disruptive .
You understand ?
Web 2.0 is totally disruptive .
You know what XML is ?
You ’ve heard about well - formedness ?
Okay .
So anyway — ”
And on it ran , like a dentist ’s drill in the Gulag .
At first I tolerated the pain by mentally modifying the famous scene from Annie Hall :
HIM : “ I teach a venture capitalist workshop , so I think my insights into XML have a great deal of validity . ”
ME : “ Oh , really ?
Because I happen to have Mr. Bray right here . ”
Later I gnawed my knuckles .
At some point , in a kind of fever , I may have moaned .
Blessedly , at last the lights dimmed and the night ’s real speakers redeemed the evening .
But the ass whose braying I ’d endured left a bad taste .
Less noise , more signal #section3
Let us now define and disclaim .
The jerk at the library event was in love with his own noise , and the problem with noise is that it interferes with signals .
What is the signal ?
What , if anything , does “ Web 2.0 ” mean ?
What is the good thing that the hype risks obscuring ?
Well , there are several good things , it seems to me .
Some small teams of sharp people — people who once , perhaps , worked for those with dimmer visions — are now following their own muses and designing smart web applications .
Products like Flickr and Basecamp are fun and well - made and easy to use .
That may not sound like much .
But ours is a medium in which , more often than not , big teams have slowly and expensively labored to produce overly complex web applications whose usability was near nil on behalf of clients with at best vague goals .
The realization that small , self - directed teams powered by Pareto ’s Principle can quickly create sleeker stuff that works better is not merely bracing but dynamic .
As 100 garage bands sprang from every Velvet Underground record sold , so the realization that one small team can make good prompts 100 others to try .
The best and most famous of these new web products ( i.e. the two I just mentioned ) foster community and collaboration , offering new or improved modes of personal and business interaction .
By virtue of their virtues , they own their categories , which is good for the creators , because they get paid .
It is also good for our industry , because the prospect of wealth inspires smart developers who once passively took orders to start thinking about usability and design , and to try to solve problems in a niche they can own .
In so doing , some of them may create jobs and wealth .
And even where the payday is smaller , these developers can raise the design and usability bar .
This is good for everyone .
If consumers can choose better applications that cost less or are free , then the web works better , and clients are more likely to request good ( usable , well - designed ) work instead of the usual schlock .
Of this they spin#section4
In addition to favoring simpler solutions built by leaner teams , the stuff labeled “ Web 2.0 ” tends to have technological commonalities .
On the back end , it is most often powered by open source technologies like PHP or ( especially ) Ruby on Rails .
On the front end , it is mainly built with web standards — CSS for layout , XML for data , XHTML for markup , JavaScript and the DOM for behavior — with a little Microsoft stuff thrown in .
When web standards with a little Microsoft stuff thrown in are used to create pages that can interact with the server without refreshing , the result is web apps that feel peppy and , dare we say it , Flash - like .
In a white paper that actually got read , writer / consultant Jesse James Garrett named what I ’ve just described .
He called it AJAX , and the acronym not only took , it helped interactivity powered by these technologies gain traction in the marketplace .
Here is where the spinners bedazzle the easily confused .
Consider this scenario :
Steven , a young web wiz , has just celebrated his bar mitzvah .
He received a dozen gifts and must write a dozen thank - you notes .
Being webbish , he creates an on - line “ Thank - You Note Generator . ”
Steven shows the site to his friends , who show it to their friends , and soon the site is getting traffic from recipients of all sorts of gifts , not just bar mitzvah stuff .
If Steven created the site with CGI and Perl and used tables for layout , this is the story of a boy who made a website for his own amusement , perhaps gaining social points in the process .
He might even contribute to a SXSW Interactive panel .
But if Steven used AJAX and Ruby on Rails , Yahoo will pay millions and Tim O’Reilly will beg him to keynote .
Who weeps for AJAX ?#section5
We pause but a moment to consider two AJAX - related headaches .
The first afflicts people who make websites .
Wireframing AJAX is a bitch .
The best our agency has come up with is the Chuck Jones approach : draw the key frames .
Chuck Jones had an advantage : he knew what Bugs Bunny was going to do .
We have to determine all the things a user might do , and wireframe the blessed moments of each possibility .
The second problem affects all who use an AJAX - powered site .
If web signifiers and conventions are still in their infancy , then AJAX - related signifiers and conventions are in utero .
I am still discovering features of Flickr .
Not new features — old ones .
You find some by clicking in empty white space .
This is like reading the news by pouring ACME Invisible Ink Detector on all pieces of paper that cross your path until you find one that has words on it .
I am not knocking Flickr .
I love Flickr .
I wish I were as gifted as the people who created it .
I ’m merely pointing out complex design problems that will not be solved overnight or by a single group .
In Ma.gnolia , which is now in beta , we used small icons to indicate that additional actions could be taken and to hint at what those actions might be .
We succeeded to the extent that 16 px by 16 px drawings can communicate such concepts as “ you may edit these words by clicking on them . ”
These problems and others will be solved , most likely by someone reading this page .
One points to these issues mainly to dent a swelling of unthinking euphoria .
We have been down this road before .
When I started designing websites , if the guy on the plane next to me asked what I did , I had to say something like “ digital marketing ” if I wanted to avoid the uncomprehending stare .
A few years later , if I told the passenger beside me I was a web designer , he or she would regard me with a reverence typically reserved for Stanley - Cup - winning Nobel Laureate rock stars .
Then the bubble burst , and the same answer to the same question provoked looks of pity and barely concealed disgust .
I remember meeting a high - rolling entrepreneur in the early 2000s who asked what I did .
I should have told him I hung around playgrounds , stealing children ’s lunch money .
He would have had more respect for that answer .
I hated the bubble .
I hated it when Vanity Fair or New York Magazine treated web agency founders like celebrities .
I hated that mainstream media and the society it informs either ignored the web or mistook it for a high - stakes electronic version of the fashion industry .
When the bubble burst , these same geniuses decided the web was of no interest at all .
Funny , to me it was more interesting than ever .
To me it was people and organizations publishing content that might not otherwise have seen light .
It was small businesses with realistic goals delivering value and growing .
It was traditional publishers finding their way into a new digital medium , helped by folks like you and me .
It was new ways of talking and sharing and loving and selling and healing and being .
Hardly dull .
Eventually the uninformed stopped seeing a wasteland and started seeing bloggers , by which they meant only those bloggers who wrote about politics , most often from the extreme left or right .
The web was “ back ” even though it had never left .
( Of course , the fifth time you hear Wolf Blitzer say “ blogger ” or ask , “ what do the bloggers have to tell us about these still - unfolding events ? ” the joke is stale and you wish those who do n’t get the web would go back to ignoring it . )
But nothing , not even the rants of political bloggers , was as exciting as the scent of money .
As the first properly valued “ Web 2.0 ” properties began to find buyers , a frenzy like the old one popped hideously back to life .
Yahoo spent how much ?
Google bought what ?
Here was real blood in the water .
But how to persuade the other sharks in the tank that this blood feast was different from the previous boom - and - bust ?

To you who are toiling over an AJAX – and Ruby - powered social software product , good luck , God bless , and have fun .
Remember that 20 other people are working on the same idea .

Especially if you get rich .
Nothing is more unsightly than a solemn multi-millionaire .
To you who feel like failures because you spent last year honing your web skills and serving clients , or running a business , or perhaps publishing content , you are special and lovely , so hold that pretty head high , and never let them see the tears .
As for me , I ’m cutting out the middleman and jumping right to Web 3.0 .
Why wait ?
