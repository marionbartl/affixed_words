Those who hoped that the change promised by candidate Barack Obama would include repeal of the various acts that have stripped Americans of their constitutional rights should be disappointed .
Benjamin Franklin supposedly wrote , " Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . "
The citation is likely apocryphal , at least in terms of its attribution to Franklin , but it is useful shorthand for the unfortunate abandonment of many of the liberties guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution as a consequence of 9/11 .
The trauma of 9/11 created an opportunity for those seeking to centralize executive power , an objective of recent presidents from both political parties .
Many Americans initially accepted that there had to be some abridgment of fundamental liberties while fighting a multi-faceted and unconventional war against terrorism , but few realize just how much the constitutional rights that all citizens take for granted have been eroded .
History also teaches us that once a right is suspended , in all likelihood it is gone forever .
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism
Act of 2001 might well be described as one of history ’s more spectacular euphemisms employed to gut a constitution , somewhat akin to Hitler ’s “ emergency act ” in the wake of the Reichstag fire of 1933 .
It is better known as PATRIOT Act I. PATRIOT
Act I became law six weeks after the fall of the Twin Towers and was followed by PATRIOT Act II in 2006 .
The two laws together diminish constitutional guarantees of free speech , freedom of association , freedom from illegal search , the right to habeas corpus , prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment , and prohibition of the illegal seizure of private property .
The First , Fourth , Fifth , Sixth , and Eighth Amendments in the Bill of Rights have all been discarded or abridged in the rush to make it easier to investigate , torture , and jail both foreigners and American citizens .
The PATRIOT Act also incorporates the Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of Oct. 17 , 2001 , which permits the freezing of assets and investigation of individuals suspected of being financial supporters of terrorism .
“ Suspected ” is the key word , as there is no oversight or appeal in the process .
The Military Commission Act of 2006 ( MCA ) followed the PATRIOT Acts , creating military tribunals for the trying of “ unlawful enemy combatants , ” including American citizens .
Unlike a civil or criminal court , the accused needs only a two - thirds vote by the commission members present to be convicted .
The act permits the indefinite jailing of suspects in a military prison without being charged with a crime or given access to a lawyer .
The government is not required to produce any normally admissible evidence at a commission hearing and can rely on hearsay or even information obtained overseas during torture to make its case .
Detainees do not have access to any classified information used against them and cannot cross -examine or even know the identity of witnesses .
The MCA suspends habeas corpus for anyone charged and forbids the application of the Geneva Conventions to mitigate conditions of confinement or to challenge the judicial process or verdict .
The Geneva Conventions also cannot be invoked if the accused subsequently claims he was tortured or otherwise abused , protecting overly zealous interrogators from later charges of “ war crimes . ”
The act was also designed to cover all cases that were pending , meaning that it was retroactive .
An executive order issued on July 17 , 2007 , which is still in effect , authorized the president to seize the property of anyone who “ threatens stabilization efforts in Iraq . ”
As the administration ’s own Justice Department decides what constitutes " threatening stabilization efforts , " the order can be used to go after any critic of the government .
Most disturbing , the order does not permit a challenge to the information the seizure is based on , and it also permits the confiscation of the property of anyone who comes to the assistance of the suspected de-stabilizer .
The threat to civil liberties is real .
Under the authority of the PATRIOT Act , the FBI requested more than 30,000 national security letters in 2007 , and the number was surely higher in 2008 .
The letters enable the FBI to look at anyone ’s personal information without any judicial oversight or showing of cause .
Anyone who is presented with a letter and compelled to cooperate to provide information on a suspect cannot reveal that the letter has been received .
Are there 30,000 terrorists roaming the United States ?
If there were , the country would surely be a bombed - out ruin by now .
The government is instead using the security letters and the other tools provided by the PATRIOT
Act legislation to look at people who are completely innocent of any wrongdoing , because it is convenient to be able to do so without the bother of having to go to a judge for a search warrant .
Sen. Barack Obama opposed the MCA and voted against it .
He was not in the Senate when the first PATRIOT
Act was passed , but he criticized the second version for its abuse of civil liberties before voting for an amended version .
Candidate Obama ran on his record of opposition to the various pieces of legislation , noting consistently that they had authorized the abuse of authority by law enforcement and had abridged the rights of every American .
Unfortunately , President Obama appears to have forgotten the principled positions he took as a senator and presidential candidate .
After his inauguration , he moved quickly to publicly ban the CIA ’s use of torture , a meaningless gesture in that the Agency had already abandoned the practice , but it now appears that he will do nothing to revoke Bush - era legislation like the MCA that he once strongly criticized .
There is every indication that he will also endorse renewal of the PATRIOT
Act when it expires at the end of the year , afraid that if he does not do so and there is a terrorist attack he will pay a significant political price .
The Obama administration has also been silent about the National Security Agency ’s warrantless wiretaps and has invoked the " state - secrets privilege " in connection with a lawsuit by the Islamic charity al - Haramain in an apparent bid to prevent disclosure of the warrantless wiretap procedure .
President Obama is not just contradicting his progressive campaign promises and betraying many of the people who voted for him .
As a lawyer , he surely understands that protecting the government ’s questionably legal " rights " to monitor citizens completely subverts the rule of law , because it guarantees that there will be no accountability .
Currently , judges who rule on the state - secrets issue are not themselves allowed to see the alleged classified information , meaning that there is absolutely no transparency to the process in which the government is asserting an extralegal privilege that is surely unconstitutional .
If the Obama administration is beginning to sound like the Bush White House , it should .
To be sure , the new president is relying on the advice of many Bush administration holdovers like FBI Director Robert Mueller .
Mueller asserts , without providing any evidence , that the tools provided by the PATRIOT
Act have been effective in preventing terrorism , just as Bush - era intelligence chiefs claimed that torture and extraordinary rendition were essential to meet the terrorist threat .
All such claims should be viewed with extreme skepticism , particularly as they are rarely backed up by any evidence .
The government also often lies when it wants to make a case for some illegal action .
Claims made in 2008 that the waterboarding of Abu Zubaida produced a flood of information that frustrated terrorist plots are now revealed to have been false .
Zubaida confused his interrogators and sent them off on wild goose chases with information that was either deliberately deceptive or flat - out wrong .
In reality , the government cannot cite a single instance where the use of draconian new legislation or illegal procedures like torture has either prevented a terrorist incident or led to the arrest of anyone who was ready , willing , and able to carry out a violent act .
Obama would have been wiser to ignore the experts and sit back and consider the broader picture .
Does the creation of a monstrous Department of Homeland Security supported by a bloated defense and intelligence establishment really make sense in light of the threat that the U.S. actually faces ?
How did we arrive at a 400,000 - name no-fly list and an NSA that has conducted hundreds of millions of interceptions of telephone calls without any oversight ?
That a small group of terrorists holed up in an isolated and backward part of the world got lucky against an unsuspecting America on 9/11 is clear , but the odds of them repeating that spectacular success are minimal .
More than seven years later , the actual vulnerability of international terrorism should be completely clear and the government should be telling the people the good news , that al - Qaeda is on its last legs and that the other Salafist terrorist groups that have a similar philosophy have been hounded and contained all around the world .
There has been no successful terrorist action within the United States , and the appeal of jihadist terrorism is on the wane everywhere else .
Its moment has passed .
In spite of the reduced threat , under Obama the business of fighting terrorism goes on with a change in the rhetoric but not in the policy , buttressed by an enlarged military budget to spread the cheer to Afghanistan and increased spending on intelligence .
And there is no sign that the liberties that Americans have bartered away are about to be returned .
Having an amorphous foreign threat hanging around is always good politics , as it can be used to divert attention from more serious problems at home .
Having the mechanisms at hand to investigate an American citizen can also be useful when the critics become too loud .
Those who feared that George W. Bush would give his successors unconstitutional tools that they would be reluctant to relinquish have apparently been vindicated .
A new version of the P2P plug - in Littleshoot makes it possible to download torrents right from within your browser .
The software runs on Macs and Windows PCs and works with IE , Firefox , Chrome and Safari .
It even offers Gnutella and Youtube integration as an added bonus .
Have you ever tried to explain BitTorrent to someone who has no clue about P2P ?
It ’s challenging , is n’t it ?
Things that most of us take for granted really make no sense to users that are n’t all that tech - savvy .
Do n’t believe me ?
Just go to a site like Yahoo Answers – and be amazed by the number of people who just do n’t understand why their Windows Media Player wo n’t play back this damn torrent file .
Sure , we could make fun of these people .
Or we could help them with an easy way to download torrents without having to know about the pros and cons of enabling DHT in uTorrent .
Littleshoot decided to try the latter approach with a new BitTorrent browser plug - in that is being unveiled today .
Littleshoot ’s BitTorrent plug - in has been in the making for quite some time now .
The company behind it was founded by the former Limewire developer Adam Fisk who initially set out to develop an application for sharing data within a circle of friends .
Littleshoot eventually changed directions towards general purpose , browser - based P2P and finally launched last November , albeit without BitTorrent integration .
The plug - in ’s first iteration looked a little like a solution that did n’t really know which problem it wanted to solve .
Littleshoot offered Gnutella downloads through your browser as well as the capability of publishing data on a separate P2P network that is based on the open source SIP protocol .
Both were great in theory , but people hardly shared any data via Littleshoot , and when it comes to media sharing Gnutella is n’t exactly the first choice anymore either .
Enter BitTorrent .
Fisk teamed up with Julian Cain for this release , who previously developed the Mac torrent client BitRocket as well as Kazaa ’s never - released OS X client and who has also been involved in a bunch of other P2P projects over the years .
Their ambitious goal is to transform Littleshoot into something like the Flash player of the BitTorrent world .
Install it once , then forget about it , and it will work with any content , on any site .
I ’ve had a chance to test multiple builds of the client over the last couple of weeks , and I must say Littleshoot has come a long way towards achieving this goal .
Install the client , visit any torrent site , click on a torrent download link – and Littleshoot starts do download the files in question right within your browser on a Web 2.0 - ish download page .
The client even automatically starts a Flash - based audio player if you download an MP3 file , and files can be easily forwarded through Twitter , Facebook and other social networks .
Littleshoot in action .
It also offers a search page that makes it possible to simultaneously search isoHunt , Youtube , Flickr , Yahoo Video and the Littleshoot P2P network , or any subset of these services .
This search page may not be that useful to advanced users that prefer sites other than Isohunt , but again , it ’s a great feature for beginners .
Littleshoot does n’t come with any configurable options at this time .
All data is saved in a default download directory , and the client seeds files indefinitely .
However , Fisk told me that future versions of Littleshoot will offer the option to shut down the client after a certain ratio is reached .
The current download page already offers details about your ratio as well as your up - and download rates .
Speaking of future changes : Littleshoot is still clearly in beta stage .
The Windows version seemed especially rocky in earlier builds that I got to test , but most things seem to be working when it comes to the final version that has been made available today .
So what ’s the final verdict ?
Littleshoot may still have some room for improvement , but it ’s definitely promising .
Not only because this is the first BitTorrent client your mom will be able to use , but also because the Littleshoot team definitely has its eyes set on bigger goals .
One of the plans for future releases is an SDK that will make it possible for website owners to offload the distribution of any file to Littleshoot .
Just drop a few lines of Javascript in your blog , and your MP3 file will be available as a P2P download .
Says Fisk : “ If a site relies on P2P services , they ’ll display an “ install plugin ” window , just like the user sees when they do n’t have Flash on sites that require it . ”
Kinda makes you wonder how long it will take for a torrent site to integrate something like this for all of its files .
The new version of Littleshoot is currently available on this beta page and will launch on the Littleshoot home page later today .

In the days since I wrote a post about finally claiming the womanist label and the warm welcome I ’ve received since , I ’ve had some of my white transsisters express movement - envy and surprise that we transwomen of color would be embraced by our cisgender sisters of color .
Some of them have read about the principles of womanism , see the night - and - day comparisons and contrasts between it and feminism , and asked if they can join the womanist ranks .
The answer I ’ve heard from other womanists is no – and not for exclusionary reasons .
Womanism started because of profound disagreements between Black and White feminists over the shabby treatment of Black women inside and outside the feminist movement , the unacknowledged class privilege , and alarm over the transphobia being expressed by radical feminists .
There ’s no love lost between some radical feminists and womanists in particular , on a wide variety of issues , besides their hatred of transpeople .
While I empathize with my white transsisters , womanism evolved because feminism became so narrowly defined , ignored race and reinforced privilege , and became so toxically hostile to anyone who pointed out the obvious shortcomings that people left or disassociated themselves from it .
Just as you have conversations with various groups that we WOC are n’t privy , those that fall under the ‘ family business ’ label , there are conversations that womanists need to have as we explore the role of transwomen within the movement that fall under the same header .
The point I ’m making is that you already have multiple social justice movements geared toward white people .
Womanism is a FUBU production we treasure and need to cultivate due to the constant infusion of fresh ideas that continue to fuel its growth and stimulate discussion .
I can understand why you ’d want to be a part of a movement that is growing , welcoming and continually evolving , while the feminist label has become something to be reviled .
Rush Limbaugh ’s frequent use of the ‘ feminazi ’ epithet , spewed forth from his radio studio to the ears of his dittoheads and feminism ’s detractors , highlights the image problem that has resulted from the stagnation and tainting of the feminist brand .
If you truly want to embrace the good parts of feminism , then you ’ll need to fight within those circles with other transgender feminists and your cisgender allies to make that happen .
It ’s going to be a long , messy undertaking because the entrenched factions wo n’t make it easy for you , but nothing worth fighting for is particularly easy .
You ’ll have to respectfully demand your plac , just like African - American transpeople have done ( and are still doing ) to take our rightful place with our allies at the African - American family table .
Until then , until feminism becomes more like womanism – in which all people are respected and welcomed into the fold – and the issues that caused the split in the first place are dealt with , it ’ll probably be a while before you see white women being accepted into the womanist community .

The conservative group Americans United for Life put out a statement today calling President Obama ’s decision to allow federal funding for embryonic stem cell research a waste of tax payer money .
More importantly others are worried that Obama will start cloning people .
After Obama signed an executive order lifting the restriction on federal funding for stem cell research , social conservatives went ballistic .
Right wingerGary Bauer is worried that Obama is going to lift the ban on human cloning , “ My concern is that the long - term result of this work will lead to a lifting of the ban against human cloning , a development that would allow testing in laboratories on human embryos , human life .
But today , Obama ’s decision to allow federal tax dollars to be used to destroy human embryos is tragic on many levels .
He raises false hope for those who are ill ; he strains the American taxpayer at a time of economic crisis , and he ignores the humanity of the lives ended in cold laboratories to satisfy a liberal ideology . ”
Dr. Charmaine Yoest , President & CEO of Americans United for Life responded , “ Embryonic stem cell research is the research of the past .
Millions of dollars have been spent on embryonic stem cell research and it has failed .
To pour more money into it is simply a waste .
” This does n’t sound like everything else that I have read on the subject , could Dr. Yoest have another reason for her opposition ?

Dr. Yoest continued , “ Even more , this research destroys lives at the very earliest stage of development .
Adult stem cell research is helping people now .
If we ’re going to put tax dollars into research — particularly at a time of unprecedented federal deficits — it needs to be research that protects life and helps patients now . ”
There it is .
Contrary to what all objective scientists say , the social conservatives are arguing that adult stem cells are the way to go .
The new social conservative argument is based on the idea that Barack Obama is wasting tax payer money by trying to fund research that could possibly cure a wide variety of diseases such as Parkinson ’s , Alzheimer ’s , cancer and many other conditions , so they are going to deny a potential cure on moral grounds .
Furthermore , this argument about cloning is silly .
Obama is not in favor of cloning , and no one has proposed lifting the ban on cloning .
It is not like we are start cultivating human beings for genetic harvesting .
This is straight out of some sort of paranoid sci-fi .
How cruel do a group of people have to be to deny a potential cure to the sick and dying ?
They claim to be protecting life , but what about the lives of those that are already born ?
Do n’t they count too ?
Social conservatives know that this is a losing argument , which is why they tried to turn it into a spending issue .
Obama ’s Executive Order puts the White House back in step with the desires of the majority of Americans on this issue , which is a very good thing .
Mr Griffin hopes to become the British National Party 's first MEP .
British National Party ( BNP ) chairman Nick Griffin has defended a party leaflet which says that black Britons and Asian Britons " do not exist " .
The BNP's " Language and Concepts Discipline Manual " says the term used should be " racial foreigners " .
In a BBC interview , Mr Griffin said to call such people British was a sort of " bloodless genocide " because it denied indigenous people their own identity .
Mr Griffin is standing in the European Parliament elections in June .
' Politically correct fiction '
The BNP manual , leaked to the anti-fascist group Searchlight and seen by the BBC , says that " BNP activists and writers should never refer to ' black Britons ' or ' Asian Britons ' etc , for the simple reason that such persons do not exist " .
LISTEN TO THE REPORT Thursday 23 April , 2009 , BBC Radio 4 at 2000 BST
Or listen again on the Radio 4 website
Or download the programme podcast " These people are ' black residents ' of the UK etc , and are no more British than an Englishman living in Hong Kong is Chinese .
" Collectively , foreign residents of other races should be referred to as ' racial foreigners ' , a non-pejorative term ...
The key in such matters is above all to maintain necessary distinctions while avoiding provocation and insult . "
The manual describes the BNP's " ultimate aim " as the " lawful , humane and voluntary repatriation of the resident foreigners of the UK " .
Commenting on the leaflet 's content , Mr Griffin told The Report on Radio 4 that although " in civic terms they are British , British also has a meaning as an ethnic description " .
" We do n't subscribe to the politically correct fiction that just because they happen to be born in Britain , a Pakistani is a Briton .
They 're not ; they remain of Pakistani stock .
" You can't say that especially large numbers of people can come from the rest of the world and assume an English identity without denying the English their own identity , and I would say that 's wrong , " he added .
" In a very subtle way , it 's a sort of bloodless genocide . "
' Delighted '
Mr Griffin was also candid about the significance the BNP places on the slogan " British jobs for British workers " .
I certainly regret the fact that the BNP could be using language we 've used in order to legitimise what I regard as divisive , pernicious policies
Hazel Blears , Communities Minister The Prime Minister Gordon Brown famously used the phrase in a speech about skills training .
Mr Griffin claimed the prime minister borrowed the rhetoric from his party .
" When I heard Gordon Brown use our slogan - British jobs for British workers - I was delighted , " he said .
" What Mr Brown actually meant when he said British jobs for British workers is of course down to Mr Brown .
" But there 's no doubt that it was perceived - and was intended to be perceived - by millions of ordinary Brits as meaning that they would be at the front of the queue in front of economic migrants from anywhere else in the world . "
" So having raised our slogan , promised it , we feel that he 's legitimised our message . "
' Pernicious ' Hazel Blears , secretary of state for Communities and Local Government , said she rejected Mr Griffin 's charge that the prime minister 's use of the phrase represents an endorsement of BNP policy .
" I certainly regret the fact that the BNP could be using language we 've used in order to legitimise what I regard as divisive , pernicious policies which will actually do working class people no good at all , " she said .
" What I do n't regret is the fact that we need to have a proper discussion in this country about making sure that British people have a chance to get the skills , the education , to be able to get the jobs of the future . "
The " British jobs for British workers " slogan was widely repeated during the BNP 's recent council by - election campaign in Moston in Manchester , where the party 's candidate , local publican Derek Adams , came second .
Moston is in the North West region , where the BNP hopes its supporters will elect Mr Griffin as the party 's first MEP in the European Parliamentary elections on 4 June .
Nominations close on 7 May .
Under the proportional representation system used in European elections , the BNP would need around 9 % of the vote ; in the last elections the party won 6.4 % .

The Israel Defense Forces announced on Wednesday that an internal investigation has determined that no civilians were purposefully harmed by IDF troops during Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip .
Following the release of the investigation results , Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that the army 's willingness to probe itself " once again proves that the IDF is one of the most moral armies in the world .
" The IDF is not afraid to investigate itself and in that , proves that its operations are ethical , " said Barak .
The defense minister added that he has " complete faith in the IDF , from the chief of staff to the last of the combat soldiers . "
The inquiries were performed by five IDF colonels who were not involved in the fighting in Cast Lead , and examined reports of attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure , medical personnel and facilities , United Nations facilities , and also the use of white phosphorous .
The investigation , which was supervised by IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi , did find cases of civilians killed by mistaken fire on the part of IDF troops , but said the incidents were isolated .
Deputy IDF
Chief of Staff General Dan Harel said that in the dozens of cases they examined , they found that throughout Cast Lead the IDF " adhered to international law and maintained a high level of professionalism and morality . "
The most glaring case of mistaken fire found by the inquiry was the attack on the Al - Dahiyeh family home in the Gaza City neighborhood of Zeitoun , in which 21 members of the same family were killed .
In the incident , the IDF called a household that was suspected of being a weapons storehouse and told the residents to evacuate , saying an attack was imminent .
The subsequent IAF strike , which was targeting a suspected weapons storehouse , landed dozens of meters from its target , slamming into the Al - Dahiyeh household .
The mistaken fire reportedly came as a result of a malfunction in the targeting system of the aircraft carrying out the mission .
The IDF has called the incident " regretful " , but said it resulted from " an operational mistake that is bound to happen during intensive fighting . "
Another incident reported in the probe 's findings was the case of an IAF attack on a truck that military intelligence had reported was carrying Grad rockets .
After the attack , which killed 8 Palestinians , including 4 Hamas gunmen , it was determined that the truck was transporting gas canisters .
Tibi :
No reason to acknowledge IDF inquiry
MK Ahmed Tibi ( United Arab List ) on Wednesday criticized the findings of the probe , saying " there 's no reason to acknowledge the IDF inquiry , which comes from a murderous , secretive , and moaning army known for being murderous and for complaints and cover-ups . "
Tibi said " if these hundreds of civilians were killed knowingly , that is a war crime , and under Israeli law , it is considered even more severe . "
Tibi added that he is " not surprised that the IDF has refused to cooperate with UN probes of mass killings in Gaza . "
Head of the Hadash party Mohammed Barakeh also blasted the report , saying those who performed the inquiry are obscuring the truth about " war crimes that Israel committed in Gaza .
There is a price for committing war crimes , and also for mistakes that cause war crimes . "
Barakeh also criticized the source of the inquiry , saying " military officials are not commissions of inquiry , there are a part of the system that perpetrated these crimes , and is carrying out a cover - up . "
Barakeh added that eventually those responsible for the " war crimes " will be brought to trial " from those at the top of the pyramid , all the way down to rank - and - file soldiers . "
Human rights group B'Tselem : IDF inquiry flawed
An Israeli human rights group , B'Tselem , called the military 's investigation flawed .
and said it " does not answer the need for an independent inquiry outside the army that would look at the whole range of violations the army is incapable of looking at . "
" It shows how important it is that Israel cooperate with the fact - finding mission of [ Richard ] Goldstone that would look at violations , " said spokeswoman Sarit Michaeli , speaking on behalf of a group of human rights groups that have made this demand in the past .
Goldstone , a former United Nations chief prosecutor for war crimes , was recently appointed to head a UN investigation into atrocities allegedly committed during Israel 's three - week war against Gaza 's Islamic Hamas rulers .
The investigation called by the UN's Human Rights Council was only supposed to look at Israeli conduct .
But Goldstone did not accept the assignment until the mandate was changed to also examine Palestinian actions .
Israel has not said whether it would cooperate with the Goldstone
investigation .
But it has rejected council investigations in the past , calling them biased .
Among questions being raised is whether Israel used disproportionate force and failed to protect civilians .
In one case , Israeli artillery fire reportedly hit near a UN school where hundreds of Gazans had sought refuge , killing an estimated 42 people .
Israeli said its troops were responding to fire from militants near the school , and both the incident and number of casualties have been disputed /
In another instance , Gazans allege Israeli soldiers ordered 110 civilians into a warehouse , then shelled it the next day , killing 30 .
Israel denies the army targeted the warehouse .
Israel also has been criticized for using white phosphorus weapons , which can be legitimately used in war to create smoke screens or provide illumination .
But rights activists have said its use over populated areas can indiscriminately burn civilians and constitute a war crime .
Israel says its army took great care to avoid harming civilians in Gaza ,
preceding some airstrikes with leaflets or phone calls warning civilians to flee - a contention confirmed by Gaza residents .
Israel is preparing for potential legal action , barring the media from
publishing pictures of officers ' faces and their names for fear of
investigations .
It has promised legal and financial support for any officers facing trial , despite the difficulty of prosecuting Israelis .
Ever wonder why we have the impulse to rock babies to help them calm down ?
Studies show that rocking , spinning and other physical movement through space helps children ’s brain development and their ability to pay attention , by stimulating the vestibular ( inner ear ) system .
And here ’s the thing , this works with both infants and older kids .
It can also be a really fun way for you to cut lose and play with your kids .
So , the next time your little guy is about to lose it , check with him about whether it sounds fun , and then spin around with him in your arms , or take him to a nearby swing - set .
Even hanging upside down can produce vestibular stimulation .
Just make sure he ’s enjoying it , and not getting dizzy or upset .
It never hurts to ask , “ Is this okay ? ”
Believe it or not , when we get lots of motion through space ( like on a swing , dancing , or spinning ) it actually helps our senses work better .
With some well - timed rocking or spinning , stimulation , your little dude could be settling down with his dinosaurs for some sustained play time .
In other words , you may get to shower today !
Hooray !
So here ’s the deal with vestibular stimulation : you want to offer your baby or child lots of it .
As long as she looks content , just keep rocking and / or spinning .
After a while , you ’ll either have a sleepy child , or an awake , alert child .
When babies and children are in the “ awake - alert ” state , they ’re most open to learning new information .
So , in a way , vestibular stimulation helps the brain decide whether it ’s ready for more learning , or needs sleep to help process what ’s already been learned .
When you have an awake - alert baby or young child it ’s a perfect time to get out a few favorite toys , or a new puzzle , sit back , and enjoy your little ones as they learn and grow .
When I worked in Montessori schools , we ’d often use this tool to help our most active kids settle in to their work .
If we noticed someone wandering around , bothering other kids , and unable to decide what activity to choose - we ’d just send him or her out to the swings for five minutes .
After a few minutes of swinging , the child would almost magically come back into the classroom , decide on an activity , sit down and really concentrate for a half an hour or more !
I sometimes could n’t believe it was the same kid .
So , enjoy this new tool and use it whenever your kid seems unfocused , erratic , or is just looking for trouble .
I ’d love to hear your comments about this topic and your stories about trying it out .
Please leave your thoughts or stories in the box below .
Warmly ,

Ontario Superior Court Justice John Hamilton today acquitted beverage entrepreneur Frank D'Angelo of sexual assault after a one - day trial yesterday .
D'Angelo , who turns 50 this week , testified that while he did have sex with the now 22 - year - old woman on June 3 , 2007 , in a hotel room , it was consensual and she initiated it .
The woman , who cannot be identified , said the former Steelback Brewery president forced her to have sexual intercourse after the two had lunch in a restaurant at the Holiday Inn near the Yorkdale shopping mall .
Hamilton said that while he found both witnesses credible and was “ inclined ” to believe both of them , the Crown had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt .
Yesterday in Ontario Superior Court , D'Angelo and his accuser testified as to their recollections about what happened in the Holiday Inn near Dufferin St. and Highway 401 on June 3 , 2007 .
The trial lasted about four hours and featured a bizarre array of references to hair pulling , baldness and age differences in sexual relations .
Both people testified they arranged to have lunch in the hotel restaurant to discuss her working at a summer car race that was sponsored by Steelback Brewery .
At the time , D'Angelo was president of the company .
The woman had had sporadic , non-romantic contact over the years with D'Angelo , whom she met through her father , a business associate .
She sometimes ate free at one of the businessman 's restaurants and accepted a 46 - inch flat screen television as a present .
D'Angelo testified he chose to meet at the hotel after booking a room there because the air conditioner at his 8,000 - square - foot home in Forest Hill had stopped working .
The hotel was also near the rink where D'Angelo played hockey , he said .
Prosecutor Mary Misener , however , told court D'Angelo rented the room intending to lure the woman upstairs for sex .
D'Angelo repeatedly denied he was the aggressor .
He may have acted inappropriately in having sex with the young woman , he said , but said she initiated the encounter .
She " rolled over and kissed me , " he said .
Defence lawyer Clewley said the young woman was looking for a rich boyfriend .

" They had sex .
She regretted it and here we are , " Clewley said .
There 's " not a stitch of evidence to corroborate her account , it 's simply her word . "
The woman insisted D'Angelo forced her to have sex .
" I was trying to stop him , " she said .
She told court he removed her clothing , pulled her by her hair and demanded she say she was enjoying herself .
The encounter lasted about an hour , she said .
She was left with a bump on the back of her head , she said .
After sex , D'Angelo took a shower and the two left the hotel room together , she told court .
He walked her to the parking lot and kissed her goodbye .
" He said what happens between us stays between us , " she testified .
She returned to her apartment and told her two girlfriends she had been raped by D'Angelo .
The following day , she filed a complaint with police .
Clewley told Justice Hamilton , that , in their day , the age difference between D'Angelo and his accuser would have been significant but that is no longer the case .

Ed note : Our embed Rhys Southan is following today 's AIG protest from the inside .
His first dispatch can be found here .
Several hours after the protest was set to begin , it 's looking like today 's much - hyped protest against AIG ( AIG ) and its execs is a total bust .
At this point , we 're waiting outside of AIGFP HQ , and still waiting for another bus to arrive .
But we 've heard that that bus is being followed by 20 vans of media .
Once again , it seems the media is much more interested than anyone who 's actually protesting .
The protesters did make an attempt to get the attention of AIG execs , by going to the homes of two of them and dropping off letters about people who have lost their fortunes in the financial meltdown .
It 's not clear what effect , if any , that had , or if the AIG execs even got the letters .
One amusing anecdote :
The protesters stopped at one point in an organic grocery store and were suprised to learn that many AIG execs were shoppers there , and that according to the store 's proprietor , they were actually very nice people .
The flummoxed protesters spent several minutes outside trying to figure out how such " evil " people could be nice to an organic grocer .

The asteroid 1996 HW1 is a chunk of rock over 3.5 kilometers across .
Its 3 - year orbit around the Sun is a little odd : it 's elliptical , going out as far as the main asteroid belt , but then dipping back in to get only 19 million kilometers or so from the Earth 's orbit .
This makes it a Near Earth Object , or NEO , though not really a dangerous one .
It belongs to a class of asteroids called Amors , which have similar orbits .
But what does it look like ?
What shape is it ?
It 's too small to be resolved even by big telescopes , so you might think we can't determine its shape .
Ah , but we 're clever , we evolved monkeys .
Turns out , we do n't have to see it all that well to figure out its shape .
I present to you the shape of NEO 1996 HW1 , as determined by the good folks at the Table Mountain Observatory : How .
Freaking .
Awesome .
Is .
That ?
There 's another view on that link , looking " down " on it so to speak .
But how did they get the shape of this thing ?
Between July 2008 and January 2009 , Michael Hicks , Heath Rhoades , and James Somers observed the asteroid over many occasions .
As 1996 HW1 moves around the Sun , the amount of sunlit surface we see changes ( just like the Moon goes through phases ) .
If it were a perfect sphere , then we can predict exactly how much light we would see from it as our angle to it changes .
But then , we could do that if it were , say , a cube , too !
Or a banana - shape , or an axisymmetric epicycloid ( a figure - 8 shape that has loomed large in my life ; remind me to tell you that story someday ) .
In fact , it 's possible , given enough observations , to determine the rough shape of any object from measuring how its brightness changes over time .
This method is called light curve inversion .
A light curve is the plot of brightness over time .
You feed those numbers into some pretty fierce equations which determine the shape of the object .
Since normally you use the shape to get the light curve , this method is the inverse of that .
That 's where the name comes from .
And we know this method works , because it 's been used to predict the shapes of asteroids which were later found to be accurate when high - resolution images of asteroids were obtained !
Science !
I love this stuff .
Incredible .
In the animation you can see that HW1 is elongated .
I also noticed that the rotation period ( mentioned in the Table Mountain page ) is long for a small asteroid , about 9 hours .
Most small asteroids spin faster than that , which is interesting .
Why so slow ?
I suspect it 's suffering from the YORP effect , where sunlight can slow the spin of an asteroid .
This is strongest in asymmetric rocks , and HW1 is clearly not terribly symmetric , so this may indeed be the case .
This method of shape fitting is incredibly powerful .
We can learn a lot from just a few observations , and of course the more data we get , and the more accurate they are , the better a fit we can get to an asteroid 's shape , and the more we can learn about them .
And need I remind you , these rocks are not all safe .
Some of them have orbits which do cross ours , and one the size of HW1 is big enough to cause a mass extinction .
So hear me well when I say that the more we know about these asteroids , the better .
And all of this can be learned without ever leaving the comfy confines of our little blue planet !
So when we do venture out to visit these interplanetary rogues , we 'll have a much better idea of what they 're about .
And that is the shape of things to come .
The orbit of 1996 HW1 is in blue .
In September 2008 it dove near the Earth in its elliptical orbit , passing about 20 million km away .

According to Lieutenant - Colonel Xavier Guimard 's calculations , the French police plans to save a bundle by migrating to complete Open Source desktop and web applications .
Such is the news from the European Commission 's Open Source Observatory and Repository ( OSOR ) .
Guimard reported about the migration of Microsoft to Ubuntu at a conference in Utrecht : " This year the IT budget will be reduced by 70 percent .
This will not affect our IT systems . "
Most of the savings will be in proprietary software licenses .
Much of the previous budget flowed into conventional Office applications .
Up to 2004 the Gendarmerie needed about 12,000 to 15,000 of these licenses annually , whereas in 2005 they acquired only 27 .
Guimard says , " Since July 2007 we have bought two hundred Microsoft licences .
If one of us wants a new PC , it comes with Ubuntu .
This encourages our users to migrate . "
The Gendarmerie has about 105,000 policeman .
2004 was the beginning of their transition to Open Source , mainly because one of their concerned accountants decided to switch to OpenOffice on his own .
Because of subsequent Microsoft lobbying , the general manager found out about the experiment and was resolved to install OpenOffice on all of the agency 's desktops .
Even though conventional wisdom might support training for Open Source migration , the agency decided to dispense with it , with the attitude " users need no training to use a web browser . "
According to Guimard , the move to Ubuntu incurred minimal complications : " The two biggest differences are the icons and the games .
Games are not our priority . "
The European OSOR recently reported case studies of open source migration for two entities , the Swiss Federal Court and the French Gendarmerie , with details on the latter here .
Understanding Git : Merging
In This Section
Merging
After you have finished implementing a new feature on a branch , you want to bring that new feature into the main branch , so that everyone can use it .
You can do so with the git merge or git pull command .
The syntax for the commands is as follows :
git merge [ head ] git pull . [ head ]
They are identical in result .
( Though the merge form seems simpler for now , the reason for the pull form will become apparent when discussing multiple developers . )
These commands perform the following operations .
Let the current head be called current , and the head to be merged called merge .
Identify the common ancestor of current and merge .
Call it ancestor - commit .
Deal with the easy cases .
If the ancestor - commit equals merge , then do nothing .
If ancestor - commit equals current , then do a fast forward merge .
Otherwise , determine the changes between the ancestor - commit and merge .
Attempt to merge those changes into the files in current .
If there were no conflicts , create a new commit , with two parents , current and merge .
Set current ( and HEAD ) to point to this new commit , and update the working files for the project accordingly .
If there was a conflict , insert appropriate conflict markers and inform the user .
No commit is created .
Important note :
Git can get very confused if there are uncommitted changes in the files when you ask it to perform a merge .
So make sure to commit whatever changes you have made so far before you merge .
So , to complete the above example , say you check out the master head again and finish writing up the new data for your paper .
Now you want to bring in those changes you made to the headers .
The repository looks like this :
+---------- ( D) / | ( A ) -- ( B ) -- ( C ) --------------
( E ) | | fix -headers master | HEAD
where ( E ) is the commit reflecting the completed version with the new data .
You would run :
git merge fix - headers
If there are no conflicts , the resulting respository looks like this :
+----------
( D) ---------------+ / | \ ( A ) -- ( B ) -- ( C ) --------------
( E ) -- ( F ) | | fix -headers master | HEAD
The merge commit is ( F ) , having parents ( D ) and ( E ) .
Because ( B ) is the common ancestor between ( D ) and ( E ) , the files in ( F ) should contain the changes between ( B ) and ( D ) , namely the heading fixes , incorporated into the files from ( E ) .
Note on terminology :
When I say “ merge head A into head B , ” I mean that head B is the current head , and you are drawing changes from head A into it .
Head B gets updated ; nothing is done to head A . ( If you replace the word “ merge ” with the word “ pull , ” it may make more sense . )
Resolving Conflicts
A conflict arises if the commit to be merged in has a change in one place , and the current commit has a change in the same place .
Git has no way of telling which change should take precedence .
To resolve the commit , edit the files to fix the conflicting changes .
Then run git add to add the resolved files , and run git commit to commit the repaired merge .
Git remembers that you were in the middle of a merge , so it sets the parents of the commit correctly .
Fast Forward Merges
A fast forward merge is a simple optimization for merging .
Say your repository looks like this :
+-- ( D ) -- ( E ) / | ( A ) -- ( B ) -- ( C ) | | | current to - merge | HEAD
and you run git merge to - merge .
In this case , all Git needs to do is set current to point to ( E ) .
Since ( C ) is the common ancestor , there are no changes to actually “ merge . ”
Hence , the resulting merged repository looks like :
+-- ( D ) -- ( E ) / | ( A ) -- ( B ) -- ( C ) | | to -merge , current | HEAD
That is , to - merge and current both point to commit ( E ) , and HEAD still points to current .
Note an important difference : no new commit object is created for the merge .
Git only shifts the head pointers around .
Common Merge Use Patterns
There are two common reasons to merge two branches .
The first , as explained above , is to draw the changes from a new feature branch into the main branch .
The second use pattern is to draw the main branch into a feature branch you are developing .
This keeps the feature branch up to date with the latest bug fixes and new features added to the main branch .
Doing this regularly reduces the risk of creating a conflict when you merge your feature into the main branch .
One disadvantage of doing the above is that your feature branch will end up with a lot of merge commits .
An alternative that solves this problem is rebasing , although that comes with problems of its own .
Deleting a Branch
After you have merged a development branch into the main branch , you probably do n’t need the development branch anymore .
Hence , you may want to delete it so it does n’t clutter your git branch listing .
To delete a branch , use git branch -d [ head ] .
This simply removes the specified head from the repository ’s list of heads .
For example , in this repository from above :
+----------
( D) ---------------+ / | \ ( A ) -- ( B ) -- ( C ) --------------
( E ) -- ( F ) | | fix -headers master | HEAD
we probably do n’t need the fix - headers head any more .
So we can use :
git branch -d fix - headers
and the resulting repository looks like :
+----------
( D) ---------------+ / \ ( A ) -- ( B ) -- ( C ) --------------
( E ) -- ( F ) | master | HEAD
Important note : git branch -d will cause an error if the branch to be deleted is not reachable from another head .
Why ?
Consider the following repository :
+----------- ( E ) / | ( A ) -- ( B ) -- ( C ) | | | head1 head2
Say you delete head2 .
Now how can you use commit ( E ) ?
You ca n’t check it out , because it is n’t a head .
And it does n’t appear in any logs or anywhere else , because it is n’t an ancestor of head1 .
So commit ( E ) is practically useless .
In Git terminology , it is a “ dangling commit , ” and its information is lost .
Git does allow you to use the - D option to force deletion of a branch that would create a dangling commit .
However , it should be a rare situation that you want to do that .
Think very carefully before using git branch - D .

MOSCOW , March 19 ( Reuters ) - China and other emerging nations back Russia ’s call for a discussion on how to replace the dollar as the world ’s primary reserve currency , a senior Russian government source said on Thursday .
Russia has proposed the creation of a new reserve currency , to be issued by international financial institutions , among other measures in the text of its proposals to the April G20 summit published last Monday .
Calls for a rethink of the dollar ’s status as world ’s sole benchmark currency come amid concerns about its long - term value as the U.S. Federal Reserve moved to pump more than a trillion dollars of new cash into the ailing economy late Wednesday .
Russia met representatives of China , India and Brazil ahead of the G20 finance ministers meeting last week , as the big emerging powers seek to up their influence on decisionmaking globally .
Their first ever joint communique did not mention a new currency but the source said the issue was discussed .
“ They ( China ) did not formally put forward their position for the G20 summit but unofficially they had distributed their paper regarding the same ideas ( the need for the new currency ) , ” the source told Reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The source said the Chinese paper envisaged the International Monetary Fund ’s Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) being first assigned a role of a clearing currency on some transactions and then gradually becoming the main global reserve currency .
“ They said that the role of reserve currency should be given to SDR , ” the source said .
A U.N. panel of experts is also looking at using expanded SDRs , originally created by the International Monetary Fund in 1969 , but now used mainly as an accounting unit within similar organisations as a new reserve currency instead of the dollar .
Currency specialist Avinash Persaud , a member of the U.N. panel , told a Reuters Funds Summit on Wednesday that the proposal was to create something like the old Ecu , or European currency unit , that was a hard - traded , weighted basket .
The SDR and the old Ecu are essentially combinations of currencies , weighted to a constituent ’s economic clout , which can be valued against other currencies and against those inside the basket .
The Russian source said Moscow was aware that the emergence of the new global currency would not happen overnight and said its goal was to initiate a discussion about it at the G20 summit in London on April 2 .
The source said that India did not object to the discussion but was not prepared to take the lead .
The source said South Korea and South Africa backed the idea , while developed nations were not “ allergic ” to it .
“ We are not waiting for everyone to say : ‘ How beautifully it has all been formulated , let ’s subscribe to it ’ , ” the source said .
“ The main idea is to start a discussion about it . ”
Russia holds about half of its reserves , the world ’s third - largest , in dollars , with the rest in euros and pounds .
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called on reserve currency issuers to show more financial discipline .
Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin told reporters on the sidelines of the G20 finance ministers meeting that it would take up to 30 years to create a new super - currency , suggesting there was no unity in Russia on the issue .
President Dmitry Medvedev ’s top economic aide and G20 sherpa Arkady Dvorkovich is behind the Kremlin ’s G20 proposals , made public one day after Kudrin returned from England .

I have to ask , why does Hollywood assume that we wo n’t buy good DVDs at the end of April ?
It ’s the same with movie releases .
It ’s as if they think that people would prefer to watch a movie on a sunny May or June day than a cold and rainy March or April afternoon .
I ’m really having a hard time picking this week , we ’ve got The Beethoven Pooch Pack , that ’s right a boxed set of all 5 Beethoven movies !!!!
There ’s also Anne Hathaway ’s latest Bride Wars , but I ’m pretty sure she ’s not topless in this one so it ’s out .
If you ’re looking for TV there are a few interesting selections coming out this week like X - Men , Volumes 1 and 2 , American Dad ! , Vol. 4 , and Star Trek : The Original Series – Season 1 [ Blu-ray ] , but I do n’t think I ’m enthusiastic enough about them to pick any of them .
So , since I have n’t found any worthy DVDs this week I ’m going to have to pick a book again , in fact it looks like I ’m going to have to pick a Scott Sigler book again .
So ( hmm , two sentences in a row that started with so ) , this weeks DVD Pick of the Week is The Rookie by Scott Sigler .
Set in a lethal pro football league 700 years in the future , THE ROOKIE is a story that combines the intense gridiron action of “ Any Given Sunday ” with the space opera style of “ Star Wars ” and the criminal underworld of “ The Godfather . ”
Aliens and humans alike play positions based on physiology , creating receivers that jump 25 feet into the air , linemen that bench - press 1,200 pounds , and linebackers that literally want to eat you .
Organized crime runs every franchise , games are fixed and rival players are assassinated .
Follow the story of Quentin Barnes , a 19 - year - old quarterback prodigy that has been raised all his life to hate , and kill , those aliens .
Quentin must deal with his racism and learn to lead , or he ’ll wind up just another stat in the column marked “ killed on the field . ”
I first read ( listened to ) The Rookie a few years ago ( partially on the way to a Pittsburgh Pirates game , different sport but it worked ) , when Sigler first released it as a free audiobook .
He ’s released all of his books for free on his site and I recommend you check them out .
Of course , I only actually picked his book because I want to be one of the survivors after the FDO ™ takes over the planet .

From the get go , the Bespin project means a few different things .
One of the components is the Bespin Editor component itself .
We have already seen people taking that piece and plugging it into their system .
For example , the XWiki integration .
The problem is that we ( Bespin team ) have n’t done a good job at making this reuse as easy as it should be .
That has now changed with the edition of the bespin.editor .
Component class that tries to wrap up the various parts and pieces that the editor can tie into ( settings , toolbars , command lines , server and file access ) so you do n’t have to think about them .
A common use case will be embedding the editor itself , and having it load up some content , maybe from a container div itself .
I created a sample editor to do just this :
There is a video of this in action , comically in 2 x speed for some reason on Vimeo :)
Since this is a sample , there are things that you can do , that you probably would n’t in your case .
To embed the editor component you will be able to simply do this ( NOTE :
We have n’t deployed this version to production yet , so for now you need to load up Bespin on your own server , sorry ! ) :
< script src = " https://bespin.mozilla.com/embed.js " ></ script > < script > var _editorComponent ; //
Loads and configures the objects that the editor needs dojo .
addOnLoad ( function ( ) { _editorComponent = new bespin. editor .
Component ( ' editor ' , { syntax : " js " , loadfromdiv : true } ) ; } ) ; </ script > < div id = " editor " style = " height : 300 px ; border : 10 px solid #ddd ; - moz - border - radius : 10 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 10 px ; " > var foo = " whee " ; function flubber ( ) { return " tweeble " ; } </ div >
First we read in the embed wrapper code , which relies on Dojo ( so Dojo has to be loaded first ) .
Then we create a component passing in the HTML tag to inject into , and options which in this case tell it to use JavaScript syntax highlighting , and then load up the editor using the value in the div that we are injecting into .
At this point the editor is ready to go .
You can focus on the puppy and start typing , but chances are you want to access the editor text at some point ( for example , read from it and post it up to a form ) .
To mimic this , we have a textarea that we can copy contents into ( editor.getContent( ) ) , and then send it back to the editor ( editor.setContent( contents ) ) :
function copyToTextarea ( ) { dojo .
byId ( ' inandout ' ) . value = _editorComponent .
getContent ( ) ; } function copyToEditor ( ) { _editorComponent .
setContent ( dojo .
byId ( ' inandout ' ) . value ) ; }
The example also shows how you can change settings for the editor via editor.
set ( key , value ) .
There are more features we should probably put into the editor , such as automatically syncing to a hidden textarea with an id that you specify ( so then a form can just be submitted and the backend gets the right stuf ) .
What else do we need ?

Advertisement A ceremony has been held in Basra to mark the official end of the six - year British military mission in Iraq .
UK combat operations ended as 20th Armoured Brigade took part in a flag - lowering ceremony with a US brigade .
Gordon Brown said the operation in Iraq had been a " success story " because of UK troops ' efforts .
But the Stop the War Coalition said it had been a disaster and the 179 British military deaths were made more acute by the pointlessness of the UK presence .
Mr Brown , who held talks with Iraqi prime minister Nouri Maliki in Downing Street , said : " Today Iraq is a success story .
" We owe much of that to the efforts of British troops .
Our mission has not always been an easy one , many have said that we would fail .
I think when the history is written of this campaign , they will say of the British military : ' We did a superb job '
John Hutton
Defence Secretary
In pictures : British withdrawal " Britain can be proud of our legacy that we leave there . "
Mr Maliki said : " There are people in Iraq who want the government to fail but our army and armed forces are ready to face these challenges . "
Although Britain may be pulling its troops out of Iraq a month ahead of schedule , the row over why they were sent there in the first place in support of a US - led invasion looks set to continue .
Opposition leader David Cameron called for an immediate full inquiry into the Iraq war , similar to the one carried out by the Franks Committee into the Falklands conflict .
He said : " After years of foot - dragging , I believe it is the time for the government to announce a proper Franks - style inquiry .
" Instead of starting in many months ' time , it should start right now .
" There are vital lessons to learn and we need to learn them rapidly and the only justification for delay can , I 'm afraid , be a political one . "
In Basra itself , Defence Secretary John Hutton attended a memorial service for the military personnel killed in the conflict .
UK CASUALTIES IN IRAQ
Full details on every casualty
The focus was a memorial wall featuring the names of the 234 UK and foreign troops and civilians who lost their lives under British command in Iraq .
The names of those who died , including Italian , Dutch , Danish , American and Romanian troops , were read out before the Last Post was sounded and prayers said .
Then there was a loud roar in the sky as a Tornado aircraft flew over in tribute .
Those attending the service were adamant the British presence in Basra had been a force for good .
Lt Col Edward Chamberlain , commanding officer of Iraq - based battalion 5 Rifles , said : " We 've been slowly working , as part of a coalition together over the six years , to achieve an end - state which is an Iraq which is secure , happy , at peace with itself and its neighbours .
" We 're slowly but surely transitioning towards that . "
Mr Hutton said British troops had fought " a long and hard campaign " .
He added : " There 's been no question about that , and we 've paid a very high price .

" But I think when the history is written of this campaign , they will say of the British military : ' We did a superb job ' . "
British forces began their official pull - out last month when the UK's commander in the south of the country , Maj Gen Andy Salmon , handed over to a US general .
The civilian death toll in Basra as a result of the conflict is estimated at between 3,302 and 3,766 , according to data from the Iraq Body Count .
Asked about the UK presence in Iraq , the country 's president , Jalal Talabani , told BBC News that the mission had been one of liberation .
" In the past the British forces came to occupy against the will of the Iraqi people , " he said .
" This time they came here to liberate Iraqi people from the worst kind of dictatorship . "
But the UK Stop the War Coalition said : " The British soldiers will leave Basra in a much worse condition than they found it , its population depleted and demoralised , its infrastructure devastated . "
BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt says there is a sense of relief for many British servicemen and women that their final tour of Iraq is ending .
Some were serving on their fourth tour , taking them away from home for two years out of the last six .
But the BBC's John Simpson says many ordinary Iraqis in Basra are worried that the Americans who will replace them will be much more aggressive .

Yes , a 9 out of a possible 9 .
Did the patient gain new insight ?
Not in today 's session - a 2 on the 9 - point scale .
Painstaking work like theirs , translating complex human interactions into hard data points , may be the last , best hope for saving what remains of Sigmund Freud - by showing that the style of deep , prolonged talk therapy he originated can work .
Freudian therapy rose early in the 20th century and reigned supreme for decades , dominating American psychiatry and permeating popular thinking with concepts like ego , repression , and the Oedipal complex .
Psychoanalysts often developed years - long relationships with patients , delving into childhood memories , dreams , and hidden desires .
More recently , however , Freud 's ideas have lost favor , and his style of therapy has fallen on hard times , victim of cost - conscious insurers and a focus on mental illness as biological brain disease .
This decline has only been accelerated by many practitioners ' insistence that what goes on between a therapist and a patient is too individual to lend itself to scientific research .
Left largely without studies demonstrating its positive effects , long - term talk therapy has been hard - put to justify itself to insurers , patients , and grant - givers .
Treatment has shifted to drugs and quicker types of therapy with more evidence to back them up .
They include cognitive behavioral therapy , which aims to change thinking and behavior in the here and now , and often lasts just a few weeks .
Of 650,000 therapists in the country , probably fewer than 200 make their living practicing traditional psychoanalysis , estimated Jonathan Engel , author of the new book , " American Therapy : The Rise of Therapy in the United States . "
At Mass .
General and elsewhere , researchers are ramping up a fight for long - term psychotherapy 's survival , producing research that shows it helps some patients , and casts some light on how .
One apparent finding : Just as the therapy lasts longer , it appears that its beneficial effects may often last longer .
The research efforts stem from the fear among practitioners that " we need to establish a new evidence base and wed better do it soon , " said Raymond Levy , clinical director of the hospital 's Psychotherapy Research Program .
In October , a review in the Journal of the American Medical Association supported longterm " psychodynamic psychotherapy " for patients with complex mental disorders .
The review of 23 studies reported that in a pool of more than 1,000 patients , long - term psycho - dynamic therapy - lasting at least a year , or 50 sessions - was significantly more effective at relieving symptoms than shorter - term therapy .
As may or may not be aware , there is this movie coming out called Midgets vs. Mascots , which looks to be pretty interesting .
Personally , I have always been a fan of mascot humor , so I hope the final cut is entertaining .
It definitely has a good premise to work with .
We at Gunaxin have been lucky enough to host a pre-party for the movie before a screening at the Tribeca Film Festival next week .
So in anticipation of that event , we came up with a Top Ten Midgets Little People ranking earlier this week .
Those who cracked the top list include noted thespians Warwick Davis and Peter Dinklage .
So , it was only natural to generate a reciprocal listing of the top ten mascots .
Who could crack that list ?
I must tell you that selecting only ten mascots is pretty difficult .
You start with sports , which is what most people think of when they hear the word mascot .
Baseball alone has given us such greats like the Phillie Phanatic and Youppi ! ( who since migrated over to hockey ) .
Basketball , Football , and even Hockey have followed suit , meaning there are over a hundred to choose from just from the professional ranks of the major sports .
Next , you toss in colleges .
There are hundreds of those around , even if half of them use the nickname Wildcats or Tigers .
The UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs are particularly unique .
How do I choose from so many ?
I have n’t even touched on the Olympics and its mascots yet .
Since sports fans are often quite passionate about their own teams , I ’m guessing when I narrow it down to only ten , many people will be upset that their favorite team or college was n’t chosen .
It ’s bound to happen .
But yet , there are plenty of mascots beyond the realm of sports .
Advertisers have used mascots for an assortment of goods , ranging from things like the Big Boy to Mrs. Butterworth to the Marlboro Man .
And then there ’s the random odd mascot , like Mr. Testicles , whose work is to raise awareness about male cancer .
And let me tell you , there ’s really is nothing like a shorn scrotum …it ’s breathtaking .
So I ’ve taken it all into account and determined this is our Top Ten :
10 . The Noid
Less a corporate mascot and more of a spokesvillain , the Noid was an evil red-suited character with rabbit ears created by Domino’s .
His raison d’être appeared to be to attempt to ruin your pizza ( he did n’t seem too successful ) .
Although to be fair , I ’m not sure Domino ’s needs any help with that thanks to employees like Kristy Lynn Hammonds and Michael Anthony Setzer .
Created in 1986 , the Noid enticed you to buy Domino ’s since they were the the only ones who could “ Avoid the Noid ” and get a tasty pizza pie to your house .
Of course , the motives behind the Noid were mysterious .
Usually you can understand why a character does something .
Hell , there ’s an entire segment of cereal marketing based around characters trying to steal the product because they want to eat it ( Trix , Cookie Crisp , Fruity Pebbles , etc… ) .
Contrast that to the Noid , who had no clear influence .
I mean what kind of soulless bastard would ruin a good pizza ?
No one could deconstruct or analyze the Noid ’s motivations .
He was little more than an inane relentless destructive force who lived to ruin pizzas in any way possible .
Sadly , the Noid was put out to pasture in 1992 , and Domino ’s would move on to other mascots , such as the crust mutant Andy ( “ Good Andy . Bad Pizza . ” )
The Noid was so wildly popular that he inspired two video games .
In 1989 , “ Avoid the Noid ” was used to cross- promote the pizza chain , and in 1990 Capcom released “ Yo! Noid ” for the Nintendo .
Though it can be said that not everyone enjoyed the Noid .
In 1989 , Kenneth Noid walked into a Domino ’s outside of Atlanta , Georgia , and held two employees hostage for over five hours because he thought the Noid ads were a personal attack on him .
Quahog Mayor Adam
West was no fan either , as he killed the Noid .
If you ’re still thirsting for more Noid knowledge , check out the Unofficial Noid Homepage .
And check out this ad to see the Noid in action :
9. McGruff the Crime Dog
McGruff is an anthropomorphic bloodhound created by the Ad Council in order to build awareness of crime among children .
Created by John Young for the National Crime Prevention Council , the name McGruff was chosen over such other candidates like “ Sherlock Bones . ”
You decide if they made the right call .
Although the name McGruff lent itself perfectly for the creation of his nephew , “ Scruff McGruff ” .
McGruff ’s patented slogan is , “ Take a bite out of crime ! ”
But I find a delicious amount of irony in the character .
McGruff ’s a dog , but he wears a trench coat .
I know he ’s supposed to be a detective , but dog ’s already have coats .
What ’s more is that he ’s often seen hanging around playgrounds with small children .
To me that does n’t say police , that says flasher .
And I would n’t think you ’d want your anti-crime mascot being a damn pervert .
“ Hey kids , who wants to see my penal code ? ”
Here ’s an old school McGruff Public Service Announcement with a hilarious ginormous phone :
8. Snuggle Bear
I know what you ’re thinking .
You ’re wondering why I ’m including that cute and cuddly teddy bear for Snuggle Fabric Softener ?
The same bear that ’s been pedaling dryer add - ons since 1983 .
Yes , I ’m really doing it , but with good reason .
For one , he ’s pretty well known .
But that ’s only the start .
And yes , I find amusement in the fact numerous Snuggle Bears have been recalled due to being “ choking hazards . ”
It just seems so odd to think of Snuggle as a dangerous toy .
But the real reason the bear is on this list is thanks to appearances via parody in two BattleTanx commercials for the Nintendo 64 .
If you do n’t remember seeing them , they ’re worth checking out .
Who does n’t want to see a flaming Teddy Bear coughing up stuffing or being re-built six million dollar man style ?
It basically takes an established well known mascot , and takes it to a whole nother echelon .
Watch the little bear get pwned :
7. Stanford Tree
This belongs into the “ it ’s so bad it ’s good ” category .
For reference , Stanford University ’s nickname is “ The Cardinal ” .
Not the bird , the color cardinal red .
However , the school has yet to adequately convey the fierceness and sporting prowess it had hoped to symbolize with that particular shade of sanguine .
Enter the Stanford Band , which put together the infamous tree .
Sure you might think an excellent institution such as Stanford would be able to come up with something better than this .
But there ’s some logic to the choice , as a tree appears on the official seal of the University plus on the municipal seal of Palo Alto , Stanford ’s host city .
Yeah , the tree looks like it was put together by third graders from the discarded parts of twenty other mascots , but it works .
He dances , he drinks ( it was caught drinking from a flask at a game and banned from performing due to failing a breathalyzer test ) , and he has funky red lips and giant eyes .
He also has been known to get involved with some other debauchery .
One thing is for sure , you ’ll remember this ridiculous - looking monstrosity .
Here ’s Sports Center ’s John Anderson and the Stanford Tree in an awkward moment :
6. Duffman
The enthusiastic mascot and spokesman who is basically a guy in a costume that creates awareness of Duff in the Simpsonsverse .
As an employee of the fictional Duff Beer company , he ’s an often underutilized resident of Springfield .
The smooth - talking mascot can usually be seen donning blue and red tights , a red cape , and white gloves with the Duff logo emblazoned across his chest .
He also sports a red hat , dark sunglasses , and a “ utility belt ” of eight beer cans around his waist .
In addition to his snazzy outfit , he ’s the proud creator of such quips as :
“ This brown spot needs a little H2 - oh , yeah ! ”
“ Duff Man … says a lot of things !
Oh , yeah ! ”
“ Are you ready to get DUFFED ? ”
Here ’s Duffman ’s song , “ Oh Yeah ” by Yellow :
5 . The Suns Gorilla
Our first professional sports mascot on our ranking , he is the official mascot of the Phoenix Suns and is sometimes referred to as “ Go ” .
Like any good mascot , he has his typical antics , but he ’s known most for his entertaining dunks .
He ’s also appeared as a secret character in the video game NBA Jam and its copycat arcade style hoops games .
A charter member of the Mascot Hall of Fame , the Suns Gorilla is basically the most well known of the NBA mascots .
Sorry to Benny the Bull , Hugo The Hornet , and the Toronto Raptor for not picking you , but I had to take someone .
Here ’s one of his dunks from All - Star Weekend :
4. Racing Sausages
We can thank the Milwaukee Brewers for this great cultural phenomena and spawning a legion of similar “ races ” throughout stadiums .
Although Bernie Brewer might be the team ’s official mascot , these sausages help represent the club in addition to their official sponsorship of Klement ’s Sausage Company .
The Sausage Race itself started as a virtual race on the team ’s Jumbotron , with the first real sausages introduced as a lark to appease kids .
The earliest record of a live sausage race was on Sunday , May 29 , 1994 , although it did not become a full time attraction until 2000 .
In the beginning , there were only three sausages : the Bratwurst , the Polish , and the Italian .
The Hot Dog was introduced in the mid-1990s and the Chorizo got its start in 2006 .
The most famous sausage race took place on July 9 , 2003 , when Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon hit the head of the Italian Sausage with a baseball bat , knocking it over and taking the Hot Dog down with it .
Simon was arrested , paid a fine , and was subsequently suspended by Major League Baseball for three games .
Since that incident , T - shirts and other memorabilia popped up with the now infamous words , “ Do n’t whack our wiener ! ”
Here ’s the video of Sausage - gate :
3. Poppin’ Fresh , the Pillsbury Doughboy
As his name suggest , the Pillsbury Doughboy is a small anthropoid character made out of dough .
And he hawks all sorts of refrigerated Pillsbury dough products , with most of the commercials ending with a human finger emerging and poking the Doughboy ’s stomach .
I ’m not sure why he puts up with such assault and battery , but the Doughboy responds by rubbing his stomach and giggling .
I feel the whole thing has a weird creepy vibe to it .
How did the doughboy appear in someone ’s house ?
He seems to emerge and suddenly begins to praise the wonderful flavor and texture .
But is he a cannibal ?
Why does he seem to take pleasure in baking his cousins ( he ’s made of dough after all ) ?
And why is he so happy all the time ?
Comedian Kyle Cease attempts to answer these questions :
and here ’s what happens when the Doughboy finally breaks down and goes nuts :
2. Kool - Aid Man
The official mascot for Kool - Aid drinks ( although pre-1975 he was known simply as “ Pitcher Man ” ) , he ’s basically an enormous pitcher of Kool - Aid .
Begs the question what happens to him if he actually breaks ( no idea , actually ) .
The fun-loving and jolly character would appear to children everywhere sharing his Kool - Aid beverage by crashing though walls and screaming out , “ Oh yeah ! ” .
He was n’t just a wall - crasher however , as he ’d also do activities like play baseball , drive go - karts , and break - dance .
Despite his rotund shape , he ’s actually quite nimble .
And he did it all in the name of his dehydrated sugar - laden fruit drink packets .
Like the Noid , Kool - Aid Man was the subject of two video games ( one for the Atari 2600 and one for the Intellivision ) .
Even though people tend to hate Dane Cook these days , he does have a nice bit on him :
And of course we can’t forget this classic Family Guy clip of the Kool - Aid Man busting into court and slowly backing away ( remix version ) :
1. San Diego Chicken
The San Diego Chicken ( also known as the The Famous Chicken , the KGB Chicken or just The Chicken ) , is simply too famous not to be number one .
He ’s the most popular mascot these days and and probably will always be .
And he was n’t even intended to be a sports mascot .
He was originally an advertising mascot from an animated television commercial for KGB - FM Radio in San Diego .
His popularity quickly grew , to the point he was a regular at San Diego Padres games among other bookings .
His shtick is to be wildly animated , and he loves slapstick , satire , and often makes fun of the players , managers , coaches , referees , and umpires .
You can also credit him for the widespread appearance of mascots throughout professional sports , particularly Major League Baseball .
Here ’s a montage of some of his highlights :

George Carlin was right : this country was bought and paid for a long time ago and it ’s run by the banks and the state .
I knew this but I ’m not sure I understood it until recently .
[ efoods ] I recently took a new job in Milwaukee , Wi .
In preparation for my relocation I called my creditors in an effort to responsibly manage my finances and see if for the month or two that I would be financially overburdened with the move if I could defer my payments .
That small sum of money would be immeasurable in helping us shoulder the costs of relocation .
My new company is reimbursing me , of course , but I still have to incur the costs up front .
My creditors were more than willing to help except for Bank of America .
I was in good standing with BOA and did n’t think it would be a problem .
Unfortunately , it was .
I was told not only would they not grant me a monthly deferment but they were cancelling my credit cards !
This was n’t the first time I had run-in with BOA : I ’ve been banking with them for about 2.5 years , in good standing , but on the rare occasion have overdrawn my checking account using my debit card .
What I noticed was that if a transaction would overdraw my checking account and at the same time there were other pending transactions , BOA would process the largest transaction first , causing all the smaller transactions to overdraw my account to which they would charge me a $ 35 overdraft fee for each one .
They would do this rather than posting the smaller transactions first and posting the largest one last therefore incurring only the one overdraft fee .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A fast - food restaurant within about 500 feet of a school may lead to at least a 5 percent increase in the obesity rate at that school , according to a study released on Friday .
Pedestrians wait to walk across a street near Times Square in New York August 28 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
The study , conducted by economists at Columbia University and the University California , Berkeley , suggests that “ a ban on fast foods in the immediate proximity of schools could have a sizable effect on obesity rates among affected students . ”
The researchers looked at how proximity to the restaurants affected obesity rates among 3 million ninth graders at California schools , and more than 1 million pregnant women in Michigan , New Jersey and Texas .
They focused on the ninth graders , typically about 14 years old , in part because the students get a fitness test in the spring -- about 30 weeks after starting school and exposure to fast food .
The study , released by the American Association of Wine Economists , showed that “ the presence of a fast - food restaurant within a tenth of a mile of a school is associated with at least a 5.2 percent increase in the obesity rate in that school . ”
It also found that pregnant women who lived within a tenth of a mile of a fast - food restaurant had “ a 4.4 percent increase in the probability of gaining over 20 kilos ( 44 pounds ) . ”
The study follows one presented last month at an American Stroke Association conference .
Researchers from the University of Michigan found people who live in neighborhoods packed with fast - food restaurants are more likely to suffer strokes .
In December , a study found that youth who study within a half mile from a fast - food outlet eat fewer fruit and vegetables , drink more soda and are more likely to be obese than students at other schools .
‘A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT ’
Janet Currie , lead researcher of the wine economists ’ study , said that if fast food near schools causes obesity , then having a fast - food - free zone might be good policy .
“ It would not be so different in spirit from existing policies that aim to prohibit soft drinks and junk foods in schools , or to improve the quality of school lunch , ” she said .
A spokeswoman for Yum !
Brands , the parent company of KFC , Pizza Hut , Taco Bell and Long John Silver ’s , declined to comment , saying she had not seen the study .
Burger King did not return calls seeking comment .
A McDonald ’s spokeswoman referred calls to the National Retail Federation , a trade group in Washington .
“ I think it would be a dangerous precedent to limit the types of legitimate , important businesses and where they ’re located in a city , ” federation spokeswoman Ellen Davis said .
“ Does n’t it make more sense for parents to limit a child ’s allowance or let them know when and where they ca n’t eat certain things ? ”
Davis added that restaurants have changed their menus in the last five years , especially for children ’s meals .
“ We see many healthy options available -- slices of apple , milk instead of sodas ... .
It ’s important to note that many chain restaurants have tried to diversify their menus and make them more healthy . ”
Radiohead
James Frost directed this video off Radiohead ’s In Rainbows .
If you ’re confused by what ’s going on , here ’s a brief explanation pilfered from the YouTube blurb :
In Radiohead ’s new video for “ House of Cards ” , no cameras or lights were used .
Instead , 3D plotting technologies collected information about the shapes and relative distances of objects .
The video was created entirely with visualizations of that data .
Radiohead has been keeping me company since Pablo Honey .
I ’m not a good critic of their work because I can’t find anything to criticize .
I do n’t wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts Forget about your house of cards
And I ’ll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I ’ll do mine Fall off the table ,
And get swept under
Denial , denial
The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband ‘ good night ’
Forget about your house of cards
And I ’ll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I ’ll do mine Fall off the table ,
And get swept under Denial , denial
Denial , denial
Your ears are burning
Denial , denial
Your ears should be burning

VANCOUVER – An office stapler .
Nothing special , right ?
But since Robert Dziekanski picked one up at the Vancouver airport when confronted by four Mounties on a fateful morning in 2007 , it has become a symbol of growing public outrage with the RCMP over the Polish immigrant 's death .
Week after week , the Braidwood Commission of Inquiry looking into the death has heard the four Mounties massage earlier statements about Dziekanski's actions – including with the stapler – as well as their own .
Or , as senior officer Cpl. Benjamin ( Monty ) Robinson , the final Mountie to testify this week , explained : " I was mistaken , but I was telling the truth . "
It 's not true , insisted Robinson , that he took Dziekanski 's pulse with his work glove on .
Or that he put the weight of his knee on the man 's neck , rather than on his shoulders .
He discounts scenes from an amateur video shot by bystander Paul Pritchard that seem to show otherwise , with the comment : " I do n't know how you 're interpreting it , but I 'm telling you what I did . "
It 's clear the public grasps inconsistencies in RCMP testimony about what happened early on Oct. 14 , 2007 , when Dziekanski , 40 , was pronounced dead at the scene .
He 'd been zapped five times by an RCMP
Taser , including after he lay writhing on the ground , screaming in pain .
" You 're assuming he was screaming in pain , " Robinson corrected .
Faith in the Mounties appears to be nose - diving .
A recent Harris - Decima poll for The Canadian Press shows 60 per cent of respondents feel the officers used excessive force on Dziekanski .
Polish Canadians recently started an online petition against the officers through Facebook , and readers routinely fire off critical emails to the Star .
Wrote Lynne Earle from Slave Lake , Alta. : " A sad day for the Force and Joe Public 's faith in the system . "
This week , RCMP Cpl.
Peter Thiessen , a senior media relations officer , told inquiry reporters : " This is a lose - lose situation for everybody ...
We are certainly sensitive to the fact the public trust is at a level we would rather not see it at . "
Opposition parliamentarians describe a " crisis of confidence " and fear damage to the national force could be permanent .
Says NDP public safety critic Jack Harris ( St. John 's East ) : " We 're very concerned because we 're seeing a loss of respect for the RCMP in the minds of Canadians . "
Critics urge RCMP Commissioner William Elliott to enforce stricter guidelines for Taser use and , failing that , for Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's government to introduce an amendment to the Criminal Code to severely restrict use of Tasers by police .
Liberal MP Ujjal Dosanjh ( Vancouver South ) , a former B.C. attorney general , urges a moratorium on the use of Tasers .
Of the RCMP 's Elliott , Dosanjh says : " He has utterly failed ; he has shown no guidance , no leadership . "
Meanwhile , the world is watching .
" It 's the cover - up that 's the worst , " says Marcin Wrona , covering the hearings for TVN Poland .
Last week , two of his broadcasts pulled in close to 4 million viewers .
" Incidents happen everywhere , but it's how you handle it . "
Before the inquiry , Robinson appeared calm and , at times , aggrieved by questions .
In a March 2 letter from his lawyer , he changed key facts about the event , saying he had n't " articulated well " before .
Lawyer Don Rosenbloom , acting for the Polish republic , suggested the four officers cooked up their stories and collaborated to mislead an internal RCMP investigation .
Shortly after Dziekanski's death , RCMP officials described a man who " continued to throw things around and yell and scream " after police arrived .
On the basis of the RCMP investigation , plus the amateur video , the Criminal Justice Board of B.C. announced last December that the four officers applied reasonable and necessary force , and that no charges would be recommended .

Thiessen says if additional evidence is brought forward by Commissioner Thomas Braidwood in his report , it " could potentially be forwarded to ( RCMP ) counsel for their decision . "
He wo n't comment when asked whether the altered versions present such evidence .
Certainly , a different image has emerged of Dziekanski , who spoke no English and arrived to live with his mother , Zofia Cisowski , in Kamloops , B.C. ; his luggage was filled mostly with geography books .
It now appears he did n't stack his luggage against the door of the secure arrivals area , as officers originally said , nor did he appear in an " agitated state ... angry ... pissed off ... just wired up . "
He did n't ignore RCMP commands , nor " wildly swing the stapler " while advancing on the Mounties .
He did n't have to be " wrestled " to the ground , as they 'd originally stated .
Rather , said Robinson : " The Taser took him to the ground . "
Still , Robinson insisted Dziekanski was a threat , as he held his stapler to face four Mounties armed with guns , metal batons , pepper spray and the Taser .
The amateur video shows what appears to be a confused man who throws up his hands in what Rosenbloom describes as " resignation . "
Dziekanski's last words before he was Tasered the first time were ( as translated ) : " So you are not going to let me out of here ?
Leave me alone !
Leave me alone !
Are you crazy ? "
Then the inquiry heard the sound of the multiple Taser zappings , amplified for viewing by Braidwood , witnesses and spectators , including Dziekanski 's mother .
Even on the ground , handcuffed , Dziekanski remained a threat , Robinson claimed .
Const .
Bill Bentley called in a " Code 3 " emergency after seeing a blue discoloration , but Robinson said this week only Dziekanski's ears were blue .
Robinson , whose first - aid training and Taser certification were expired at the time , stuck to his view Dziekanski might be alive if he had n't picked up the stapler .
If he had n't done so , Const .
Kwesi Millington might not have jolted him five times with his Taser , beginning 24 seconds after the Mounties encountered him in arrivals .
" On a personal level , it 's so painful to watch ( that video ) , " says Liberal MP and public safety critic Mark Holland ( Ajax - Pickering ) , who says oversight is badly needed for the RCMP .
" What a cruel and terrible way to die ... It is so tragic . "
So far , we 've seen some great articles dealing with the many diverse and exciting incarnations of expanded gaming universes ( fair warning , this wo n't be one of them ) .
We 've had a fine sampling from movies , cartoons , books , and edutainment venues .
But one growing part of the expanded world has been sorely overlooked and since nobody else wants to get down and messy with the dry - heave inducing media in question , I guess its up to me to bring you ; Expanded Universes , the Fan-Fiction edition ( Shipero totally sniped me , but I 'm posting this anyway ) .
Let me start off by saying , I do n't finish many games .
Do n't get me wrong , I love playing games , exploring new worlds and meeting fun and interesting characters .
But generally , after playing something compulsively for a few weeks , I 'll take a day or two off to attend to the petty concerns of real life and , typically , I do n't find my way back .
If I do , its usually been so long that I have no idea what I was doing , or how to play anymore , so all progress is lost and I start over .
It 's a vicious cycle , but lets move on .
Fortunately , there is a wondrous thing called the Internet .
Finally , I was able to get the story behind the games I loved , even though I had n't finished them .
Granted the walk - thrus and synopses were n't always the best source for finding out why something had happened or even what the outcome was , but it was enough that I could at least reach some resolution to the story I 'd started .
It got to a point where when I found a game I was interested in , I 'd just read about it , not bothering to even buy it .
This lead to my addiction to following game walk - thrus verbatim and not actually playing any games for myself for a few years ( that 's a blog for another day ) .
At some point the avid reader in me matured a bit and realized that I was no longer content with “ kill the boss and save the world , game over ” explanations anymore .
I wanted to find out what Harry Mason was thinking while he explored Silent Hill , why Zelda was always needing some kid to rescue her , and what kind of hair gel Seifer used ( okay , maybe not so much the latter ) .
I really just wanted to get more out of the story , find out what made these people tick and why they did the things that subsequently lead to them either saving or destroying their worlds .
It was on my mission for truth that I stumbled into the serpents pit lovingly called , fan - fiction ( remember this is an article about fan - fiction ) .
In theory , this was the answer to all my prayers .
Finally a place where anyone who was a fan of a game could give their take on the story , or even create whole new stories and worlds with the characters everyone knew and loved .
It seemed so perfect that I can hardly be blamed for falling for its guise .
How was I to know that lurking beneath the surface of this seemingly happy and tranquil utopia was some of the worst story writing and cringe worthy match - ups the Internet has to offer ?
Yes I was young then , but I 've learned a few things about why fan - fiction has gotten such a bad rep and I 'm going to share these things with you .
First and foremost :
There are no straight guys in fan - fiction .
( I wish I could tell you guys I did n't already have this pic on my hard drive . )
Really , none .
No matter how macho and tough your favorite game character is , there is a fan - fiction somewhere where he is a limp - wristed sissy who only wants to be loved by every other male character in the game .
Now , I enjoy fictitious male - on - male action as much as the next girl , but I have to admit , I was pretty shocked to see that there were no limits to how far - fetched the fan - fiction writers were willing to be in their attempt to ship their favorite paring .
Even in the stories where a male and female character are the main pairing there is always at least a hint of bisexuality swimming just beneath the surface .
It does n't have to have anything to do with the story , ( though usually it is the story ) , there will be some awkward groping sessions and a “ we 're friends and friends do that kinda thing so lets not be ashamed ” discussion dropped in there somewhere .
Did I mention that anyone can write fan -fiction ?
Oh yes , anyone and everyone .
There are no rules or regulations ( or grammar ) to be concerned with .
There are ridiculous amounts of angsty , emo , abusive drama fics , as well as fluffy “ OMFG so random ” pieces .
There is no standard of acceptance here so even the most lack luster would - be author can churn out their own little gem that twists and corrupts entire game worlds .
Quick example for the folks playing at home :
Viewtiful Joe
" Joe must defat the demon lord who has captured Blue and Silvia .
He may need some help from an unexpected aquaintence , though . "
A fire started it all
" Orphan Kim , has never liked Pokemon .
Because berserk Fire Pokemon killed her parents .
On her 10th birthday , her decision will change .
When she visits Prof.
Rowan , her starter turns out to be a Magby , the Fire type .
OC 's gladly accepted .
Please R& R "
It 's not enough to control the world , the writers want to live in it as well .
The vast majority of the plot of fan - fictions stems from the writers wanting to tell everyone about their experience in the game , but as if the game were real .
This leads to a metric ton of bad to mediocre “ OMG I 'm in Kingdom Hearts and I 'm also the new keyblade master .
Also , all the guys are like totally in love with me , OMG ” stories .
There should seriously be an entire section devoted to these atrocities of imagination .
If it were possible for ideas to have abortions , the result would be these type of fan - fictions .
But what about the good fan -fiction ?
Okay , so not all fan - fictions are terrible .
I 've read some good stories by people who actually were decent writers , but you know what ?
As long as they write fan - fiction they will never be good writers .
This is n't a knock against those who write fan - fiction ( I 'm guilty of it ) , its just an observation .
Being good at writing fan - fiction ( to quote that guy from Waiting ) is like being the smartest kid with downs .
When your only competition is the worst writers in middle school , you 're stories are pretty much the best by default .
Do n't think that the shallow words of encouragement and praise that flood the comment section are full of anything resembling actual literary criticism .
Nearly all the so - called comments on the fan - fiction site are something along the lines of :
“ OH !
Please I wanna know more !
This is so awesome !
XD I really hope you update soon ! ^_^ “
“ I can't wait to see more .
Keep up the good work ! “
“ UWE HE HE , NOT A BAD START , HOPE THE REST ARE THIS GOOD YAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA “
So yeah you get some confidence in your writing , but at what cost to the beloved characters and worlds that are being raped by your ilk ?
Is there no hope at all ?
Having reached the conclusion of my rant , I feel compelled to point out that I still enjoy the concept of fan -fiction .
It could be the perfect media to give me a chance to see the worlds of my favorite games from a different and often overlooked perspective .
I could get more in - depth stories about characters I 've grown to love and a better insight into their daily struggles outside of the scope of the game .
However , good fan - fiction is like finding a quarter in a pile of dog poop .
You know it 's there , but you have to really psych yourself up to actually dig around and look for it .
Are you into extreme sports ?
Whether you ’ve actually partaken or just have a macabre fascination , extreme sports ( also known as “ X Games ” ) are the most entertaining of all sports – and at times the craziest ( or dumbest depending on your opinion ) .
Even if you think some of these people are crazy or downright stupid , you have to watch .
There are roughly a hundred extreme sports that I ’m aware of , but I ’ve come up with a great list of the most brutal of them all .
Ultimate Fighting
Ultimate fighting usually refers to one huge annual event called the UFC ( Ultimate Fighting Championship ) .
The organizers use to promote this event by calling it “ no hold barred ” fighting and it was pretty much the truth as is there were basically no rules .
People would enter the ring and more times than not the loser would leave the ring on a stretcher – or worse !
It did n’t take long before politicians stepped in and said it was too brutal and even called it “ human cock fighting ” .
This probably was n’t far from the truth .
So they had to stop the production .
Of course , the sport itself continued , but not legally until the organization altered the rules .
Today the UFC is very different from before it was modified , but it ’s still brutal enough to hold your attention .
The organization no longer calls it “ no holds barred fighting ” but instead refers to it as “ mixed martial arts ” or MMA .
Freestyle Powerisers Stilts
This is an up and coming extreme sport where you wear these things on your feet that are sort of a cross between low stilts and pogo sticks .
The idea is to do stunt with them .
It sounds a little boring until you see it .
BASE Jumping
BASE ( Building , Antenna , Span , Earth ) jumping is where you jump from fixed objects such as cliffs and mountains with the aid of a parachute or a parachute and a wing suit .
This extreme sport was derived from skydiving , but is more dangerous because its typically performed at much lower level giving you less of a window to open your parachute .
Also , a BASE jumper travels at a lower speed which gives them less aerodynamic control tan skydivers .
Wing Walking
I ’m not so sure that wing walking would qualify as a sport as much as it is a stunt , but it ’s certainly “ extreme ” .
Some people do refer to it as an extreme sport and it ’s extremely dangerous , so it made the list .
Wing walking is the act of walking out onto a wing of an airplane while it ’s in the air .
This actually did n’t start as a sport , but as a necessity as the first wing walker , Omer Locklear walked out on a wing with the airplane in flight during World War I to repair some damage .
I guess after that , people saw it or heard about it and said , “ Hey would n’t that be fun ” .
Hell , no !
But we have enough crazies that do think it ’s fun and it does n’t stop the rest of us from watching .
We now see wing walkers at air shows doing stunts such as handstands and hanging by their teeth !
Freestyle Motocross
Freestyle motocross ( or FMX ) is the sport in which you use a motorcycle for stunts and tricks such as flips , like the back flip , double back flip and the whip flip .
This has increased in popularity throughout the years , but the sport is very dangerous and if it ’s one that you plan to partake in , you also should plan on getting some broken bones .
Aggressive Inline Skating
Aggressive inline skating is a sport where stunts and tricks are done on inline skates .
It ’s sort of a take off on the stunt skateboarding , but the people use inline skates instead .
Give some people wheels and a shoe and they go crazy !
This actually looks like a lot of fun and they do some crazy stuff .
Extreme Skiing
The name says it all .
This is a form of skiing where the skier goes down very steep hills or on rough terrain .
This is awesome to watch and it looks like it would also be great to try , but you know what they say .
It ’s always fun until someone gets hurt .
Ice Climbing
I definitely would n’t have thought to try this one .
It takes a special kind of person to look at an ice foundation such as a frozen waterfall or a mountain covered in ice and say , “ Gee , I ’d really like to climb that ” .
The cold , frigid truth is that people find a lot of adventure in this .
I guess they ’ve never heard of global warming .
Sky Surfing
I ’d like to know what genius thought that it would be a good idea to take their surfboard and jump out of an airplane with it .
I just picture some drunk surfer saying to his buddies , “ Dude , I wonder how big the waves are up in the sky ” .
From this , the most sober of them all invented sky surfing .
In reality , it ’s a type of skydiving where a board is strapped to the diver ’s feet .
They usually do stunts or acrobatics on it on the way down .
Bungee Jumping
We all know what bungee jumping is .
It ’s when you jump off of a tall fixture tied to a large rubber band and hope to God that it does n’t break !
This , of course has been very popular for years and there have been a lot of accidents associated with bungee jumping , but there also has been a lot of success .
Skydiving
Skydiving has been around since before the airplane , believe I or not .
In fact , it goes way back to the end of the eighteenth century when a Frenchman by the name of André - Jacques Garnerin made the first parachute and jumped out of a hot air balloon with it in 1797 .
Of course , in World War I , skydiving was used in their missions .
As we know , skydiving is still very much existent in our military today .
We also have tons of thrill seekers who enjoy the sport of skydiving and he even have stunt people that perform variation of the sport in air shows .
Whitewater Kayaking
When done right , this can be a very dangerous sport .
Imagine that you ’re in a river with extremely rough water and the only thing you have to protect you is a small layer of fiberglass surrounding you and you somehow have to control it .
Of course , there are degrees of the severity of the current of a river , so rivers are divided into “ classes ” to denote the severity .
This is why I say that it ’s very dangerous if done right !
These are the extreme sports that I found to be the most interesting and dangerous .
Some are fairly new and others have not only stood the test of time , but been improved upon over the years .
In general , I ’m not so sure that extreme sports should even be classified as sports , but rather craziness .
Most of us have tried at least some extreme sports , including myself .
Therefore , I think it ’s safe to say that we all have a little bit of craziness in us .

For the first time in a quarter century , the number of African - Americans incarcerated for drug offenses in state prisons has declined more than 20 percent while the number of white imprisoned drug offenders has increased more than 40 percent .
The decline took place over a six year period from 1999 to 2005 and reflects fundamental changes in the so - called " war on drugs " – how it 's targeted and prosecuted – as well as the waning of the crack epidemic in predominantly minority urban areas and the increase in methamphetamine abuse in largely white rural neighborhoods .
The trends were identified in an analysis of Justice Department statistics released Tuesday by The Sentencing Project , a criminal justice and reform nonprofit in Washington , D.C.
The study found that an increase in the number of drug courts and state - level efforts to find alternatives to incarceration may have played a role in bringing about the change .
" Over the last year or two , largely because of the fiscal crisis , states around the country are reconsidering many of their sentencing and incarceration policies , particularly for lower level drug offenses , " says Marc Mauer , executive director of The Sentencing Project and author of the study .
" So it seems reasonably likely that we could see some decline in the overall number of people incarcerated for drug offenses . "
According to the study , the number of blacks in state prisons on drug- related charges dropped from 144,700 in 1999 to 113,500 in 2005 .
The number of white drug - offenders in prison increased during the same time from 50,700 to 72,300 .
Perceptions of racial bias
When the government ramped up the war on drugs in the 1980s , violent open - air crack markets plagued many urban areas .
These areas became the focus of police drug enforcement efforts and crack use invited harsh mandatory minimum sentences .
That led to an exponential increase in the number of imprisoned drug offenders from 40,000 in 1980 to more than 500,000 today , according to Justice Department statistics .
The majority of incarcerated drug offenders have been African - American – despite the fact that drug abuse rates are fairly equal across ethnic and racial lines – and that fed a widespread perception that law enforcement efforts were racially biased .
One impact of the new report , say criminologists , could be that law enforcement will no longer be perceived as biased .
" If citizens believe the criminal justice system is grossly biased , it undermines its effectiveness , " says Jonathan Caulkins , a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh .
For years , the disproportionately large percentage of imprisoned African - American drug offenders fueled calls for reform of local police departments as well as the national criminal sentencing structure .
Professor Caulkins does n't want to diminish the presence of racial bias , which he says still exists to some extent in most American institutions , but he contends that incarceration disparities may have had more to do with the nature of the drug epidemic than with overt bias .
In the 1980s , for instance , many urban neighborhoods plagued by the crack epidemic became openly violent .
So that 's where police targeted their efforts , he says .
" When the sellers are flagrant , then the No. 1 concern is the lack of social order , " he says .
By contrast , " when the sellers are invisible to the neighbors [ as in many affluent white neighborhoods ] , then you still have the public health problem of addiction and overdose , and that 's what you focus on – not law enforcement . "
" The difference is n't middle class or poor , white or black , meth or crack , " he argues .
" The question is : Are the sellers invisible to neighbors ? "
Crack dealers who once operated openly on urban street corners have now largely disappeared behind closed doors and disposable cellphone numbers , making them harder for police to track , according to The Sentencing Project report .
Criminal justice reforms a factor ?
Other criminologists still see clear racial bias in the way the justice system prosecutes the war on drugs .
Apart from the disproportionate incarceration rates , they point to differences in sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine compared with powder cocaine .
The two are chemically identical , but the penalties for crack – predominantly used by minorities – remain much harsher than for powder cocaine , which is predominantly used by whites .
The disparity , though , has been reduced in recent years .
That and other reforms of the criminal justice system , such as the development of drug courts in the 1990s which offered treatment in lieu of prison , are also contributing to the decline in the number of African - Americans imprisoned for drug offenses .
Mr. Mauer of The Sentencing Project says that 's probably because the majority of the more than 2,000 drug courts are located in urban areas .
New York State , which implemented a series of alternatives to incarceration such as drug courts , is a good example of how such policy changes helped lower incarceration rates .
In 1999 , New York state prisons held about 22,000 people in prison for drug offenses , according to Mauer .
By 2005 , that had dropped about a third to 14,000 .
The state also shows a rise in the number of whites incarcerated for drug offences .
In January 2001 , whites accounted for 5.4 percent of drug offenders in the New York state prisons .
In 2009 , that figure had almost doubled to about 10 percent , according to the Correctional Association of New York .
" There have been some modest shifts , " says Robert Gangi , of the New York Correctional Association .
" But people of color still make up a disproportionately large percentage . "
That 's led some analysts to argue that the racial shift in national incarceration rates does not reflect changing police and prosecution practices within states so much as the increase in methamphetamine use in many Western and Midwestern states .
" I have no doubt that explains part of the white numbers , because whites are more likely to be arrested for those offenses , " says Mauer .
" But it 's a relatively modest number of states where meth is a problem , " he adds .
The question , he says , is whether those meth use numbers are sufficient to explain part or all of the increase in white incarceration rates .
" I 'm not sure the scale of the change can be explained by that . "
For the American liberal intelligentsia who have always revered European opinion , and taken its contempt for America as unimpeachable wisdom , this is going to be a problem .
But not much of one .
When it comes to a choice between foreign intellectuals and the president whom they believe to embody the moral regeneration of their own country , I can assure you there will be no contest .
It is impossible to over - estimate the importance of Mr Obama 's election to the presidency among enlightened liberal Americans : he is more than a hero .
He is a vindication of all that they have believed ( often in defiant hope ) that their country stood for .
He is living proof that America is the land of equality and opportunity that it was founded to be .
And now they have seen him rebuffed by degenerate old Europe as if he were as if he were no better than his barbarian predecessor whom they had delighted in detesting in comradeship with the most sophisticated chatterers in the world .
10 Questions to Ask a New Partner Before Having Sex
CorbisBefore hopping into bed with a new sex partner , have an open and honest conversation about your sexual histories , risks , and the last time you were tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) .
Knowing someone 's test results is n't enough .
" Even if your partner tested negative for HIV last week , it does n't mean he or she is n't HIV positive , " says Perry N. Halkitis , PhD , a psychologist specializing in HIV at New York University .
" Most HIV tests can only detect the virus starting three to six months after infection — so you should ask about your partner 's sexual history for the past six months . "
Here 's what you need to find out .
Of course , you probably wo n't get too far down the list if you just roll out the interrogation ; but these are the questions you really do need answers to , one way or another .
One option : Start by sharing your own history , and see what you get back .
1 . Are you HIV positive ?
2 . Have you ever tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease ?
If so , were you treated ?
3 . How many sex partners have you had since your last STD and HIV tests ?
4 . Have you had any STDs in the past six months ?
5 . If you have been diagnosed with herpes or genital warts , are you having outbreaks ?
Are you being treated ?
6 . Have you been at risk for HIV in the past six months ?
7 . Do you have any objection to using a condom ?
8 . Are you allergic to latex ?
9 . Are you on any form of birth control ?
India has been gripped by claims of attempted murder and professional jealousy against one of the world 's richest men , as a technician who uncovered the alleged plot was found dead .
Bharat Borge , a senior technician with Air Works India Engineering , last week discovered sand and stones in the fuel tank of a Bell 412 helicopter belonging to the wealthy industrialist Anil Ambani .
Anil Ambani ... plot to kill him .

But in a twist worthy of a crime novel , Borge 's body was found on a railway track in a Mumbai suburb on Tuesday evening , according to police , who said a note was recovered and the case was being treated as suicide .
Indian media reported the note was to a detective who had questioned Borge , and also claimed that before his death Borge had received visitors from the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group ( R - ADAG ) , of which Ambani is chairman .

The classic post - bender bacon sarnie really does help cure your hangover , thanks to the dual chemical benefits of the bread / sliced pig combination .
Elin Roberts , science development manager at the Centre for Life in Newcastle , told the Daily Mirror : “ Food does n’t soak up the alcohol , but it does increase your metabolism – helping you to deal with the after - effects of over - indulgence .
So food will often help you feel better .
Bread is high in carbohydrates and bacon is full of protein , which breaks down into amino acids .
“ Your body needs these amino acids , so eating them will make you feel good .
Bingeing on alcohol depletes neurotransmitters too , but bacon contains a high level of amines which tops these up , giving you a clearer head . ”
It 's not just the bacon sarnie that helps clear the fug ; the very act of preparing the British culinary delight will help the fragile rebuild their shattered brains .
Elin explained : “ If you ’ve got amino acids and reducing sugars at a heat above 150 °C , it kickstarts the Maillard Reaction in the pan .
That means lots of lovely smells are released and it ’s this which draws us in . "
In fact , so lovely are these aromas that Elin concluded he'd known " three vegetarians who have been broken by the smell of bacon . ” ®

I do n't personally know any veggies " broken " by bacon , but did meet one whose resistance finally failed when faced with a particularly fine Scotch egg .

B.C. Green party leader Jane Sterk envisions marijuana being sold in establishments resembling liquor stores .
In a post - prohibition era , Sterk also sees pot being grown by co-operatives .
During an April 20 interview at the Georgia Straight offices , Sterk addressed her party ’s election - platform promise to support an end to drug prohibition and to work toward the regulation of the production and distribution of psychoactive substances .
“ The vast majority of people who use these substances use them in such a way that it causes no harm to themselves or anyone else , ” said Sterk , who is the Green candidate in Esquimalt - Royal Roads .
“ Fundamentally , we believe that , if it ’s not causing harm , why would we need to criminalize behaviour which is done by responsible adults . ”
When asked if she saw marijuana being sold in liquor - store - style outlets in the future , Sterk said , “ Yes . Or Compassion clubs or cooperatives . ”
Sterk hinted that the legalization of marijuana would help fight gang violence .
“ We ’re already giving over our land to all kinds of criminal elements , who are growing cannabis on land and in buildings that make it less than desirable , including the watershed in Greater Victoria , ” Sterk said .
“ They found grow - ops there , so we need to get a handle of that and make it a legitimate agricultural activity .
“ So , that ’s one way to do it , and then it would be controlled and regulated just like we do tobacco and alcohol , so that we keep it out of the hands of youngsters and out of the hands of the criminal elements that are destroying our communities , ” she added .
Sterk said that the Greens are focusing their efforts on marijuana at this time but that ultimately the province needs to end the prohibition of other drugs .
“ The war on drugs is a futile endeavour , ” she said .
“ It ’s a failure , and it does n’t make sense to continue to do something that ’s failing , and we should approach this problem differently . ”
You can follow Stephen Hui on Twitter at twitter.com/stephenhui .
That approach may sound straightforward in theory , but in practice the vast variety of database structures and possible search terms poses a thorny computational challenge .
“ This is the most interesting data integration problem imaginable , ” says Alon Halevy , a former computer science professor at the University of Washington who is now leading a team at Google that is trying to solve the Deep Web conundrum .
Google ’s Deep
Web search strategy involves sending out a program to analyze the contents of every database it encounters .
For example , if the search engine finds a page with a form related to fine art , it starts guessing likely search terms — “ Rembrandt , ” “ Picasso , ” “ Vermeer ” and so on — until one of those terms returns a match .
The search engine then analyzes the results and develops a predictive model of what the database contains .
In a similar vein , Prof. Juliana Freire at the University of Utah is working on an ambitious project called DeepPeep ( www.deeppeep.org) that eventually aims to crawl and index every database on the public Web .
Extracting the contents of so many far - flung data sets requires a sophisticated kind of computational guessing game .
“ The naïve way would be to query all the words in the dictionary , ” Ms. Freire said .
Instead , DeepPeep starts by posing a small number of sample queries , “ so we can then use that to build up our understanding of the databases and choose which words to search . ”
Based on that analysis , the program then fires off automated search terms in an effort to dislodge as much data as possible .
Ms. Freire claims that her approach retrieves better than 90 percent of the content stored in any given database .
Ms. Freire ’s work has recently attracted overtures from one of the major search engine companies .
As the major search engines start to experiment with incorporating Deep Web content into their search results , they must figure out how to present different kinds of data without overcomplicating their pages .
This poses a particular quandary for Google , which has long resisted the temptation to make significant changes to its tried - and - true search results format .
( CNN ) --
As Hayden Henshaw was being rushed to the doctor 's office after becoming ill , his father heard that his son's classmates had been struck with the deadly swine flu virus like the one sweeping through Mexico .
Swine flu commonly affects pigs and occasionally infects people in contact with pigs .
Patrick Henshaw called his wife immediately to have Hayden checked for it .
Later , they received the bad news .
Hayden had become the third confirmed case of swine flu at his Texas high school .
It is a virus that has killed 68 people in Mexico and infected at least eight people in the United States .
Health officials arrived at the Henshaws ' house Friday and drew blood from the whole family , then told them to stay inside and away from the public , Henshaw told CNN .
The whole family is quarantined indefinitely , according to CNN - affiliate KABB .
Henshaw said his family was shocked when they got the news about their son .
" Stunned .
My wife was having a panic attack , " Henshaw told the affiliate .
U.S. health officials have expressed concern about U.S. cases of a swine flu virus that has similar characteristics to the fatal virus in Mexico .
More than 1,000 people have fallen ill in Mexico City in a short period of time , U.S. health experts said .
" This situation has been developing quickly , " Richard Besser , acting director of the Atlanta , Georgia - based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , said Friday .
" This is something we are worried about . "
Besser said all of the eight U.S. patients have recovered .

New York health officials said Friday they were testing about 75 students at a school in New York City for swine flu after the students exhibited flu - like symptoms this week .
A team of state health department doctors and staff went to the St. Francis Preparatory School in the borough of Queens on Thursday after the students reported cough , fever , sore throat , aches and pains .
Test results are expected as early as Saturday .
The new virus has genes from North American swine influenza , avian influenza , human influenza and a form of swine influenza normally found in Asia and Europe , said Nancy Cox , chief of the CDC 's Influenza Division .
Swine flu is caused by a virus similar to a type of flu virus that infects people every year but is a strain typically found only in pigs -- or in people who have direct contact with pigs .
There have , however , been cases of person - to - person transmission of swine flu , the CDC said .
CNN 's David Alsup contributed to this report .

When Sergeant Jeffery Humphrey and his squad of nine men , part of the 1/26 Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division , were assigned to a Special Forces compound in Samarra , he thought they had drawn a dream duty .
“ Guarding Special Forces , it was like Christmas , ” he says .
In fact , it was spring , 2004 ; and although Humphrey was a combat veteran of Kosovo and Iraq , the men to whom he was detailed , the 10th Special Forces Group , were not interested in grunts like him .
They would not say what they were doing , and they used code names .
They called themselves “ the Faith element . ”
But they did not talk religion , which was fine with Humphrey .
An evenhanded Indianan with a precise turn of mind , Humphrey considered himself a no - nonsense soldier .
His first duty that Easter Sunday was to make sure the roof watch was in place : a machine gunner , a man in a mortar pit , a soldier with a SAW ( an automatic rifle on a bipod ) , and another with a submachine gun on loan from Special Forces .
Together with two Bradley Fighting Vehicles on the ground and snipers on another roof , the watch covered the perimeter of the compound , a former elementary school overlooking the Tigris River .
Early that morning , a unit from the 109th National Guard Infantry dropped off their morning chow .
With it came a holiday special–a video of Mel Gibson ’s The Passion of the Christ and a chaplain to sing the film ’s praises , a gory cinematic sermon for an Easter at war .
Humphrey ducked into the chow room to check it out .
“ It was the part where they ’re killing Jesus , which is , I guess , pretty much the whole movie .
Kind of turned my stomach . ”
He decided he ’d rather burn trash .
He was returning from his first run to the garbage pit when the 109th came barreling back .
Their five - ton–a supersized armored pickup –was rolling on rims , its tires flapping and spewing greasy black flames .
“ Came in on two wheels , ” remembers one of Humphrey ’s men , a machine gunner .
On the ground behind it and in retreat before a furious crowd were more men from the 109th , laying down fire with their M - 4s .
Humphrey raced toward the five - ton as his roof shooters opened up , their big guns thumping above him .
Later , when he climbed into the vehicle , the stink was overwhelming : of iron and gunpowder , blood and bullet casings .
He reached down to grab a rifle , and his hand came up wet with brain .
Humphrey had been in Samarra for a month , and until that day his stay had been a quiet respite in one of the world ’s oldest cities .
Not long before , though , there had been a hint of trouble : a briefing in which his squad was warned that any soldier caught desecrating Islamic sites –Samarra is considered a holy city –would fall under “ extreme penalty , ” a category that can include a general court - martial and prison time .
“ I heard some guys were vandalizing mosques , ” Humphrey says .
“ Spray - painting ’em with crosses . ”
The rest of that Easter was spent under siege .
Insurgents held off Bravo Company , which was called in to rescue the men in the compound .
Ammunition ran low .
A helicopter tried to drop more but missed .
As dusk fell , the men prepared four Bradley Fighting Vehicles for a “ run and gun ” to draw fire away from the compound .
Humphrey headed down from the roof to get a briefing .
He found his lieutenant , John D. DeGiulio , with a couple of sergeants .
They were snickering like schoolboys .
They had commissioned the Special Forces interpreter , an Iraqi from Texas , to paint a legend across their Bradley ’s armor , in giant red Arabic script .
“ What ’s it mean ? ” asked Humphrey .
“ Jesus killed Mohammed , ” one of the men told him .
The soldiers guffawed .
JESUS KILLED MOHAMMED was about to cruise into the Iraqi night .
The Bradley , a tracked “ tank killer ” armed with a cannon and missiles –to most eyes , indistinguishable from a tank itself–rolled out .
The Iraqi interpreter took to the roof , bullhorn in hand .
The sun was setting .
Humphrey heard the keen of the call to prayer , then the crackle of the bullhorn with the interpreter answering –in Arabic , then in English for the troops , insulting the prophet .
Humphrey ’s men loved it .
“ They were young guys , you know ? ” says Humphrey .
“ They were scared . ” A Special Forces officer stood next to the interpreter– “ a big , tall , blond , grinning type , ” says Humphrey .
“ Jesus kill Mohammed ! ” chanted the interpreter .
“ Jesus kill Mohammed ! ”
A head emerged from a window to answer , somebody fired on the roof , and the Special Forces man directed a response from an MK - 19 grenade launcher .
“ Boom , ” remembers Humphrey .
The head and the window and the wall around it disappeared .
“ Jesus kill Mohammed ! ” Another head , another shot .
Boom .
“ Jesus kill Mohammed ! ” Boom .
In the distance , Humphrey heard the static of AK fire and the thud of RPGs .
He saw a rolling rattle of light that looked like a firefight on wheels .
“ Each time I go into combat I get closer to God , ” DeGiulio would later say .
The Bradley seemed to draw fire from every doorway .
There could n’t be that many insurgents in Samarra , Humphrey thought .
Was this a city of terrorists ?
Humphrey heard Lieutenant DeGiulio reporting in from the Bradley ’s cabin , opening up on all doorways that popped off a round , responding to rifle fire–each Iraqi household is allowed one gun–with 25 mm shells powerful enough to smash straight through the front of a house and out the back wall .
Humphrey was stunned .
He ’d been blown off a tower in Kosovo and seen action in the drug war , but he ’d never witnessed a maneuver so fundamentally stupid .
The men on the roof thought otherwise .
They thought the lieutenant was a hero , a kamikaze on a suicide mission to bring Iraqis the American news :
عيسى قتل محمدا

So I thought it would be a cool thread idea to combine GAFs boxart fetishism with a Photoshop thread ( who doesnt love these ? ) .
Partly inspired by AniHawk 's magazine ad thread , I decided to make a thread about  The GAF Collection , a theoretical series of video game releases for the more serious collectors ( à la The Criterion Collection , hence the name ) .
The Criterion Collection is known for its stunning boxarts just as much as it is for its high quality movie transfers and overall quality .
I think itd be cool to try this with video games , who have boxarts traditionally bombarded with way too many ugly labels , ratings , seals , and logos .
I think this ideas probably been done before , but I havent seen any threads like this here before so why not go for it .

You might have to alter the dimensions a bit for whatever case you 're using , I have n't checked those out at all .
And although not really GAF Collection covers per se , these are some good alternative covers :
Hey artists , if you still have a high resolution version of your cover around it would be great if you could make a back cover and spine for it .
There are a ton of people asking for printable versions of these covers to use as replacements for the originals .
If you 'd be willing to do that it'd be awesome .
Just post it in the thread or PM a link to me and I 'll add it to the OP .

This is a nice idea , certainly one encouraged by the yogic philosophy , yet we may not have an idea of what it really involves .
As a therapist and yoga teacher , it has been rare to come across people who are interested in letting go of attachment to the ego .
In a way , we enjoy the stories and dramas created by ego , and then other days , ( when you have acted out the same patterned behavior for the millionth time ) , we hate it !
If you ask inside , “ Do I really want to love without ego ? ” , and YES !
comes from inside your being , ( not from the head ) , then go for it .
If it is your heart ’s desire to love and experience relationship in this way , you must follow it !
Otherwise , feel free to stay in ego love , watch it , and enjoy it .
Practice observation of the projections of love , i.e. loving the projected mother or father , or loving the reflection of your perfect self or most hated self .
There are lots of themes of ego love that can be quite dramatic , engaging , and chaotic .
These games can serve as opportunities to learn a great deal about oneself .
Enjoy the opportunity .
Even if one does n’t really know how to love without attachment to ego , ( like me , I ’m learning as I go ) , if we remain committed to the intention , the heart will continue to expand and ego will continue to dissolve .
My elementary understanding of what comprises a tantric relationship is where I am committed to loving another from my Pure Heart rather than the small ego , remembering the other as the Beloved rather than as their small ego , and choosing to act with love in every moment with the other .
How fantastic !
And how utterly challenging .
In my explorations with sacred relationship , here ’s the how tos I ’ve discovered so far .
5 Tips for How to Love Fully without attachment to the Ego
Get to know your ego , make friends with it , understand and accept its existence within you Commit to a consistent meditative and breath practice so your ability to witness your thoughts , emotions , and behaviors with some distance increases .
Every time you notice the ego tempting you to put up walls of fear , resistance and judgement towards another , look within yourself to see what you are not content with within your own being .
Be honest with yourself .
Be honest with others .
Share your ego and its ’ fears .
Share love whenever you remember .
With your partner , your children , your friends , a stranger , a collegue , the Existence around you ….in the most subtle ways we can share love and expand the energy of the heart .
With some this may be a smile , a silent prayer , with others it may be sharing attention , listening , playing , giving something , cooking , writing a letter , massaging , holding a hand , a phone call , singing , dancing , creating , whenever you remember , share your love .
This consistent remembering to take action from the heart ( when it ’s not an obligation ! ) , expands consciousness and diminishes unconsciousness ( ego ) .
Experiment and enjoy !
Software piracy is a term that is frequently used to describe the copying or use of computer software in violation of its license ( commonly referred to as an end user licensing agreement or EULA ) .
Interestingly , not only the concept , but also the term itself , is highly controversial .
1
The copying and selling of software in violation of its EULA is extremely common in many parts of the world , particularly in the so - called developing economies , such as China , Southeast Asia , Eastern Europe and Latin America .
In fact , in such regions typically the vast majority of computers contain unofficial copies of commercial software .
Moreover , this practice is far from unusual even in the higher income , industrialized countries .
Inability to Stop Software developers have tried various techniques to eliminate so - called software piracy because of the loss in their revenue that can result from it .
These techniques have included publicity about the harm that it supposedly causes , electronic copy protection , surprise audits of businesses , requiring users to contact the vendor to obtain an installation code , legal action , and the selling of less expensive versions with reduced functionality .
However , such measures have generally met with little success , as determined users soon discover ways to avoid or defeat them .
Moreover , some of them have actually alienated users by making software more difficult to install or use , notably the tedious task of typing in long registration codes and the annoyance of having to call the vendor after installation or reinstallation to obtain an authorization code .
The main success of these techniques has been in the higher income , industrialized countries , particularly within large businesses and other organizations .
This is largely because of the stronger enforcement of copyright laws in such countries and the fear of surprise audits and heavy fines by the Business Software Alliance ( BSA ) 2 , as permitted by the EULAs .
The BSA is a not - uncontroversial , international organization that was set up by the largest software vendors to enforce compliance with their EULAs .
Dispute About Effects
Some industry executives assert that unauthorized copying and use is by far the biggest problem facing the software industry .
The BSA claims that it results in a loss of revenue of tens billions of dollars per year ( more than US $ 30 billion for 2004 ) and that it also destroys jobs , impairs computer security and hinders innovation .
However , this view is strongly disputed by others , both within and outside of the software industry , who contend that such copying and use is only a relatively minor problem .
They explain that the way the supposed losses are computed is faulty and results in a wild exaggeration .
According to some sources , the loss could be overstated by a factor of ten .
3
In particular , they point out that many , or most , individuals and organizations currently using the so - called pirated software would not do so if they had to pay the prices set by the vendors .
This is particularly true in the lower income countries , where the official price of an operating system or application program can easily exceed the average monthly family income .
Rather , they claim , the biggest problems for much commercial software are the lack of competition and the consequent poor quality ( most notoriously , sloppy coding and the consequent vulnerability to viruses , worms and other malware ) and high prices .
The true cost of poorly designed and carelessly written commercial software is difficult to measure , but there is little doubt that it is massive .
Some estimates place the total annual worldwide damage from malware alone at more than US $ 150 billion .
For example , the mi2g Intelligence Unit estimated that it ranged between $ 166 and $ 202 billion for 2004 .
4
This does not include other problems that can result from poor quality software , such as system crashes ( and the consequent disruption to businesses ) , incompatibility of files , data loss , etc .
There is little doubt that such problems are for the most part avoidable with good program design and careful development , as can clearly be seen from their relative rarity on operating systems that have been designed from the ground up with security and stability as high priorities , such as Linux , Mac OS X and FreeBSD .
Moreover , those complaining about the supposed economic harm caused by so - called software piracy have failed to provide any solid evidence for their claims that it reduces the growth in jobs and slows down innovation .
In fact , it can be argued that just the opposite is the case : that is , because software is used by individuals and businesses that would not otherwise use it , the result is an increase in the efficiency of economies , and thus the creation of more jobs and income .
Reasons and Justifications For
The copying and using of software in violation of its EULAs occurs for several reasons 5 : ( 1 ) One is the fact that it is extremely easy to do because of the nature of digital media .
That is , CDROMs or other disks containing entire operating systems or application programs can be copied for mere pennies using readily available and inexpensive equipment , and a company or group of friends can easily install software on any number of computers from a single disk .
( 2 ) Another is that many users find it prohibitively expensive to purchase proprietary ( i.e. , commercial ) software at the prices set by its vendors .
This is particularly true for users in the developing countries , for which the prices are typically comparable to those in the high income countries ( in which the developers are invariably located ) but in which incomes are far lower .
For example , China , the world 's most populous nation , had an average annual per capita income equivalent to US $ 1,290 for 2004 , and the corresponding figures were $ 620 for India , the second most populous nation , $ 3,090 for Brazil and $ 390 for Nigeria .
6 Even US $ 200 for a proprietary operating system ( e.g. , the least expensive version of Microsoft Windows Vista ) would be completely unaffordable for the majority of the population in such countries , not to mention $ 400 for an office suite ( e.g. , Microsoft Office ) or $ 600 for a graphics program ( e.g. , Adobe Photoshop ) . ( 3 ) A third reason is that many people feel compelled to use expensive proprietary software , even if they are aware of the free alternatives , because it is required by schools for their studies , by companies for their jobs ( or for submitting resumes ) , or by government agencies for submitting or accessing documents .
( 4 ) In addition , there is also a strongly held ethical or moral justification on the part of many who engage in so - called software piracy as well as many of their sympathizers .
This justification is based in part on the view , which is widespread in the developing regions , that it is unfair to charge prices in low income countries that are comparable to those in the higher income countries , and which are thus virtually unaffordable for most citizens and many businesses in such countries .
It is also based on the awareness that such high prices bear little relation to the actual costs of development and production and , rather , result merely from the fact that there is little or no competition due to the obstruction of market forces .
This position also holds that large software companies that complain about so - called software piracy are not justified in making complaints from an ethical or moral point of view because they have utilized unethical , and sometimes illegal , tactics 7 to create a situation which leaves no choice for vast numbers of people but to engage in unauthorized copying and use .
Although many countries have laws that make it illegal to violate software licenses , such laws are not enforced uniformly .
Critics of such laws ( and advocates of lax enforcement ) could point out that their non-enforcement is also justified from the point of view that antitrust ( i.e. , anti-monopoly ) laws , which exist in most industrialized countries , have not been vigorously enforced with regard to software in the countries in which the software developers are based , particularly in the U.S.
Had antitrust laws ( e.g. , The Sherman Antitrust Act in the case of the U.S. ) been consistently enforced for a number of years , there would have been much more competition in the software field and thus software prices would be substantially lower ( i.e. , closer to the true cost of development and production ) ; consequently , unauthorized copying and use would be much less common in terms of the number of installations or copies and vastly lower in terms of valuation .
Secret Allies ?
Moreover , there is a widely held suspicion that developers of commercial software themselves are secretly in favor of some extent of copying and use of their software in violation of the EULAs despite their incessant publicity about the supposed harm that it causes .
One reason for this is that such practices are extremely valuable for familiarizing people with the software who otherwise would not be able to afford it .
When the incomes of such users rise , or when they start or join a company , this familiarity is likely to encourage some fraction of them to purchase the same software at full price from the authorized vendor .
8 Perhaps an even more important reason that developers of commercial software might secretly be , at least in part , happy with the unauthorized copying of their products is that it is a major weapon in their fight to slow down the advance of free software , which represents a far greater threat to their business model than does unauthorized copying and use .
Free software consists of programs that are free both in a monetary sense and with regard to use .
That is , it can be acquired by anyone at no cost , and everyone is permitted to use it for any desired purpose , including studying , copying , installing on as many computers as desired , giving away and even selling .
The most famous examples are Linux and the Firefox web browser , but thousands of other free software programs are also available , many of which have a performance comparable to or exceeding that of their proprietary counterparts .
9
Advocates of this secret ally theory point out as evidence the fact that the large commercial software developers are very selective in their attempts to enforce the EULA restrictions .
That is , their efforts are devoted mainly to organizations in high and medium income countries , whereas relatively little is done in low income countries and very little is done about individuals unless their actions are particularly blatant and attract a lot of attention .
In fact , at least until recently , little attempt was made to prevent individuals using unauthorized copies from freely downloading security patches and other upgrades .
Inappropriate Terminology Critics of the concept of software piracy also point out that the situation is further confused by what they claim to be the deliberate use of misleading and inappropriate terminology by the major commercial software developers .
That is , use of the term piracy itself is also highly controversial in a software context .
This is because it implies that people or organizations who create or use copies of programs in violation of their EULAs are similar to pirates .
Pirates are violent gangs that raid ships at sea in order to steal their cargoes and rob their crews ; they also frequently injure or kill the crews and sink their ships .
10 Critics of this terminology claim that it was chosen for its dramatic public relations value rather than because of any relationship to the traditional use of the word .
Many people who have heard about real pirates can easily sense that this term is a great exaggeration when applied to software .
They might legitimately ask whether it would be any less meaningful to use another nonsensical term such as software murder or software rape .
When the terminology is so exaggerated , it can only strengthen the suspicion that the entire situation is being exaggerated , probably mainly for revenue enhancement and political purposes .
Another problem with the term is that some people might actually delight in considering themselves to be pirates of some sort , as the term has taken on somewhat of a romantic image as a result of various books and movies about historical pirates and their adventures .
This is just one more reason that the term unauthorized copying might be a much more appropriate alternative .
Possible Solutions
Some computer , economics and legal experts believe that if a solution to the so - called software piracy situation were truly desired , then an important first step would be a reexamination of the entire issue , including the concept of EULAs and the lack of antitrust enforcement , by unbiased parties or representatives of all interests and points of view rather than just by those representing the views of the large software developers .
However , they are generally aware that this could be very difficult because of the strong forces that favor the status quo , particularly the great political influence of the largest software developers .
They also emphasize that the issue could become increasingly irrelevant in the future .
Among the unilateral steps that could be taken were there serious interest on the part of at least some of the major parties involved in achieving a reduction in the so - called software piracy but in the absence of any consensus on the policy measures for achieving such solution are : ( 1 ) Adjustment by vendors of proprietary software of their prices to levels that are consistent with the income levels in each country or region .
In fact , this could actually result in increased revenue for them due to the greater volume of authorized sales .
( 2 ) Enforcement by national governments of existing antitrust laws and the creation of new ones where necessary in order to increase competition and thereby lower prices so that it is easier for users to purchase software from authorized sources .
Ideally , it would be most effective to do this in the countries in which such software is developed ( i.e. , mainly the U.S. ) .
However , in the absence of the political will to do so in such countries , the coordinated enactment and enforcement of such laws in a number of user countries , even the lowest income ones , could still have quite an effect . ( 3 ) A more honest approach by companies that are accusing users of so - called software piracy .
This includes ( a ) stopping the exaggeration of the negative effects , ( b ) openly admitting and making at least token restitution for the vast amount of damage which has resulted from years of abusive monopoly practices and ( c ) avoiding the use of nonsensical terminology such as software piracy .
( 4 ) Increased promotion of the use of free software .
Because its license always requires that it be available at no monetary cost and encourages the study , modification , extension and redistribution of it , thus , by definition , there can be no such thing as piracy of free software .
Indeed , the increased use of free software is likely to become the most effective solution in the long run as its use continues to proliferate as a consequence of successive improvements in its performance , of more people becoming aware of its benefits , 11 and of governments and other organizations continuing to remove the various barriers to its widespread use .

It is reported that in 1998 Bill Gates , co-founder and chairman of Microsoft , stated in a presentation to business students at an American university that widespread software piracy could be a useful for Microsoft .
According to Microsoft in China : Clash of titans , cnn.com , February 2000 , and other sources , he said : " Although about three million computers get sold every year in China , people do n't pay for the software .
Someday they will , though .
And as long as they 're going to steal it , we want them to steal ours .
They 'll get sort of addicted , and then we 'll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade . "
Significantly , this quote appears to be well known in China .

10 Although many people think of piracy as being something that occurred centuries ago on sailing ships , the practice is still very much alive today , particularly in the waters around Southeast Asia and off the east coast of Africa .
It is often at least as cruel now as it was in the past .

The tenor of American diplomacy in the weeks since Mullen ’s visit suggests that Cacho ’s read on administration policy was right .
In the last few weeks , the U.S. has sped up the delivery of $ 1.4 billion of military and surveillance equipment , and pledged to buy Black Hawk helicopters for the Mexican military .
It has become de facto U.S. policy to characterize Calderon ’s domestic deployment of the army as “ courageous , ” a plaudit recently used by Obama , Attorney General Eric Holder , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , and Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
Even Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got in on the action , stopping by a military training facility in Mexico City .
At the end of that visit , she “ then , dressed in a coral pantsuit , … climbed into the back of a pickup and sped off to tour a Black Hawk helicopter hangar , ” USA Today reported .
On the homefront , too , it ’s been a busy time for American drug policy .
But the tone here is rather different .
The President ’s new budget proposal would allocate some $ 64 million to the country ’s drug courts , making it possible for more users to get treatment rather than incarceration .
Attorney General Eric Holder has also committed the Justice Department to halting raids on state - approved medical marijuana dispensaries .
And confirming just how far domestic drug policy has shifted from punishment and policing , the man the administration has picked as its new " drug czar " is Seattle Police Chief R. Gil Kerlikowske , who is famously not in favor of hard - line drug policies .
Kerlikowske ’s stance is that fighting supply is ultimately ineffective , and that " our nation 's drug problem is one of human suffering . "
Medical marijuana advocates in Washington State see his nomination as something of a coup .
Joanna McKey , co-founder of Seattle ’s Green Cross medical marijuana dispensary , worked with Kerlikowske ’s office to amicably resolve neighborhood clinic complaints .
When she heard of Kerlikowske ’s federal appointment , her first thought was , “ we are blessed , ” she says .
To Douglas Hiatt , a Seattle - area medical - marijuana lawyer , the selection of his chief for drug czar signals a new open - mindedness when it comes to domestic drug laws .
“ He ’s a very pragmatic guy , ” Hiatt says .
“ He ’s not going to continue with policies that do n’t work .
He ’s got enough intellectual integrity that he ’s going to try to solve problems and not parrot useless nonsense . ”
Given the softening domestic climate on marijuana , some Southwestern officials have wondered whether fighting the drug is even worth it .
In December , Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard suggested that marijuana ’s illicit status is responsible for some of the cartel - related violence seeping into his state .
His logic was simple : according to his office , 65 percent of the cartels ’ revenue comes from smuggling marijuana , a business that ’s only profitable because it ’s illegal .
Though Goddard , a Democrat , is careful to note that he does n’t support legalization , he ’s been calling loudly for a reexamination of our federal and state marijuana laws , especially given that marijuana looks like “ health food ” compared to products like meth , he says .

Scientists who for the first time tracked an asteroid on a collision course with Earth , and watched as it exploded in the atmosphere , have now picked up some of the remnants on the ground .
The discovery and analysis of the meteorites , reported in Thursday ’s issue of Nature , give scientists solid data on the composition of meteorites that originate from at least one type of asteroid , known as F - class .
Millions of asteroids , mostly small , whirl around the solar system , and over the years people have picked up tens of thousands of meteorites , the surviving rock fragments of asteroids that collide with Earth .

Capital intensive vs. labor intensive production techniques is the two popular techniques used in the production of goods .
Firms , irrespective of their sizes , can also decide the system that is ideal for them .
Nevertheless , we are going to be as plain as possible in this comparison .
The aim , as always , is to provide valuable information .
Capital intensive vs. labor intensive :
What differentiates both production techniques ?
A business that is capital intensive implies one in which higher capital investment is required .
The business owner needs to invest more in the acquisition of sophisticated and automated machines , including diverse equipment .
So , there might be a need to hire only a fewer number of workers , whose primary duty would be to operate the machines .
But in labor - intensive production techniques , the focus is to hire more employees ( humans ) to handle the production process .
Furthermore , in capital intensive methods , higher investment is required to maintain the machines used for production , and output could be considerably higher in the long term .
But in labor - intensive techniques , businesses can only increase production by asking workers to work extra hours or employ more temporary staff for a specified period .
Continue reading to get more information on this topic !
What Is Capital Intensive Production Process ?
It is best to decide the production process a business is going to adopt before even thinking of starting operations .
The reason is that if the company is capital intensive , it means that you may require a lot of money to produce similar quality and quantity as your competitors .
Furthermore , the good thing about the capital intensive production process is the output .
Machines can go overboard and deliver more products or services .
They can work 24 hours for weeks , while humans can’t .
However , the bottom line is , before you think of splashing the cash on a new business , think of the production process , and plan accordingly .
So , what ’s capital intensive production , by the way ?
When we say that a business is capital intensive , what we are referring to is that the company relies heavily on machines to produce goods and services .
The company would need substantial financial resources to acquire more assets .
The assets also have to be proportional to the profits or sales they can generate for the business .
Machines and robots handle the goods produced in these types of companies .
So , the initial investment is always very high .
Subsequently , there will be a need to make money available for repairs or probably , to replace some of the machines .
Examples Of Capital Intensive Industry
Most companies are capital intensive .
In other words , they require a huge capital base to establish .
For an investor venturing into a capital intensive business to be competitive , fixed capital such as property , equipment , and plant relative to the level of revenue , must be put in place .
Let ’s consider an air transport business as an example .
Starting such a company would require significant financial investment because of the cost of an aircraft .
The price of the jetliner 747 – 700 models , starts from $ 82.4 million .
So , you may require nothing less than $ 1 million to start such a business .
Other examples of capital intensive industry ;
Telecommunication
Oil refining and production
Transportation ( airlines and railways )
Automobile manufacturing industry
So , these are examples of businesses that come under capital - intensive .
Now let ’s take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of this type of production process .
Capital Intensive Production Process : What Are The Advantages ?
Some things make starting these kinds of businesses attractive .
But before venturing into a capital intensive business , it would make sense to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages .
So , below are the advantages of starting or owning such businesses .
1. Products are more accurate :
No offense to humans , but products made by machines or robots , is more accurate .
As long as the machine in use is in good shape , it will continue to deliver the same quality and standard for years .
And as a consequence , there might be little or no complaints from customers who are comfortable with the same standard .
2. Increased output :
Machines and robots can produce more goods than human laborers .
They can work extra time without complaining .
Products are also provided with higher speed and efficiency .
So , customers will not have to wait for too long to get the products they need , unlike the labor - intensive production process .
In labor - intensive production , the workers may even forget about the fact that they have a deadline and continue interacting with one another .
3. Reduced employee wages and costs :
In a capital intensive production , 10 workers can produce 10,000 products per day .
But in the labor - intensive production system , the business might need to hire 100 workers or more to be able to deliver 10,000 products per day .
So , you can see that in the capital intensive system , companies do n’t spend much money when it comes to paying salaries because they have fewer workers .
And as a result , the cost of production is also reduced a bit .
4. Machines can work round the clock :
Can humans work round the clock ?
The answer is no !
But machines can work 24 hours throughout the week .
Also , even if they work round the clock for days , the quality and standard of the product or output will not be compromised .
Capital Intensive Production Process : What Are The Disadvantages ?
Everything has its good and bad sides .
One just has to understand both sides to be able to make an informed decision .
Here are the disadvantages of capital intensive production ;
1 . The high initial setup costs :
The idea of owning a capital intensive business looks attractive .
I understand perfectly well .
But one thing that is preventing many people from venturing into such kind of business is the initial startup cost .
Consider the airline business as an example ; you will need over $ 1 million to start the business .
2. Difficulty customizing orders :
Products made with machines are uniform .
They are always the same .
You ca n’t tweak the machine to make one particular order to be different .
3 . Lack of creativity :
Machines do not have initiatives .
They are inflexible and will not know when to come up with new ideas that will make the product unique .
What Is Labor Intensive Production Process ?
In economics , labor refers to human efforts deployed in the production of goods or rendering of services .
The products or services produced are handled by laborers , hired , and paid specific amounts , following the agreement reached with the employers .
In labor intensive production , one drawback is that the output can be too low when compared to capital intensive production .
In short , the labor - intensive production process is most common among smaller - sized companies with weak financial capacities .
Examples of Labor Intensive Industry
Agriculture
Hospitality
Foodservice
Mining
Pole and line fishing
Small scale farming
Hairdressing
Labor Intensive Production Process : What Are The Advantages ?
There are advantages a labor intensive system has over the capital intensive production process .
Let ’s take a look at them .
1. Employment opportunities :
Machines do n’t have a family nor responsibilities , but humans do .
The labor intensive industry tends to provide more employment opportunities than the capital intensive one , which is beneficial to the economy and country as a whole .
2 . High flexibility :
Machines and robots can only act according to what is programmed in them .
Hence , they are not flexible .
But humans are adaptable and can utilize diverse ideas to create customized products .
3 . Can take over when machines breakdown :
Most machines are too expensive that when they malfunction , employing human labor becomes a better option .
The repairs of these machines can also be too costly .
4. Ability to provide instant feedback :
Businesses can get feedback in a labor - intensive production system , which could lead to the improvement of specific products or services .
The feedback and changes effected can give the company a competitive advantage , too .
Labor Intensive Production Process : What Are The Disadvantages ?
1. Labor - related problems abound :
Labor unions can go on strike at anything , thus causing production to stop .
This can affect the company in diverse ways .
However , machines do n’t have associations , so they do not go on strike .
2 . High level of inconsistency and inaccuracy :
In a labor - intensive production system , you cannot get the same quality of product all the time .
Humans are also more prone to errors than machines .
3. Expensive in the long run :
If you take time to calculate the amount paid to each worker as salaries for a year or more and revenue the business generated during the same period , you will discover that a labor - intensive system is a bit more expensive in the long run .
Conclusion
So , that ’s what you need to know about the capital intensive vs. labor intensive production systems .
You can see that both have their advantages and disadvantages .
So , if you are thinking of running a business , you have to consider these things before making your final decision .
But above all , choose a production system that you can handle successfully .
Keep in mind that the success of your business is what counts .

How can an Englishman write a novel about American myths and culture ?
The following essay was originally posted on Borders.com to coincide with the publication of American Gods .
Nobody 's asked the question I 've been dreading , so far , the question I have been hoping that no - one would ask .
So I 'm going to ask it myself , and try to answer it myself .
And the question is this :
How dare you ?
Or , in its expanded form ,
How dare you , an Englishman , try and write a book about America , about American myths and the American soul ?
How dare you try and write about what makes America special , as a country , as a nation , as an idea ?
And , being English , my immediate impulse is to shrug my shoulders and promise it wo n't happen again .
But then , I did dare , in my novel American Gods , and it took an odd sort of hubris to write it .
As a young man , I wrote a comic - book about dreams and stories called Sandman ( collected , and still in print , in ten graphic novels , and you should read it if you have n't ) .
I got a similar question all the time , back then : " You live in England .
How can you set so much of this story in America ? "
And I would point out that , in media terms , the UK was practically the 51st state .
We get American films , watch American TV .
" I might not write a Seattle that would satisfy an inhabitant , " I used to say , " But I 'll write one as good as a New Yorker who 's never been to Seattle . "
I was , of course , wrong .
I did n't do that at all .
What I did instead was , in retrospect , much more interesting : I created an America that was entirely imaginary , in which Sandman could take place .
A delirious , unlikely place out beyond the edge of the real .
And that satisfied me until I came to live in America about eight years ago .
Slowly I realised both that the America I 'd been writing was wholly fictional , and that the real America , the one underneath the what - you - see - is - what - you - get surface , was much more interesting than the fictions .
The immigrant experience is , I suspect , a universal one ( even if you 're the kind of immigrant , like me , who holds on tightly , almost superstitiously , to his UK citizenship ) .
On the one hand , there 's you , and on the other hand , there 's America .
It 's bigger than you are .
So you try and make sense of it .
You try to figure it out - something which it resists .
It 's big enough , and contains enough contradictions , that it is perfectly happy not to be figured out .
As a writer , all I could do was to describe a small part of the whole .
And it was too big to see .
I did n't really know what kind of book I wanted to write until , in the summer of 1998 , I found myself in Reykjavik , in Iceland .
And it was then that fragments of plot , an unwieldy assortment of characters , and something faintly resembling a structure , came together in my head .
Either way , the book came into focus .
It would be a thriller , and a murder mystery , and a romance , and a road trip .
It would be about the immigrant experience , about what people believed in when they came to America .
And about what happened to the things that they believed .
I wanted to write about America as a mythic place .
And I decided that , although there were many things in the novel I knew already , there were more I could find by going on the road and seeing what I found .
So I drove , until I found a place to write , and then , in one place after another , sometimes at home , sometimes not , for nearly two years , I put one word after another , until I had a book .
The story of a man called Shadow and the job he is offered when he gets out of prison .
It tells the story of a small Midwestern town and the disappearances that occur there every winter .
I discovered , as I wrote it , why roadside attractions are the most sacred places in America .
I discovered many other strange by - ways and moments , scary and delightful and just plain weird .
When it was almost done , when all that remained was to pull together all the diverse strands , I left the country again , holed up in a huge , cold , old house in Ireland , and typed all that was left to type , shivering , beside a peat fire .
And then the book was done , and I stopped .
Looking back on it , it was n't really that I 'd dared , rather that I had had no choice .

I recently published a series of articles on the topic of emergency preparation and titled it , “ In The Event Of An Emergency “ .
The series is devoted to the topic of planning ahead for life ’s little ( and big ) emergencies that we all know will come our way .
The series covered topics ranging from making sure you have insurance coverage and an emergency fund , to making sure your family is provided for in case the worst case scenario happens .
Today I thought I would do a quick recap of the posts and bring all the articles together in one spot .
So without further ado , here they are :
In The Event Of An Emergency
Conclusions
Something that I ’ve taken away from writing this series is that we all go through hard times , things that were unexpected or unplanned for .
While we ca n’t keep ourselves from experiencing all of the pain associated with these events , we can plan ahead and minimize the impact .
A medical problem can go from being a bankruptable life event , to a bump in the road .
A fire in your home can go from being life changing to just putting your life on hold .
The point I ’d like to get across in this series is that while we can’t always avoid life ’s little emergencies , we can still plan ahead for them , and put ourselves in the best possible position to avoid having them become more than they need to be .

“ There is more travelling [ in the United States ] than in any part of the world , ” an article in the Boston American Traveler claimed in 1828 .
“ Here , the whole population is in motion , whereas , in old countries , there are millions who have never been beyond the sound of the parish bell . ”
The editor of the same paper remarked two years later that whereas in 1786 it had taken as long as six days to travel by stage from Boston to New York , now the trip was made easily in only a day and a half .
“ Who will undertake to predict the wonderful results of the next half century ? ” he wondered .
Aside from the fact that his paper was dedicated to the interests of the coaching business , the editor had good reason for looking forward to another fifty years of improvement and growth in highway travel .
Except for its navigable rivers and a handful of canals , the interior of New England in 1830 still was traversed only by a network of dirt and gravel roads .
As in other parts of the country , there had been a flurry of excitement over canals during the 1820s following the initial success of New York ’s Erie Canal .
Only a few canals were built in New England , however , and despite the fact that the canal companies promised to reduce transportation costs , teamsters had been able to compete with them by selectively cutting their own charges and by offering services the canal companies were unable to duplicate .
Agitation for railroads also had begun during the 1820s ; Massachusetts chartered the Boston and Lowell in 1830 .
But claims that railroads would revolutionize transportation , although frequently made , remained to be proved .
By 1840 , however , there were already more than 3,000 miles of track in the United States , including more than 400 miles in New England .
Railroads came to dominate overland transportation so completely that a half century after 1830 it had been largely forgotten that the roads , which then carried mostly local traffic , once had been important arteries of commerce .
Thus the historian of Ashburnham . , Massachusetts , was describing experiences familiar only to his older readers when he wrote in 1887 :
“ For many years long lines of teams and a great amount of pleasure travel passed through the central village ... heavy wagons , drawn by four , six and eight horses , laden with produce for the market and returning with merchandise for the country stores , [ and ] four and six horse stages ... daily passed each way . ”
With even further passage of time , improvements in overland transportation in the decades prior to the railroad era have become almost completely obscured by a mist of writings that either nostalgically relate the more romantic aspects of stagecoach and tavern days or that simply conclude that poor roads continued to keep inland communities isolated from effective links with the outside world until railroads brought about a revolution in transportation .
In the hill country of northern New England , according to one twentieth ?
century account , “ men and women were born , lived , and died without traveling twenty miles from the place of their birth . ”
Although there were undoubtedly people who fit that description , New Englanders even before the railroad era were increasingly a people on the move .
This was true of the hundreds of thousands of Yankee migrants who made overland treks to new settlements far removed from their places of birth and it was also true of those who remained behind .
It was made possible in part by improvements in the roads .
New England ’s first great road ?
building era occurred during the period 1790 to 1840 .
Its first phase , commonly referred to as the turnpike era , began during the 1790s and had practically ended in all the New England states except Connecticut before the War of 1812 .
Some 240 corporations built more than 3,700 miles of toll roads .
Every part of New England except Maine acquired an extensive turnpike network , although Connecticut was far in the lead with about 1,600 miles .
A second phase occurred between 1820 and 1840 and was marked by an upsurge of construction at public ( local ) expense .
In few ways had the United States been more backward prior to the turnpike era than in the roads that linked the coastal towns with the growing inland settlements .
Even near the largest towns main highways were at times so hard and rutted that they threatened to shake a vehicle to pieces and at other times so muddy as to be virtually impassable .
An English traveler during the fall of 1795 had his vehicle sink to the hubs near the same place in the vicinity of Baltimore where the President of the United States recently had suffered a similar indignity .
When the same traveler reached Baltimore he was detained for a week until the roads had frozen sufficiently for the Philadelphia stages to begin running again .
Another foreign visitor who traveled by stage from New York to Philadelphia wrote that the passengers were ill for an hour or more after being slammed about on a particularly rough stretch of road .
Other travelers described clouds of choking dust and vain efforts to defend themselves against the hordes of mosquitoes .
Newly settled areas , including parts of northern New England , were even less a place for the traveler faint ?
of ? heart .
A Connecticut minister who made a preaching tour of Vermont during the spring of 1789 at one point found himself in “ mud belly deep to my horse and I thought I should have perished . ”
Even so inveterate a traveler as President Timothy Dwight of Yale could only marvel at the way settlers on the northern New England frontier adjusted to hardships of travel “ over the worst roads , where both horses and men , accustomed to smoother ways , merely tremble , and creep .
“ Over roads , encumbered with rocks , mire , and the stumps and roots of trees , they ride upon a full trot ; and are apprehensive of no danger .
Even the women of these settlements , and those of every age share largely in this spirit .
The longest journies , in very difficult roads , they undertake with cheerfulness , and perform without anxiety .
I have often met them on horseback ; and been surprised to see them pass fearlessly over those dangers of the way , which my companions and myself watched with caution and solicitude . ”
Southern New England had some of the best roads in the United States .
The broad , smooth highway between Boston and Portsmouth was by far the best section of the great postal route from Portsmouth to Savannah , Georgia , and portions of the upper post road from Boston to New York , which led through Worcester , Springfield , and Hartford , also were considered good .
But between Spencer and Wilbraham , Massachusetts , the same road was so poor in 1788 that a Frenchman , after being “ bumped over rocks for thirty miles ” in a springless carriage , concluded that “ a coach with springs would have very soon upset and been smashed to pieces . ”
An Englishman who traveled by stage from Boston to Newport in 1797 wrote
“ Very often we surprised a family of pigs taking a bath in a gully of sufficient compass to admit the coach .
As often such chasms were filled by piles of stones that , at a distance , looked like Indian tumuli .
I found there were two evils to be dreaded in New England travelling — a clayey soil in wet weather , which , unqualified with gravel , made the road a canal ; and a sandy one in summer , which might emphatically be called an enormous insect preserve . ”
New England roads , he concluded , were “ far better than those in any other quarter of the Union , ” but “ brought ... sad comparison with the bowling ? greens of England . ”
Each New England town was responsible for building and maintaining all roads within its limits .
Colonial laws originally had required all adult males with few exceptions to work a certain number of days each year in the roads .
These laws were revised during the eighteenth century so that by 1800 most towns annually voted a highway tax assessed in proportion to the value of property holdings .
But these taxes continued to be paid in labor , and in halfhearted labor at that .
Although conditions varied somewhat from town to town , indifference in most cases prevented significant improvement .
A Connecticut man complained in 1797 that the people of many towns in that state “ have gone fifty or an hundred years through sloughs , as often as they have gone to the house of God , and probably they would be content to do the same fifty years more unless the public relieves them . ”
Even the main street of “ a flourishing and beautiful country town , ” according to an account written in 1803 , was likely to be littered with pieces of old fences and firewood , “ old sleds bottom upwards , carts , casks , weeds and loose stones , lying along in wild confusion . ”
The roadway itself would be “ scandalously bad ; foot ways , or cross paths , ruts and gutters , with stones at every step , disturb the traveler in his carriage , and the teamsters with their loads .
In a road of 80 miles , the worst part is that which passes through this charming street ! ”
And voters indifferent to their own convenience , were even less inclined to exert themselves for the benefit of outsiders who passed through town on the main highways .
Labor on the roads was supervised by surveyors of highways , twenty to thirty of whom were elected annually by some small towns .
When John Adams reached the age of twenty ?
one , he was surprised to find himself nominated for this job and objected that he knew nothing about road making .
He was told that “ they make it a rule to compell every Man to serve either as Constable or Surveyor , or to pay a fine . ”
Adams performed his duties in a conscientious way , even though a bridge built under his direction soon was washed away .
It was charged , however , that most highway surveyors lacked interest as well as skill and that many of them were concerned only to have the roads past their own houses repaired .
Gangs of men working out their own or someone else ’s highway taxes remained a common sight in many New England towns until well after the Civil War .
Some work was done during the fall and a way had to be cleared after particularly heavy snowstorms , but most repair work was done on several days in June during the period between planting and haying .
The roads then were deeply rutted but were no longer muddy from spring thaws and rains .
Gutters were ploughed out and ruts filled with the dirt and decayed vegetation thus obtained .
In many instances the dirt simply was piled high and left to be worn down by the wheels of passing vehicles , although ox ? drawn scrapers sometimes were used to level and smooth .
Much time was spent in leaning on shovels or hoes or resting in the shade , for a day on the roads was widely regarded as a holiday from farm work .
Rum flowed freely , stories were told , and impromptu footraces and contests of strength occasionally were held .
At the end of the day the workers were given credit for a day ’s labor and left the roads in little better condition than they had found them .
In spite of these road conditions , traffic increased considerably during the latter half of the eighteenth century .
One reason was that inland areas had become more fully settled .
Families struggling to overcome the wilderness at first were able to procure little more than a bare subsistence and had little to trade with the outside world .
But by the early 1790s , according to a contemporary account , even in towns settled no earlier than the time of the Revolution “ the present inhabitants have overcome the first difficulties of clearing their farms , and begin to furnish considerable supplies of produce for market . ”
Butter , cheese , beef , pork , and other articles able to bear the cost of transportation over poor roads to the markets along the coast and navigable rivers were traded at inland stores for sugar , spirits , hardware , and occasional “ gewgaws ” such as “ new fashioned blue and white ware , ” “ Very Elegant Fruit Baskets and Stands , ” “ wood painted fans , ” and “ silver tea and table spoons , sleeve buttons , knee buckles , broaches and clasps . ”
During the slack winter months many farmers brought sleds loaded with their produce to sell in Boston , Portsmouth , and other markets from as far away as northern Vermont and New Hampshire .
One winter Saturday in 1803 more than 700 sleds and sleighs entered the river town of Hudson , New York , by way of a toll road leading from Berkshire County , Massachusetts .
The Revolutionary War was another factor in the growth of transportation .
It created a temporary need for the movement of men and supplies over long distances , but more importantly , perhaps , many a New Englander returned from service with a greater realization that the world was not bounded by the limits of his own town and that distances could be overcome .
Levi Pease , for example , had been a blacksmith in Blandford , Massachusetts , before serving as a courier and procurer of supplies during the Revolution .
In 1783 he decided to start a stage line between Boston and Hartford despite the warning of at least one skeptic that there would not be sufficient patronage for such a line “ in your day or mine . ”
There were then only about a dozen stage lines in New England , the longest of which ran between Boston and Portsmouth .
Pease and his partner , starting business with two coaches and twelve horses , persisted even though at first they sometimes carried no passengers at all .
They gradually attracted patronage and by 1786 had thrice ?
weekly stages running between Boston and New York .
By 1795 there were “ upwards of an hundred horses , and twenty carriages employed ” between Boston and New Haven alone and competitors were trying to emulate Pease ’s success .
Finally , business opportunities resulting from war in Europe during most of the period between 1793 and 1815 led to further growth in transportation .
It was largely because of these opportunities that Timothy Pitkin could write in 1816 , “ No nation , it is believed , has ever increased so rapidly in wealth as the United States . ”
Shipping interests enjoyed the greatest profits , but farmers , who still relied primarily on overseas markets in a pre? industrial United States , also benefited from a growth in foreign demand .
The quantity of barreled pork exported from the United States in 1795 , for example , was more than three times what it had been four years earlier .
Even so remote a community as Peacham , in northern Vermont , shared in the prosperity and a storekeeper there in 1801 warned “ those few individuals who have dispensed with punctuality in their payments ” that “ it is much better for them to make remittances now , when articles of the country command a good price , than after they have fallen at least 50 per cent , which will probably take place , at the termination of the European war . ”
By the end of the eighteenth century a growing number of New Englanders thus were directly affected by the condition of the roads .
Among the number were stagecoach operators , storekeepers who made semiannual purchasing trips to New York or Boston in addition to using the roads for the transportation of goods , and those farmers who received lower prices for their produce at inland stores because transportation costs were high as well as those who made marketing trips themselves .
The attitude of many of them was summed up in the complaint of a Connecticut farmer that “ our winters are often open ?
our spring and fall are rainy ?
yet these are the seasons for going to market , and the poor farmer who lives 30 or 40 miles from water , must risk his cattle and his carriage , or lose the benefit of market . ”
Why , he wondered , must “ the interior towns [ continue ] to drag their produce to market thro ’ deep mud to the axle ? trees of their carts and Waggons ? ”
As Americans during the 1790 ’s sought to form “ a more perfect union , ” the improvement of transportation facilities for purposes of both defense and development came to be regarded as a patriotic duty .
This , together with the already growing importance of roads in New England and in other parts of the United States where forces similar to those described were at work , led to demands for improvement of the highways and for reform of the system of local responsibility for the roads .
As long as the towns remained seemingly free to do almost as they pleased , according to one observer , “ three centuries , perhaps ten , will pass away before the roads are made good and more money will be spent in vain than would dig the canals of China . ”
Although the towns in theory were answerable to the states , laws relating to road standards had proved difficult to enforce .
It was recognized that many towns , particularly the newer and more sparsely settled ones , lacked resources as well as the inclination to maintain through roads , which at any rate seemed to be primarily for the benefit of the travelers who used them .
During the years following the Revolution , however , the states generally were in no position to assume the responsibility themselves or to increase already unpopular tax burdens .
The day when they could look to the federal government for assistance in such matters still was far in the future .
English eighteenth ?
century experience with toll roads financed by bonding had shown , moreover , that it was possible to secure better roads by requiring those who actually used them to pay the cost .
Given proper incentives , individuals with money to invest stood ready to undertake road building projects .
With proper regulation , voluntary associations of such individuals might well prove more amenable as agents of the state than the towns had been .
Toll bridge corporations had enjoyed some success during the 1780s and during the 90s a number of states similarly began chartering semi?
public turnpike corporations , the name turnpike having been derived from an early device used to stop travelers on English toll roads .
Although turnpike companies were owned by private shareholders who were to be permitted profits on their investments of as much as twelve per cent a year from the collection of tolls , it was well understood that they were in business to perform a public service as well as to earn profits .
They were required to build and maintain their roads to standards approved by public commissioners , to charge no more than legally established rates of toll , and to locate their tollgates at specified intervals ( usually ten miles ) to prevent overcharging .
In most cases the states also sought to protect the public by retaining the right to condemn and award compensation for land taken for turnpike use , thus erecting a barrier against abuses such as later occurred when railroads were given considerable freedom in determining their routes .
As a further safeguard , most turnpike charters were to expire after the companies had earned back their investment plus profits averaging twelve per cent a year .
Complaints that turnpikes were “ injurious to the Rights of free men ” usually were based on objections to paying toll .
On the whole , public interests were fairly well protected during the turnpike era .
The Lancaster Turnpike , chartered by Pennsylvania in 1792 , was the first toll ? road corporation in the United States , although previously there had been a few experiments with toll roads based on the English model of a turnpike trust with a bonded debt to pay in Virginia , Maryland , and Connecticut .
Rhode Island established the second such corporation in 1794 and within two years each of the New England states had chartered at least one turnpike .
With its relatively heavy concentration of population and wealth , the region during the next decade took the lead in this form of enterprise .
In 1800 two ? thirds of the seventy ?
two toll roads in the United States were in New England , twenty ?
three in Connecticut .
“ Turnpike roads seem to be the great rage of the day , ” a traveler in Berkshire County observed in 1801 .
Two years later the Rev. William Bentley predicted that Essex County , Massachusetts , soon would “ be intersected with the best [ turnpike ] roads , & the whole will probably be lucrative to adventurers . ”
By 1808 , when Jefferson ’s Embargo interrupted foreign trade and helped to bring an end to turnpike fever in New England , most of the important routes of travel and many unimportant ones had been taken over and improved by corporations .
Most New England toll roads , according to Fisher Ames , the former Federalist Congressman who was himself president of a turnpike company , were built “ to facilitate country produce on its way to market . ”
Many closely followed previously established routes between the back country and the principal market towns .
Boston , New England ’s principal commercial center , became the hub of its turnpike system , with toll roads radiating outwards towards Providence , Hartford , the Connecticut Valley of Massachusetts , and the New Hampshire line .
A number of the latter roads connected with turnpikes leading across New Hampshire to the Connecticut River , where they in turn were linked with Vermont toll roads .
Other New Hampshire turnpikes led towards Portsmouth and Portland .
In western New England turnpikes led towards the Hudson River and Lake Champlain .
In Rhode Island they were used to carry farm produce to Providence from rural towns in that state and parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts .
Throughout the region , many of these roads , varying in length from a few miles to fifty or more , were combined into longer chains for through travel .
Thus it was possible to journey most of the way from Boston to Burlington , Albany , or New York on toll roads .
From Albany other turnpikes led most of the way across New York State .
Connecticut developed by far the most complex network of toll roads in New England .
A visitor to that state in 1807 found “ in almost every ... direction a turnpike ? road ; for , these roads being here made objects of private gain , and not as in England , of merely public care , they are established with avidity , on the smallest prospect of advantage . ”
Unlike Massachusetts or Rhode Island , Connecticut had no great center of wealth and commerce comparable with Boston or Providence and there was considerable competition among its market towns for the trade of the back country .
Merchants and other interested individuals in Bridgeport , Hartford , Middletown , New Haven , New London , Norwalk , and Norwich were active in making their towns turnpike centers as a means of furthering that competition .
Many of these towns had direct trade with the West Indies and all traded by water with New York or Boston , the principal centers for foreign trade .
A number of inland towns , including Litchfield , Tolland , Torrington , and Windham , also became toll road centers upon which vehicles loaded with farm produce or imported goods converged from all directions .
Competition for trade may have been one reason why Connecticut corporations continued to build toll roads until the mid?
1830 ’s , while relatively few turnpike projects were undertaken in other New England states after 1808 .
More than eighty ? six per cent of the 113 turnpike corporations chartered by the Connecticut legislature succeeded in raising the capital needed for their projects , while only slightly more than half the companies elsewhere in New England were similarly successful .
Although it was hoped at first that toll roads would return substantial earnings , Fisher Ames as early as 1802 wrote , “ Turnpikes with the fairest prospect of success have seldom proved profitable . ”
Turnpike stock within a few years usually sold at far below its original cost .
Although the financial records that have been preserved are far from complete , it is probable that a majority of New England toll roads failed even to earn back the cost of capital expenditures .
Maintenance costs were one important factor in holding down earnings ; the success of the public in evading toll payments was another .
Since tollgates frequently were as far as ten miles apart , much of the local traffic using these free ? access roads did so without paying any toll .
In addition , toll roads , which usually followed a fairly straight course , often crossed older , winding roads in a number of places ; travelers frequently were able to bypass tollgates by detouring temporarily onto one of these “ shunpikes . ”
The Norfolk and Bristol Turnpike , main route between Boston and Providence , crossed one such road thirteen times in the space of a few miles ;
Ames , its president , once estimated that the company ’s earnings would be almost sixty per cent greater if it were not for shunpikes .
The owners of the Powder Mill Turnpike complained to the Rhode Island legislature that its road “ hath ... so many places for turning Off , that unreasonable designing travellers , constantly take advantage of such old ... roads , avoiding the gate . ”
Connecticut turnpike companies , which often made only minor improvements ( the average expenditure per mile for toll roads in that state was about $ 550 as against $ 1300 in New Hampshire ) , had by far the best earnings .
The Talcott Mountain Turnpike , part of the main route between Hartford and Albany , had average profits of 10.9 per cent a year for four decades and at least twenty other companies earned average profits of from three to 9.5 per cent a year for ten years or longer .
Elsewhere in New England , only five roads are known to have had earnings within the same range .
While turnpikes seldom returned direct profits to investors , they did benefit many merchants and tavern keepers in the form of new trade .
Real estate values in the vicinity of toll roads tended to rise .
Those who used the new roads also benefited .
Timothy Dwight , in describing the turnpike between Norwich and New London , wrote that before it was built
“ few persons attempted to go from one of the places to the other , and return , on the same day .
The new road is smooth and good ; and the journey is now easily performed in little more than two hours .
These towns , therefore , may be regarded as having been brought nearer to each other more than half a day ’s journey . ”
Robert Rantoul wrote of the Salem Turnpike in 1872
“ How much the new route , only twelve miles and a fraction long , did to bring us and the metropolis together , will be recalled with pleasure by some yet living who enjoyed for the first time , in the fall of 1803 , an evening ride to Boston with a ball , a concert , or a play in prospect to give zest to the excursion . ”
Most importantly , perhaps , turnpike companies introduced and popularized improved methods of road building .
Roads that once had been little more than cleared paths , narrow and winding , were widened and straightened .
Crowned surfaces and ditches were used to provide drainage .
Gravel also was used on the better toll roads .
Turnpike builders , to be sure , often were so preoccupied with the shortening of distances that they chose to follow a straight line over steep hills that should have been avoided .
Many such mistakes eventually had to be corrected , but in general grades on turnpikes probably were less steep than those on many earlier roads , which had been built from farm to farm with little regard for either distance or grade .
Efforts were made , moreover , to reduce some of the worst grades by means of cutting and filling .
These methods soon were put to use by some towns to improve roads still under local control .
A resident of Goshen , Connecticut , wrote in 1812
“ The common roads in this town have for the last ten years been in a state of rapid improvement .
This has been owing partly , to the running of two turnpike roads through the town , crossing each other at the meeting house , which not only throws more [ of the townspeople ’s ] labour on the common roads but gives us ... a precedent [ for their improvement ] . ”
Daniel Webster recalled in later years that before the turnpike era there had been no road usable by carriages between New Hampshire ’s three major rivers .
“ Perhaps , ” he said , “ the most valuable result of making these turnpike roads was the diffusion of knowledge upon road making among the people ; for in a few years afterward , great numbers of the people went to church , to electoral and other meetings , in chaises and wagons , over very tolerable roads . ”
Following its decline after 1808 , road building activity became intensified again between 1820 and 1840 .
A number of new highways were built as New England began to turn toward manufacturing and as older communities situated near suitable sources of water power began to grow and new ones came into existence .
Private investors by then seldom were willing to undertake risky toll ? road projects .
As a result , despite continued opposition , the burden of building roads “ of general use and importance to the public ” once again was thrust upon the towns .
In Massachusetts and New
Hampshire the counties occasionally shared part of the cost .
New laws gave the counties firm authority over the towns in matters relating to roads , particularly in Massachusetts and Maine , where elected county commissioners were empowered to order and supervise the building of any road they considered necessary and to have the work done at the expense of any town that refused to carry out their orders .
These laws were unpopular and similar ones soon were repealed in Vermont and New Hampshire .
Before 1840 , however , public roads once again had become the dominant element in New England ’s highway system .
These newer roads in many instances took traffic from the turnpikes , a number of which went out of business between 1820 and 1840 .
By the latter date some toll roads also were affected by competition from railroads .
Those that remained in business came to be regarded as obnoxious vestiges of a period when governments had granted special privileges to favored groups .
Petitioners to the New Hampshire legislature , in 1834 complained that
“ In the early days of this country , such corporations tended greatly to facilitate the public travel ; yet , when towns became sufficiently wealthy to support Free Roads , Turnpikes became a grievance to the inhabitants , and a burden to the traveler . ”
New Hampshire in 1838 enacted a law under which town selectmen were permitted to condemn a turnpike company ’s property and take it over as a public road .
But even in New Hampshire it appears that the towns usually permitted companies to continue maintaining their roads until declining revenues forced them out of business .
By this time their property was virtually worthless and the towns were compelled to award them very little in the way of damages .
Probably half the toll roads in New England had ceased to operate by 1850 ; nearly all were gone by the end of the century .
The last company abandoned its road about the time of World War I .
New England ’s highway system in 1840 was still the best in the United States , although far below the standards of such advanced countries as England and France .
The best roads were in eastern Massachusetts and in the vicinity of Hartford , Providence , and other large towns .
These were in good condition nearly all year except for short periods during the early spring and fall .
The worst roads may have been in Maine , where it was reported in 1832 , “ the communication is uniformly good only for a few months in summer , and a few weeks in the winter . ”
According to the same account , however , New England roads were considered “ generally fine , ” [ and ] are thronged with stage coaches , most of which are good . ”
Fifty years after Levi Pease went into the coaching business , nearly 300 stage lines served almost every corner of the region .
In 1790 most travel had been on horseback and private pleasure vehicles had been a rare sight out side the largest towns .
In 1840 there were more than 6,000 such vehicles in Connecticut alone and a traveler on horseback had become a rare sight .
The two ? wheeled oxcart commonly had been used for hauling heavy loads in 1790 .
Before 1840 four ?
wheeled wagons drawn by horses were “ used in almost every family in the country ” and were to be found on the roads hauling wool and other supplies purchased throughout New England and parts of New York from agents in Boston and Providence to mills in Oxford , Southbridge , and Webster , Massachusetts .
They returned with finished cloth .
They carried great loads of mackerel barrels from coopers ’ shops in southern New Hampshire to the wharves of Boston , Newburyport , Portsmouth , and Salem , iron , marble , and lime from western Connecticut and Massachusetts to shipping points along the Hudson River .
Farmers throughout the period continued to make winter journeys to market and drovers brought large numbers of cattle and hogs to the great Brighton market near Boston from all over northern New England and parts of New York .
Country storekeepers also continued to take farm produce in trade , sending it to market in return for store goods .
Brimfield , Massachusetts , had three stores and according to the recollection of one resident :
“ Every Saturday afternoon the sheds and hitching post were surrounded by the horses and , wagons of the farmers who had come into town with their wives and daughters to trade off their poultry , butter and eggs for store goods , and in the fall of the year , when the hogs had been killed and the turkeys fattened and dressed for market , the store keepers would purchase them , and some Monday morning when they had made up a load would start a man and team for Boston with them , who would return Saturday night with a wagon load of new goods , the arrival of which was an occasion of great interest . ”
Transportation needs grew sufficiently before 1840 for teaming to become a regular form of employment .
Regularly scheduled baggage wagons operated between the larger towns ; independent teamsters also worked for store keepers , factory owners , and other businessmen .
A survey in 1828 of the transportation needs of thirty ?
five towns near the route of a proposed railroad from Boston to Albany showed that an estimated average of 740 tons a year was transported by land between each town and its markets .
It was reported at the same time that an average of forty loaded wagons a day carrying 14,000 tons a year passed through Bolton , Massachusetts , on their way between Boston and towns in the vicinity of Greenfield , Massachusetts , and Brattleboro , Vermont .
One teamster , Moses Peck , made more than 100 trips between Montpelier , Vermont , and Boston between 1820 and 1828 , drawing loads of up to four tons with his six ?
horse team .
Vehicles such as Peck ’s were part of what Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1837 described as
“ the endless procession of wagons loaded with the wealth of all regions of England and China , of Turkey , of the Indies , which from Boston creep by my gate to all the towns of New Hampshire and Vermont .
With creaking wheels at midsummer , and , crunching the snows , on huge sledges in January , the train goes forward at all hours , bearing this cargo of inexhaustible comfort and luxury to every cabin in the hills . ”
By present standards the roads and vehicles of the time were still primitive and Emerson ’s “ endless procession ” was but a trickle .
Although they declined somewhat during the period , transportation costs ( often as high as $ 20 per ton for 100 miles ) continued to affect prices and to exclude bulky , low ? value products from distant markets .
Dairy products and meat , along with wool , were still among the relatively few items of farm produce that could be transported profitably long distances .
The price of wool , which in December 1830 sold in Boston for from thirty to sixty ?
seven cents per pound , was little affected by transportation costs .
Hay , on the other hand , sold for only sixty to seventy cents per hundred pounds , and it cost about as much as that commodity was worth to transport it by land sixty or seventy miles .
The distance i it could be transported profitably was much less than that .
The farmers of New Braintree , in central Massachusetts , sent 200 tons of cheese , butter , and pork to market in Boston in 1822 , but it was complained that transportation costs prevented them from growing oats or potatoes commercially and from purchasing plaster of Paris for use as a fertilizer .
Vermont , because of its distance from most markets , was particularly hard hit by freighting costs .
Governor Samuel Crafts complained in 1830 that “ the more bulky products of our agriculture , of our forests , and our mountains , excepting so much as are necessary for the use of our inhabitants , are valueless . ”
Worcester , Massachusetts , was only about forty miles from Boston , but the charge for overland freight during the 20’s and early 30’s was about $ 10 per ton ; “ it costs less to transport a ton of heavy goods from Liverpool ... to Boston , than from Boston to Worcester . ”
After the opening of the Boston and Worcester Railroad in 1835 the cost of freighting was reduced to about $ 3.50 per ton .
Such reductions led many New Englanders to hope that railroads would permit farmers and manufacturers to do a much greater volume of business and to market a greater variety of products than was possible as long as they had to rely on highway transportation .
But some changes that the railroads were to bring were not anticipated .
Cheaper transportation enabled western farmers to compete successfully with their New England counterparts in supplying some types of food to the region ’s growing cities .
And the residents of more than one village that had been outstripped by towns closer to the railroad probably came to echo the complaint that “ railroads are sometimes feeders and sometimes drains . ”
Developments in transportation during the decades after 1840 far surpassed the “ wonderful results ” of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries .
Yet even before the railroad era , the physical isolation of New England ’s inland communities had been broken down to a considerable extent .
“ Of late years , ” the editor of a Concord , New Hampshire , paper wrote in 1839 , “ such has been the passion for improving roads , for evading bad hills , shortening distances and turning travelers by particular locations ” that transportation had been facilitated “ to an extent beyond what . . . settlers fifty and sixty years ago would have anticipated . ”
Even during muddy periods of spring and fall , “ so much has travel increased , so great is the transit of heavy goods , as well as of many travellers to and from the interior and seaboard , that at the worst period of the roads there seems , if possible , to be most travel . ”
The road , Horace Bushnell wrote shortly after 1840 , “ is that physical sign or symbol by which you will best understand any age or people ... for if there is any motion in society , the road , which is the symbol of motion , will indicate the fact . ”
Better roads and increased traffic during the period 1790 to 1840 resulted from and contributed to a quickening pulse in the economic and social life .

Get potomp v0.2 ( sources only ) - with CSS stylin ’ o’ the progress bars !
Get potomp v0.1 ( sources only )
Deluge has a client / server model separating its core from its user interface .
potomp connects to a running deluged instance via XML - RPC , gets the current running torrents ’ stats and displays a set of progress bars for each torrent .
I wrote potomp wanting to brush up on my C++ and in order to familiarize myself with the Qt4 toolkit .
It uses the QXML - RPC library by Dmitry Poplavsky to handle communications with the deluge daemon .
It should run on any system that supports Qt4 ( * nix , Windows and Mac OSX ) , but it ’s only been tested on Linux and Windows .
And it ’s got some issues , either with Windows or with Qt 4.5 , because while on my Linux box running Qt 4.4.3 it looks like the screenie above and runs fine , on my Windows box running Qt 4.5 only the first XML - RPC request goes thru , the progress bars do n’t update to reflect torrent progress .
And also , it looks weird on Windows , as the text is n’t ON the progress bars , but to their right ( har har , fixed using CSS , Qt is awesome ! )
I suppose it ’s just a styling issue , but I have n’t found a way around it as of yet .
Other issues include an inability to sort the torrents in any way ( they ’re automatically sorted alnum by infohash ) and the fact that the main window wo n’t extend if you ’ve got more torrents running than will fit in the initial window height .
The Console tab looks like this .
How to build and run potomp
The APPLET tag in an HTML document identifies the name of a Java program called an applet included in a Web page .
The name of the applet is called its class name .
This name associated with the executable bytecodes that run the applet .
Put the following lines in a file called bhj.html :
“< HTML >
< HEAD >
< TITLE>CPWebHosting – Control Panel Web Hosting </ TITLE >
</HEAD >
< BODY >
< APPLET Code= ” Hi.class ” Width = ” 600 ″ Height = ” 300 ″ >
</ APPLET >
</BODY >
</HTML >“
In the example , there is an open APPLET tag , < APPLET > , and a close APPLET tag , </ APPLET >.
The attributes shown here are Code , to identify the class file which contains the Java bytecodes and the Width and Height attributes , measured in pixels , to describe how much room should reserved on the Web page for the applet .
Let me provide you the general syntax of the APPLET TAG
< APPLET
Codebase = “ path to a directory containing class files . ”
Code = “ name of class file ”
Width = “ width of applet in pixels ”
Height = “ height of applet in pixels ” >
< PARAM Name= ” parameter name ” Value= ” value of parameter ” >
< PARAM Name= ” parameter name ” Value= ” value of parameter ” >
</ APPLET >
here is a minimal Java applet that will help you :
import java.awt .
Graphics ;
/**
A first hello .
*/
“ public class Hi extends java.applet .
Applet {
public void init ( ) {
resize ( 600 , 300 ) ;
}
public void paint( Graphics context ) {
context.drawString
( “ Hello , world ! ” , 50 , 100 ) ;
}
} “
You can place Java code in a file named bhj .
java .
Next , you have to compile the Java source code using the Java compiler , javac .
At the operating system prompt ( $ ) , enter :
$ javac bhj.
java
If there are no errors , the compiler will create a file named bhj.class that contains the bytecodes for the HelloWorld applet .
So at this point , you have the following :
* A file called bhj.html .
This is the hypertext markup language ( HTML ) source file .
* A file called bhj . java .
This is the Java language source file .
* A file called bhj.class .
This is the Java bytecode file .
If you have a Java - enabled browser , you can test this applet .
Use the browser to open the file HelloWorld.html .
Alternatively , you can also use the applet viewer supplied with the Java Developer ’s Kit ( JDK ) to view applets without having to make an HTML page to reference them .
Once the applet is downloaded , it need not be downloaded again , even if the applet code defines repeated loops or other interaction .
The user might use a downloaded applet several times over the course of an online session without any more network retrievals .
Java enabled and non-enabled browsers
In a non-Java Web browser , the downloaded content defined concerning Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ( MIME ) specifications , which include a variety of multimedia document formats .
The browser needs to employ a helper application such as in displaying images , sound , and video to display the content .
In a Java - enabled browser , the same pattern is followed , but one more crucial step is added .
First , the Java - enabled browser , following requests by the user , downloads content defined by MIME specifications and displays it .
However , a Java - enabled browser recognizes a particular hypertext tag called APPLET which is a special kind of Java program .
The browser then downloads another file of information , as named in an attribute of the APPLET tag , that describes the execution of that applet which is called bytecode .
The Java - enabled browser interprets these bytecodes and runs them as an executable program on the user ’s host .
The resulting execution on the user ’s host then drives the animation , interaction , or further communication .
This execution of content on the user ’s host is what sets Java content apart from the hypertext and other multimedia content of the Web .
The downloading and start of the execution of content happens automatically .
The user does not specifically have to request this content or start its execution , this executable content is platform - independent , Java programmers need not create separate versions of the applets for different computer platforms , as long as the user has a Java interpreter ( or Java - enabled browser ) installed on his or her computer .
That means that the resulting executable content shifts the site of activity from the Web server to the Web client ( the Java - enabled browser ) .
Newly released video reveals police brutality

Wednesday , Feb 4th , 2009
A video released as part of a lawsuit against police in Millville , Philadelphia , shows an officer forcefully punching a woman in the face four times after he bungled an attempt to arrest her for riding a bike on the sidewalk .
As reported by NBC news , Sheila Stevenson , 42 , has filed a civil suit ( PDF ) , alleging police used excessive force , after then - Millville Police Officer Carlo Drogo stopped her one year ago on February 3 2008 .
The newly released video shows Drogo attempting to use pepper spray on Stevenson while she is still on the bike , but instead spraying himself in the face .
As Stevenson struggles , a reeling Drogo knocks her off the bike and onto the ground .
Two more cops then arrive and haul Stevenson to the curb , one of them seemingly applying the full force of his upper arm onto her neck and head .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The same cop then thrusts his knee into her back twice , with full force , whilst attempting to handcuff her .
( Article continues below )
“ I am not doing nothing , ” Stevenson screams .
“ Put your hands behind your back , ” one of the other officers orders .
“ Can you not do this ?
I ’m not doing nothing !
I ’m not doing nothing , ” she wails .
Drogo , clearly in great discomfort from using his own pepper spray on himself , then approaches Stevenson after the other officers have restrained her and aggressively punches her in the face and head four times .
“ Why are you hitting me ?
You ’re hitting me !
Why are you hitting me ? ” Stevenson cries out .
“ Why did you hit me and I ’m handcuffed ? ”
Stevenson was later convicted of resisting arrest .
Watch the raw video :
Watch an NBC news report here .
As noted by NBC10 , Drogo resigned from the police department in October for undisclosed reasons .
He has previously issued a statement defending his actions and maintaining that Stevenson ’s allegations represent a distortion of the facts .

Comment on this article
GOOD Friday was spent sitting round with lapsed Catholics drinking wine , eating meat and using the Lord 's name in vain , punctuated by the odd person saying , " Do n't tell my parents . "
What a thrill to stare eternal damnation in the face with a chop in one hand , a glass of cask wine in the other and a mouth full of blasphemy while still being scared of your mum and dad .
All the while not believing in God .
We do n't believe in heaven any more , but as sure as hell something 's making this snag taste so good .
It 's probably the confidence of our contradictions .
A dozen wide - eyed children were rigid with fascination as we recounted Good Fridays of our childhood , on which being happy and watching television were classified sins .
" What 's a sin ? " asked the 11 - year - old atheist .
I could have sung with joy knowing a child knew right from wrong and good from bad but knew not what the word " sin " meant .
Sin .
The conflict of desire verses programming may explain the common myth ( or as we micks like to think , well - known fact ) that Catholics go off like a frog in a sock in the sack .
All that programming of wrongness makes some things feel so right .
We all have guilty blocks of chocolate hidden in our glove boxes .
The thrill of the illicit .
But it 's not all good .
Last week a lapsed Catholic atheist mate of mine told me she was gay .
I 'm shattered .
She does n't fancy me .
Do n't touch me , I 'm fine .
Truth is I bullied her into telling me because of my interest in the physical manifestation of the emotional .
She 'd suffered debilitating migraines for years .
She vomited blood and needed injections and hospitalisation .
I kept prodding until I found out what it was that was making her head explode .
This is how it went : " Are you gay ? " " Yes . "
" Have you told your parents ? " " No . " " Tell your parents and the migraines will go away .
They 're proud of you and they love you .
There is no perfect time .
You 'll wonder what took you so long , but you 'll be thrilled you did n't wait a moment longer .
Nothing is ever as bad as you think it will be .
The body never lies and the truth will set you free . "
Hell is truth seen too late .
The cherries are grown in a giant greenhouse in the Lerida area of Spain , and are picked daily when they are considered to be perfectly ripened .
They are dispatched to the UK within hours by farmer Oscar Ortiz , 41 , who sleeps among his 15,000 trees to monitor air temperature and humidity .
The fruit is firm and crisp with an intense flavour .

In the past , I ’ve discussed how it ’s a good idea to spend your spare time dabbling in entrepreneurship :
It fills your time with something that you choose ( and thus you enjoy ) and sets up a potential long - term revenue stream .
I also discussed how I got a side business going myself .
But that was 2007 , and quite a bit has changed since then .
Where a side business was once a novel idea , it has since become much more mainstream .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , freelancers now make up around 15 % of the workforce , compared to only 7 % in 1995 .
And the trend is n’t expected to stop here .
The BLS reports that freelancers and self - employed individuals may comprise 20 % of the workforce by 2020 .

Generating Business Ideas
Coming up with a good idea is n’t a static process ; it involves a lot of trial and error .
The best way I ’ve found to generate ideas is to write and write often .
Make lists every day of things that you might enjoy , and try to figure out how you could make money doing them .
To help , here ’s a list of 50 business ideas you can begin building as you continue plugging away at your 9 - to - 5 .
Each of these ideas is very simple to start , and most can be done as a sole proprietorship at first ( meaning you do n’t have to file any legal documents to get started , though you will want to do that if it starts to take off ) .
Most of these can be done at home in your spare time , and in your spare space , too .
See if there are any ideas below that fit you well .
If you find an idea you like , do a bit of research or seek out a guide on how to get started in that area .

Take worn - out antiques home with you , invest the time and care needed to transform those old items into something amazing , then resell them at a profit .
18 . Personal chef
I recently met a woman who earned quite a bit of money as a very part - time chef .
Once a week , she would go to someone ’s house and prepare a homemade meal for their family , then do all the dishes and cleanup work .
This gives the family plenty of together time , while putting some cash in the woman ’s pocket .
If you love to cook , this can be a great opportunity , but you may have to put a lot of effort into searching for clients .
19 .
Event coordinator
Events like family reunions and large parties are often full of busywork that many people simply do n’t want to tackle .
That can be the perfect place for you to step in and take charge of the planning and coordination .
And thanks to the Internet , it is now easier than ever to market your event planning services .
20 . Event DJ
Are you an audiophile ?
If you have a great sound system and a large selection of music , you ’ve already got what you need to hire yourself out as a DJ for various events and receptions .
This is a great way to fill an afternoon or evening while also earning some cash in the process .
21 . Exercise instructor
Many gymnasiums will trade membership and often a bit more for a person willing and able to teach an exercise class .
You can also find people who do n’t want to go to a gym and train them at home as a personal trainer .
If you ’re in good shape , this is a great opportunity to earn some extra money , plus it can often lead to additional income with one - on - one instruction opportunities .
22 . Gardening services
I ’ve actually fielded requests from others looking for people willing to do this , so the demand is out there .
To put it simply , some people are willing to pay others to get a vegetable or flower garden started for them in their yard so they can have access to ultra - fresh produce without all the legwork .
If you have a green thumb and some knowledge about the vegetables that grow well in your area , this would be an easy business to start .
23 . Handyman services
Skilled at basic home repair ?
Let people know that they can call you for small repair jobs like basic plumbing , fixing a broken stair , and other things .
You ’d be amazed at the simple things people are willing to pay others to help them with .
24 . Catering
If you love to cook , take the “ Blondie ” route and start a home catering business .
Catering is a business that ’s perfectly designed to reward those who plan well , and it can often fit perfectly into weekends , which could work great if you are trying to build a business outside of normal working hours .
25 . Interior decorating
Fascinated by interior design ?
Have a huge collection of interior design materials around ?
Many people are quite happy to hire someone to help them decorate their home , and that ’s especially true of those who want a magazine - caliber style yet do n’t have an eye for design at all .
26 . Pet yard waste cleanup
For many people in suburban areas , cleaning up pet yard waste is a real hassle – it ’s disgusting , for one .
Instead of cleaning it up themselves , they might hire someone to do it regularly , two to three times a week .
There are several such services in our area , actually .
27 . Knitting , crocheting , or quilting
Skilled at creating blankets and sweaters ?
There ’s a huge market for these types of items – even better , you can usually make them in your spare time whenever you have it .
As always , local shops and sites like Etsy are great venues to sell such items .
28 . Landscaping services
Willing to mow lawns and trim bushes and trees ?
Many people are quite happy to pay for such services , and the demand is persistent : Nature just keeps growing … and growing … and growing .
Not only is this a great side business for a fit adult , it ’s also a great way for a teenager to get a small business started .
29 . Furniture making
If you ’re adept at woodworking and have some basic equipment , it ’s easy to get into business making deck furniture .
It only requires a few items – a saw , a drill , a sander – and some creativity and passion for working with wood .
If you have the tools or just want to turn your hobby into a business , this may be a great small business idea for you .
In addition to creating new items , you could also focus on repairing existing wooden furniture or woodwork .
30 . Meal - to - go preparations
Remember my earlier post about breakfast burritos ?
Making meals in advance is a great way to save money for yourself – but you can often prepare these for others as well and sell them for a markup .
Prepare eight casseroles , for example , then sell six of them to cover your costs , and you ’ve got two free dinners for your family ( and maybe a bit more ) .
You can grow this by taking orders from others and finding out what they like .
31 . Personal assistant
Thanks to sites like TaskRabbit , plenty of people have learned to pick up work doing a variety of side jobs that other people just do n’t have time to do .
Common tasks can include anything from picking up dry cleaning to making dinner or assembling Ikea furniture .
32 . Pet grooming
Many people loathe bathing their pets and grooming their fur – I know I do .
Pet groomers perform these tasks for a small fee – a perfect job for a person who loves dogs and cats .
33 . Jewelry making
If you have a good eye for detail work and a lot of patience , homemade jewelry can be quite profitable .
As with other items on this list , there are many opportunities to sell such items through local gift shops , craft fairs , or sites like Etsy .
34 . Growing and selling produce
Like to grow vegetables ?
Focus in on one vegetable and sell the excess to grocery stores and at farmers ’ markets .
My father does this with tomatoes and earns some solid extra money during the summer months .
You can do really well , though , if you can grow things inside during the winter – February fresh tomatoes can sell quite well .
35 . Proofreading and editing
Have strong English skills and exceptional grammar ?
You may have opportunities to work as a proofreader from home .
Advertising for this can be difficult ; seek out those who might actually be able to use your services and advertise directly to them .
36 . Scrapbook making
Many people dream of having beautiful scrapbooks but never take the steps to create them on their own .
You can step in here – take their ideas and materials and assemble a scrapbook for them .
37 . Slideshow making
Many people would love to have a beautiful slideshow to commemorate the passing of a loved one , an anniversary , or a special birthday .
With a computer and some select software , you could quickly turn anyone ’s pictures into a beautiful , custom slideshow , and profit handsomely for your time and effort .
38 . Senior citizen assistance
Many elderly people need assistance with a wide variety of simple household tasks – cleaning , laundry , and so forth .
Many adult children of elderly people are quite willing to hire someone to help out their parents .
39 .
Sewing and alterations
My wife is quite handy with a sewing machine and often hems and modifies our children ’s clothes .
She could easily take this a step further and offer her services to others , doing basic garment repair and modification for a small price on lazy evenings .
40 . Computer troubleshooting
I had some success with this in the past , though I ’ve largely moved away from it now .
If you have a knack for fixing computers , this is a good place to start .
41 . Public speaking
If you ’re the type of person who can get the attention of a room easily , public speaking might be for you .
Take advantage of every public speaking opportunity you can and you ’ll be surprised at the opportunities that make themselves available for you .
42 . Soap making and spa products
Making amazing homemade soaps and other spa products is n’t as hard as you might think – it just takes time and patience .
Again , people value handmade items like these , which can easily be sold through local gift shops and websites like Etsy .
43 . Giving music lessons
If you know how to play an instrument well ( particularly the piano or the guitar ) and have patience , you ’ve got what you need to teach others how to play .
Offer lessons in that instrument to others – this can also be an excellent service to barter with , too .
44 . Tutoring
Did you major in a subject like English , history , or math in college , or do exceptionally well on the SAT exam ?
Do you have patience with children ?
If so , you likely have what you need to tutor kids in particular subjects .
Seek out parents or teachers and let them know that you tutor students in a certain subject , and offer materials for them to share , and phone calls will often trickle in .
You can get going locally or expand across the country by offering to tutor online .
45 . Virtual assistant
Many ultra- busy professionals appreciate having someone who can check and answer their email , organize task lists for them , update their calendars , and other administrative tasks , with minimal interaction .
The best part is that you can provide this service from home with a good Internet connection .
46 . Website design
Many small businesses in your community could use a very basic web presence to tell others about their business .
Quite often , these businesses do n’t have a large budget for such things .
That ’s where you come in – get a bunch of clients from the local community by beating the pavement , create sites for them , and maintain them for a small fee .
Get enough businesses and you have a nice side business of your own that does n’t require a ton of maintenance time .
47 . Wedding planner
If you ’re one of those people who ca n’t help but flip through bridal magazines and think about various wedding arrangements in your daydreams , wedding planning might be the perfect thing for you .
A great way to get started is to develop a website or blog on the topic , get to know people online , and promote your services at local wedding venues and throughout the community .
48 . Affiliate marketing
If you play your cards right , certain types of businesses will pay you to promote their products and encourage sales .
If you ’re interested in learning more , check out affiliate marketing programs such as Amazon Associates , Commission Junction , LinkShare , and ShareASale .
49 .
Become a business or life coach
If you ’re passionate about the business world or able to influence and encourage others in your own unique way , you may want to consider marketing your services as a business or life coach .
Use your passion and expertise to give advice and suggest actionable steps people can take to improve their professional and personal lives .
50 .
Start a resume writing service
If you ’re excellent at crafting amazing resumes that ultimately result in people getting the job , consider marketing those services .
Most of your work will revolve around writing , editing , designing , and proofreading , so you will need few supplies outside of your computer and basic software to get started .
These are just some of the many side business opportunities that have grown more common in the past few years .
However , there are many more out there already , in addition to some that are yet to be discovered .
As you embark on your new side business or “ side hustle , ” remember that you are only limited by your own imagination and skillset .
Do n’t be afraid to be creative , and do n’t let anyone tell you that you ca n’t succeed .
You never know , unexpected success might be right around the corner .
And once you have things up and running , you might consider a business credit card that offers rewards to help manage your costs .
Not all technology consulting gigs are created equal .
Here ten questions you can ask — and what to look for in the answers — for when interviewing with a technology consulting firm .

In 2009 , layoffs have become so common that layoff fatigue has set in .
In times like these , it ’s hard enough to find a place that is hiring , let alone considering the idea of turning down a job offer .
That said , even in a year where over 500,000 jobs are being shed per month in the U.S. alone , it is important to carefully vet potential employers .
This is especially true in technology consulting .
As I write in my book , The Nomadic Developer , joining a technology consulting company that loses money , routinely fails to deliver on its promises , or otherwise misrepresents itself is possibly even worse than unemployment .
Knowing how to spot those companies that will cause you further problems — be it a subsequent round of unemployment ( what you risk when you join firm that is bleeding cash ) , or your own dignity — is even more critical during times like these , when most of us are prone to act out of fear .
The reality of the technology consulting market in 2009 is that business is still here .
It may not be growing , and firms tend to not hire " to the bench " during bad times .
Of course , because there is no bench , it means the moment there is a new project , the consulting companies will go into a ( temporary ) hiring frenzy — especially if the company just cleared the bench through a layoff during the preceding month .
The purpose of this article is to offer you ten questions you can ask , and what to look for in the answers , for those occasions when you do get an opportunity to join a technology consulting firm .
Financial Questions
These questions are probably best asked to the highest - level person with whom you are interviewing – someone who is in a good position to know the financials .
Not being interviewed by such a person at some point during the process is almost , by itself , a huge red flag .
Question 1 : What is your target growth rate this year ?
Especially now , with the economy working its way through a fear bubble , it is as important as ever to make sure that the firm you are joining has set realistic goals for itself .
A well run technology consulting firm does not run on wild hope , nor can it run well if it is paralyzed by fear .
This year , unless there is a very good reason , the right answer is probably somewhere between - 10 % ( we are hoping to manage through some small losses ) to around +5 % ( we expect to grow , but much more moderately ) .
If the answer is outside this range , you have a real good reason to ask some follow up questions to understand why .
Of course , anyone can say they are going to grow , and some firms will say they intend to grow 50 % — the same month they miss payroll .
The key , of course , is to dig a little deeper with the next question .
Question 2 : Please describe how you forecast revenue
Some companies are at least reasonably disciplined in how they forecast revenue .
They rigorously maintain a sales pipeline — that is , based on a list of clients at various stages of commitment in the sales process , and based on historical data for how frequently an opportunity at a given stage of commitment turns into real work , drive a forecast that someone is actually accountable for .
Others just completely wing it based on gut .
Ideally , you are looking for the former – as the latter is likely the kind of place where gut is wrong , and massive layoffs occur when wild optimism turns into wild pessimism .
In other words , given that continuing employment in technology consulting depends on how well the demand generation side of the business is executing , you want to have a real sense that the demand forecast is accurate .
Question 3 : Do consultants have visibility into the pipeline ?
There are some companies where the health of the organization is essentially a state secret .
You are asked to simply believe the owner during the quarterly meeting that things are fine , until that day when layoffs come and they are suddenly not .
Such places tend to be miserable places to work , on account of the fact that in the absence of real information , rumor mill tends to fill the void .
During such times , the rumor mill is usually more colored by fear when times are bad .
While there are some companies who fear that consultants will use the information in the pipeline to steal the client or prospect list – if such a company has that fear – a fear that speaks to lack of trust in its consultants , you should definitely consider that as a data point a decision of whether to accept a job offer .
Dear Cecil :
Is it true that the Vatican has the world 's most extensive collection of erotica and pornography locked away where no one who can appreciate it can see it ?
M.B. , Baltimore
Cecil replies :
I have n’t had a chance to check this out personally , M. , having been detained with Grafenberg spot research .
But having spoken with parties who know , I can tell you that if it ’s a truly monster porn collection you want , you do n’t need to leave the U.S.A .
Years ago a couple researchers from the Kinsey Institute in Bloomington , Indiana , made an attempt to inspect the Vatican ’s collections , but church officials refused to permit it .
Subsequently , however , it was learned that the Vatican had arranged to have its holdings microfilmed during World War II , when it was feared Rome would be bombed .
The film is now stored at St. Louis University in Missouri .
The Kinsey folks looked through all the material and found a few mildly erotic art items , but virtually nothing since the Renaissance .
From this they concluded that stories about the Vatican ’s 100,000 books of porn are naught but a myth .
Not everyone buys this , of course .
The more conspiracy - minded among us argue that the Vatican would n’t be dumb enough to microfilm the smut section .
One of my correspondents claims the Vatican library has ( or had , anyway ) thousands of erotic volumes , most of them file copies of works that appeared on the Catholic Church ’s well - known Index of Prohibited Books .
This fellow says he spent time in a World War II concentration camp with a Vatican librarian , who gave him a tour of the library in 1945 .
He says many of the books , “ mainly the illustrated volumes , ” have since disappeared .
Well , maybe .
Most researchers , however , doubt that the Vatican has or ever had much genuine smut on the shelves .
Gershon Legman , a prominent student of erotica who helped compile a bibliography of porn for Alfred Kinsey , says the Vatican “ has no really erotic books , ” although there are some fairly tame volumes from the classical era .
For instance , a copy of Ovid ’s The Art of Love is filed with Latin poetry , and Aristophanes ’ Lysistrata is with Greek drama .
The Vatican also has some erotic specimens among its art holdings , including , among other things , some drawings by Michelangelo featuring various phallic fantasies .
In addition there is a famous collection of erotic frescoes designed by Raphael in 1516 and executed by his students in the bathroom of a certain Cardinal Bibbiena .
The frescoes , which are badly deteriorated today , consist of scenes involving Venus and Cupid , Cupid and Psyche , and Vulcan and Pallas , and one would be hard put to describe them as even mildly titillating .
That ’s not to say hard - core porn is unknown in Rome .
A student of Raphael ’s by the name of Guilio Romano produced some explicit erotic art , in particular a series of 20 drawings of various parties having intercourse and such that even by modern standards would be considered pretty out there .
These were turned over to an engraver and printed up in book form .
Pope Clement VII was outraged and had the engraver heaved into prison , but copies of the book continued to circulate clandestinely in Europe for centuries .
Whether the Vatican has a copy today I dunno , but they ought to–most good university art collections do .
As for the Index of Prohibited Books ( which , by the way , was discontinued in 1966 ) , I ’ve taken a look at it , and you could probably come up with a racier bunch of titles in your average Walgreen’s .
About 1,500 books and / or authors are listed ; of the small percentage alleged to be “ obscene ” ( obscenity was just one of 12 categories of forbidden works , the remainder having to do with heresies and the like ) , many were written by such famous authors as Honore de Balzac , Alexandre Dumas ( both father and son ) , Emile Zola , Anatole France , and Victor Hugo .
None of the erotic “ classics ” ( e.g. , Fanny Hill , the works of de Sade ) were listed , maybe because the Vatican figured they were of such limited circulation they were n’t worth worrying about .
In short , I think the legendary Vatican pornography collection is a crock .
Most of the stories you hear about it are undoubtedly part of the folklore that surrounds any large , old , secretive institution ( the Masons are another case in point ) .
However , there are some truly awesome smut depots out there , if you ’re into that kind of thing .
The municipal museum of Naples , for instance , is said to have an amazing collection erotic artifacts , most of them classical in origin–fornicating satyrs and so forth .
The British Museum in London has a famous “ Private Case ” collection of erotica bequeathed to it by eccentric Victorians that at one time was said to number 20,000 volumes , although theft , vandalism and other causes have reduced it to somewhere between 1,800 and 5,000 volumes , depending on who ’s counting .
In Paris the Bibliotheque Nationale ’s famous L’Enfer ( “ hell ” ) collection contains 4-5,000 volumes .
Initially I thought the largest collection of all was held by the Kinsey Institute ( formally known as the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex , Gender , and Reproduction ) on the campus of Indiana University at Bloomington .
When I checked there were 12,000 books , 50,000 photographs , 25,000 pieces of flat art , 3,700 films , and 1,300 art objects , such as figurines .
Subsequently I learned that an even larger collection was owned by the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco , which as of the early 90s had 289,000 films and 100,000 videos .
The Kinsey archive spans the ages , but it ’s safe to say the vast majority of items in these collections is of recent origin .
The fact is that color photography , the high - speed offset press , and , more recently , the videocassette have resulted in a profusion of erotica that makes the porn collections of Europe seem positively quaint .

Lately I saw an increasing interest for IP SLA monitor and analyze of the data output .
I believe that you already know that you can do IP SLA monitor with a lot of tools from the most expensive ones which include support and assistance to the free ones like MRTG or RRDTOOL .
From the statistics that I have , more than 50 % of the network engineers interested in this tools have a problem either with the money ( low budget or the on and on “ we do not have money this year for that investment ” ) or making free tools actually work and report accurate data .
Yesterday I received an e-mail from SolarWinds that announce me about their FREE IP SLA monitor tool .
Usually I ignore such e-mails as for most of them there is always a catch , but since it was from a company that made me a very good impression over the year by offering exactly what ’s specified in the advertisement , I said that I should give it a try .
Before I present this to you , let ’s make something clear .
This is not a commercial post , e.g. post to be pay or another things like that .
I do not have time and I do n’t want to do such stuff of my blog , but when some product really worth to be tried I think that the development company deserve to be specified .
Since it ’s a free tool do n’t expect to have all the features of the one which you are paying for it , but compared to the headache of implementing other free tools ( MRTG , RRDTOOL ) you ’ll find this one to be piece of cake .
Everybody who has an idea about networking can use this without any problems .
Configuration is as simplest as it can be .
You have to choose the destination IP or hostname to monitor then pick the monitor service and polish some parameters to your particular network .
That ’s it !
One particular issue to me is that this tool is working only from Windows .
Please have a look below to see how to configure this :

The Danish government has begun paying compensation to women who have developed breast cancer after long spells working nights .
It follows a ruling by a United Nations agency that night shifts probably increase the risk of developing cancer .
BBC Radio Scotland 's
The Investigation has been hearing from experts and union leaders in Scotland who said the UK government should be doing more to tackle the dangers .
For years there has been growing evidence that night shifts are bad for you .
Among the symptoms : disturbed sleep , fatigue , digestive problems and a greater risk of accidents at work .
But these are the first government payments to women who have developed breast cancer after long spells on the night shift .
Ulla Mahnkopf is one of those who has been compensated .
Long hours
She spent 30 years as a flight attendant for the big Scandinavian airline SAS .
Long hours and disturbed working patterns came with the territory .
Then she developed breast cancer .
" It was awful telling my kids that , telling them what we were facing , " she told me .
" It 's not just the surgery but all the thoughts - do I survive this ?
I had bilateral cancer so not just one breast , two breasts . "
At first she did not make the connection between her cancer and night working .
She said : " I had no idea .
" But when you think back now I can see that when I stopped flying it was like coming out of a shell , I had been living in there because of jet lag and I can see now I had a totally different life . "
The level of evidence is really no different than it might be for an industrial chemical
Dr Vincent Cogliano
So far almost 40 Danish women have won compensation .
Not every case was successful : women who had a family history of breast cancer were among the ones whose claims were rejected .
The Danish authorities acted following a finding by the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) , an arm of the UN's World Health Organisation .
The IARC studies and ranks cancer risks .
Category
One risks are known carcinogens such as asbestos .
Night working now sits just one rung below that : a probable cause of cancer .
Dr Vincent Cogliano of the IARC said they reached their conclusion after looking at a wide number of studies of both humans and animals .
One of the reports , published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute , showed a 36 % greater risk of breast cancer for women who had worked night shifts for more than 30 years , compared with women who had never worked nights .
He said there was evidence to support the hypothesis that alterations in sleep patterns could suppress the production of melatonin in the body .
" Melatonin has some beneficial effects in preventing some of the steps leading to cancer , " he said .
" The level of evidence is really no different than it might be for an industrial chemical . "
Here in the UK unions estimate about 20 % of the national workforce is involved in night shifts .
Margaret Ann Hancock from Edinburgh was like many parents who take on the night shift : she needed the extra money and had a young family to care for .
When she started work at the former Leith Hospital in the 1980s , her shift pattern allowed her to take her three children to nursery when she got home , sleeping just a few hours before picking them up again .
At the time , she said , tiredness and disrupted meals seemed a reasonable price to pay : " I felt like I battled time continually .
" There 's only so much you can get done in a day .
" And because I did split nights , I often was n't sleeping until the following day .
Margaret Ann Hancock worked night shifts with three children at nursery " My sleeping patterns , even now , my eating patterns - that side of it is still with me . "
It was during her time at Leith hospital that she developed breast cancer , undergoing a lumpectomy , radium treatment and chemotherapy .
At the time , she said she would never have dreamt that there could have been a connection between her disease and her night work .
But now that she knows it is a possibility , as a breast cancer survivor , she has a clear message for other women who may find themselves in her position : " You should have a choice whether or not to do nights .
" If I knew then what I know now ... you would be better , if there is an alternative .
" Because if it 's risking your health , there 's nothing worth that . "
Professor Andrew Watterson , an occupational health specialist at Stirling University , said we are far behind Scandinavia in recognising the dangers .
" I think we can say there is a big public health problem here , " he said .
" The evidence has been good over a long period of time about cardiovascular disease and night work , gastro - intestinal problems and nights .
" Work indicates there may be risks in terms of low birth - weight babies and longer pregnancies for women .
" We do n't tend to identify the damage being done where shift working is prevalent and I think that 's an error .
The damage is there but we do n't see it and we do n't count it . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
If your nights are busy , it can be fine but you lose your social life Steve G , Reading At the Health and Safety Executive , chief medical officer Dr John Osmond said they were aware of the debate and have commissioned their own research .
" The HSE has been very on the ball in this area and has commissioned a very eminent epidemiologist to examine the risk of working at night and whether there is any link to breast cancer .
This report will be completed in 2011 . "
But assistant general secretary of the Scottish TUC , Ian Tasker , thinks the UK is lagging behind .
He fears workers may be missing out on health checks to which they are entitled under the existing law .
Greater awareness " I do n't think we have enough evidence to say they 're not , " he said .
" But we have a feeling that perhaps employers are taking the opportunity to ensure these health checks are not carried out or , if they are , it 's very much a tick - box approach to it . "
In the meantime unions are calling for a greater awareness of the dangers of night shifts .
But for some workers , such as Ulla Mahnkopf , that is already too late .
She said she would have given up her job if she had known the dangers .
" I would n't have been flying for that many years , definitely not .
Because it 's cancer you can die from .
So I would like to stay alive . "
The Investigation was broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland at 0900 GMT on Monday .

Obama administration releases secret Bush anti-terror memos Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday March 2 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) - Hours after Attorney General Eric Holder repudiated anti-terror methods enacted under former president George W. Bush , the Justice Department released nine internal memos and opinions it said gave legal grounding to the controversial policies .
The documents -- the first dating from the wake of the September 11 , 2001 attacks to the last from the months following the US - led 2003 invasion of Iraq -- detail how Bush gave himself sole power over terror suspects .
" The power to dispose of the liberty of individuals captured ... remain in the hands of the president alone , " said a 2002 opinion written by then - assistant attorney general John Yoo on US methods for transferring suspects .
" Congress can no longer regulate the president 's ability to detain and interrogate enemy combatants than it may regulate his ability to direct troop movements , " according to another 2003 opinion written for Alberto Gonzales , then counsel for Bush , which detailed prerogatives for military interrogations .
In another potentially explosive opinion , Bush 's administration also gave itself ample space to skirt international law .
The president 's " power to suspend treaties is wholly discretionary , " according to a memo intended for John Bellinger , who was then legal advisor to the National Security Council .
Self - applied boundaries for executive power gave the White House " unconstrained discretion to suspend treaty obligations of the United States at any time and for any reason , " said Obama 's Justice Department in a statement released alongside the memos .
The house - cleaning move comes as Obama 's administration seeks to distance itself from Bush - era policies .
" Waterboarding is torture , " Holder said earlier Monday in a speech to the Jewish Council of Public Affairs .
" My Justice Department will not justify it , will not rationalize it and will not condone it , " he said .
" The use and sanction of torture is at odds with the history of American jurisprudence and American values .
It undermines our ability to pursue justice fairly , and it puts our own brave soldiers in peril should they ever be captured on a foreign battlefield . "
Holder is currently leading a review of the treatment of terror suspects .
Obama ordered the review as one of his first acts in office , as he also ordered the closing of the infamous Guantanamo Bay detention center , the CIA 's secret prisons abroad and special interrogation authorities for terror detainees .
In an executive order , Obama required that all interrogations conducted at US facilities worldwide follow the US Army field manual , which bars the use of waterboarding -- a form of simulated drowning -- and other harsh interrogation techniques .
" Living our values does n't make us weaker , it makes us safer and it makes us stronger , " Obama told a joint session of Congress in a primetime address last month .
" And that is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture . "
The president has also vowed " swift and certain justice for captured terrorists . "
Many detainees at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba have been held there for years without trial , and more than 200 inmates remain .
A Pentagon report in February said that conditions at Guantanamo were in line with the Geneva Conventions but also called for easing the isolation of high - security detainees .
More than 800 detainees have passed through Guantanamo since it was opened on January 11 , 2002 , as a place to ship suspects in the " war on terror " begun by Bush in the wake of the September 11 attacks .
The memos can be accessed at this link .

Yes , wingnut paranoia has jumped itself as it was already preparing to jump the shark .
In their rush to outsmart the nonexistent , double - secret double agents ( also ! ) , the teabagging nutters are now warning one another not to fall for any dirty tricks like sharing basic contact information with one another , lest they be unwittingly included in petitions supporting administration positions , or ( in their fevered dreams ) be reported as dissidents !
Ah , me !
The treacherous politics of teabagging !
Let me just state here and now that I wish I had thought of this myself .
What could be better than watching wingnuts deny themselves the most basic of organizing tools purely out of their own paranoia ?
This will doubtless be a crushing blow to actual organizers who were planning to mine these teabagging parties for signatures on petitions that actual teabaggers would actually support .
But hey , you can't be too careful these days !
Anyone who asks you for your support of anything while you 're out teabagging it up is probably a commie , and you should be ready to scream , " Treason ! " at the drop of a hat bag .
Remember that while you 're out there claiming your place in the pantheon of patriots , calling to mind the brave colonists of old , it 's crucial that you guard carefully against being persuaded to sign your name to any public declaration of your political independence .
I promise you that the Founders will be smiling down upon your conservative prudence .
Man , I thought this picture of an Umphrey ’s Aragon crowd was funny , but the Phish Hampton picture above takes the cake .
For some inexplicable reason , there ’s about 4,000 dudes and only 40 46 55 chicks * on the entire floor at the Phish Hampton show on March 6th — basically a 100:1 90:1 72:1 ratio of guys to girls .
We pretend to like the dudes in the front row .

I identified every floor mistress I could find with a little red arrow , but feel free to click the image above for the high - res pic and look for yourself .
It ’s entertaining and sad all at once .
* Thanks to the amateur Columbos who helped find the other chicks .
Update ( March 16 , 2009 , 11:00 am ) :
Well incredibly this made the front page of Digg so welcome Diggnation to Jamtopia .
Notably , one eagle - eyed Digger has taken the time to identify a handful of additional ladies in the picture .
Thanks Gypzee .
Props also to cryptographic genius kamerononfire who noticed a secret message hidden in the picture …
Update ( March 16 , 2009 , 10:30 pm ) :
Got the pic updated to include Gypzee ’s discoveries .
I actually dispute one of his finds but discovered an alternate lady - of - the - rail while investigating , bringing the grand total up to 55 .
Also pleased to note that the Digg count is up over 3,000 .
Unbelievable .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors announced plans Monday to cut 23,000 U.S. jobs by 2011 , drop its storied Pontiac brand and slash 40 % of its dealer network in its latest bid to stay out of bankruptcy .
The new restructuring proposal will leave the Treasury Department , and thus U.S. taxpayers , owning a significant stake in GM .
Treasury would accept GM stock , rather than cash , for repayment of about $ 10 billion that the government has already lent to GM .
Trust funds controlled by the United Auto Workers union would also hold a significant stake in the company .
Between them , Treasury and the unions would own 89 % of GM .
GM also announced an offer to its bondholders to swap $ 24 billion of the company 's $ 27 billion in unsecured debt for stock .
GM is offering bondholders 225 shares of its stock for every $ 1,000 it owes the bondholders in principal .
GM CEO Fritz Henderson warned in a press conference Monday that a bankruptcy is still very likely unless bondholders agree to the swap .
" It 's not impossible but it 's a tough task , " Henderson said about the company 's ability to get enough bondholders to accept the company 's stock .
" That 's why I think [ bankruptcy ] is more probable . "
And in a statement released late Monday afternoon , advisors to an ad hoc committee of GM bondholders expressed dissatisfaction with the proposal , dubbing it " neither reasonable nor adequate . "
" We are deeply concerned with today 's decision by GM and the auto task force to offer only a small , inequitable percentage of stock to its bondholders in exchange for their bonds , " the statement read .
" We believe the offer to be a blatant disregard of fairness for the bondholders who have funded this company and amounts to using taxpayer money to show political favoritism of one creditor over another . "
The moves are GM 's latest efforts to cut costs and stem losses that have dogged its North American auto operations since 2005 .
But Monday 's restructuring announcement goes much further than the viability plan GM unveiled to President Obama 's auto industry task force in February .
The company had announced many of the job cuts in February , but Monday 's news that GM would have about 38,000 hourly U.S. employees by 2011 represents an additional reduction of 7,000 to 8,000 jobs beyond what GM disclosed in its previous viability plan .
The job cuts come as GM is set to announce the closing of more plants in the next few weeks .
Henderson would not comment on which plants could be on the chopping block .
The company said its goal is to cut costs to the level where GM can break even even with industrywide U.S. sales of only 10 million vehicles , rather than the 11.5 million to 12 million sales range that had been its previous break - even target .
Henderson added he 's hoping that the company could be profitable as soon as 2010 under the new restructuring plan .
While the cuts will leave GM a much smaller company , Henderson said this does not concern him .
He admitted that results at GM have not been acceptable for quite some time .
" I 'm much more focused on getting results than being big , " he said .
GM also confirmed reports that surfaced Friday and officially announced plans to drop its Pontiac brand altogether .
In its earlier restructuring plan , GM had signaled that Pontiac would survive , albeit as a niche offering .
The company also said it would make more cuts to its dealership network than it announced in February , and at a much faster pace .
GM said Monday it will cut the number of its dealers by 42 % to 3,605 by 2010 , up from its original plan to reduce its network to 4,100 dealers by 2014 .
Bankruptcy still possible
The Obama administration 's task force , which found that GM's February turnaround plan was not viable , said Monday that the new plan " reflects the work GM has done since March 30 to chart a new path to financial viability . "
But the task force added that it " has made no final decision regarding the treatment of its current loan to GM or with respect to any future investments in the company . "
The administration has given GM only until the end of May to reach deals with creditors and unions to cut costs or be forced into bankruptcy .
But the Treasury Department did extended GM an additional $ 2 billion in loans last week , bringing its total federal assistance to $ 15.4 billion .
Even before it reaches the government 's May 31 deadline to reach an agreement with bondholders and unions , GM will need additional loans from the Treasury in order to continue to pay its bills , Henderson said Monday .
Details of those loans have not yet been worked out .
The company has said it could need as much as $ 30 billion in federal help to weather its current financial crisis , and Henderson said Monday that request should still be sufficient .
The United Auto Workers union was not available for immediate comment on Monday 's announcements .
GM will still need to convince bondholders to take the deal and win further labor concessions from the union if it is to stay out of bankruptcy .
The union announced a tentative deal with Chrysler LLC late Sunday in an effort to help that company meet an April 30 deadline to avoid its own bankruptcy filing .
If the GM bondholders take the offer , they will end up owning about 10 % of GM .
But they will be accepting stock worth only $ 380 , based on Friday 's closing price , for every $ 1,000 they are now owed on the bonds .
By accepting the offer , bondholders would be betting that the company 's stock would rise in the future , and that the alternative of bankruptcy could result in them getting even a smaller percentage of what they are owed .
But taking the deal will still be risky .
Even unsecured bondholders can hope to be paid something back on their bonds if the company is forced into bankruptcy at some point in the future , while stockholders are likely to be wiped out altogether .
If all parties agree to the new restructuring plan and bankruptcy is avoided , current shareholders will be left owning as little as 1 % of GM 's outstanding shares .
Still , shares of GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , a component of the Dow Jones industrial average , gained more than 30 % in late morning trading due to hopes that the company may now be able to stay out of bankruptcy .
UNITED STATES -200 DEAD PIGS IN FIELD .
Hampton , Iowa --
State regulators are ordering a Franklin County hog operation to take action .
Recently they discovered more than 200 dead hogs .
They ’d been improperly disposed of , in a
Amanda Johnstone says she never noticed anything unusual in the field next to her home in Franklin County .
" Well no , we moved in August , but it really did n’t smell that bad when we moved in , we just thought it was from the hog farms from around here , cause there ’s one up the road . "
But Franklin County Environmental Health Specialist Earl Kalkwarf , wo n’t soon forget the recent hike he made into this field north of Hampton .
" You looked out and you could see some white and we knew it was n’t rocks , so we walked out there and discovered roughly 215 dead hogs in a pile . "
An airplane pilot was the first to spot the unusual sight , a second pass at lower altitude reveled even more gruesome scene .
The biggest concern for both the DNR and the county is the composting carcasses leeching into the ground and into the drinking water of home owners living nearby .
There was also no fences to keep animals from getting into the pile and scavenging .
" We do n’t need a pandemic flu of some sort of an outbreak of some serious disease , " said Kalkwarf .
The DNR is telling the owner of a nearby hog confinement it is against state law .
Regulators told him to get the hogs moved within two days .
But many believe the company should face more than a warning .
" They do things with city ’s for discharging and other animal sites that do manure spills sometimes they get big fines , " said Kalkwarf .
Johnstone and others are worried about whether anything seeped into the ground .
She ’s just hoping her family is safe .
" Cause we have 4 kids and if it was contaminated gosh they would be sick so that was my biggest fear , " she said .
The owner of the land where the hogs were dumped sent them off to a rendering plant .
Regulators are warning the operator he could face legal action if it happens again .
Coping with the Financial Crisis as a Kept Woman
Rumor has it that times are tough for Manhattan ’s “ girlfriend elite . ”
Now that investment banking , proprietary trading and various other seven - figure Wall Street professions are losing a digit or two , funding is drying up for high - maintenance , extra-marital relationships .
During the go - go days ( and nights ) of the late nineties and early aughts , Manhattan ’s “ kept women ” enjoyed 5 - star lifestyles .
But the disappearance of over - the - top pay packages has crimped the economics of under - the - covers liaisons .
As Wall Street ’s pampered professionals lose their perks , so do their girlfriends .
Many of these privileged ladies must now adjust their lifestyles “ down island , ” so to speak .
The posh , Upper East Side digs of 2007 are yielding to Lower East Side lofts and studios .
Some of these gals are suffering such a severe drop in income and lifestyle that they are starting to resemble , dare I say , prostitutes .
It ’s humiliating .
Sadly , these voiceless victims of the financial crisis possess almost no recourse .
Either they accept a cut in pay or choose a new line of work , just like their boyfriends must do .
But the transition away from high - priced prostitution to less lucrative lines of work can be very stressful .
And it ’s not easy for the girls to change their professions either .
Even the fortunate members of the girlfriend elite who have survived this initial wave of layoffs face new stresses .
They must now carefully consider the security of their revenue stream , and contemplate a vast new range of potential risks .
They must ask themselves , “ Does my boyfriend work for one of the big banks or does he work for a hedge fund ?
If he works for a bank , is the bank receiving TARP funding ?
If yes , is my boyfriend ’s bonus ‘ contractually obligated ’ or discretionary ?
If no , can my boyfriend ’s bank survive without bailout monies ?
If my boyfriend works for a hedge fund , is the fund suffering from poor performance in 2008 ?
Or , if the fund ’s numbers were good in 2008 , were they also real ?
Who ’s auditing this thing anyway ?
Is the auditing firm reputable or does it operate out of a small , dingy office in Florida ? ”
Younger members of the girlfriend elite will also want to contemplate long - term economic trends , like the prospective path of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies or gold .
There ’s almost nothing more tragic than devoting a lifetime to backbreaking labor , only to accumulate savings in a fatally flawed currency .
Sure , you get to keep all the memories from a career of faithful service , but what happens to your golden years ?
So every highly compensated girlfriend owes it to herself to ask , “ Would it be best to save money in dollars or euros or yen…or perhaps something more exotic like Brazilian reals ? ”
After all , this is business .
“ According to a survey by Prince & Associates , a Connecticut - based wealth - research firm , the average ‘ price ’ that men and women demand to marry for money these days is $ 1.5 million , ” reports Robert Frank in a fascinating column for the Wall Street Journal entitled , “ Marrying for Love…of Money . ”
“ The survey polled 1,134 people nationwide with incomes ranging between $ 30,000 to $ 60,000 ( squarely in the median range for nationwide incomes ) , ” Frank continues .
“ The survey asked : ‘ How willing are you to marry an average - looking person that you liked , if they had money ? ’
“ Fully two - thirds of women and half of the men said they were ‘ very ’ or ‘ extremely ’ willing to marry for money .
The answers varied by age : Women in their 30s were the most likely to say they would marry for money ( 74 % ) while men in their 20s were the least likely ( 41 % ) .
The matrimonial price tag varies by gender and age .
Asked how much a potential spouse would need to have to be money - marriage material , women in their 20s said $ 2.5 million . ”
Let ’s think about this ; $ 2.5 million seems like a lot of money .
But it seems like a lot less money if you ’re a 20 - year old facing a new cycle of hyper-inflation .
Therefore , given the crisis of the last 24 months , and the Fed ’s inflationary response to that crisis , every forward - looking gold - digger has reason to wonder if $ 2.5 million is really enough …and whether the dollar is really the best store of value .
And one final note gals ; PLEASE know your counterparty !
Contracts – both actual and implied – are only as good as your counterparty .
Specifically , examine the size of prospective “ senior claims , ” like the divorce settlement that might ensue from your first chance encounter with Mrs. Investment Banker .
Additionally , be certain that your counterparty has not issued multiple , redundant claims on the identical underlying asset .
The “ Risk Factors ” section of the prospectus may not include all the relevant disclosures .

There ’s a retarded picture going around of a little kid licking the nose of a pig with the caption , “ You little bastard , you ’ve killed us all . ”
First off , fuck this picture .
I ’m tired of cats , gerbils , hedgehogs , and hamsters with dumbass captions sabotaging my Reddit front page .
Second , it ’s supposed to be funny because none of us really expect the human race to perish from swine flu , so this ugly ass tow headed kid licking the nose of a pig is meant to remind us that life is cute and adorable and pigs are wonderful animals despite the panic .
I am not laughing .
It is my sincere wish that seven out of ten people who read this post experience the excruciating business end of H1N1 .
Yes .
You , and you , and you .
We need to grab our collective sac and face the facts :
Earth has grown obese with humans .
It has a homo sapien spare tire riding its gut , and if there is n’t a rapid depopulation within the next five years — leaving the human species so decimated that we can’t over fish , pump shit into the air , and dump waste into our rivers at the same self - destructive pace — the world wo n’t be habitable soon anyway .
Fact .
Please stop the hand wringing , the moaning , the bitching , the useless worry over self - preservation ( god is not looking out for you because he does not exist , so you can stop praying too ) , and start calling whatever pandemic inevitably wipes out a good two - thirds of the world population what it is .
Nature ’s version of gastric bypass surgery .
Knock off a subcontinent or two , the entire East Coast of the United States , all the Speedo wearing men in Europe and a whole bunch of chopstick users in Central Asia .
Who fucking cares ?
Humanity is like a weed .
Give us a little water and we spring right back .
I ’m not crying if a whole handful of helicopter parents and their pansy ass , allergy prone progeny perish .
Here ’s a radical suggestion :
Do n’t wash your hands .
Do n’t cover your mouth when you cough .
When you feel swine flu symptoms setting in , use drinking fountains and hang out in shopping malls .
Find a way to serve food at the local elementary school cafeteria and sneeze on the mac and cheese .
Invite your friends and neighbors over when you start feeling sick , and spike their food with the flu by dipping your cock in their soup .
Be at peace with this situation .
In the long run , depopulation on a massive scale is good for us as a species .
Yes , it is .
To argue otherwise is to be a deluded douche nozzle who is n’t paying attention to science .
So go forth .
Catch swine flu .
Vomit blood into your toilet .
Then do us all a favor .
Die .

We like green .
Green apples .
Green Bay .
The Green Mile .
Asparagus .
And we have this sweater .
Anyway , we like green , but we 've never been " green . "
We 're , shall we say , suspicious about any word so often swathed in so much righteousness .
Because " green " can too easily be equated with " good , " which is a vast oversimplification , especially when so much fact gets aggressively manipulated by so many interested parties in the name of " green . "
We have this friend who gave us some perspective on " green . "
His name is Bjørn Lomborg , a political economist , environmental activist , and fierce optimist , who brought eight economists ( including five Nobel laureates ) together a year ago to come up with a sensible plan for environmental activism .
It 's called the Copenhagen Consensus .
He wrote an essay in our 75th Anniversary Issue ( October 2008 ) that convinced us that the small things we do ( and some of the big things we do ) can't amount to much unless we overhaul our list of priorities ( placing malnutrition above , say , reducing CO 2 emissions ) .
His essay makes environmentalism a powerful and complex idea .
You can read it here .
So , about being " green " we 're a little ambivalent .
But about doing good we are n't conflicted at all .
The products on these pages are good , and using them feels good .
They improve our lives .
They work .
And they 're environmentally sound .
Which is a bonus .
The Quiet Mow

Virtues :
+ Gas-free

If pollution and sloth ever become virtues , self - propelled and riding mowers will be the trappings of the righteous .
Until then , we 'll stick with old - fashioned manual mowers .
They do n't use gas , do n't stink , do n't involve a potentially arm - snapping rip cord .
And then there 's the whisperlike sound they make .
It 's almost worth the looks you 'll get from neighbors .

A Hatchback for Men
Ben Goldstein / Studio D
Virtues :
+ Quick
+ Efficient
+ Japanese
The hatchback already comes close to the practical ideal : Seats five , sips gas , handles like a go - kart , looks cool enough .
Utilitarian .
But the new breed of sport hatchback is more sport , less hatchback .
Take the MazdaSpeed3 pictured above .
( See also : Volkswagen GTI , Subaru WRX . )
With 263 hp , 26 mpg highway , and a $ 23,500 base price , it 's frugal enough for daily commuting , roomy enough for errands and powerful enough to remind you you 're not driving a Prius .
Better Beer
Virtues :
+ Fresher
+ Larger
+ Cheaper
+ Comes with handle
Until the late 1800s , beer came in one kind of container the keg and was sold in one place : the local saloon .
Folks wishing to drink elsewhere would bring jugs to be filled at the tap .
These were known as growlers .
And the invention of the beer can all but killed them .
These days beer makers across the country are distributing growlers again .
( And many brewpubs and specialty grocers will let you fill your own growlers directly from their taps . )
Plunk down seven or eight bucks plus a two - or three - dollar bottle deposit , and head home with half a gallon of the crispest , freshest ale ( or stout or pilsner ) you 've ever tasted .
When you 're done , you bring the bottle back and reclaim your deposit or treat it as a down payment on the next growler .
The bottle itself gets cleaned and returned to its source , ready to be filled again .
Paint Made from Mlik
Ben Goldstein / Studio D
Virtues :
+ Odorless
+ Durable
+ Bovine
Before modern chemistry gave us oil and latex varieties , " house paint " meant milk paint .
You 'd take a bucket of milk , add powdered lime ( the mineral , not the fruit ) and some pigment , and stir .
The result was an odor - free , fade - proof coating with the added benefits of extreme toughness and zero cases of lead poisoning .
Since 1974 , the Old - Fashioned Milk Paint Company has been offering genuine milk paint in powder form , and there 's a new version formulated specially for interior walls .
Look for it wherever gorp is sold ( or at milkpaint.com ) .
Soap for Everything
Ben Goldstein / Studio D
Virtues :
+ Works on hands
+ Works on feet
+ Works on hair
+ Works on dogs
There 's no reason to buy hand soap , dish soap , shampoo , body bars , body wash , or shaving cream when you can just buy a bottle of Dr. Bronner 's .
The stuff 's been around since World War II , is 100 percent organic , and cleans everything from rugs to babies .
Dr. Bronner 's comes in eight scents we prefer the original peppermint and according to the label can be used in eighteen different ways .
( According to the Internet , there are hundreds more . )

There were people who were proud to call themselves tech geeks and a few who admitted being near - Luddites , and there was at least one person who called herself a radical technologist .
They joined book publishers , librarians and computer consultants , some of whom had come from as far as Ireland and Brazil , at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University in Downtown Brooklyn on Saturday for something akin to a happening for the Internet age  Drupal Camp .
Drupal is free software used to run Web sites , and participants at the event said they were drawn there , despite differences in backgrounds and ideologies , by a belief in an almost utopian form of technological cooperation .
“ We ’re throwing out the idea of software as a commodity and replacing it with the idea of labor and participation being valued more than ownership , ” Eric Goldhagen , a software consultant and developer from the East Village and a primary organizer of the event , told the gathering .
Drupal was developed by Dries Buytaert , a Belgian programmer , and nearly 10 years ago he made the Drupal code public , giving up formal control of his creation and letting people use it without charge with the stipulation that they share modifications and improvements with one another .
Mark Huba is one of numerous Capital
One cardholders nationwide who pays his bills on time and has n’t missed any payments -- yet has just been notified that his interest rate is soaring to almost 18 % .
Cap
One ’s rate hikes are the latest example of how the credit card industry is turning the screws on customers even as many of those same lenders receive billions of dollars in taxpayer - funded bailouts .
Huba , 38 , is an account manager for DS Waters of America Inc. , the bottled - water company that owns Sparkletts , Alhambra and other well - known brands .
He ’s been a Cap One cardholder for 12 years and carries a balance of about $ 1,700 .
In other words , at least from Cap One ’s perspective , he ’s a model customer .
Advertisement
So Huba was astonished to receive a five - page pamphlet from Cap One recently informing him that his interest rate would rise next month to 17.9 % from 9.9 % .
It also said that if Huba missed a due date by more than three days twice in a single year , his rate would soar to 29.4 % .
The pamphlet blamed the rate hikes not on anything Huba did but on “ extraordinary changes in the economic environment . ”
That ’s another way of saying Cap One lost $ 1.42 billion in the last three months of 2008 and , like most other lenders , is now looking for any way to boost revenue -- even if that means stepping all over once - loyal customers .
“ If I treated my customers like that , I would n’t be in business , ” Huba said .
“ I ’ll probably close my account and never use Capital One again . ”

Pam Girardo , a Cap
One spokeswoman , said customers have until mid-April to decide whether they want to accept the new terms or close their accounts .
If they choose to walk away , they ’ll have to pay off the outstanding balance and forfeit any rewards their card may have accumulated .
“ Because the credit and lending environments continue to be challenging , the account changes are necessary in order for us to appropriately account for the increased risk of lending to consumers during the downturn , ” Girardo said .
The crappy economy means default rates are rising for card issuers and could hit a record 10 % this year .
But it seems like a decidedly shortsighted approach to punish those customers who still pay their bills and have n’t shown themselves to represent any greater risk .
Yet Citigroup Inc. recently informed cardholders that their interest rate could rocket to almost 30 % if they missed a single payment , and JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it would start charging a $ 10 monthly fee to those who ’ve carried large balances for more than a couple of years .
Advertisement
Most lenders have declined to say how many customers have been hit with higher rates .
But consumer advocates place the number in the millions .
Insult to injury : Citi has received $ 45 billion in bailout cash from taxpayers .
Chase has gotten $ 25 billion .
And Capital One Financial Corp. has pocketed $ 3.55 billion .
Meanwhile , some card issuers are going so far as to raise people ’s rates and not even make a pretense of blaming it on tough economic conditions .
Los Angeles resident John Concannon , 61 , told me that Advanta Corp. had just jacked up his rate to 27.9 % from 7.9 % .
Like Huba , he said he does n’t miss payments and always pays his bills on time .
But when Concannon called Advanta to ask why his rate had just gone through the roof , he said the company clammed up .
Advertisement
“ They refused to tell me why , ” he said .
“ They said it was for proprietary reasons . ”
Yeah , that ’s a trade secret you would n’t want getting into the wrong hands .
Tom Taulli , an Advanta vice president , said he could n’t comment on individual cardholders or on what the company ’s service reps might be telling people .
But he acknowledged that rates had gone up recently for Advanta customers .
“ We periodically look at our portfolio based on what ’s going on with the industry and the economy , ” he said .
The Federal Reserve is attempting to curb runaway rate hikes by limiting lenders ’ ability to charge more for existing balances and requiring 45 days ’ notice for any changes to contract terms .
However , the Fed ’s new rules do n’t take effect until July 2010 -- nearly a year and half from now .
Advertisement
Clearly help is needed for cardholders sooner rather than later .
That ’s why Sen. Christopher J. Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , has introduced legislation that would immediately end the credit card industry ’s practice of raising rates at any time and for any reason .
At a committee hearing Tuesday , he called for “ sweeping reform of abusive credit card and mortgage lending practices , ” and asked whether a new regulatory agency is needed to focus exclusively on protecting consumers from rapacious lenders .
My hunch is that most cardholders already know the answer to that question .
Cap on payday loans
Advertisement
Speaking of legislation that ca n’t be approved quickly enough , Sen. Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill . ) reintroduced a bill last week that would put a halt to payday lenders ’ triple - digit interest rates .
The legislation would cap payday lenders ’ rates at 36 % annually .
That ’s still an absurdly high amount , but it ’s a whole lot better than the 400 % annual rate that many payday lenders now charge .
Members of the military already enjoy such protection .
Durbin ’s bill essentially would provide the same safeguards to everyone -- and would allow individual states to impose even tougher limits .
California ’s usury law limits interest on most consumer loans to 10 % annually but exempts payday lenders from the provision .
That ’s a loophole we can close .

The International Committee for the Red Cross ( the organization empowered by international law to investigate claims of prisoner abuse ) released the second part of its report on the treatment of detainees by the United States .
As before , the results are damning , and this time directly implicate medical officers who participated in the torture :
Medical officers who oversaw interrogations of terrorism suspects in CIA secret prisons committed gross violations of medical ethics and in some cases essentially participated in torture , the International Committee of the Red Cross concluded in a confidential report that labeled the CIA program “ inhuman . ”
Health personnel offered supervision and even assistance as suspected al - Qaeda operatives were beaten , deprived of food , exposed to temperature extremes and subjected to waterboarding , the relief agency said in the 2007 report , a copy of which was posted on a magazine Web site yesterday .
The report quoted one medical official as telling a detainee : “ I look after your body only because we need you for information . ”

HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro said on Tuesday Cuba had no desire to rejoin the Organization of American States , as called for by some of his allies , and did not even want to “ hear the vile name of that institution . ”
Castro , in his third column published on Tuesday , said the OAS “ has a history that collects all the trash of 60 years of betrayal of the people of Latin America . ”
He said the organization had been involved in “ aggressive actions ” that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people .
Cuba was suspended from the 35 - member OAS in 1962 because the communist system created by Castro after he took power in a 1959 revolution was judged to be “ incompatible ” with the organization ’s principles .
Castro has criticized the group for years , calling it the “ Ministry of Colonies ” of the United States .
Before the OAS ’ Summit of the Americas set to begin on Friday in Trinidad and Tobago , several Latin American countries have said Cuba should be reinstated in the organization , which promotes regional cooperation and democracy .
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim told reporters in Rio de Janeiro on Monday that Cuba ’s absence from the OAS “ is an anomaly that needs to be corrected . ”
OAS chief Jose Miguel Insulza told Brazilian newspaper O Globo that Cuba must show its commitment to democracy to be readmitted .
“ We need to know if Cuba is interested in returning to multilateral organizations or if it is thinking only about the end of the embargo and economic growth , ” he told the newspaper , referring to the U.S. trade embargo imposed on Cuba since 1962 .
“ It even offends us to suppose that we are desiring of entering the OAS .
That train passed a while back , and Insulza still does n’t know it , ” Castro said .
Castro , 82 , has not been seen in public since intestinal surgery in July 2006 .
He ceded power to his brother , President Raul Castro , last year but maintains a powerful voice through columns published in state - run Internet sites and newspapers .
In recent weeks , he has churned out columns at a prolific rate .
The first two on Tuesday dealt in part with Monday ’s decision by U.S. President Barack Obama to let Cuban - Americans travel freely to Cuba and send as much money as they want to relatives there .
Castro said the travel measure was a positive , but small step toward improved U.S. - Cuba relations that Obama has said he will pursue .
( CNN ) -- Troubled insurance giant AIG , already under fire for intending to pay out $ 165 million in bonuses and compensation , succumbed Sunday to congressional pressure , identifying banks that received chunks of the company 's billions in federal bailout funds last year .
AIG says it " recognizes the importance of upholding a high degree of transparency " relating to bailout money .
AIG , a recipient of at least $ 170 billion in federal bailout money , got an $ 85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve .
The list released Sunday of " counterparties " that benefited from the bailout is topped by European banks Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank , which received $ 4.1 billion and $ 2.6 billion , respectively .
Wall Street firms Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch round out the top four , receiving $ 2.5 billion and $ 1.8 billion , respectively .
In releasing the list , AIG said it " recognizes the importance of upholding a high degree of transparency with respect to the use of public funds , " in a statement .
Lawmakers have been pushing for AIG to release a list of its counterparties since last fall , arguing taxpayers have a right to know how federal aid is being used .
Earlier this month , in reference to lawmakers ' request for a list of AIG 's counterparties , U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - New York , told CNNMoney it was critical to determine whether AIG 's collapse would have resulted in a market catastrophe .
" We were told AIG posed systemic risk to our economy , " she said .
" How do we know if that 's true if we do n't know where the money went ? "
AIG Payouts Below are the top 10 largest payouts , according to a report released Sunday by AIG .
Societe Generale : $ 4.1 billion
Deutsche Bank : $ 2.6 billion
Goldman Sachs : $ 2.5 billion
Merrill Lynch : $ 1.8 billion
Calyon : $ 1.1 billion
Barclays : $ 0.9 billion
UBS : $ 0.8 billion
DZ Bank : $ 0.7 billion
Wachovia : $ 0.7 billion
Rabobank : $ 0.5 billion
Officials from the Federal Reserve and AIG have resisted disclosing the identity of the banks , citing concerns about competition and confidence in the market .
Responding to questioning about AIG on March 5 , Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn told the Senate Banking Committee that revealing the names of the banks would prevent financial institutions from doing business with AIG and other recipients of federal bailout money .
" They would draw back from doing business with those folks , " Kohn said .
Kohn 's comments drew scrutiny from the committee , namely chairman Sen.
Chris Dodd , D - Connecticut , who replied , " Right now the public is deeply , deeply troubled by all of this .
And it 's their money that is being fed into these operations , and they , frankly , do n't understand -- nor do we -- the legal arguments you 're giving , but at a time we need to engender public trust and confidence in these very difficult steps , that kind of an answer undermines that effort very significantly . "
AIG , in its statement Sunday , said it consulted with the Fed about the benefit to the public of disclosing the counterparties , and whether doing so would cause " competitive harm . "
Watch report on AIG naming names »
The company also faced criticism over the weekend from White House officials and some congressional lawmakers who reacted strongly to news that AIG had intended to pay out $ 165 million in bonuses and compensation .
Under pressure from the Treasury , AIG scaled back those plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or " retention payments " -- by at least 30 percent .
That did little to temper outrage at the initial plan , however .
In a letter Sunday to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , U.S. Sen .
Russ Feingold urged the Obama administration to explore " legal options " to prevent the millions in AIG payouts .
" I write to ask why any bonuses would be legally required , given the company 's abysmal performance , " said Feingold , D - Wisconsin .
iReport.com : AIG , ' You failed '
Also Sunday , CBS ' " 60 Minutes " aired an interview with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , who said the AIG bailout rankled him .
" Of all the events and all of the things we 've done in the last 18 months , the single one that makes me the angriest , that gives me the most angst , is the intervention with AIG , " Bernanke said . "
AIG lost a record $ 62 billion dollars in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
It has more than 74 million insurance policies issued in 130 countries around the world .

United States Empire Built on False Prosperity Collapsing
KEEP ON ROCKIN IN THE FREE WORLD - The American Republic is 226 years old .
The Roman Empire lasted 13 centuries before collapsing .
The Roman emperors attempted to stave off the collapse by providing bread and circuses to the masses .
Feeding Christians to lions worked only for so long .
I picture Caligula “ Mad Money ” Cramer exhorting the masses that the worst was over and not to worry about the Vandals and the Huns .
Nero “ Mustard Seed ” Kudlow probably saw a recovery on the horizon as Barbarians were at the gates of the city .
Cleopatra “ Money Honey ” Bartiromo was proclaiming that the stupid masses did n’t know what was best for the system .
Caesar “ Glimmers of Hope ” Obama was sure that if they just distributed more bread and added a few more circuses , things would improve by the Ides of March .
The false prosperity we have been experiencing for the last thirty years has come to an abrupt conclusion in the last 18 months .
The amount of wealth destroyed is beyond comprehension .
Household net worth has declined by $ 12 trillion in a matter of months .
It will take years for average Americans to restore their wealth to 2007 levels .
If your investment portfolio has declined by 50 % , it will need to increase by 100 % to break even .
According to the Wall Street shills on CNBC , it should take at least 3 months .
An honest financial advisor would tell you 10 to 15 years .
Americans have no choice but to substantially increase their rate of savings .
Think back to yesteryear in 1981 when the savings rate was 12 % .
Back then , Americans accept as a truth that hard work and a saving ethic led to long - term success .
I ca n’t look at this chart without questioning why this happened .
It always brings me back to the dreaded Baby Boomers .
Their delusional belief that somehow they could borrow and spend today with real estate wealth funding their retirement came crashing down around them in the last 18 months .
The bailing out of these delusional boomers with tax dollars has generated incredible anger in the country .
Those who followed the rules are being compelled by the authorities to pay for the sins of those who did n’t follow the rules .
The stupendous fabric of the country is straining and in danger of yielding to the immense pressure building up in our society .
I believe the actions taken by politicians and Washington bureaucrats in the last year have marked a point of no return .
If we continue on the chosen path , time or accident will ultimately result in the demise of the Great American Experiment .
I ’m irate at the government for choosing to bailout excessive risk takers at my expense .
There are millions of other Americans who feel the same way .
This is why tea parties are taking place across the nation .
I truly believe that every American has the right to make his or her own financial decisions .
While I do not judge individuals on how they live their lives , I feel entitled to pass judgment on clusters of people whose individual decisions have negatively impacted my life .
With the support of Congress , the Treasury and the Federal Reserve , these individuals are seizing my tax dollars as compensation for their idiotic behavior .
Do n’t Feel Like Satan
There 's colors on the street
Red , white and blue
People shufflin ' their feet
People sleepin ' in their shoes
But there 's a warnin ' sign
on the road ahead
There 's a lot of people sayin '
we'd be better off dead
Do n't feel like Satan ,
but I am to them
So I try to forget it ,
any way I can .
Keep on rockin ' in the free world ,
Keep on rockin ' in the free world
Keep on rockin ' in the free world ,
Keep on rockin ' in the free world .
Neil Young – Rockin in the Free World
Neil Young wrote the song Keep on Rockin in the Free World in 1989 .
It is an angry song and I believe its lyrics are more relevant today .
Neil and a member of his band , Pancho Sampedro , were glancing at newspaper photographs of the funeral of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran as the angry mob set American flags on fire and chanted death to America .
These Iranians thought America was the great Satan .
Sampedro commented , " Whatever we do , we should n't go near the Mideast .
It 's probably better we just keep on rockin ' in the free world . "
I wish we had made this guy our Secretary of State .
When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1991 , President George Bush decided it was America ’s responsibility to protect Saudi Arabia ’s oil fields and liberate Kuwait from the clutches of the dictator we had previously supported .
The American military crushed Sadaam Hussein ’s Republican Guard and liberated Kuwait .
After the Gulf War , the U.S. left 4,000 American troops in Saudi Arabia , eventually growing to 7,000 troops .
These troops became a rallying point for Muslim fundamentalists , who charged the U.S. was trying to increase its influence over the Saudi royal family and the nation 's oil reserves .
" The presence of the U.S. forces gave a lot of fuel to the virulent , anti-American Islamic forces that certainly commanded an audience in Saudi , and in the broader Arab world , " said Jamil Khoury , an Arab specialist and business consultant who teaches at the University of Chicago .
The U.S. has spent $ 7 trillion on Defense since 1991 .
Most of these funds were used to develop offensive weapons , not defensive weapons .
The Heritage Foundation will argue that military spending as a percentage of GDP was only 4 % in 2007 , well below the 45 year average of 5.5 % .
This period includes the Cold War , Korean War , and Vietnam War .
The 2010 budget spending will increase it to at least 5.6 % of GDP .
The real question is n’t what percentage of GDP is proper it is whether $ 7 trillion could have been spent more intelligently .
Would $ 4 trillion have been sufficient to defend the country ?
The military launched approximately 1,000 cruise missiles during the Iraq War at a cost of $ 1 million per missile .
This was a choice to spend $ 1 billion blowing up bridges , water plants , and electrical facilities in Iraq rather than spending it repairing our 156,000 structurally deficient bridges , replacing our decaying water pipes , and upgrading our electrical grid .
Would the $ 7 trillion have been better spent by private individuals ?
Could it have been better spent jump starting efforts to wean ourselves off Middle East oil ?
I do n’t know the answer .
But , I do know that the vast majority of the $ 7 trillion was borrowed from China , Japan and my grandchildren .
Kinder , Gentler , Machine Gun Hand

Neil Young – Rockin in the Free World
Neil Young ’s cynical view of our President , national priorities , and future was well founded .
He saw the social fabric of the country ripping apart in 1989 .
I believe everyone has a right to live their lives as they see fit .
This is America , land of the free , home of the brave .
When powerful government bureaucrats choose to subsidize the conscious blunders of others through the utilization of my tax dollars , I ’ve got a big problem .
There are approximately 308 million people living in the United States .
75 million of these people are under 18 years old and 40 million are over 65 years old .
They are generally off the hook regarding the current financial crisis .
That leaves 195 million people .
The 80 million Baby Boomers ( the pig in the python ) are at the root of most problems in our society today .
As I walked from the parking garage to my office the other day I noticed a license plate on a parked BMW 335i .
It read 335-4- NOW .
This boomers goal in life was to move up from a $ 40,000 automobile to a $ 60,000 automobile .
Very noble goal , but it reflects that the priorities for many in this country have become warped .
Approximately 12 % of the U.S population ( 36 million people ) is considered poor and are totally dependent upon the State to keep from starving .
The working class makes up 40 % of the population , the middle class 45 % , and the ruling elite class 3 % .
All of these classes made dreadful mistakes in the last decade .
The poor pretended to be middle class .
They were able to buy $ 200,000 houses , lease $ 30,000 cars , own cell phones , get monthly cable , and eat out three times per week .
Their friendly neighborhood banker loaned them the money to live this fantasy life .
The working and middle class were able to buy $ 700,000 McMansions , go on trips to Europe , lease $ 50,000 cars and generally live the life of the rich and famous .
A different banker in a nicer neighborhood also loaned them the money to live like rock stars .
A portion of all these classes were the extremists that led us down the erroneous path to destruction ..
Extreme behavior by individuals throughout our society , encouraged by banks , the government , Federal Reserve , and the mainstream media have pushed our country to the brink of disaster .
Half of the households in America make less than $ 46,000 per year .
I can guarantee you that the household incomes in the neighborhoods of West Philadelphia that I drive through to work every day are much lower than $ 46,000 .
Half the houses are boarded up , and rats are the predominant tenants .
When I see a middle aged lower income woman driving an $ 87,000 Mercedes SUV or a young punk driving an $ 85,000 BMW , I know something has gone seriously off course .
The auto financing companies were willing to make 7 year 0 % interest loans or $ 400 a month leases available to these people .
They did it because they were able to parcel these awful loans into a package , get it rated AAA by Moody ’s and sell the toxic stench bomb to pension funds and life insurance companies .
Meanwhile the deadbeats cruising around in the luxury wheels got to live the Fake American Dream for awhile .
Extremism was not relegated to only the poor .
The lifestyles of the rich and famous are nauseating and revolting to the average middle class American .
Watch one episode of Housewives of Orange County or New York to understand the shallowness and pretentiousness of the privileged rich .
Across America there are millions of people whose sense of worth is tied to the McMansion they live in , the brand of car they drive , the school they send their kids to , and the number of electronic gadgets they can accumulate .
The majority of these people can be found on the East Coast and West Coast .
Wall Street and Hollywood are the Mecca for these arrogant , vain , self centered snobs .
The powerful few in our society took extreme risks in the casinos of Wall Street .
AIG , Goldman Sachs , Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns , among others were inhabited by multi-millionaire gamblers .
They had already socked away millions in bonuses and stock options , but their arrogance and pride led them to take even more extreme risks .
They ultimately destroyed the financial system .
Now they want you and I to come to their rescue , for the good of the country .
Let ’s See How Far We ’ve Come
Said where you going man you know the world is headed for hell
Say your goodbyes if you 've got someone you can say goodbye to
I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well I guess we 're gonna find out
Let 's see how far we 've come
Let 's see how far we 've come
How Far We ’ve Come - Matchbox 20
I believe the world is burning to the ground .
The United States is spending trillions per year propping up social safety nets and waging foreign wars while borrowing the funds to do so .
The currency is being debased day by day and will eventually be worthless .
Our current path will lead us to hell .
I think I can address the anger and disillusionment of the vast majority of hard working Americans :
The materialism and wastefulness of our society is reflected in how our minimum living standards have changed since 1970 .
The average household size has declined from 3.1 to 2.5 , a 20 % reduction .
Our average home size has increased from 1,400 sq ft to 2,600 sq ft , an 86 % increase .
The average number of vehicles per household has increased from 1.1 to 2.3 , a 109 % increase .
Bigger is better has been the American mantra for decades .
These figures are skewed , as many people live in 6,000 sq ft McMansions and drive 4 or more cars .
It is clear that millions cannot distinguish between a need and a want .
I bought my home in 1995 .
The minor upgrades ( finished basement , hardwoods ) we ’ve made over fourteen years were paid for in cash .
The other major expenditures were to replace appliances that broke .
When the value of the house miraculously doubled between 2000 and 2005 , I opened a home equity line of credit with my Credit Union as an emergency fund .
It has not been used to take vacations , buy a new car , or install a $ 25,000 kitchen .
The extreme risk takers bought houses with 105 % leverage , lied on their mortgage applications , attempted to flip multiple condos , used the appreciation in their home value to live the lifestyle of Madonna and vacationed on the French Riviera .
Now the politicians running our government are using my tax dollars to insure that these extreme risk takers stay in their homes .
Rewarding reckless behavior leads to more reckless behavior .
I drive a paid for 7 year old CRV with 120,000 miles .
My wife drives a paid for 9 year old Minivan with 95,000 miles .
I have never been a car person .
My Dad always bought used cars .
I do n’t see the point in spending money on a depreciating asset .
My self esteem is not tied to the car I drive .
I ’ve owned 2 new cars in the 30 years I ’ve been driving .
I ’ve financed my cars over four years .
Every month that I do n’t have to make a car payment allows me to put that money towards my kid ’s college fund or my retirement account .
GMAC , Chrysler Financial , and Ford Credit have been the credit drug pushers that have permitted luxury addicts all over the country to tool around in a Mercedes , BMW , or Porsche of their choice .
Shockingly , lending money to subprime borrowers led to billions in losses .
GMAC rationally decided in October 2008 to limit loans to people with credit scores above 700 .
In December the government delivered $ 5 billion of taxpayer TARP funds to GMAC , who then decided to again lend money to subprime borrowers with 620 credit scores .
Their plan is to lose money on these loans , but make it up on volume .
When you see an 18 year old punk driving a BMW , you are probably making his car payment .
We use a credit card to pay for virtually all of our monthly expenses .
1 % of the charges go into my son ’s 529 college account .
I have not paid an interest charge since 1990 .
I ’m a credit card company ’s worst customer .
No interest income , no late charges and I ’ve received maximum rewards .
I ’m not the average American .
The average American owes $ 9,000 on their credit cards .
In a fair world , when these people could n’t repay their debts the bank would take a major loss and the consumer face bankruptcy with the inability to borrow for years .
The top credit card issuers JP Morgan , Bank of America , Citicorp , and Capital One issued credit cards to anyone with a pulse because they just sold the package of bad debt to widows and the Chinese .
Then they drank their own poisoned kool - aide .
Now our clueless Treasury Secretaries ( Mr. Paulson & Mr. Geithner ) have shoveled $ 78 billion of your tax dollars to these banks so they can continue to send out 5 billion credit card solicitations per year to more deadbeats .
Loaning money to people incapable of repaying you is generally not a good business practice , except in the America of today .
Every individual in the United States has right to live any way they choose .
Many have chosen to borrow and live the good life today and not worry about tomorrow .
They will vote for the politician that promises them bread and circuses without requiring them to sacrifice , save for a rainy day , take responsibility for their future or exercise any self control .
This is where reality and fantasy meet .
People can only borrow and spend if the Federal Reserve and bankers provide the funds to do so .
By creating money out of thin air and handing it out to people with no legitimate means of repaying , the bankers who run this country have put this country on the road to ruin .
The government solution is to confiscate your tax dollars , give it out to bankers , who will lend it to new subprime borrowers , who will not repay these debts .
They are doing this in a last ditch attempt to retain power and control .
The people of our great country must heed the words of David Walker , unless we want it to collapse into a heap of smoldering ashes .
“ The US government is on a ‘ burning platform ’ of unsustainable policies and practices with fiscal deficits , chronic healthcare underfunding , immigration and overseas military commitments threatening a crisis if action is not taken soon .
There are striking similarities between America ’s current situation and the factors that brought down Rome , including declining moral values and political civility at home , an over - confident and over - extended military in foreign lands and fiscal irresponsibility by the central government . ”
Let ’s see how far we ’ve come .
I guess we ’re going to find out .

From the 1970s with fiat money - until now .
You can't put something on nothing and expect it to stand - it will collapse .
Seems to me that the fact of the US dollar being the world 's reserve currency is what has kept the financial circus going this long .
But , even that buffer can only last so long .

Slaves rejoice in a hard - won fight for freedom
By Liu Jun ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-03-09 10:13
Pasang still remembers the night she decided to flee her master 's house some 50 years ago .
The stars shone brilliantly over her , as if they were pointing to a brighter future .
It was that night she changed her name from Kelsang ( Auspiciousness ) to Pasang ( Bright Star ) .
Born in a family of Nangsan - the house slaves of Tibetan noble families - Pasang was destined to be a slave for her life .
At 7 , the girl was sent to serve the master 's mother .
Her duties included bringing tea upstairs and cleaning the old lady 's chamber pot ( toilet ) .
She was often kept awake throughout the night .
" It was a time for a young child to grow , but I had to toil day and night with hardly any sleep , " recalls Pasang in her spacious study filled with books .
She was the first woman to become vice - chairperson of the Tibet autonomous region 's government in 1971 .
A few years ago , she retired from the post of vice - chairperson of the All China Women 's Federation .
The dramatic turn of her destiny came in 1956 , when her master beat her and the 19 - year - old decided to run for her life .
Journeying for seven days from Lhasa , she found the People 's Liberation Army and joined the construction of the Damxung airport .
In the documentary Stories of Tibetan Serfs , which is been aired on China Central Television ( CCTV ) this week , Pasang joins other former Tibetan slaves , beggars and researchers to celebrate the tremendous changes that have taken place in Tibet over the past half a century .
Jointly made by the State Council 's Information Office and the CCTV , the 50 - minute documentary gives a vivid account of Tibet 's peaceful liberation and democratic reform in the 1950s and 60s .
What makes it more convincing are rare film footages taken by both Chinese and foreign journalists at the time .
In a scene recorded by British photographers in the late 1940s , Tibetan nobles rode on horses and human slaves to enjoy a journey .
Along the road , serfs had to bow and stick out their tongues to show humble obedience .
About the same time , the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Dec 1948 , whose 4th article states that " No one shall be held in slavery or servitude ; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms " .
Another powerful example comes from Orphans of the Cold War : America and the Tibetan Struggle for Survival , which was written by John Kenneth Knaus in 1999 .
Knaus proves the United States ' support of Dalai Lama and his followers from the 1950s to the mid-1970s .
Besides planning the escape route for Dalai Lama in 1959 , the CIA also trained Tibetans in Colorado and Saipan Island to be special agents .
The CIA air - dropped troops and weapons into Tibet and Sichuan province to sabotage the democratic reform .
The Tibetan noble class and high - level monks tried to resist the changes and maintain their privileges .
The documentary compared Chairman Mao Zedong to Lincoln , because both men were faced with the challenge of liberating the slaves and maintaining the nation 's unification .
Only three days after Dalai Lama fled Tibet , the rebellions stopped and the old Tibetan Kashak government was dissolved on March 28 , 1959 .
The documentary shows many moving scenes of how the slaves and beggars rejoiced over their hard - won freedom .
" The liberation of one million serfs and slaves is a human rights movement in its true sense , " says the documentary .
In contrast , Tsewang Gyungmey comes from a prominent nobleman 's family .
Among the students in a primary school founded in the early 1950s in Lhasa , he was the only one to have servants leading his horse to school .
But Tsewang Gyungmey believed everybody must earn a living with his own hands .
With other young Tibetans , he went to Beijing and graduated from the Beijing Normal University , where he won the heart of a schoolmate .
Zhang Tingfang says she believed their love was strong enough to conquer any difficulties , and she followed Tsewang Gyungmey back to Tibet .
They both taught numerous students and her husband became the first president of Tibet University in 1983 .
The documentary has been translated into English , French , Spanish and other languages and will be broadcast in CCTV 's foreign language channels on today , Tuesday and March 16 .
In the bid for a fat envelope this year , it may help , more than usual , to have a fat wallet .
Facing fallen endowments and needier students , many colleges are looking more favorably on wealthier applicants as they make their admissions decisions this year .
Institutions that have pledged to admit students regardless of need are finding ways to increase the number of those who pay the full cost in ways that allow the colleges to maintain the claim of being need - blind  taking more students from the transfer or waiting lists , for instance , or admitting more foreign students who pay full tuition .
Private colleges that acknowledge taking financial status into account say they are even more aware of that factor this year .
“ If you are a student of means or ability , or both , there has never been a better year , ” said Robert A. Sevier , an enrollment consultant to colleges .

I believe if something is important enough to remember , it ’s important enough to write down .
This does n’t just apply to random to - do tasks or events to put on your calendar .
I write down goals , ideas , what I spend money on and useful thinking points from books .
The reason to write is n’t to keep records , but to be more aware .
In the popular productivity bible , Getting Things Done , Dave Allen suggests writing everything down on a notepad so you wo n’t forget .
The purpose , according to Allen , is to take the burden off your memory .
While I think this is important , it only touches on one of the reasons to write things down .
Writing Keeps You Aware
Writing focuses your thinking .
When you write something down , you are n’t just creating a paper record , you ’re changing the way you think about it .
Writing down a goal changes a whim into a conviction .
Writing down your expenses changes excessive spending from a bad habit to a conscious choice .
Writing down your idea turns a vague suggestion into a clear concept .
Writing is like an upgrade to your thinking .
In the normal flow of thought , you ca n’t edit typos and make adjustments .
If you get distracted , it can be hard to return to your place .
And since your short term memory is only about 5 - 9 items long , you ca n’t think over more complex ideas .
When you start writing things down , you have an upgraded level of thinking about them .
Writing things down makes you more aware of opportunities and problems , like a temporary boost to your IQ .
The Virtue Is n’t in a Record
Over half the things I write down , I never look at again .
For the other half , about three quarters of those , I ’ll only look at once or twice , usually briefly .
Only a small amount of the things I write down are needed for keeping records I ’ll look at repeatedly .
If you ’re stuck in the record - keeping mindset , writing everything down wo n’t make sense .
It just does n’t seem practical to write down every idea , expense , meal or to - do item .
But , if you appreciate the role writing plays in keeping you focused , you can see why it is valuable , even if you throw away the writing soon afterwards .
What Should I Write Down ?
Obviously you ca n’t write down everything .
You ca n’t write down everything said in a conversation .
Writing down everything you eat or everything you do can eat up a lot of time .
Writing is valuable because it forces you to focus , so writing down everything would ruin the purpose .
You should write down anything you feel needs more clarity .
If your finances are n’t doing well and you want more clarity , start writing down everything you spend money on and all of your income .
If your studying habits need work , start writing down when you study , what you studied and for how long .
If you keep getting distracted on important goals , write them down too .
Writing is sort of a universal productivity tool .
It can focus your thinking in just about anything , so using it frequently is a good way to stay focused .
Even something as simple as writing down when you procrastinate can be enough to stop it .
Where Do You Need to Focus ?
If something is important and worth getting done , it is probably worth writing down .
Ask yourself what things could use more focus in your life .
Writing is n’t an instant cure that will immediately make you more productive .
But it makes you far more aware of what needs to be done and how well you are doing it .
The first time I started writing out exactly what I needed to do , I finished three times as much work .
When I started writing out my goals , I was able to focus on them far more than when they were just in my head .
I ’ve also found writing down my expenses , how I use my time or what I eat to increase my awareness of any problems .
If there is a part of your life that is unknown , inconsistent or in poor shape , you should consider writing more down about it .
Write down ideas and make records while you ’re working on it , and spend time writing your thoughts when you ’re taking a break .
If you can keep writing for a few weeks , it can reveal solutions to problems you did n’t even realize you had before .
I suggest committing yourself to writing something down for at least a month .
Writing is n’t a natural habit , we were n’t born with the skill and it ’s one of the first pieces of technology we had developed .
As a result , if you do n’t commit to continuing it for a few weeks , you probably will return to relying only on your short - term memory .
Thinking is good , but writing plus thinking is even better .
Do n’t try to write down everything .
Pick just a handful of things you want to keep your focus on .
And if you ’re planning on making a commitment to write , you will probably want to write that down too .
It 's after midnight in China , but I wanted to mention in real time an oratorical performance that deserves a second look .
It 's from Barack Obama 's NATO press conference that just wrapped up , and the part worth studying is the two or three minutes that followed a question by Edward Luce of the Financial Times .
I have nothing against Luce , who wrote a very good recent book about India , but here he asked in what can only be called plummy tones whether Obama still clung to the idea of " American exceptionalism . "
The general phrasing of the question held that idea out at arm 's length as a kind of yahoo colonial oddity .
" I believe in American exceptionalism , " Obama said after one beat for thought .
" Just as the Brits believe in British exceptionalism , and the Greeks in Greek exceptionalism ... "
I do n't have a transcript here , but what was impressive was how rapidly he seemed to have figured out the full shape of his answer ; how effortlessly the term " the Brits " ( and the instant pairing with " the Greeks " ) offset the seeming Oxbridge hauteur* of the question ; and how he went on to give so balanced a response that no one , Yank or otherwise , could fail to be satisfied .
Of course he was proud of his country , Obama said .
But it was also objectively exceptional in several ways : it still had the world 's largest economy ; its military power was unmatched ; and -- with emphasis here -- its Constitutional principles enshrined values and ideals that truly were exceptional .
Therefore it should be proud of its role in the world , and embrace its responsibilities .
A new study has found surprising evidence of delays in getting women with heart trouble to the hospital .
Researchers at Tufts Medical Center in Boston examined 5,887 emergency calls about suspected cardiac symptoms in Dallas County , Tex .
About half of the calls were made by women .
Ambulances arrived just as quickly for women as for men , the researchers found .
Patients of both sexes spent an average of 34 minutes in the care of emergency medical workers , including about 19.9 minutes of care on the scene and 10.3 minutes spent traveling to the hospital .
But 647 patients , about 11 percent , were delayed , spending 45 minutes or longer in the care of emergency workers .
[ Image : EDAW 's " If I could design London , I would ... just add water " ; view larger ! ] .
With salmon leaping from Sydenham to Southgate and from Hayes to Hackey , the capital 's rivers are now so clean that they are teeming with fish and anglers are feasting on London salmon for the first time in around 200 years .
This happy state of affairs stems from Project Salmon , a scheme launched in the run up to the 2012 Olympics to champion pioneering water - sensitive urban design , architecture and public realm design .
All 16 of the Thames tributaries have been brought to the surface once again .
Acting as the main arteries for a London - wide water - cleaning system , these waterways are now fed by rain and waste water which is naturally cleaned in a unique network of rain gardens , ornamental channels , reed beds and swales .
Project Salmon has also improved building standards : all new buildings now include innovative designs for green walls , living roofs and integrated sustainable drainage systems .
Many of London 's streets now incorporate new watercourses : in residential areas , these channels have become the focus for activities from canoeing to waterside promenading .
In Kentish Town the Fleet River has become London 's first floating market .
The impact this has had on London 's economy and status as a tourist destination is immense .
As many other UK and European cities are struggling to manage the annual temperature fluctuations , water shortage and flooding , Londoners have been sheltered from the worst effects of climate change .
The success of the scheme has inspired other UK and world cities to follow London 's example .
Having been interested in the riverine nature of London for years now – not many people realize that it's a city of canals – when I stumbled on a poster produced by EDAW for an exhibition last summer called " If I could design London I would ... , " I was excited enough to print it out and pin it up on my wall here at BLDGBLOG Centraal .
Now that I 'm moving apartments – again – and have been forced to take the poster down , I decided I should actually write something about it .
Using the trope of a fake newspaper article – supposedly published in the Evening Standard in the year 2041 A.D. – EDAW , a surprisingly interesting firm , I might add , write the following scenario .
I 'll quote the whole thing , in fact , as I do n't believe it 's been published elsewhere online , and it's an interesting example of fictional narrative put in the service of urban design :
The city 's buried waterways are returned to the service ; roads have becomes rivers ; polluted byways are retrofitted into fishing grounds ; former car parks find themselves walled off as reservoirs ; canals have been reclaimed by the boats of floating markets ; roundabouts are overgrown to form wetlands ; and green roofs overlook it all .
It 's idyllic , sure , but it 's no mere flight of fancy : the city is surely , over the course of coming centuries .
Like it or not , in less time than now exists between us and Shakespeare , our descendants will be living in a London underwater : architects and urban designers – and , for that matter , novelists – might as well start planning now .
EDAW 's project , and nearly two dozen others , can still be downloaded , a year after the fact , from Building Design
GOP leaders hoping for repeat of Bush v. Gore in Coleman case Rachel Oswald
Published : Tuesday March 17 , 2009
Print This Email This Anticipating a loss in Minnesota state court , the GOP is pinning its hopes to a federal court ruling in favor of Sen.
Norm Coleman 's challenge of Al Franken 's narrow vote lead by making the same case they did in 2000 with Bush vs. Gore .
Though a ruling is expected any day in the case and many signs point to a victory for Franken , who leads the recount with 225 votes , Senate Republicans are " encouraging Coleman to be as litigious as possible and take his fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if he loses this round , believing that an elongated court fight is worth it if they can continue to deny Democrats the 59th Senate seat that Franken would represent , " reported The Politico on Tuesday .
Republicans are hoping that their Supreme Court success in the 2000 Florida recount could be replicated in federal court by arguing that the different methods used for counting absentee ballots in Minnesota counties are in violation of the Constitution 's equal protection clause .
 The Supreme Court in 2000 said in Bush v. Gore that there is an equal protection element of making sure there is a uniform standard by which votes are counted or not counted , and I think that s a very serious concern in this instance ,  said Sen.
John Cornyn ( R - TX ) , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee to Politico .
 Im not making any predictions , but I wouldnt be surprised  if it ended up in federal court . "
The Franken camp on the other hand remains confident of victory .
" After seven weeks of trial , hundreds of witnesses , and thousands of exhibits , the trial demonstrated what the state canvassing board found to be true after an exhaustive recount : that Al Franken got more votes on Election Day than Norm Coleman ,  said Franken lawyer Marc Elias in a statement reported by The Hill on Monday .
Other top Republicans have also taken up the call for a federal court battle including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R- KY ) , Sen. Lindsay Graham ( R - SC ) and Jeff Sessions ( R - AL ) .
 The state court is not the final word on that , because the question in federal court is whether the guarantee of equal protection under laws in the U.S. Constitution has been violated by an inconsistent policy with regard to counting ballots ,  said Sessions to Politico .
Even if Franken is eventually seated , the tactic of dragging out the case through federal court over a period of months could delay Senate Democrats a crucial vote needed in favor of their card - check legislation , something Republicans are all to well aware of .
On the other hand , a costly legal battle will deprive Republicans of much needed campaign funds for 2010 when they are already feeling the affects of a down economy on their campaign coffers and the realities of their minority party status with its inherent fundraising lag from key lobbyist constituencies such as defense and finance .
Coleman campaign spokesman Tom Erickson told Politico that Coleman had raised nearly $ 25 million for the 2008 election .
Though the Supreme Court never intended their 2000 ruling in Bush v. Gore to become a legal precedent , The New York Times in December reported that the ruling has already been cited in multiple other election cases .
 Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances ,  the majority ruling in the case said , for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities . 
 You re starting to see courts invoke [ Bush v. Gore ] and you 're starting to see briefs cite it ,  said Samuel Issacharoff , a law professor at New York University to The Times .
 Bush v. Gore introduced an important idea .
It is that the political process has rules , the rules have to be fairly applied and that those rules need to be known up front . 
Bush v. Gore was at the center of a unanimous decision in November by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that allowed a comprehensive challenge to Ohio voting systems to move forward , reported The Times .
In their ruling , the judges acknowledged the Supreme Courts admonition about the limited precedential value of Bush v. Gore but said we find it relevant here . 
Correction :
This story has been updated to include a retraction by Politico on the amount of money the Coleman campaign has raised .
An earlier draft of this article attributed the $ 25 million figure to money raised since November .

Hmmm , " I'm a California doctor who must choose between her faith and her job . "
It boggles the mind how gay marriage can possibly force such a choice on this doctor .
Does she insist on throwing gay spouses out of the waiting room ?
" I 'm part of a New Jersey church group punished by the government because we can't support gay marriage . "
Um , the only " punishment " I can think of might be that they risk their tax exemption by illegally using their funds in support of political campaigns .
I 'm punished that way every time I pay taxes .
" I 'm a Massachusetts parent helplessly watching ... while schools teach my son that gay marriage is OK . "
Ah , here we begin to get to the heart of the matter .
If gay marriage is legal , how will bigot moms be able to spout bigotry about gay people without their children thinking " gee , Mom 's sure a bigot . "
I 'll bet that poor woman has already watched helplessly while schools have taught that black - people - sitting - at - the - front - of - the - bus is " OK . "
Life can sometimes be insufferable .

This is really a disgusting ad - though not surprising in the least .
It appeals to the lowest common denominator .
However , I do n't think it plays beyond its typical audience - the ignorant and intolerant - who always imagine that their holy way of life is being threatened .
I 'm not sure why they are so concerned .
After all , as long as they maintain their sin- free lives , they will be going to heaven while the sinners who are outlined in this ad will be frying in hell for eternity .
So , no worries .

Anyone else get ever get the feeling that the whole gay rights movement is allowed to happen because alot of wealthy and influential people have relatives that are gay ?
It sure is a great wedge issue that ultimately has no effect on how the money is divvied up .
I wonder what the statistics would be on heterosexuality and income / education level .
I 'd be willing to bet that homosexuality goes up with income and education level .

Update 6/12/09 : For more background regarding the Corporation ’s Inspector General Gerald Walpin ’s role in the Kevin Johnson controversy , check out this article in Youth Today .
Kevin Johnson , Sacramento ’s mayor , former Phoenix Suns point guard and former AmeriCorps program director , has settled with the Feds , clearing the way for Sacramento to receive stimulus funding .
Last fall , I wrote about Kevin Johnson ’s missteps as head of an AmeriCorps program in Sacramento .
The Corporation for National and Community Service ( CNCS ) accused him of wasting its money and directing corps members to do things clearly outside the bounds of AmeriCorps service .
The controversy did n’t end when he left his nonprofit St. HOPE Academy and its AmeriCorps program Hood Corps ; nor when he ran to become mayor of Sacramento ; nor when he took office as mayor .
In fact , his questionable role with the AmeriCorps program threatened to prevent the city of Sacramento from receiving stimulus funding !
Because the Corporation ( a federal organization ) had named him in the excluded parties system he was not allowed to receive federal contracts , subcontracts , funds , and even nonfinancial benefits .
Recently he and his former nonprofit St. HOPE Academy settled with the government .
They are responsible for repaying about half of the $ 848,000 in AmeriCorps funding that they had received between 2004 and 2007 .
According to the San Francisco Chronicle , “ Johnson agreed to pay $ 73,836 owed by St. HOPE , although he eventually might be repaid by the organization .
St. HOPE Executive Director Dana Gonzalez agreed to pay another $ 1,000 .
St. HOPE will pay the remaining $ 350,000 over 10 years . ”
The settlement does n’t force anyone to acknowledge misuse of AmeriCorps money , but it does take his name out of the excluded parties system .
( I just did a search of his name and did n’t find it listed . )
That clears the way for people in Sacramento to get stimulus funding .

“ Why privatize ?
We can run it better ! ”
That ’s the question United Electrical Workers Local 274 and the Office and Professional Employees ( OPEIU ) asked when their wastewater treatment plant was threatened with privatization .
The city council — called a Selectboard — in Montague , Massachusetts , a town of 8,500 in the western part of the state , was concerned about the treatment plant because it had lost a large industrial customer .
But the Selectboard never thought to ask the people who worked there what to do .
Instead , it solicited bids to privatize the plant in hopes of saving the town money .
Soon four companies had handed in proposals , most of which promised big savings .
Because of intense pressure from union members , none of the proposals called for layoffs or wage cuts ( except , perhaps , cuts in management ) .
Montague has an unusual governance structure that allows for ample public input .
Five elected Selectboard members meet weekly , and the town budget is voted on at representative town meetings of 150 people elected from precincts .
The unions knew they had to take their case to the public .
PACK THE HOUSE
The Selectboard held public hearings on the proposal to privatize , and these hearings were broadcast live on the local cable TV station .
Union members made sure they packed the audience to hear the companies present their proposals on how they would run the facility .
But the companies never discussed how they would be paid .
When the time came for questions , the unions immediately asked , “ How much are you going to make for running the facility ? ”
After much beating around the bush , the largest company answered that it would receive 10 percent of the operating budget as its “ fee . ”
Union members in the audience pointed out that this gave the companies the incentive to increase the budget instead of cutting costs .
Many of the Selectboard members thought that if the facility was privatized the company would assume all costs .
Under intense questioning by the union , the companies admitted that the town would pay for repairs and replacement parts , such as generators and pumps .
This was the moment the unions were waiting for .
They asked for time to create a proposal for more efficient ways to run the plant .
The bosses , who had assured the Selectboard they had done everything possible to cut costs , were outraged .
SUPPORT LABOR NOTES BECOME A MONTHLY DONOR Give $ 10 a month or more and get our " Fight the Boss , Build the Union " T - shirt .
The fight against privatization must be made public and held in public — people support public facilities that they think are well - run .
The Selectboard agreed , their faith in privatization shaken by the disclosures of how the privatizers made their money , and by the looming costs for repairs .
THE UNION PLAN
For the next several weeks , the union members worked on their proposal .
The only guideline : no wage , benefit , or job cuts .
The workers voted to exclude management from the planning sessions because the plant manager was the person who had first proposed privatization .
Both UE members ( who operated the plant ) and OPEIU members ( who handled the clerical work and laboratory testing ) participated .
Many of the proposals were ideas they had pushed management to try for many years .
Workers made lists of their ideas , hashed through them in meetings , and threw away plenty .
The clerical workers wrote up the winning ideas in easy - to - understand language for the Selectboard and the public , who did n’t understand how the facility actually worked .
The result was a detailed report calling for higher usage and earnings by processing waste from other communities , and process and machine changes that would cut costs for maintenance , electricity , and chemicals .
For example , the privatizers claimed that since they were large corporations , they could buy chemicals in large quantities , and therefore more cheaply .
Union members countered that Montague could join an existing consortium of small towns that bought chemicals together — and save thousands of dollars .
The workers ’ plan was challenged , of course , by the privatizers at another televised hearing .
The evidence , however , was overwhelming that union members had developed a cost - saving plan that did not involve wage or job cuts and that kept the facility on a non -profit basis .
In the end , one Selectman ’s plea that “ everyone knows big business runs things better ” was greeted with chuckles , mockery , and a vote to keep the plant public .
SOME LESSONS LEARNED
The fight against privatization must be made public and held in public — people support public facilities that they think are well - run .
They do n’t like overpaid bureaucrats and waste .
Turn the focus back on management .
Talk about eliminating or trimming executive salaries .
Develop a union proposal on how money can be saved and efficiency improved without cutting jobs or pay .
In Montague , workers consulted everyone from the electric company to the federal government and got useful advice .
Look to the community .
Churches and activists can turn out valuable help .
Emphasize that privatizing a public service means adding a new and unacceptable cost : profit .

Question for you : which of these two images shows dots that are placed at random , and which does not ?
The problem with questions like this is that you already know it 's the one on the left that 's random , and the one on the right is n't , since you know I 'm trying to trick you .
But what 's going on ?
Our brains love to find patterns in random noise .
Look at the clumping of the dots on the left ; surely that 's not random ?
But it is .
The distance between dots will average out to some number , but statistically you expect there to be some deviation from that average , so that some dots will be closer together ( making clumps ) and some farther apart ( making voids ) .
That 's what 's happening on the left .
On the right , the random pattern that was generated was modified so that the dots would not be too close together .
If a dot 's position was found to be too close to another , its position was redone until it was a minimum distance from all other dots .
What 's left is a pattern that we think looks more random , but is in fact highly non-random .
A more detailed explanation of these images is at the blog
In The Dark , and he uses it to talk about galaxy distributions .
However , it also tells us a lot about our brains .
We are instinctively lousy at statistics .
Another great example is this one : imagine you flip a coin ten times , and you keep track .
Which of these sequences is more likely ?
HHHHHTTTTT or TTHHTHHTTH
The answer is they are both exactly as likely .
You have a 50/50 shot at a heads or tails on each throw , so any 10 - throw sequence is just as likely as any other !
But we look at the second sequence and see no information in it .
We assume it 's just random , and therefore more likely than a sequence where we perceive there is information , like five heads in a row followed by five tails .
But each is just as likely .
We view the entire Universe through our senses , and the data are processed by our brains .
This gloppy computer is highly sophisticated , but also highly unreliable to give us unbiased information .
We see patterns where they do n't exist , we see cause where they may be none , and we see intent where there may be randomness .
That 's why pareidolia -- seeing faces or other familiar objects in random patterns like oil stains , wood grain , and the odd piece of bark of pastry item -- cracks me up .
The brain of a human will interpret that pattern into something familiar , and if that person is religious , they see a religious icon .
But they do n't seem to hang the same connotation on seeing Abe Vigoda in a nebula and Lenin in a shower curtain , or Ben Grimm in a supernova , or any of a hundred examples I can find easily .
You can be fooled .
Remember that , always .
It pertains to a lot in life , and a lot in the life of an active skeptic .
Fooling people is easy .
Getting them to see ?
That 's what 's hard .
Tell you what ...

North Korea 's neighbours have strongly condemned the rocket launch
North Korea has defied international warnings and gone ahead with a controversial rocket launch .
State media said a satellite had been put into orbit and was transmitting data and revolutionary songs .
But there has been no independent confirmation so far .
The US , Japan and South Korea suspect the launch was a cover for a long - range missile test .
They strongly condemned the launch .
The US president told Pyongyang to " refrain from further provocative actions " .
" This provocation underscores the need for action - not just this afternoon at the UN Security Council , but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Japan called the move " extremely regrettable " , while South Korea said it constituted a clear breach of a United Nations resolution .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said North Korea 's actions were not conducive to regional stability , as did the European Union .
China and Russia both called on all sides to act with restraint , while the UK urged North Korea to immediately halt all missile - related activity .
The UN Security Council has approved a Japanese request for an emergency session .
Washington , Tokyo and Seoul regard the launch as a clear violation of Security Council resolution 1718 adopted in October 2006 , which bans North Korea from carrying out ballistic missile activity .
No intercept
North Korea announced several weeks ago that it planned to send what it called an " experimental communications satellite " into space from the Musudan - ri launch site in the north - east .
The three - stage rocket blasted off just before midday local time , within a pre-announced launch window .
It flew over Japan towards the Pacific , with two booster stages dropping into the ocean to the east and west of Japan , Tokyo said .
Japan said it had not tried to intercept the rocket .
It had indicated it would do so if the rocket threatened its territory .
North Korea says the launch is part of what it calls peaceful space development .
" Our scientists and engineers have succeeded in sending satellite ' Kwangmyongsong - 2 ' into orbit by way of carrier rocket ' Unha - 2 ' , " state news agency KCNA reported .
It added that it was transmitting data and the " Song of General Kim Il - sung " and " Song of General Kim Jong - il " - references to the late founder of North Korea and his son , the current leader .
In a previous satellite launch attempt in 1998 , North Korea said it was sending up a device that would orbit the world transmitting revolutionary melodies .
It claimed this was also successful but the launch is believed to have been a failure as no trace of the satellite was ever found .
Earlier on Sunday , an unidentified South Korean official told Yonhap news agency that the rocket did appear to be carrying a satellite .
If confirmed , North Korea will see this as a major propaganda victory , says the BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul .
A White House spokesman said there would be an assessment by defence and intelligence officials later in the day .
US within range ?
But of more concern to Pyongyang 's neighbours is the potential military use of the launch vehicle , our correspondent says .
They believe the real aim of the launch was to test long - range missile technology ; specifically the Taepodong - 2 .
They believe it could put parts of the US within the communist nation 's military reach .
North Korea first tested a Taepodong - 2 in July 2006 .
It failed less than a minute after lift - off .
Three months later , Pyongyang carried out a nuclear test .
International talks involving the US , South Korea , Japan , Russia and China on an aid - for - nuclear disarmament deal are currently stalled .
With all the talk lately about midgets , dwarfs , and little people , I figured I might as well fill folks in on the tallest ladies and gents roaming the globe .
Now , for the purposes of this list I chose people who are all currently alive , so please do n’t write in bitching about my not including Andre the Giant or some other deceased tall person :
Andre the Giant has shuffled off this mortal coil , so leave it alone .
Anyway ,
Here are a bunch of the tallest currently breathing people found around the world .
Sudan Tribes of Africa – Tallest Race
In the case of some Sudanese tribes , males can have an average height of 6 foot , 4 inches , while women of 6 foot .
These people have slim but strong bodies , and their heads are more elongated than in the case of the typical African Blacks .
In case of a mixed race , these huge heights may not be generally attained by the population .
Tallest Man in the World 2009 , Guinness - Leonid Stadnyk – 8 ′ 4 Tallest in World .
Tallest Woman in the World 2009 – Yao Defen – Claimant as tallest living female at 7’9 ″
Tallest American 2009 - George Bell – Tallest living American at 7’8 ″
Tied for Tallest NBA Player ( non active ) – Manute Bol – Tied for tallest in NBA history at 7’7 ″
Gheorghe Muresan – Tied for tallest in NBA history at 7’7 ″
Tallest Active NBA Player – Yao Ming – Yao is currently the tallest player in the NBA at 7’6 ″
Tallest Active WNBA Player – Małgorzeta ( Margo ) Dydek – 7’2 ”
Tallest Wrestler ( retired ) – Jorge ( El Gigante , Giant Gonzales ) Gonzales – 7 ’6 ”

According to an article on GovernmentExecutive.com , an announcement regarding appointment of an Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property ( a.k.a. , Director of the USPTO ) could come within the next week or two .
This news of a new leader on the horizon seems to be quite pleasing to Robert Budens , the President of the Patent Office Professional Association , which is an independent union of professional employees formed in 1964 to represent the interests of examiners , classifiers , computer scientists , and other patent professionals who work at the United States Patent and Trademark Office .
According to the GovExec article Budens says : “ We need a new director just as soon as we can get one . ”
I know a lot of people in the patent industry outside the Patent Office feel that same way .
But who will the new leader be ?
Among the names being suggested as possibly in contention are Q. Todd Dickinson , who ran the office under former President Bill Clinton and is presently the Executive Director of the American Intellectual Property Law Association ; ( 2 ) James Pooley , a partner and litigator in the Palo Alto office of Morrison Foerster ; and ( 3 ) IBM Vice President David Kappos .
Whoever the new leader is there will be plenty of issues that need to be addressed .
Perhaps one of the most important issues , even ahead of the backlog , is that the Patent Office IT systems are pitifully inadequate .
According to Budens , some within the Patent Office are concerned that the USPTO computer network is “ hanging on by bubble gum and bailing wire . ”
How can that be possible ?
We all know it to be true , but how can it be possible that the repository of all scientific information in our society has an IT system that has not been updated in a decade ?
Only recently did the Patent Office become paperless in any real sense of that word .
Up until recently an application filed using the Electronic File System ( EFS ) would be printed and then scanned back into electronic format .
This means that the USPTO idea of a paperless electronic system was to print electronic filings , scan them and then destroy the printed copy .
Obviously paperless filing is not intended to save trees .
But how could anyone in their right mind call this a paperless system ?
The reality is that the front end EFS system was not compatible with the back end file maintenance systems .
And to think that USPTO management actually had the nerve to force rejection after rejection of real inventions .
Like they would know a real invention if they saw one !
They did n’t even know the meaning of paperless , or have the ability to create an interface that could electronically feed the back - end system .
With the internal operations of the Patent Office being so terrible , with problems stretching from human resource issues to IT systems , one might suspect that David Kappos should be in the lead for consideration of the top job at the USPTO .
I do not know the man personally , but on behalf of IBM he has been taking some positions that are not necessarily what the majority of stakeholders would like , although he will undoubtedly make the high - tech community happy .
Given that the high - tech computer industry is probably feeling beat up on regarding changes to the Senate version of the patent reform legislation being considered , I wonder if this further elevates his candidacy .
In addition to supporting enhanced post grant review , Kappos also supported damages provisions that would have caused real and substantial injury to manufacturing , start - up technologies , pharma , independent inventors and the green innovation industry .
In testimony given by Kappos to the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 10 , 2009 , he explained :
Patent litigation has increased significantly for more than a decade , in part driven by low patent quality that creates uncertainty around intellectual property rights , spawning increased speculation .
This excessive litigation threatens to sap America ’s innovative capacity and its ability to compete in the world if left unaddressed .
He went on to say :
This high level of patent litigation , particularly in the IT industry , shows that valuation issues are not being resolved in negotiation .
IBM believes that this indicates both that patents of uncertain scope and validity are being enforced , and reasonable royalty damages determinations are not providing the needed guidance for the IP licensing market .
This sounds good , but it is simply not true .
Yes , there has been a dramatic increase in the number of patent lawsuits filed since 1980 , with an upward trend really being most noticeable since about 1992 , but the number of cases that reach trial has remained the same since 1980 .
So regardless of the number of patent litigations filed there are plus or minus 100 cases that reach trial every year .
That was true when there were just over 800 patent litigations commenced in 1980 , and it was true last year when there were over 3,000 patent litigations commenced .
If you doubt this truth , just take a look at the following charts .
As you can see , the number of patent cases terminated during or after trial has largely remained constant .
This is even more clearly demonstrated on the chart below .
The largest growth seen is with those cases terminated with at least some court action being required , but before pretrial hearings .
Also increased is the number of cases that are terminated without any court action .
So the truth is that despite what Mr. Kappos or IBM thinks , patent litigations are settled through negotiated resolution in the overwhelming number of cases .
In fact , since 2000 , more than 96 % of patent litigations were terminated without requiring a single day of a trial .
See chart below .
So it is factually incorrect to say that patent disputes and valuation issues are not resolved through negotiation .
Overwhelmingly patent disputes are settled through negotiations , many after filing lawsuits and before the court has taken a single action , as evidenced by the Microsoft v. TomTom matter recently .
When parties sue it is almost always to cause the dispute to come to a head , which is exactly what will happen with AOL ’s recent lawsuit against Yahoo .
The fact that litigation creates leverage and urgency does not mean that patent litigation is out of control .
It does not mean that negotiations are useless .
It means we have a robust and functioning system that allows the overwhelming majority of plaintiffs and defendants to resolve issues in an orderly manner .
What exactly is wrong with that ?
Writing on O'Reilly Radar , preeminent legal scholar Pamela Samuelson cuts through the distractions associated with the Google Book Search / Authors Guild settlement and goes right to the heart of the matter : Google , in acceding to the Authors Guild 's requests , have attained a legal near - monopoly on searching and distributing the majority of books ever published .
The Authors Guild — which represents a measly 8000 writers — brought a class action against Google on behalf of all literary copyright holders , even the authors of the millions of " orphan works " whose rightsholders can't be located .
Once that class was certified , whatever deal Google struck with the class became binding on every work of literature ever produced .
The odds are that this feat wo n't ever be repeated , which means that Google is the only company in the world that will have a clean , legal way of offering all these books in search results .
The Authors Guild and the American Association of Publishers ( who took part in the settlement ) totally missed the real risk of Google Book Search : they were worried about some notional income from advertising that they might miss out on .
But the real risk is that Google could end up as the sole source of ultimate power in book discovery , distribution and sales .
As the only legal place where all books can be searched , Google gets enormous market power : the structure of their search algorithm can make bestsellers or banish books to obscurity .
The leverage they attain over publishing and authors through this settlement is incalculable .
I like Google .
I worry about the privacy implications of some of their technology , and I wish they had more spine when it came to censoring search results in China , but I think they make incredibly awesome search tools and every person I know who works at Google is a class - A mensch and a certified smart person ( a rare combination ) .
But no one , not Google , not Santa Claus , should have this kind of leverage over the entire world of literature .
It 's abominable .
No one benefits when markets consolidate into a single monopoly gatekeeper — not even the gatekeeper , who is apt to lose its edge without competition to keep it sharp .
The publishers I spoke to about this were incredibly smug about it .
Because the settlement gives them the power to keep new releases out of Google , they feel like they can use this to keep the company honest .
This is wrong .
New releases are the majority of the publishers ' business , but they 're not the majority of the market for books — and they 're only successful because of all the context created by the entire history of literature .
If the publishers offer a sweetheart deal on searching new results to Yahoo , but can't give Yahoo access to the orphan works and other catalog items to which Google alone has easy legal access , Yahoo's search tool will never compete with Google's .
To understand why , imagine if Yahoo tried to compete with Google by offering a search engine that only indexed the last 30 days ' worth of web - pages : it 's true that most of the stuff I read on the web was written in the past 30 days , but the 40 - 50 % of stuff I that was n't is often enormously important to me .
In that world , I would have to flick constantly between searching Yahoo and Google to make sure I was n't missing stuff — and very quickly , I 'd just default to Google .
By design or by accident , Google got the most reactionary elements in publishing to anoint Google the Eternal God-Emperor of Literature .
Thanks a lot , Authors Guild — with friends like you , who needs piracy ?
The proposed settlement agreement would give Google a monopoly on the largest digital library of books in the world .
It and BRR , which will also be a monopoly , will have considerable freedom to set prices and terms and conditions for Book Search 's commercial services .
BRR is unlikely to complain that the price is too high , the digital rights management technology is too restrictive , or the terms are too onerous .
Google will also be the only service lawfully able to sell orphan books and monetize them through subscriptions .
BRR will get 63 per cent of these revenues which it will pay out to authors and publishers registered with it , even as to books in which they hold no rights .
( Some unclaimed orphan book funds may go to charities that promote literacy . )
No author whose books are in the corpus can get paid by the BRR unless he / she has registered with it .
Virtually the only way that Amazon.com , Microsoft , Yahoo ! , or the Open Content Alliance could get a comparably broad license as the settlement would give Google would be by starting its own project to scan books .
The scanner might then be sued for copyright infringement , as Google was .
It would be very costly and very risky to litigate a fair use claim to final judgment given how high copyright damages can be ( up to $ 150,000 per infringed work ) .
Chances are also slim that the plaintiffs in such a lawsuit would be willing or able to settle on equivalent or even similar terms .
Legally Speaking : The Dead Souls of the Google Booksearch Settlement
Central questions these days are how severe will the U.S. economic downturn be and how long will it last ?
The most serious concern is that the downturn will become something worse than the largest recession of the post - World War II period -- 1982 , when real per capita GDP fell by 3 % and the unemployment rate peaked at nearly 11 % .
Could we even experience a depression ( defined as a decline in per-person GDP or consumption by 10 % or more ) ?

Fistfight at the Coulter / Maher Speaker Series !
What happens when the country 's most litigious conservative butts political heads with the man who champions pot and prostitution more fervently than a horny frat boy on 4/20 ?
A fistfight in the audience of Boston 's theatrical mastodon , The Wang Theatre .
Ann Coulter and Bill Maher came to town last night to inaugurate the theater 's 2009 " Speaker Series : The Minds That Move The World , ” each flapping their caricatured cake - holes about America 's political landscape before engaging in a yawn - fest " debate " that was marred by technical snafus ; an awkward , ill - informed moderator ; and - what proved to be the most exciting element of the evening - some crazy - ass heckling , courtesy of drunk dipshits .
Considering that Coulter spits venom at liberals and that Maher wants to skull - fuck every Republican that crosses his path , one would have expected a balls - out catfight to break out on stage .
Instead , Maher and Coulter took predictable potshots at politicians ( Coulter facetiously compared Obama to Jesus !
Maher thinks Rush Limbaugh is fat and ineffective !
Insert canned laughs here ! ) and each other , and let the audience do the brawling .
It started innocently enough ; Maher was in the middle of a long and comedically tired set - up about how Sarah Palin is an Avon lady , and a man in the back of the house screamed something about the " liberal Gestapo , " a bizarre choice of insult , given that nobody ever accused Hilter of being a bleeding - heart progressive .
The rest of the drunk conservatives in the audience took this as an invitation to scream at Maher whenever they felt so moved , perhaps forgetting that they were watching an informed political event in the theater district , and not a Larry the Cable Guy set at the Chuckle Hut .
What really set it off , though , was when Coulter 's lavaliere microphone stopped working .
The sound was shitty to begin with , and the set - a few leather armchairs and a giant bouquet of flowers - looked like it'd been airlifted directly off the set of an Oprah spin - off show .
( Really , the Wang has absolutely no business hosting a speaker 's series , given last night 's awkward staging , shoddy production value , and the audio staff 's apparent inability to rectify simple sound issues .
I digress . )
A man , who'd been previously yelling something unintelligible about Maher and his liberal agenda , started screaming , at Coulter , about how he could n't hear her .
He screamed again and again , until a woman sitting in front of him asked if he 'd please quiet down .
" Fuck you , bitch ! " he bellowed .
" I paid $ 120 for these motherfucking tickets and I can't hear a fucking thing ! "
The octogenarian ushers at the Wang could n't shuffle over there fast enough , so another man stood to defend this woman 's honor .
Nothing doing !
" Motherfucker , I will fuck you up ! " screamed the heckler , inciting chest puffing , fist clenching , and scuffling .
Our poor theater critic Carolyn Clay was sitting right next to the fracas , bless her heart , and to her credit , she ignored the meatheads and kept watching the stage like the diligent arts pundit that she is .
Hoo boy !
Finally , security arrived to escort Drunky McGoo out .
Probably a first for the Wang .
I doubt anyone 's ever had to be thrown out of , say , Cats , for being unruly .
As he made his way out he screamed , " I was in Baghdad for three years !
Iraqi freedom NEVER ! "
While your service to your country is appreciated , sir , it does NOT give you the right to be a spectacular asshole .
Sadly , this debacle was the highlight of the evening .
No matter how inflated Maher 's ranting , how nonsensical Coulter 's analogies , they both lost the debate .
To the audience .
Score one for the liberal Gestapo and the conservative buffoons !
MOUNT PLEASANT , S.C. 
Boat owners are abandoning ship .
They often sandpaper over the names and file off the registry numbers , doing their best to render the boats , and themselves , untraceable .
Then they casually ditch the vessels in the middle of busy harbors , beach them at low tide on the banks of creeks or occasionally scuttle them outright .
The bad economy is creating a flotilla of forsaken boats .
While there is no national census of abandoned boats , officials in coastal states are worried the problem will only grow worse as unemployment and financial stress continue to rise .
Several states are even drafting laws against derelicts and say they are aggressively starting to pursue delinquent owners .
“ Our waters have become dumping grounds , ” said Maj .
Paul R. Ouellette of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission .
“ It ’s got to the point where something has to be done . ”
Derelict boats are environmental and navigational hazards , leaking toxins and posing obstacles for other craft , especially at night .
Thieves plunder them for scrap metal .
In a storm , these runabouts and sailboats , cruisers and houseboats can break free or break up , causing havoc .

We are the darkness , and as the sun sinks in a bloody streak to the crux where the land rises up to touch the bottom of the sky , we ride .
Like razors cast from liquid steel , our wings flex against wind and our engines cry out with the roar and the fire of a thousand ravening furies .
Alive , we tear a streak across the sky that divides the heavens into darkness and light .
We are the .
We carve our names in the bosom of the night with knives and nails of light and liquid fire .
Headfirst , we plunge into the darkening clouds .
andprowl close at my sides , andburn rigid at my flanks , and thedominates the sky high above .
shudders around and beneath me on the prismatic wake of wave cascades that flay themselves in their vain attempts to rip us out of the sky .
With electronic clarity , we pick out our targets one by one , dozens flagged in the darkness within fractions of a second .
The machine grows tense around me , around each of us .
The unspoken command bounces between neuron and steel , reverberates through mind , machine , blossoms clear in the fleshy centers of us all .
Reflexively , we loose our payload , and in the sudden storm of angry warheads , there is a scream ; the sound of death ’s own seraphim ripping from our wings like the hunting fingers of skeletal banshees .
Plumes of fire and white fly from vectored thrusters , and for a moment the night is endless cloud and billowing ash , a fimbulvinter of burnt fuel and tortured sky .
We lose ourselves in the moment , watching scopes and feeling the feedback as the machine reaches into our minds to show us what we ’ve come to see , images that burn on wires and leads into and through the inner bodies of meat and bone that crouch within an exoskeleton of windborne steel .
In the distance , the lines and jutting teeth of our targets burn brightly , reduced to rubble so suddenly , so precisely , that the streets below have yet to be scorched .
In the darkness , thespeaks , and we obey the call , folding ourselves into the night like ghosts .
There will be nothing to betray us when the sun rises– only the testament to our wrath will remain .

Here 's some tips on cutting insurance costs .
Russ Rader , spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says that small fast cars carry higher insurance premiums so the number on tip is to stay away from those types of vehicles .
Â
If a certain car general poses a high dollar loss to an insurance company your premium is going to be higher .
Â Â Data shows that smaller cars are not always safer .
Â
People who feel they can zip in and out of traffic tend to have more accidents .
Rader says , that smaller , sportier cars tend to be driven dangerously and also by younger drivers .
Â
These types of cars are generally more affordable and therefore more appealing to young drivers .
Â
Some of the cars on the most expensive to drive list such as he Subaru Impreza WRX , the Mitsubishi Lancer , the Acura RSX , the Nissan Sentra SE - R , have the highest rate of collision .
Â A Scion tC is also on the most expensive to insure list and the demographics show that 35 % of it 's drivers are under 25 .
Topping of the list at most expensive to insure is the Escalade by Cadillac .
Â
It may seem strange to have such a high end car on the list , but this car is stolen a lot .
Â
In fact the premium for this car can be 6 times that of the national average .
Â
So stay away from these cars , they cost you in insurance .
10 most expensive cars to insure
Cadillac Escalade EXT 4WD Subaru Impreza WRX 4WD Hyundai Tiburon Mitsubishi Lancer Scion tC Acura RSX Nissan Sentra SE - R Suzuki Forenza Nissan Sentra / Mitsubishi Eclipse Chevrolet Cobalt two - door
Want to keep your insurance costs low ?
Â
Rader says that sedans , midsize SUVs , and minivans are the way to go .
Â
These cars tend to be driven by people that are less likely to speed or drive recklessly .
These types of cars also tend to be driven less during rush hour traffic , which lowers the risk .
The ( Buick ) Rendezvous , the ( Subaru ) Outback , the ( Honda ) Pilot , the Chrysler Town & Country are all on the list of least expensive to ensure .
Â
These cars are thought of as soccer mom cars .
Â
None of these cars are very large or small , just a descent sized car .
Â
As the size of an SUV goes up so does the insurance .
The Ford Taurus was found to be the least expensive car to ensure .
If you want a low insurance premium look at these cars .
10 least expensive cars to insure
Ford Five Hundred 4WD ( now the Ford Taurus ) Buick Rendezvous 4WD Buick Lucerne / Buick Rainier 4WD / Honda Odyssey Ford Freestyle 4WD / Subaru Outback 4WD Buick Rendezvous / Honda Pilot Chrysler Town & Country LWB Honda Pilot 4WD Buick LaCrosse / Chevrolet Uplander / Ford Escape / Volvo V70 Dodge Grand Caravan / Ford Freestyle 4WD Ford Explorer 4WD / GMC Sierra 1500 4WD / Toyota Highlander / Toyota Sienna
There are exceptions to the rules .
Â
Bigger is n't always better .
Â
In an average collision it will cost about $ 3000 to fix each car .
Â
However the bigger the car the more expensive it is to fix .
These 5 cars show the highest repair costs .
Hummer H2 SUT 4dr 4WD Hummer H3 4dr 4WD Hummer H2 4dr 4WD Dodge Ram 2500 mega cab 4WD Toyota Highlander Hybrid 4dr
So to keep premiums down always talk to your insurance agent about premiums before buying a vehicle .
Â
You 'll need to do some research and ask a lot of questions because even a different model of the same car can have a higher premium .
Â
Also remember that the higher the cost of a car the higher the insurance premium will be .
Â
Checking a cars score in all categories can help you make a decision .
Â
The premium will also be effected by the person driving the car .
You can compareÂ insurance policies and quotes at Insurance.com and you can also see how vehicles rate by visiting iihs.org .

Jerusalem � Ma�an � Dozens of Israeli settlers backed by police took over a Palestinian house in the Old City of Jerusalem on Thursday morning .
Ma�an�s correspondent observed settlers raiding the house of Naser Jaber , in the As - Sa�diyeh neighborhood of the Old City .
A scuffle took place between the owner and the settlers before police intervened , allowing the settlers to take control of the house and sending the owner away .
Israeli police then imposed a neighborhood lockdown , prohibiting residents from entering or leaving their homes .
Several youth were seized during ensuing clashes in the tense half hour between the arrival of the settlers and the total closure of the area .
Jaber went immediately to the court to put forward his case , saying he was going to demand the removal of the settlers from his residence , which is home to eight .
Jaber noted that the small area of the Old City is home to seven other families and said there had been a repeated settler presence in the area over the past months .
Also on Thursday the the Israeli - controlled Jerusalem Municipality demolished a shop near the Shmidt School , on Nablus road , just outside of the Old City .
The municipality claimed that the shop was built without permits .
Separately , personnel from the Jerusalem Municipality went to the Jerusalem - area village of Al - Issawiya , and handed out several demolition warnings .
The men surveyed the area in preparation for the demolitions .

Being an animation fan from time - to - time I ’ll see an ad for a “ serigraph cel ” from a favorite animated film or TV show .
As most fans of animation know old school cartoons were made with hand painted animation cels — which is a piece of acetate inked on one side and with the color painted on the opposite side .
These animation cels are always punched so they can be registered , and it takes a mind numbing number of these to make an animated film which is shot at 24 frames per second ( although most animation is done by limiting this 12 cels per second or less which is known as “ shooting in twos ” ) .
Sadly collecting animation art did n’t catch on until 80s , and most animation studios viewed the cels as useless .
In some cases animators who worked on the film would rescue something here or there , but in the early days cels were even washed in an acid bath and reused .
So with a hunger in modern times for studios to cash in on older animation merchandising companies commission what are known as “ serigraph cels ” .
These are n’t animation cels that were ever used in the production at all !
In fact they can be produced years after everyone who worked on the film is dead and gone .
They ’re either copies of existing cels or in a worse case scenario something that is cooked up from scratch .
But I ’m afraid it ’s worse than even that — most serigraphs are n’t even hand painted like real animation cels , instead the paint is silkscreened on like a t - shirt .
So instead of owning a piece of animation history — what you are in fact owning is just a pretty print .
Now these still are n’t cheap to create and because they appeal to a niche audience these faux animations cels are often produced in limited number editions .
Now as a tchotchke ( a Yiddish for trinket ) these items may have some sort of value to collectors — but they should n’t be mistaken as actual artwork or something directly connected with the production of the film .
You should think of them as being no different than a poster or a t - shirt .
Now if you love a animated film or TV show and you ’re looking for some decoration by all means purchase a serigraph cel — but do n’t make the mistake of feeling that you own a part of the show .

Advertisement Tributes have been paid to writer and broadcaster Sir Clement Freud , who has died at his London home nine days short of his 85th birthday .
Stephen Fry , who starred alongside Sir Clement on Radio 4's comedy game show Just A Minute , described him as an " immensely generous and charming man " .
The former Liberal MP is survived by his wife , the actress Jill Freud , five children and 17 grandchildren .
Sir Clement 's funeral will take place in London next Friday .
A grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud , Sir Clement had a varied career as a cookery expert , press columnist and radio game show contestant .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme Renowned for his lugubrious expression and mournful voice , he was a regular panellist on the BBC's Just a Minute for more than 30 years .
Comedian Tony
Hawks , another regular on the long - running Radio 4 show , remembered him being a " formidable " character .
" I had listened to the show as a boy , so meeting him was like meeting a hero , " he told BBC Breakfast .
" You always knew he would be a challenging performer .
Through his great intellect he 'd always bring out the best in you . "
Writer and broadcaster Stephen Fry has also paid tribute , remembering Sir Clement as an " immensely generous , benevolent and charming man " .
" My favourite memory is of him in full flow on Just a Minute , still able to trip up people a quarter of his age , " he told Radio 4 's Today programme .
Idiosyncratic Born in 1924 , the young Clement Freud began his career in the hotel business before turning to journalism .
Sir Clement was elected the rector of St Andrews University in 2002
He started writing on cookery for newspapers and magazines in the 1950s , later expanding into a variety of subjects , including sport .
His idiosyncratic pet food commercials with Henry the dog , first broadcast in the 1960s , launched him on a long career as a television and radio personality .
His political career began in 1973 , when - against the odds - he won the Isle of Ely constituency for the Liberal Party .
Ten years later he transferred to North East Cambridgeshire , a seat he held until 1987 .
He was knighted the same year .
Sir Clement worked for a string of titles , including the Observer , the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Express .
Last year he wrote about his death in The Times , claiming his relatives would want to inherit his wine .
HAVE YOUR SAY
A gentleman of incredible intellect and wonderful dry wit Colin W , Plymouth " I took my children around our flat in turns to glean who wanted to have what when we died , " he wrote .
" They all wanted all the wine , my wife 's desk , my collection of cookery books and the same picture , so that will be no trouble . "
Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg also paid tribute saying : " Clement Freud was part of a generation of larger than life figures who kept the Liberal Party alive through thick and thin .
" It is astonishing to remember all the things he did , all the things he was - wit , raconteur , politician , chef , advertiser of dog food , writer , comedian , a devoted father , husband and grandfather and someone who could never resist a flutter .
" They do n't make people like that anymore and he will be sorely missed by millions , " he added .

Proponents of the nationalization of troubled big banking companies like Citigroup generally make the case that the work should be done with dispatch and the banks returned promptly to private hands .
But the test case for nationalization , AIG , is demonstrating that it may not be that easy .
When the Federal Reserve effectively took over AIG in mid-September , fearful after the fall of Lehman Brothers of letting a firm even more central to global financial markets go belly up , the plan was for a quick turnaround :
The government loaned AIG $ 85 billion on pretty tough terms , installed new management , and ordered the firm to start selling off its still - profitable insurance subsidiaries pronto to pay off the debt .
But in the middle of a global financial crisis there are n’t a lot of people who can afford to ( or want ) buy insurance companies .
So in November the terms were relaxed and the bailout grew to $ 150 billion , and now they ’re easing yet again and the government is pumping in another $ 30 billion .
As Carol Loomis put it in an illuminating explanation of AIG ’s predicament that ran in Fortune in December :
The ties that bind these two parties … bring to mind the 1942 movie classic “ The Man Who Came to Dinner , ” in which Monty Woolley , playing the insufferable Sheridan Whiteside , arrives to dine , injures his hip on the front steps , and stays on for the duration , driving his hosts batty .
In today ’s reality show , AIG is The Company That Came to Dinner , and the trapped , restless host is the government .
Do n’t ask when these two will be parting ways , because there ’s no date set .
Why are we doing this for AIG ?
There is perhaps no financial company less deserving , in moral terms , of taxpayer aid .
This is from Joe Nocera ’s column in Saturday ’s New York Times :
When you start asking around about how A.I.G. made money during the housing bubble , you hear the same two phrases again and again : “ regulatory arbitrage ” and “ ratings arbitrage . ”
The word “ arbitrage ” usually means taking advantage of a price differential between two securities — a bond and stock of the same company , for instance — that are related in some way .
When the word is used to describe A.I.G. ’s actions , however , it means something entirely different .
It means taking advantage of a loophole in the rules .
A less polite but perhaps more accurate term would be “ scam . ”
Essentially , AIG got into the business of insuring much of the world ’s financial system against the consequences of a global financial meltdown .
It turned out to be incapable of delivering on that insurance — no private company could deliver on it , which is one reason why AIG ’s business of selling credit default swaps was a scam .
And so government has stepped in as the ultimate insurer .
Providing insurance where private institutions can’t is one of the most important and essential roles of government .
Washington ’s failure to understand its role as insurer that was one of the key things that made the Great Depression great .
But there ’s insurance that follows proper underwriting standards and insurance that does not .
Our government ’s current experiment in insurance provision most certainly does not .
The fault there lies mostly in the past : Regulators had procedures in place to wind down banks in an orderly fashion and partially protect their depositors , plus a mechanism to collect insurance premiums to pay for all this .
But they allowed a few non -bank institutions , and non -bank parts of banking companies , to grow so large and entwined that they could n’t fail without threatening a broader financial meltdown .
And so now we ’re getting this muddled , hugely expensive bailout / takeover .
Costs keep going up on the AIG bailout not because CEO Ed Liddy is doing stupid stuff .
All appearances are that he ’s trying to wind down the bad parts of the company as quickly and responsibly as possible and keep the rest alive .
It ’s just that the losses are bigger than the government and the company anticipated , plus they keep growing as the global economy worsens .
It may be that it would make more sense in terms of management focus and incentives to split AIG into a good insurance company ( “ new AIG , ” to follow the model for banks laid out the other day by Willem Buiter ) and a bad one .
But the basic problem still remains — somebody would still have to shoulder the losses of the bad company .
AIG ’s shareholders are already virtually wiped out , so while there ’s something to be said for completely wiping them out ( the government currently owns 79.9 % of the company ) , that wo n’t pay for anything .
Which leaves AIG ’s creditors and derivatives counterparties ( that is , the people it owes money to ) and taxpayers .
The fear in hitting the former is that if creditors were forced to take another big blow all lending to financial institutions around the world would stop and , as a consequence , financial intermediation would more or less end and we’d be reduced to bartering and digging for grubs .
That fear is exaggerated , but there ’s at least a germ of truth to it — and even if creditors shouldered some of the burden the losses are so huge that taxpayers would still be stuck paying for a lot .
That leaves the final question :
Which taxpayers ?
I ’m a big fan of the concept of clawing back ill - gotten gains , and in a just world Hank Greenberg and Martin Sullivan , the former CEOs who got AIG into this mess , would currently be working as greeters at a Wal - Mart to make ends meet ( rather than , in Greenberg ’s case , going on CNBC all the time ) .
But the legal logistics of this are daunting .
A blunter but more realistic instrument is the tax rate we charge on those with very high incomes : Bankers and other financial types have been overrepresented at the top of the income distribution , so why not just tax them more ?
Of course , not all bankers made messes , and bankers are n’t the only high earners .
The best approach is probably to charge financial system participants appropriate premiums for the insurance that government is providing them .
That has to be a major part of any new financial regulatory structure .
But it wo n’t pay for anything now .
Hackers have crossed into new frontiers by devising sophisticated ways to steal large amounts of personal identification numbers , or PINs , protecting credit and debit cards , says an investigator .
The attacks involve both unencrypted PINs and encrypted PINs that attackers have found a way to crack , according to an investigator behind a new report looking at the data breaches .
The attacks , says Bryan Sartin , director of investigative response for Verizon Business , are behind some of the millions of dollars in fraudulent ATM withdrawals that have occurred around the United States .
" We 're seeing entirely new attacks that a year ago were thought to be only academically possible , " says Sartin .
Verizon Business released a report Wednesday that examines trends in security breaches .
" What we see now is people going right to the source ... and stealing the encrypted PIN blocks and using complex ways to un-encrypt the PIN blocks . "
The revelation is an indictment of one of the backbone security measures of U.S. consumer banking : PIN codes .
In years past , attackers were forced to obtain PINs piecemeal through phishing attacks , or the use of skimmers and cameras installed on ATM and gas station card readers .
Barring these techniques , it was believed that once a PIN was typed on a keypad and encrypted , it would traverse bank processing networks with complete safety , until it was decrypted and authenticated by a financial institution on the other side .
But the new PIN - hacking techniques belie this theory , and threaten to destabilize the banking - system transaction process .
Information about the theft of encrypted PINs first surfaced in an indictment last year against 11 alleged hackers accused of stealing some 40 million debit and credit card details from TJ Maxx and other U.S. retail networks .
The affidavit , which accused Albert " Cumbajohnny " Gonzalez of leading the carding ring , indicated that the thieves had stolen " PIN blocks associated with millions of debit cards " and obtained " technical assistance from criminal associates in decrypting encrypted PIN numbers . "
But until now , no one had confirmed that thieves were actively cracking PIN encryption .
Sartin , whose division at Verizon conducts forensic investigations for companies that experience data breaches , would n't identify the institutions that were hit or indicate exactly how much stolen money was being attributed to the attacks , but according to the 2009 Data Breach Investigations report , the hacks have resulted in " more targeted , cutting - edge , complex , and clever cybercrime attacks than seen in previous years . "
" While statistically not a large percentage of our overall caseload in 2008 , attacks against PIN information represent individual data - theft cases having the largest aggregate exposure in terms of unique records , " says the report .
" In other words , PIN - based attacks and many of the very large compromises from the past year go hand in hand . "
Although there are ways to mitigate the attacks , experts say the problem can only really be resolved if the financial industry overhauls the entire payment processing system .
" You really have to start right from the beginning , " says Graham Steel , a research fellow at the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control who wrote about one solution to mitigate some of the attacks .
" But then you make changes that are n't backwards - compatible . "
PIN hacks hit consumers particularly hard , because they allow thieves to withdraw cash directly from the consumer 's checking , savings or brokerage account , Sartin says .
Unlike fraudulent credit card charges , which generally carry zero liability for the consumer , fraudulent cash withdrawals that involve a customer 's PIN can be more difficult to resolve since , in the absence of evidence of a breach , the burden is placed on the customer to prove that he or she did n't make the withdrawal .
Some of the attacks involve grabbing unencrypted PINs , while they sit in memory on bank systems during the authorization process .
But the most sophisticated attacks involve encrypted PINs .
Sartin says the latter attacks involve a device called a hardware security module ( HSM ) , a security appliance that sits on bank networks and on switches through which PIN numbers pass on their way from an ATM or retail cash register to the card issuer .
The module is a tamper - resistant device that provides a secure environment for certain functions , such as encryption and decryption , to occur .
According to the payment - card industry , or PCI , standards for credit card transaction security , PIN numbers are supposed to be encrypted in transit , which should theoretically protect them if someone intercepts the data .
The problem , however , is that a PIN must pass through multiple HSMs across multiple bank networks en route to the customer 's bank .
These HSMs are configured and managed differently , some by contractors not directly related to the bank .
At every switching point , the PIN must be decrypted , then re-encrypted with the proper key for the next leg in its journey , which is itself encrypted under a master key that is stored in the module .
The most common method Sartin says criminals are using to get the PINs is to fool the application programming interface ( or API ) of the hardware security module in to helping them " understand or manipulate one key value . "
" Essentially , the thief tricks the HSM into providing the encryption key , " he says .
" This is possible due to poor configuration of the HSM or vulnerabilities created from having bloated functions on the device . "
Sartin says HSMs need to be able to serve many types of customers in many countries where processing standards may be different from the U.S.
As a result , the devices come with enabled functions that are n't needed and can be exploited by an intruder into working to defeat the device 's security measures .
Once a thief captures and decrypts one PIN block , it becomes trivial to decrypt others on a network .
Other kinds of attacks occur against PINs after they arrive at the card - issuing bank .
Once encrypted PINs arrive at the HSM at the issuing bank , the HSM communicates with the bank 's mainframe system to decrypt the PIN and the customer 's 16 - digit account number for a brief period to authorize the transaction .
During that period , the data is briefly held in the system 's memory in unencrypted form .
Sartin says some attackers have created malware that scrapes the memory to capture the data .
" Memory scrapers are in as much as a third of all cases we 're seeing , or utilities that scrape data from unallocated space , " Sartin says .
" This is a huge vulnerability . "
He says the stolen data is often stored in a file right on the hacked system .
" These victims do n't see it , " Sartin says .
" They rely almost purely on anti-virus to detect things that show up on systems that are n't supposed to be there .
But they 're not looking for a 30 - gig file growing on a system . "
Information about how to conduct attacks on encrypted PINs is n't new and has been surfacing in academic research for several years .
In the first paper , in 2003 , a researcher at Cambridge University published information about attacks that , with the help of an insider , would yield PINs from an issuer bank 's system .
The paper , however , was little noticed outside academic circles and the HSM industry .
But in 2006 , two Israeli computer security researchers outlined an additional attack scenario that got widespread publicity .
The attack was much more sophisticated and also required the assistance of an insider who possessed credentials to access the HSM and the API and who also had knowledge of the HSM configuration and how it interacted with the network .
As a result , industry experts dismissed it as a minimal threat .
But Steel and others say they began to see interest for the attack research from the Russian carding community .
" I got strange Russian e-mails saying , Can you tell me how to crack PINs ? "
Steel recalls .
But until now no one had seen the attacks actually being used in the wild .
Steel wrote a paper in 2006 that addressed attacks against HSMs ( .pdf ) as well as a solution to mitigate some of the risks .
The paper was submitted to nCipher , a British company that manufactures HSMs and is now owned by Thales .
He says the solution involved guidelines for configuring an HSM in a more secure manner and says nCipher passed the guidelines to customers .
Steel says his solution would n't address all of the types of attacks .
To fix the problem would take a redesign .
But he notes that " a complete rethink of the system would just cost more than the banks were willing to make at this time . "
Thales is the largest maker of HSMs for the payment - card and other industries , with " multiple tens of thousands " of HSMs deployed in payment - processing networks around the world , according to the company .
A spokesman said the company is not aware of any of the attacks on HSMs that Sartin described , and noted that Thales and most other HSM vendors have implemented controls in their devices to prevent such attacks .
The problem , however , is how the systems are configured and managed .
" It 's a very difficult challenge to protect against the lazy administrator , " says Brian Phelps , director of program services for Thales .
" Out of the box , the HSMs come configured in a very secure fashion if customers just deploy them as is .
But for many operational reasons , customers choose to alter those default security configurations — supporting legacy applications may be one example — which creates vulnerabilities . "
Redesigning the global payment system to eliminate legacy vulnerabilities " would require a mammoth overhaul of virtually every point - of - sale system in the world , " he says .
Responding to questions about the vulnerabilities in HSMs , the PCI Security Standards Council said that beginning next week the council would begin testing HSMs as well as unattended payment terminals .
Bob Russo , general manager of the global standards body , said in a statement that although there are general market standards that cover HSMs , the council 's testing of the devices would " focus specifically on security properties that are critical to the payment system . "
The testing program conducted in council - approved laboratories would cover " both physical and logical security properties . "
Update : Due to an editing error , a previous version of this article stated that the master key is stored in the API of the hardware security module .
It should have said that criminals can manipulate the API to trick it into revealing information about the key .
The key is stored in the HSM , not in the API .

Oil Execs Wake Up and Donate $ 125 Billion for Clean Energy Funding
TwilightEarth reports that a group of oil execs have had an epiphany … and are putting their money where their black as coal mouths are .
They say ,
" Released after an all - night meeting which ended in tears and an environmental epiphany , [ this document ] states that all of the profits from oil production last year will be divided equally among the world ’s leading environmental research organizations . "
Earlier I asked , " What could have sparked such a recent flurry of exciting news ? " …
Do you think it ’s the fact that today is April Fools Day ? 😉
Be honest , when did you figure out none of these stories were real ?
Do n’t be shy now .
Hit up
The Daily Green to check out some great green pranks to pull today … there ’s plenty of April fooling left to be done .

Leave it to the clever boys at Goldman Sachs to turn dross into gold :
They have come up with a way to hide massive losses so clever , it requires special comment : The Orphan Month .
Yesterday , we noted that the bulk of their profits had come from AIG transfer payments — the theft from taxpayers AIG 100 % payouts funded via bailout monies that saw Goldie as one of the largest recipients .
Floyd Norris notes that most of the AIG effect was in December .
“ For the first quarter , the total A.I.G. effect on earnings was , in round numbers , zero . ”
How is it possible that this occurred ?
Is n’t GS on a December to February calendar ?
Well , there is a small asterisk about that .
It seems that GS is moving from a December to a quarterly calendar .
Meaning their latest Q is January thru March .
But what of December , with all t he AIG monies and the comparison to the strong December 2007 and all ?
In a word , Orphaned :
Goldman ’s 2008 fiscal year ended Nov. 30 .
This year the company is switching to a calendar year .
The leaves December as an orphan month , one that will be largely ignored .
In Goldman ’s news release , and in most of the news reports , the quarter ended March 31 is compared to the quarter last year that ending in February .
The orphan month featured — surprise — lots of writeoffs .
The pre-tax loss was $ 1.3 billion , and the after - tax loss was $ 780 million .
Would the firm have had a profit if it stuck to its old calendar , and had to include December and exclude March ?
Truly astounding . . . the word Chutzpah simply does not do it justice . . .

The Case of the Missing Month

Apple ( AAPL ) : Why Brands Matter
As the executives at Apple ( AAPL ) were passing around the Dom Perignon , their counterparts at other companies which design and manufacture smartphones were putting all sharp objects out of reach .
In a recession , there is only so much air in any room .
Smart phone sales are suffering like all consumer electronics .
If the iPhone is doing extraordinarily well , others are doing badly .
What almost no one saw coming in Apple ’s results for the quarter that ended in March was that the company would sell nearly 3.8 million iPhones .
Most educated guesses were around 3.1 million .
In a world where securities analysts send spies to Apple stores and bribe hardware component suppliers in Taiwan for data on iPhone parts shipments , experts are not supposed to be off that much .
It makes them look bad , but it makes Apple look good , both for its ability to keep things secret and for building a handset that is expensive , making it a real aspirational product for many of the people who buy it .
Some of the consumers walking into A&T ( T ) stores do n’t have $ 299 for the iPhone and the money for the exorbitant calling plan that goes with it .
They go anyway , like junkies to a dealer .
Apple netted over $ 1.2 billion on revenue of almost $ 8.2 billion last quarter .
Investors must have sensed that good things were coming .
The firm ’s stock is up 42 % this year which is unfair to people who have invested in almost any other company .
The NASDAQ has only inched higher by 3 % during the same period .
For investors who like to keep score .
Apple ’s iPhone sales likely come at the expense of Research - in - Motion ( RIMM ) which makes the iconic business tool , the Blackberry , and struggling also - ran Palm ( PALM ) which is about to release its
Pre , the company ’s last shot at viability .
The fact that the Pre will be sold by Sprint ( S ) which has lower customer satisfaction rating than most short order take - out restaurants makes the future of the little company look bleak .
RIMM ’s stock , on the other hand , has traded up even more than Apple ’s has this year .
That can be attributed to either hope over reason , or the fact that a second smartphone company is doing well , which leaves even less room at the top of the handset market during hard economic periods .
RIMM is doing well enough that its revenue rose 25 % in the last quarter to almost $ 3.5 billion .
That means it is less than half Apple ’s size in terms of sales , but RIMM does not sell Macs or iPods .
RIMM added 3.9 million handsets in that quarter .
What does not make sense , at least at first blush , is that the financial results of all of the other major handset companies from Sony Ericsson to Nokia ( NOK ) to Motorola ( MOT ) were down .
These firms can hardly give handsets away , much less sell them .
Each of these operations said that global cell phone unit sales will be down in 2009 .
What is even more puzzling is that large handset companies do n’t just make smart phones ; they make a lot of cheap phones for people in emerging markets and consumers who do n’t want a handset that acts as a TV , PC , personal assistant , and objects d’art .
Apple and RIMM are doing remarkably well selling products into the high end of the market .
It is usually a bad idea to try to explain things that do not make sense .
It is counterintuitive that expensive phones should sell well when the economy is shrinking , the credit markets look like a dust bowl , and people are losing jobs .
The Apple and RIMM results are an example of why brands matter and why companies are willing to work to develop them by making huge investments which can stretch over decades .
Apple was n’t much of a brand until it introduced the iPod in 2001 , but the firm was around for a long time before then .
RIMM and the Blackberry are young in the brand Hall of Fame , a group that is dominated by Coca - Cola ( KO ) , IBM ( IBM ) , Microsoft ( MSFT ) , and GE ( GE ) .
Interbrand , the Rolls Royce of global brand research , has Apple and Blackberry on its list of the 100 Most Valuable Brands .
The list is not infallible ; it includes Xerox ( XRX ) , which should have left for “ brand heaven ” a long time ago .
A lot of people think that consumers who buy brand are suckers , the kind people WC Field used to mock in old movies .
Samsung builds a smartphone that looks and works a lot like the iPhone .
It is called the Instinct and Apple owners think it is junk .
A lot of experts claim to know why people buy branded products , but there are probably as many reasons as there are people .
All Apple cares about is that their customers have enough money to buy an iPhone , iPod , or Mac .
Suckers have money , too

Lampard scrubbed up nicely for Chelsea after Jose showered him with praise
Frank Lampard was standing in the shower after a training session when Jose Mourinho told him he was the best player in the world .
Casually , but with certainty , as if he was imparting information that any coach could have worked out .
That is what he does .
That is why today is the seventh anniversary of the last league match he lost at home .
February 23 , 2002 , Porto 2 Beira - Mar 3 .
Brothers in arms : Frank Lampard and his then Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho embrace in 2005
Since then , he has stayed undefeated in 38 league games at Porto , 60 at Chelsea and 12 more at Inter Milan , who now dominate Serie A. Mourinho is currently getting world class performances from Adriano , a notorious waster , and Sulley Muntari , a Ghana international who was good at Portsmouth , but not this good .
Mourinho ’s brilliance is the way he can take a top player and elevate him .
John Terry and Didier Drogba have never looked better than under his stewardship .
Deco , at Porto , was the coach ’s creation .
Zlatan Ibrahimovic is in the form of his life in Italy .
The techniques Mourinho uses to manipulate situations publicly , he utilises in private , too .
He knows precisely when to drop the bomb , which is how , at Chelsea , he turned Lampard from a very good player into the driving force behind back - to - back title wins and a Footballer of the Year .
‘ His man management was just terrific , ’ said Lampard .
‘ He knew how to get into people ’s heads .
He got into mine the moment he came .
He has that air of arrogance , that confidence , and it rubs off .
‘ I have never had a manager who , while I ’m standing in the shower cleaning my balls , tells me I ’m the best player in the world .
He did that .
I ’ll never forget it .
So casual .
“ You ’re the best player in the world , but you need to win titles ” .
‘ From that moment the extra confidence was in me .
Not that I thought I was the best player in the world , but the manager who had just won the Champions League thought it .
So I went out a different player . ’
That is the key to Mourinho .
What you see is not the half of it .
The cleverness of the man is what happens behind closed doors .
‘ His training sessions were to the dot , ’ added Lampard .
‘ He was so organised .
There was always a point to what he was doing ; and his man management was the same . ’
Manchester United have their work cut out this week , particularly without Nemanja Vidic .
No team have retained the Champions League and the previous four
winners have been knocked out in the last 16 the following year , by opposition considerably inferior to Mourinho ’s Inter Milan .
Flying : Zlatan Ibrahimovic is going great at Inter Milan
Twickenham is on the Football Association ’s list as a potential venue for the 2018 World Cup .
Why ?
Ca n’t another sport have something good without football wishing to colonise it ?
After defeating Bologna on Saturday , Mourinho said he would arrive at the training ground this week with a positive message for his players about tomorow ’s match .
He has already told Ibrahimovic he is a better player than Cristiano Ronaldo .
Maybe he was scrubbing down at the time , too .
Maybe , if Mourinho ’s inspirational powers remain , by the end of the season his players will have something almost as precious to clean : as Inter ’s first European champions since 1965 .
If that happens , just call him Goldenballs .
Not far - Fletched
Darren Fletcher ahead of Xabi Alonso : well , that caused a bit of fuss , did n’t it ?
In a column last week I made a fairly uncontroversial observation that Manchester United were ahead of Liverpool because they had better players .
The thrust was that while people look to peripheral reasons such as Rafael Benitez ’s verbal attack on Sir Alex Ferguson , or his disagreements with the board at Liverpool as the reason his title charge has lost momentum , the explanation is much simpler : United have the best team .
To support the argument , I asked how many Liverpool players would get in United ’s XI and guessed between two and four .
Then I listed my composite team — and the fun started .
How , it was asked by many people , including this newspaper ’s irate golf correspondent , could I put Fletcher in and not Alonso ( or Michael Carrick or Javier Mascherano ) ?
So here goes .
Mr Reliable : Darren Fletcher holds off Everton 's Marouane Fellaini
I wanted my composite XI to work .
I did n’t want to pick one of those teams with a line of beautiful midfield players in a row and nobody to win a tackle .
To find room for Cristiano Ronaldo , Wayne Rooney and Fernando Torres up front I had to play three in midfield and I had already listed Steven Gerrard and Ryan Giggs .
Cheer up , Harry .
Everything will be OK ... Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp ( left ) is angry about a congested fixture list that has his team playing six times in 17 days .
Not to worry .
Wait until next year : it will clear right out .
Carrick was the first name down , but his strength is not breaking up the play .
Alonso would have been next , but is similar to Carrick .
So it was a choice between Mascherano and Fletcher and Mascherano is not playing as well as last season .
Fletcher , meanwhile , has been immense in several key matches for United , not least against Chelsea at Old Trafford .
So I stand by it .
Sorry Derek ; sorry all .
Alonso is having an excellent season but , like Sir Alex , I picked Fletcher to get a job done .
And by the way , out of 26 games in which he has featured this season , do you know how many Manchester United have lost ?
One : to Zenit St Petersburg in the European Super Cup , a match the club took less than seriously .
Not bad for a ‘ donkey ’ .
Platini plan is off limits
Michel Platini , president of UEFA , lobbied the European Union last week with his proposals for limits on transfer spending .
He wants expenditure on transfers and wages to be capped at 60 per cent of revenue , a measure that would cement the status quo of elite club domination with no parvenu interlopers , just as it does in France , where Lyon are closing in on an eighth straight league title , thanks to the regulations Platini proposes .
Rendez-vous : Platini meets European Parliament president Hans - Gert Poettering ( left )
By doing this , and by enforcing stringent rules on debt , Platini also hopes to reduce the strength of English clubs in Europe .
He never acknowledges that many Barclays Premier League clubs are in debt because of stadium rebuilds , while rivals on the Continent receive government assistance for similar projects .
What a performance , Andy
Andy Flower , senior coach to the England cricket team on the tour of the Caribbean , says he wants to be considered for the post of performance director when it is advertised by the ECB .
He also says it was batsman Owais Shah ’s decision to insert James Anderson as night watchman in the third Test in Antigua , a call that may have cost England the match .
That was the time for Flower to direct performance .
It is too late doing it on an application form .
Nantes , for instance , where club president Waldemar Kita ( who is Polish , so foreign ownership is clearly not an English preserve as some at UEFA would have us believe ) , has announced plans to build a new stadium with a view to it being used in the 2016 European Championship .
The winner of that bidding process is not announced until May 2010 but no matter , because the city council will be picking up a large part of the tab .
Indeed , the project is now being evaluated by the sports rights agency SPORTFIVE , where the son of a certain UEFA president is employed .
So that ’s the way to do it .
Only a crony , PleasedMan
Looking at the way Lord Pleasedman* of the Football Association has snapped up politicians for top jobs at Soho Square , one would think Great Britain is the best - run country in the world .
That the National Health Service is not the adventure in misdiagnosis , incompetence and hospital bugs it has been for two members of my family this year ; that the education system is not turning out 13 - year - old fathers and the worst teenage pregnancy rate in Europe ; that unemployment is not rising exponentially ; that foreign policy is n’t a war of attrition in the Middle East and the City is not a crumbling ruin of failing banks propped up by money the Government does n’t really have .
Friends reunited : Lord PleasedMan ( left , obviously ) and Ian Watmore
Having stuffed his World Cup bid committee full of Westminster ’s finest , PleasedMan has now appointed a Government ally , Ian Watmore , as FA chief executive .
In this way , the FA chairman resembles a tired old football manager with no fresh ideas other than to keep going back to his former club for players .
Fine , if that club was Manchester United .
Not so good if it is Kettering Town .
* Now some of you may know him as Lord Triesman but , as I have never seen a man look quite so pleased with himself and his status , in this column , Lord Pleased Man he shall remain .
Top man : Ebbsfleet chief executive David Davis
Dream Ebbs away
Ebbsfleet United thought they had 32,000 loyal fans .
They did n’t .
They had 32,000 part - timers subscribing to MyFootballClub.co.uk and playing a computer game that got boring after a while , as all computer games do .
Now , Ebbsfleet are running short of membership renewals and funds .
Will Brooks , mastermind of MyFootballClub , was marketing a gimmick , not a brave new world .
Gimmicks have a shelf life .
Game over .
Caught out : Christine Ohuruogu celebrates glory in Osaka after serving her ban
What a load of dopes
Christine Ohuruogu wrote a column in a national newspaper last week that , at first glance , appeared admirably to be in support of the whereabouts system of random drug testing .
But on closer inspection it was just another dollop of self - serving twaddle about how tough it is to report for work at a set time every day and how , only now , are other sports beginning to realise this .
Andrew Murray is livid , apparently .
A member of Great Britain ’s rowing team says she is on the verge of giving her sport up .
Please do .
All of you .
An amoral maze
The pathetic Women ’s Tennis Association fined the Dubai Championships £ 208,000 for their refusal to admit Shahar Peer , the Israeli tennis player , to this season ’s tournament .
The WTA boasted that this was a record punishment , but you could stand next to a Dubai oil well with a polystyrene cup and collect that much in spillage in a day .
No qualms : Venus Williams was proud to win the Dubai WTA Tennis Championships
Worse was the reaction of finalist Venus Williams .
Asked why players did not boycott the event after Peer was barred on the grounds of nationality , Williams said there was a bigger picture to consider .
Which was ?
‘ We ca n’t let our sponsors down , ’ she replied .
All about priorities , is n’t it ?
Despicable .
See if we care .
Olympics idea well below par
A detailed proposal for golf ’s inclusion as an Olympic event has been sent by the International Golf Federation to the International Olympic Committee .
The sport will now be considered for the 2016 Games , alongside baseball , karate , roller - skating , rugby sevens , softball and squash .
The evaluation process should be simple : would winning a gold medal be the pinnacle in your sport ?
No ?
Well , go away .
Golf ’s out .
Among friends : David Beckham on duty with England in Spain
If you want my advice , Beckham
Matthew Etherington went to Stoke City for more than AC Milan have bid for David Beckham .
Even so , Beckham made a huge mistake signing for LA Galaxy and we wish him well in his attempt to finesse a move to Italy .
His career adviser , Simon Fuller , has flown to America to broker the deal .
As he must have been the guy who steered him down this path in the first place , what is wrong with this picture ?

Press release
WASHINGTON , April 28 , 2009 -
Maximizing mileage
Slowing down and maintaining even throttle pressure ;
Gradually accelerating and smoothly braking ;
Maintaining a safe distance between vehicles and anticipating traffic conditions ;
Coasting up to red lights and stop signs to avoid fuel waste and brake wear ;
Minimize use of heater and air conditioning to reduce the load on the engine ;
Close windows at high speeds to reduce aerodynamic drag ;
Applying the " Pulse and Glide " technique while maintaining the flow of traffic ;
Minimize excessive engine workload by using the vehicle 's kinetic forward motion to climb hills , and use downhill momentum to build speed ; and
Avoiding bumps and potholes that can reduce momentum
Drivers trained in mileage - maximizing techniques such as smooth acceleration and coasting to red lights were able to get an extraordinary 1,445.7 miles out of a single tank of gas during a fund - raising effort in Washington , D.C. that concluded today .
They did it by averaging 81.5 miles per gallon in an off - the - showroom floor , non-modified 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid , the most fuel - efficient midsize car in North America - nearly doubling its U.S. certified mileage .
The Fusion Hybrid 1,000 - Mile Challenge started at 8:15 a.m. EDT on Saturday , April 25 , from Mount Vernon , Va. , and ended this morning at 5:37 a.m. on George Washington Parkway in Washington , D.C.
After more than 69 continuous hours of driving , the Fusion Hybrid finally depleted its tank and came to a stop with an odometer reading of 1,445.7 miles - setting a world record for gasoline - powered , midsize sedan .
The challenge team , which included NASCAR star Carl Edwards , high mileage trailblazer Wayne Gerdes and several Ford Motor Company engineers , raised more than $ 8,000 for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation ( JDRF ) by exceeding the goal of 1,000 miles on a single tank of gas .
The Fusion Hybrid 's official estimated range is approximately 700 miles per tank .
" Not only does this demonstrate the Fusion Hybrid 's fuel efficiency , it also shows that driving technique is one of the keys to maximizing its potential , " said Nancy Gioia , director , Ford Sustainable Mobility Technologies and Hybrid Vehicle Programs .
" The fact that we were able raise much needed funds for JDRF while raising the bar on fuel efficient driving performance made the effort doubly worthwhile .
" A team of seven drivers prepared for the challenge by learning a few mileage - maximizing techniques , most of which can be used in any vehicle to improve fuel economy , but are especially useful in the Fusion Hybrid where the driver can take advantage of pure electric energy at speeds below 47 mph .
CleanMPG.com founder Wayne Gerdes , an engineer from Illinois who coined the term " hypermiling " to describe the mileage - maximizing techniques , provided the pointers .
They include :
Famous pairings include Apple pie and ice cream ; Apple 's Steve and Steve ; Jason Chen and pantsing new electronics ; and , of course , the iPhone and video editing .

It 's just a rumor for now , bits of newly discovered beta code , really , but that last pairing could be true , and soon .
Now , video editing and the iPhone is n't total out of the blue .
Just last month , in the aftermath of the big firmware 3.0 beta reveal , intrepid cyber sleuths uncovered an " upload my video " option in the MobileMe section .

But this tip from Gizmodo reader Ben is something a bit new .
Buried in the beta are some graphics that future iPhone directors might use for video editing .
There are also some art resources that allegedly show scrubbing and clip features .
And naturally , if these features pan out , they would make massively more sense paired up with a device that has a faster processor , more storage , etc .
You picking up what I 'm laying down ?

A broad swath of religious organizations and civil liberties groups  often on opposite sides of contentious issues  have joined together to condemn a proposed rule that they say would prohibit some religious texts in federal penitentiary libraries .
The Bureau of Prisons in January proposed that “ materials that could incite , promote , or otherwise suggest the commission of violence or criminal activity ” may be excluded from chapel libraries .
An alliance of groups  Christian , Muslim and Jewish , conservative and liberal  opposed the rule during the open comments period , which ended Tuesday .
The word “ could ” is at the center of a two - year dispute between the agency and these groups over which religious texts should be banned from prison libraries .
The American Civil Liberties Union and several other civil rights and religious groups argue that the agency is going beyond the provision of the Second Chance Act of 2007 , which included a restriction on materials that “ seek ” to incite violence .
Dandelion Salad
By Mike Whitney
April 08 , 2009 “ Information Clearing House ”
It ’s been 21 months since two Bear Stearns hedge funds defaulted setting off a series of events which have led to the gravest economic crisis since the Great Depression .
No one expected the financial meltdown to hit this hard or spread this fast .
The failure at Bear triggered a freeze in the secondary market where mortgage loans are repackaged into securities and sold to investors .
That market is now completely paralyzed cutting off 40 percent of funding for consumer and business loans and thrusting the broader economy into a deep recession .
Banks and financial institutions have been forced to curtail their off - balance sheet operations and build their reserves which have ballooned from $ 45 billion to nearly $ 700 billion in the last 6 months alone .
Like millions of homeowners who have seen their home equity vanish and their retirement savings slashed in half , the banks are hunkering down hoping they can outlast the deflationary hurricane ahead .
The deteriorating economic conditions have taken their toll on consumer confidence and forced businesses to lay off employees that wo n’t be needed during the slowdown .
The system is bursting with overcapacity .
Demand is falling faster than any time since the 1930s .
Inventories will have to be trimmed and budgets cut to muddle through the down - times .
Foreign trade has slowed to a crawl , auto sales are down by 40 percent or more , and unemployment is rising at 650,000 per month .
Policymakers have pushed through a $ 800 billion stimulus plan , but it wo n’t be nearly enough to stop the steady rise in unemployment or take up the slack in an economy where industrial output has been cut in half , new home construction has dropped to record lows , and manufacturing has fallen off a cliff .
Economists warn that when governments do n’t step in and provide stimulus to increase aggregate demand , consumers cut back sharply on spending and push the economy deeper into depression .
Treasury Secretary Geithner and Fed chief Bernanke have lent or committed $ 13 trillion trying to keep the financial system functioning , but they ’ve only managed to plug a few holes and avoid a system - wide collapse .
The financial system is hobbled and unable to provide sufficient credit to generate growth .
Every sector has suffered cutbacks , layoffs and slimmer profits .
The problems go beyond toxic assets or complex derivatives .
The system is plagued with stagnation , overcapacity and redundancy .
Economics professor Robert Brenner sums it up like this in an interview in the Asia Pacific Journal :
Robert Brenner : “ The current crisis is more serious than the worst previous recession of the postwar period , between 1979 and 1982 , and could conceivably come to rival the Great Depression , though there is no way of really knowing .
Economic forecasters have underestimated how bad it is because they have over - estimated the strength of the real economy and failed to take into account the extent of its dependence upon a buildup of debt that relied on asset price bubbles .
In the U.S. , during the recent business cycle of the years 2001 - 2007 , GDP growth was by far the slowest of the postwar epoch .
There was no increase in private sector employment .
The increase in plants and equipment was about a third of the previous , a postwar low .
Real wages were basically flat .
There was no increase in median family income for the first time since World War II .
Economic growth was driven entirely by personal consumption and residential investment , made possible by easy credit and rising house prices .
Economic performance was weak , even despite the enormous stimulus from the housing bubble and the Bush administration ’s huge federal deficits .
Housing by itself accounted for almost one - third of the growth of GDP and close to half of the increase in employment in the years 2001 - 2005 .
It was , therefore , to be expected that when the housing bubble burst , consumption and residential investment would fall , and the economy would plunge .
” ( “ Overproduction not Financial Collapse is the Heart of the Crisis ” , Robert P. Brenner speaks with Jeong Seong - jin , Asia Pacific Journal )
The economy is now in a downward spiral .
Tightening in the credit markets has made it harder for consumers to borrow or businesses to expand .
Overextended financial institutions are forced to shed assets at firesale prices to meet margin calls from the banks .
Asset deflation is ongoing with no end in sight .
Price declines in housing have reached 30 percent already and are now accelerating on the downside .
This is the nightmare scenario that Bernanke hoped to avoid ; a capitulation in real estate that drags the rest of economy into a black hole .
Economist Nouriel Roubini and market analyst Meredith Whitney predict that housing prices will drop another 20 percent before they hit bottom .
Nearly half of all homeowners will be underwater and owe more on their mortgages than the current value of their homes .
That will increase the foreclosures and push scores of banks into default .
According to Merrill Lynch ’s economist David Rosenberg :
“ It would take over three years to achieve price stability ( in housing )
The problem is that prices do not begin to stabilize until we break below eight months ’ supply – and they tend to deflate 3 % per quarter until that happens .
So as impressive as it is that the builders have taken single - family starts below underlying sales , their efforts are just not sufficient to prevent real estate prices from falling further .
In fact , even if the builders were to declare a moratorium immediately , that is , taking starts to zero , demand is so weak and the unsold inventory so intractable that it would now take over three years to achieve the holy grail of price stability in the residential real estate market . ”
The main economic indicators all point to a long period of retrenchment ahead .
The slowdown in global trade has hit Germany , Japan , and most of Asia particularly hard .
The export - driven model of growth has suffered a major setback and wo n’t rebound for some time to come .
With the US consumer unable to continue his debt - fueled spending spree , surplus countries will have to develop domestic markets for growth , but it wo n’t be easy .
Chinese workers save 50 percent of what they earn and German workers already have a comfortable life without increasing personal consumption .
Higher wages and lower interest rates can help stimulate demand , but cultural influences make it difficult to change spending habits .
Meanwhile , the economy will continue to languish operating well below its optimum capacity .
Capital flows have also suddenly reversed causing turmoil in the currency markets .
January ’s TIC data indicates that net capital outflows for the US were negative $ 148 billion in January .
Capital is now fleeing the country .
Financial protectionism has triggered the repatriation of foreign investment causing a sharp drop in the purchase of US sovereign debt .
This is from Brad Setser , economist for the CFR :
“ The obvious implication of the recent downturn in total reserve holdings — and the $ 180 billion fall in q4 was n’t driven by currency moves — is that the pace of growth in the world ’s dollar reserves has slowed dramatically …
The obvious implication : most of the 2009 US fiscal deficit WILL NEED TO BE FINANCED DOMESTICALLY .
The Fed ’s custodial data indicates central banks are still buying Treasuries , though at a somewhat slower pace than in late 2008 .
But their demand has n’t kept up with issuance .
( Foreign Central banks are n’t going to finance much of the 2009 US fiscal deficit ;
Their reserves are n’t growing anymore ” , Brad Setser , Council on Foreign Relations )
The United States does not have the reserves to finance it own massive deficits which will soar to $ 1.9 trillion by the end of 2009 .
The Fed will have to increase its purchases of US Treasuries and monetize the debt .
Foreign holders of Treasuries and dollar - backed assets ( $ 5 trillion overseas ) will be watching carefully as Bernanke revs up the printing presses to fight the recession and meet government obligations .
China , Russia , Venezuela and Iran have already called for a change in the world ’s reserve currency .
It wo n’t happen overnight , but the momentum is steadily growing .
The S&P 500 has soared 23 percent in the last four weeks , but the current bear market rally is misleading .
The prospects for a quick recovery are remote at best .
The fundamentals are all weak .
Corporate profits are down , GDP is negative 6 percent , housing is in a shambles , and the banking system broken .
The Fed has increased the money supply by 22 percent , but economic activity is at a standstill .
The velocity at which money is spent is the slowest since 1987 .
Nothing is moving .
The banks are hoarding , credit has dried up , and consumers are saving for the first time in 2 decades .
The banks ’ credit - conduit cannot function properly until bad assets are removed from their balance sheets .
But the magnitude of the losses make it impossible for the government to purchase them outright without bankrupting the country .
According to the Times Online , the IMF has increased its estimates of how much toxic mortgage - backed paper the banks are holding :
“ Toxic debts racked up by banks and insurers could spiral to $ 4 trillion , new forecasts from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) are set to suggest .
The IMF said in January that it expected the deterioration in US - originated assets to reach $ 2.2 trillion by the end of next year , but it is understood to be looking at raising that to $ 3.1 trillion in its next assessment of the global economy , due to be published on April 21 .
In addition , it is likely to boost that total by $ 900 billion for toxic assets originated in Europe and Asia .
Banks and insurers , which so far have owned up to $ 1.29 trillion in toxic assets , are facing increasing losses as the deepening recession takes a toll , adding to the debts racked up from sub - prime mortgages .
The IMF ’s new forecast , which could be revised again before the end of the month , will come as a blow to governments that have already pumped billions into the banking system . ”
Since banks lend at a ratio of 10 to 1 ; the amount of credit cut off to the broader economy will ensure that sluggish growth well into the future .
If there is a recovery , it will be weak .
The Obama administration will have to increase its capital injections even though they will add to mushrooming deficits .
So far , financial institutions have only written down $ 1 trillion or 25 percent of their losses .
This means the banking system is insolvent .
Eventually , Obama will have to resolve the bad banks and auction off troubled assets , even though political support is rapidly eroding .
According to political analyst F. William Engdahl , most of the garbage assets are concentrated in the nation ’s five biggest banks :
“ Today five US banks according to data in the just - released Federal Office of Comptroller of the Currency ’s Quarterly Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives Activity , hold 96 % of all US bank derivatives positions in terms of nominal values , and an eye - popping 81 % of the total net credit risk exposure in event of default .
The five are , in declining order of importance : JPMorgan Chase which holds a staggering $ 88 trillion in derivatives ( €66 trillion ! ) .
Morgan Chase is followed by Bank of America with $ 38 trillion in derivatives , and Citibank with $ 32 trillion .
Number four in the derivatives sweepstakes is Goldman Sachs with a ‘ mere ’ $ 30 trillion in derivatives .
Number five , the merged Wells Fargo - Wachovia Bank , drops dramatically in size to $ 5 trillion .
Number six , Britain ’s HSBC Bank USA has $ 3.7 trillion .
( “ Geithner ’s ‘ Dirty Little Secret ’ : The Entire Global Financial System is at Risk ” , F. William Engdahl , Global Research )
These five banking Goliaths are at the center of political power in America today .
Their White House emissary , Timothy Geithner , has concocted a rescue plan–the Public - Private Investment Program–which will provide 94 percent funding from the FDIC for the purchase bad assets .
The program is designed to keep asset prices artificially high while transferring the bulk of the losses to the taxpayer .
The plan has been widely criticized and has even raised a few eyebrows even among usually - supportive members of the establishment like the Financial Times :
“ US banks that have received government aid , including Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase , are considering buying toxic assets to be sold by rivals under the Treasury ’s $ 1,000bn ( £ 680 bn ) plan to revive the financial system .
The plans proved controversial , with critics charging that the government ’s public - private partnership – which provide generous loans to investors – are intended to help banks sell , rather than acquire , troubled securities and loans .
Banks have three options if they want to buy toxic assets : apply to become one of four or five fund managers that will purchase troubled securities ; bid for packages of bad loans ; or buy into funds set up by others .
The government plan does not allow banks to buy their own assets , but there is no ban on the purchase of securities and loans sold by others . ”
( The Financial Times )
It ’s a multi-billion dollar shell game with myriad opportunities for fraud .
In theory , the banks could create their own off - balance sheet operations ( SIVs or SPEs ) and use them to purchase their own bad assets taking advantage of the government ’s 94 percent low interest non recourse loans .
It ’s a blatant swindle and another windfall for Wall Street .
Geithner ’s plan does not fix the problems with the banks , it only delays the final outcome .
The next leg - down in the recession will push many of the undercapitalized banks into receivership .
Geithner ’s PPIP wo n’t change that .
As housing prices fall and foreclosures rise , the capital position of many of the banks will become untenable leading to a rash of bank failures .
An article in Monday ’s Wall Street Journal puts adds some historical perspective to today ’s financial crisis :
“ The events of the past 10 years have an eerie similarity to the period leading up to the Great Depression .
Total mortgage debt outstanding increased from $ 9.35 billion in 1920 to $ 29.44 billion in 1929 .
In 1920 , residential mortgage debt was 10.2 % of household wealth ; by 1929 , it was 27.2 % of household wealth … .
The causes of the Great Depression need more study , but the claims that losses on stock - market speculation and a monetary contraction caused the decline of the banking system both seem inadequate .
It appears that both the Great Depression and the current crisis had their origins in excessive consumer debt — especially mortgage debt — that was transmitted into the financial sector during a sharp downturn .
Why does one crash cause minimal damage to the financial system , so that the economy can pick itself up quickly , while another crash leaves a devastated financial sector in the wreckage ?
The hypothesis we propose is that a financial crisis that originates in consumer debt , especially consumer debt concentrated at the low end of the wealth and income distribution , can be transmitted quickly and forcefully into the financial system .
It appears that we ’re witnessing the second great consumer debt crash , the end of a massive consumption binge . ”

Steven Gjerstad and Vernon L. Smith , Wall Street Journal )
PARTY LIKE ITS 1929
Two leading economic historians , Barry Eichengreen and Kevin H. Rourke , have written an article “ A Tale of Two Depressions ” which has been widely circulated on the Internet .
It illustrates ( with graphs ) how the global economy is plummeting faster now than during the 1930s .
http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/3421
By nearly every objective standard , the present downturn is worse than the Great Depression .
Manufacturing , industrial production , foreign trade , capital flows , consumer confidence , housing , and even stocks are falling faster today than after the crash of 1929 .
So far , Bernanke ’s monetary bandaids have prevented the wholesale collapse of the financial system , but that could change .
The economy continues its downhill slide and it looks like there ’s nothing to stop it from falling further still .

Doubt over evidence against Libyan convicted for bombing that killed 270 people during 1988 flight over Lockerbie
The health of the Libyan convicted of planting the Lockerbie bomb , Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al - Megrahi , has worsened and he is experiencing increasing levels of pain , his lawyers said today .
The opening day of Megrahi 's appeal against conviction for killing 270 people in the 1988 bombing heard that he is to undergo a new course of treatment for his terminal prostate cancer , which has already spread to his spine and other parts of his body .
His lawyers claim he was wrongly convicted in 2001 on insufficient evidence , and is innocent of the bombing .
He was jailed for life for playing a prominent role in the atrocity when a suitcase bomb killed 259 passengers and crew on Pan Am flight 103 and 11 people in the Scottish town of Lockerbie on 20 December 1988 .
Today 's appeal hearing in Edinburgh came nearly two years after the case was referred by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission .
The commission raised substantial doubts about the reliability of the key witness against Megrahi , a Maltese shopkeeper called Tony Gauci , and said Megrahi may have been wrongly convicted .
Much of Megrahi's trial had focused on forensic evidence linking blast - damaged clothing to the suitcase that contained the bomb .
Megrahi was said to have visited Gauci 's shop on 7 December 1988 , but the commission said new evidence indicated the clothing was bought at an earlier date .
There had been no evidence at the trial that Megrahi was in Malta on that date .
Last November judges rejected an application for Megrahi , who is dying of cancer , to be released on bail on compassionate grounds before the appeal after medical experts said he could live for some years .
Megrahi said afterwards : " I wish to reiterate that I had nothing to do with the Lockerbie bombing and that the fight for justice will continue regardless of whether I am alive to witness my name being cleared . "
Many relatives of Lockerbie victims support his protestations of innocence .
Megrahi's first appeal was rejected in March 2002 .
Since he was jailed in Scotland , a prisoner transfer agreement has been reached between the UK and Libya .
The agreement was formally put before parliament on 27 January but the justice ministry said last night that the treaty could not enter into force until the instruments of ratification had been exchanged .
" Ratification will happen shortly .
In the case of prisoners in Scottish jails , including Megrahi , and respecting the devolution settlement , any decision to transfer under this agreement would be for Scottish ministers and Scottish ministers alone , " it said .
Viagra is not on the list of drugs players are banned from using
A Bolivian football team 's former physiotherapist says he gave players the sex drug Viagra to help them play at high altitude in the main city .
Rodrigo Figueroa told La Prensa newspaper he had prescribed Viagra , which oxygenates the blood , to at least nine players in his team , Blooming .
The team from Santa Cruz , 400 m ( 1,300 ft ) above sea level , were playing at more than 3,500 m in La Paz .
Players were unaware of what they were taking , the physiotherapist said .
He stressed that Viagra was not on the list of banned drugs .
" We prescribed it for several players , especially those who suffered most from altitude , " said Mr Figueroa .
He had , he explained , administered the product by mixing it with fruit juice .
Asked about his former side 's results using the product , Figueroa , who is now with Bolivar in La Paz , replied :
" At altitude you win , you draw , you lose .
The best results came when the team relied on strong tactical nous . "

Two years later , Dutch reporter Marius Krarup successfully crossed the same stretch of sand .
He rode in a 1903 Packard driven by Tom Fetch , one of three teams that left San Francisco for New York City to claim records in cross-country driving .
The pair failed in their bid to be first , but they did chart the most treacherous route .
Upon reaching Colorado Springs , Colorado , Krarup spoke of the conditions that preceded : " Nevada is awful , but Utah is the worst I ever saw .
We carry a pick and shovel along , and we found it necessary in more than one instance to use them when we had to build roads ourselves , cutting along the sides of hills . "
Colorado provided a brief respite .
After Denver , Krarup and Fetch would n't see another surfaced road until Illinois .

Electric power - train firm eyes China 's buses ENVIRONMENT

More than a million buses ply China 's streets and rural roads , burning diesel and spewing soot and greenhouse gases into the air .
Marvin Bush wants to electrify them .
His Menlo Park startup , Adura Systems , has developed an electric power train for buses and other heavy - duty vehicles .
A vehicle 's power train contains all the components that generate power and deliver it to the wheels .
Adura , running in stealth mode since its founding two years ago , has signed a testing agreement with a Chinese technology center that helps set the country 's standards for automotive equipment .
Adura also is negotiating with a Chinese bus manufacturer interested in the technology .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
With Adura 's power train , a bus can travel 100 miles between charges , Bush said .
Hook up the power train to a hybrid engine , and a bus traveling 130 miles in a day can get fuel mileage of 50 miles per gallon .
Bush has no interest in building the buses himself .
While other companies are trying to design entire electric vehicles , Adura has focused on just this one critical piece .
" We only do power trains , " Bush said .
" We 're not going to do any body work .
We 're not a car company . "
Adura , whose name means " to kindle " in Latin , may have found a key niche within the fast - growing world of electric and hybrid vehicles .
The company 's power train can fit in a number of different vehicle designs and work with engines burning multiple fuels .
And Adura is n't the only company exploring this business .
Tesla Motors of San Carlos wants to sell electric power trains , in addition to its luxury electric sports cars .
" If you 're invested in electric drivetrains , you do n't have to place all your bets on hydrogen , or batteries or any particular fuel , " said Roland Hwang , a vehicles specialist with the Natural Resources Defense Council .
And while few people get excited about buses , they remain the world 's workhorses of public transportation .
Running them on electricity - or a combination of electricity and diesel in the case of hybrids - would help clear the air .
" It 's important to clean them up in terms of smog and greenhouse gas emissions , both in the United States and worldwide , " said Spencer Quong , senior vehicles engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists .
" Buses can be dirty . "
Installing Adura 's technology in all 1.3 million buses in China would cut their tailpipe emissions by 6.1 billion tons each year , Bush said .
That includes greenhouse gases , soot and other pollutants .
Rather than a single , massive battery , Adura 's power train uses a series of battery " modules , " as many as 10 per bus .
The number of modules can be changed depending on the needs of the specific vehicle .
And if one of the modules breaks down , the others will keep the bus running without interruption .
The power train 's name - MESA , short for Modular , Electronic , Scalable Architecture - comes from that design .
" Instead of this glob of batteries , we 've built intelligent battery packs , " Bush said .
That approach fits Bush 's background , which lies in the semiconductor industry rather than Detroit .
He founded Adura after kicking around ideas with several General Motors engineers , and won financial backing from New Frontier Renewable Energy , a green - tech fund that develops wind farms .
Although Adura has not begun full - scale manufacturing , Bush said the company should be able to sell the power trains for $ 155,000 apiece .
Other hybrid - diesel power trains now sell for more than $ 180,000 , he said .
Adura 's price is well above the $ 55,000 to $ 75,000 that regular bus power trains cost , Bush said .
But China 's government , which is trying to develop green technology and cut its dependence on oil , has shown an interest .
Adura signed an agreement last May with the China Automotive Technology and Research Center to test the power train in China .
Testing there should begin within the next 12 months .
That concerns Hwang , who wants the U.S. government to become more active in pursuing similar technologies .
" There 's a question of whether the United States is going to fall behind in the race for electric vehicles and electric drivetrain components , " he said .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Apple 's AAPL.O quarterly profit soared past Wall Street expectations on strong sales of iPhones and iPods , underscoring the popularity of the company 's relatively expensive products even in the midst of a weak economy .
Known for giving conservative outlooks , Apple projected profit and revenue for the current quarter below average Wall Street estimates , but that did not discourage investors , who drove its shares up 3 percent after - hours on Wednesday .
“ As the world economy began to spiral the big question on investors ’ minds was if the Apple brand was going to be resilient or particularly susceptible , ” said Oppenheimer analyst Yair Reiner .
“ I think that what these results show is that Apple and this brand are relatively resilient . ”
In the first quarter since Chief Executive Steve Jobs went on medical leave , net profit rose to $ 1.21 billion ( 835.6 million pounds ) , or $ 1.33 a share , compared to $ 1.05 billion , or $ 1.16 a share , a year ago .
Analysts had expected earnings of $ 1.09 a share , according to Reuters Estimates .
Revenue rose 8.7 percent to $ 8.16 billion in the fiscal second quarter ended March 28 , beating the average Street forecast of $ 7.96 billion .
“ I think in a better economy our sales certainly would have been higher but ... we have just reported the best non-holiday quarter in Apple ’s history despite the economy that we find ourselves in , ” Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer told Reuters in a telephone interview .
When asked about Jobs on a conference call , he said , “ We look forward to Steve returning to Apple at the end of June . ”
LOWER COMPONENT COSTS
Apple ’s gross margin rose to a higher - than - expected 36.4 percent , from 32.9 percent a year ago , benefiting from favourable commodity and component costs .
The company forecast fiscal third - quarter earnings of 95 cents to $ 1.00 a share on revenue of $ 7.7 billion to $ 7.9 billion .
That compared to Street estimates for earnings of $ 1.12 a share on revenue of $ 8.3 billion .
Apple said the revenue outlook reflects its decision to delay revenue recognition for iPhones sold on or after March 17 until its new iPhone operating system is released .
Apple did the same thing last year when it updated software .
While some analysts said it may be prudent for Apple to be conservative given the economy , Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves pointed to some worries that sales may slow as consumers anticipate new products coming to the market , including a possible new iPhone .
“ There is going to be concern in this quarter due to purchasing delays in front of new June product releases , but outside of that , it ’s really clean , ” he said of the results .
Apple shipped 3.79 million iPhones in the March quarter , better than the roughly 3.3 million units analysts were expecting but down from 4.4 million in the December period .
Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook said Apple was happy with its relationship with AT&T T.N , the exclusive U.S. carrier for the iPhone , and had no plans to change it .
Apple also said it would like to begin selling the iPhone in China in the next year .
More than 21 million iPhones have now been sold since launch in 2007 .
Combined with the iPod touch , which uses the same software as the iPhone , around 37 million units have been sold .
Apple expects to see the 1 billionth iPhone application downloaded from its online store on Thursday .
MAC SHIPMENTS IN LINE
Apple sold 11.01 million iPods during the quarter , above the 10 million forecast by analysts .
Mac computer shipments totalled 2.22 million , down from last year but in line with expectations .
“ Apple has been one of a few companies where business has been pretty strong throughout this economic downturn , ” said Eric Kuby , chief investment officer for Northstar Investment Management .
Shares of Apple rose to $ 125.10 in extended trading , after closing the regular Nasdaq session down 25 cents at $ 121.51 .
The stock has gained more than 50 percent since hitting a 52 - week low in January , despite some concerns about Jobs .
“ Apple is a $ 30 billion company .
It ’s an institution and clearly Jobs has been an iconic leader but ... there is a deep bench of talented people there at all levels , ” said Barry Jaruzelski , partner at Booz & Co .
The company ended the quarter with $ 29 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet , but Oppenheimer said there were no plans to announce a stock buyback or other forms of returning cash to shareholders .
The judge in The Pirate Bay trial has been accused of bias , after Sweden 's national radio station revealed that Thomas Norström was a member of the same pro-copyright groups as several of the main entertainment industry reps in the case .
Sveriges Radio's P3 news programme claimed Norström is signed up to the Swedish Copyright Association ( Svenska föreningen för upphovsrätt ) , which also counts Henrik Pontén , Peter Danowsky and Monique Wadsted as members .
All three represented the entertainment industry in the case against BitTorrent tracker site The Pirate Bay .
Additionally , the judge sits on the board of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property ( Svenska föreningen för industriellt rättsskydd ) , which is lobbying for tougher copyright laws .
However , Norström insisted to the radio station that his membership of the various copyright protection groups did not “ constitute a conflict of interest ” .
Unsurprisingly , one of the defendants ’ lawyers in the case has disagreed with that standpoint and this morning called for a retrial .
" I will point that out in my appeal , then the Court of Appeal ( Hovrätten ) will decide if the district court decision should be set aside and the case revisited , " Peter Sunde ’s lawyer Peter Althin said today , according to The Local .
" In the autumn I received information that a lay judge could have similar connections .
I sent these to the court and the judge was excluded in order to prevent a conflict of interest .
It would have been reasonable to then review this situation as well . "
Expert attorney Leif Silbersky told Sveriges Radio that if any of the lawyers representing The Pirate Bay wanted to demand a retrial , it would have to happen “ immediately ” .
Meanwhile , Pirate Party chairman Rickard Falkvinge accused the copyright lobby of bringing “ corruption ” to Sweden .
Sunde - aka BrokeP - characteristically used Twitter to give his views about the latest revelation .
“ For those who missed it - the #spectrial judge seems to be working within the copyright lobby .
Breaking news right now in Sweden , ” he wrote earlier today .
More recently he cockily quipped : “ Oh how I love the smell of victory in the morning . ”
We asked the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry to comment on Norström 's close ties to pro-copyright groups , but at time of writing it had n't got back to us . ®

NEW DELHI , April 7 ( UPI ) --
An angry Sikh journalist who threw his shoe at India 's home minister in New Delhi was released Tuesday without charge , police say .
Jarnail Singh , identified as a longtime correspondent with the Hindi language daily newspaper Dainik Jagran , was taken away by security guards from a news conference with Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram after hurling his sneaker at the Cabinet member , CNN reported .

The shoe barely missed Chidambaram 's face , who called for calm after the incident .
Singh was later released without charges , Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat told the U.S. broadcaster .
Singh was angered by Chidambaram 's refusal to answer a question about the nomination by his Congress Party of a lawmaker who was accused of fanning mob actions against Sikh minority members following the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards .
CNN reported that India 's federal police recommended withdrawal of the case against the lawmaker , Jagdish Tytler , due to lack of credible evidence .
Israel has settled hundreds of thousands of its citizens on occupied land
A Palestinian military court has condemned a man to death by hanging for treason for selling land to Israelis .
Anwar Breghit , 59 , was convicted by a court in the West Bank town of Hebron .
He sold property near his village " that he did not own " , prosecutors said .
Correspondents say the sentence , which has to be approved by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , is not expected to be carried out .
The Palestinian leader has withheld his approval in several similar cases .
Only two people have had death sentences against them carried out , although others have been summarily executed over suspicions that they sold land to Israelis .
The land near the Palestinian village of Beit Omar that Anwar Breghit sold ended up in the possession of Jewish settlers residing in the nearby settlement of Karmei Tzur .
Israel occupied the West Bank and other Arab territory in the 1967 war .
It has settled more than 400,000 of its own citizens in the West Bank and East Jerusalem - illegally in the eyes of international law , although Israel disputes this .
The continued presence and expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank is one of the main points of contention in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Friction between settlements and the more than two million Palestinians in the West Bank frequently leads to violence and bloodshed .

BOSTON — If young Joba Chamberlain misbehaves tomorrow night , he might face a spanking from someone else ’s Papi .
With Chamberlain scheduled to start for the Yankees in the opener of a three - game series against the Red Sox , David Ortiz yesterday said the talented right - hander should avoid using Kevin Youkilis ’ head as a bull ’s - eye .
A - ROD RUNS IN TAMPA
YANKEES NO .
1 ON FORBES LIST
“ None of that , man — just play the game the way it ’s supposed to be , and that ’s about it , ” Ortiz said , referring to Chamberlain .
“ This is a guy , as good as he is , the next step for him will be to earn respect from everybody in the league .
He ’s not a bad guy , but when things like that happen , people get the wrong idea . ”
Considering he has fired four pitches either near Youkilis ’ head or behind Youkilis in the last 20 months , Chamberlain quickly has emerged as a villain to Red Sox Nation in this rivalry .
There were the consecutive pitches to Youkilis — one of which sailed behind him — in August of 2007 that got Chamberlain suspended .
Another close call occurred last July at Yankee Stadium , when Chamberlain threw high - and tight to Youkilis , nearly starting a bench clearing brawl .
Chamberlain uncorked another fastball three weeks later at Fenway that sent Youkilis to the dirt .
Angry glares were exchanged .
Why always Youkilis ?
“ I do n’t have an explanation , ” Ortiz said .
Talking to reporters at his locker for about 20 minutes between games of yesterday ’s split doubleheader against the Twins — the Yankees ’ game against the Athletics was on TV in the clubhouse —
Ortiz said this weekend will not feel like the normal Yankees - Red Sox circus .
“ This one is an easy one — they are missing A - Rod , ” Ortiz said .
Though Ortiz considers Alex Rodriguez a close friend , the Red Sox designated hitter said he has n’t spoken recently to A - Rod , who is continuing his rehab from arthroscopic hip surgery .
Nevertheless , Ortiz said he will not miss him this weekend .
“ You do n’t have the best player in the game in your lineup , it makes it different , ” Ortiz said .
But the Yankees are also a different team , having added CC Sabathia , A.J. Burnett and Mark Teixeira since Ortiz last saw them .
Sabathia is n’t scheduled to pitch in the series , but Burnett is slated for Saturday ’s start .
“ The pitching is the biggest move they made , ” Ortiz said .
“ Last year they had good hitters and all of them hit pretty good , but they would score 10 runs and the opposite team would score 12 .
It ’s just not right , you know ?
“ They let some good hitters go , so they definitely had to go for the good hitter , which was Teixeira .
But pitching wise they really needed some help . ”
If Ortiz is jealous of Teixeira it ’s from what Big Papi has seen of the new Yankee Stadium , where balls are jumping into the right field seats .
“ I saw some funky homers that one Cleveland series , ” Ortiz said .
“ I saw some balls going out , that I was like , ‘ Oh , that ’s a pop up . ’
The next thing you know , it was out of there . ” mpuma@nypost.com
Anfuso believes sales jumped for a few reasons .
First , tax credits .
A federal tax credit of $ 8,000 for first time home buyers was aided by a $ 10,000 state tax credit in California for buying new homes .
Why a tax credit for a new home ?
To keep California ’s job - generating home building industry busy .
But the state program is capped at $ 100 million , and those $ 10,000 credits will probably run out by June .
Still , it ’s been a boon for first - time buyers to be able to have a total of $ 18,000 in credits on a new home which they can now buy for only $ 190,000 .
Florsheim has had to slash prices that low to compete with foreclosures .
Can it make a profit ?
“ Making money went out the window two years ago , ” Anfuso says .
“ We ’re just contributing to cash flow . ”
The point is to stay alive until “ this market turns . ”
He ’s not saying when that is , but new home inventory in a two mile area around his Manteca development has gone from 130 homes two years ago to 17 .
More Real Estate Stories Including :
Florsheim is also staying alive by doing more than building homes .
It is getting asset management contracts from banks and lenders to handle their stagnant new home developments .
“ We ’re out there doing everything from storm drain protection to finishing ( and selling ) the homes , ” Anfuso says .
And he ’s also dipped his toe back into buying land , participating in a joint venture to buy land once worth $ 120,000 a lot for $ 18,000 .
The problem remains that these new homes continue to compete against a seemingly never - ending supply of foreclosures .
There is both good news and bad news on that front .
“ We ’ve reached affordability in our market , ” says realtor Kevin Moran of PMZ Real Estate .
When a home is priced right , Moran says , “ we get three to four offers in the first weekend on the same house . ”
Prices have stabilized and inventory is down .
That ’s the good news .
The bad news is that no one really knows how much real inventory is out there in Stockton .
Moran has a second line of work where he goes out and assesses the condition of homes for lenders who may want to rework the loans .
We followed him to one such home .
It was empty .
The owners were long gone .
“ I appraise and inspect over 200 homes a month , and , anecdotally , 30 to 40 percent are vacant and the lender does n’t know it , ” he says .
That means there could be a second wave of foreclosed properties hitting the market in the next five or six months .
But why would someone abandon a home before they ’ve even been foreclosed on ?
Moran pointed to the house we were looking at .
The debt owed was $ 403,000 .
A year ago , the bank agreed to a short sale , and the home went on the market for $ 230,000 .
The price was eventually lowered to $ 165,000 , but the thing never sold .
A couple of offers fell through .
In February of this year , it was taken off the market , and the family just left .
“ There ’s too many bad memories to walk in the front door , ” Moran says .
“ A lot of people , when you stop making the payment , there ’s no joy in returning home . ”
So they leave , and it takes the banks months to figure this out , and months more to put the home into foreclosure .
Still , Moran says the buyers are returning to Stockton , especially those who were priced out of the housing boom .
One tangible sign : there is less “ foreclosure brown ” .
“ The lawns are getting green again , and people are out in the yards , ” he says .
“ That part of it is very encouraging . ”

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Comedy writer Andrea Wachner hated the idea of going to her 10 - year high school reunion so much that she hired a stripper to go instead , and what followed , she says , was a comical study in human nature .
Andrea Wachner , a television comedy writer and aspiring filmmaker , who hired a stripper to impersonate her at her 10 - year high school reunion , is shown in this undated publicity photograph .
REUTERS / Christina von Messling / Handout
Her story is detailed in a nearly 40 - minute documentary directed by Wachner that , because of issues surrounding its length and getting approval to show it from former classmates , may never be seen -- not even by her parents .
But the 31 - year - old Los Angeles resident said on Friday she hopes it will someday and even if not , Hollywood already has come knocking on her door .
She has written a feature film script based on her story , is trying to sell a reality TV show from it , has appeared on cable news channel CNN , and is scheduled to be on ABC ’s morning chat show “ Good Morning America ” next week .
“ I ’ve been so lucky throughout this whole experience .
Everything that could go wrong , went right , ” she told Reuters .
“ I love the way it all turned out . ”
But some of her classmates do n’t .
“ There have been a few people that were pretty vitriolic , and I have received some angry letters , ” she said .
In 1995 , Wachner graduated from Palos Verdes Peninsula High School in an upscale Los Angeles - area neighborhood and never looked back .
She left for New York City , where she attended New York University , graduating in 2000 .
When she received the invitation to attend her 10 - year reunion , she said she would not have dreamed of going because she hated her years at the school , where BMW and Mercedes - Benz cars were prized possessions .
DRINKING , DRAMA AND DANCE
She claims that at school , fellow students ’ drinking alcohol was a problem and eating disorders were common .
She said academic competition was tight and the overall environment was “ a pressure cooker . ”
Wachner did n’t want to go back to all that , but she did want to see how people would react if the self - described “ drama geek ” showed up a changed woman -- a stripper , no less .
So , she hired Amy Bernadette “ Cricket ” Russell , whom she met at a Los Angeles strip club , to impersonate her .
Cricket showed up in a slinky dress , fishnet hose and spike heels .
As the drinks flowed , Cricket ’s clothes came off , and Wachner watched from a hotel room above the event , linked to her impersonator via wireless radio , TV cameras and a monitor .
Wachner coached Cricket through the night , telling her the names of people she met and providing her with little secrets that only Wachner and her former classmates would know .
Judging from the film 's promotional trailer , which can be seenhere , a few people may have been fooled and a few were not .
Andrea -- make that Cricket -- got one invitation for a private performance .
Wachner said she did not set out to embarrass or make fun of classmates .
Rather , she wanted to see how they would react if their old stereotype of Wachner as a “ drama geek ” was turned upside down , when she emerged from the cocoon of high school as an uninhibited artist and exotic dancer .
“ I love taking things that exist in the world as given -- things that are mainstream , notions that people take for granted -- and making people re-think them , ” she said .
While she may not be as big a name as Web sensation Susan Boyle , who skyrocketed to fame this month after a video of her appearance on “ Britain ’s Got Talent ” went viral online , Wachner is nevertheless overjoyed with the outcome .
And why not ?
Palos Verdes Peninsula
High is a distant memory , and now Hollywood beckons .
Conservatives howled , when word leaked that the Obama White House might be looking to " cut " the Pentagon 's budget request for the next fiscal year .
But it 's only under the odd rules of Beltway bizarroland that this can be considered in any way a trim .
As *CQ's * Josh Rogin reports , Team Obama wants an eight percent , $ 40 billion increase in the Defense Department budget – from $ 487.7 billion in 2009 to $ 527.7 billion in 2010 .
But this uptick is only about half the size as the one the Joint Chiefs originally requested , in a $ 584 billion draft budget , complied last fall .
So cue the all - too - predictable cries of Obama - as - hippie .
" When it comes to the budget it appears that the choices Obama is making are all too reflective of a man who not long ago had the most liberal voting record in the Senate , " sniffs Max Boot .
Oh , please .
The
$ 527 billion figure is " what the Bush people thought was the right number last February and that ’s the number we ’re going with , " an Office of Management and Budget official tells Rogin .
" The Joint Chiefs did that to lay down a marker for the incoming administration that was unrealistic .
It ’s more of a wish list than anything else . "
* Defense budget experts have said the draft by the Joint Chiefs , which was never publicly released , was designed to pressure the Obama administration to drastically increase defense spending or be forced to defend a reluctance to do so .
Defense officials in past outgoing administrations have left inflated budget estimates for incoming officials in the hope of raising the spending baseline .
In fact , the draft budget was never scrubbed by Bush ’s OMB , which had told federal agencies to submit draft budgets based on “ current services . ”
I 'm not even sure the Defense Secretary is interested in the Joint Chiefs '
mongo increases .
For more than a year , Robert Gates has been talking about how the Pentagon 's bloated budgets are going to have to come to an end .
In December , a member of his team said the new fiscal attitude was " going to be more of a Wal - Mart approach than a Gucci approach . "
In testimony before Congress last week , Robert Gates talked about making " hard choices " in the 2010 budget .
I 'm hearing rumblings from his shop about major cuts to defense programs , coming soon .
And I 'm talking real one - not Washington - style semantic trims .
UPDATE : On the other hand , Spencer Ackerman hears that Gates " may send OMB a letter objecting to the $ 527 billion ( outside of the wars ! ) ceiling .
I ’m trying to learn more about that now .
Could it be that despite the resource - shift talk , Gates does n’t mind a little budgetary good - cop - bad - cop ? "
And how much is the budget gonna change , really ?
The $ 487.7 billion figure for 2009 does n't include $ 25 billion more for military construction , notes Travis Sharp , with the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation .
Will the 2010 figure ?
And how does the stimulus bill 's billions for military construction figure in ?

ALSO :
Dario sighed , placing the call on hold to answer another .
" Network support , Dario speaking . "
" Hi , this is Seth , " the caller began , as though Dario knew who this " Seth " was .
" My computer is n't working today .
All morning , nothing . "
Specificity clearly was n't one of the caller 's strengths .
Before Dario could ask for more information , another call came in .
" Hold please , " he said , answering yet another support call .
The new caller introduced herself and complained of an inability to pull a file from the network .
In the background , Dario could hear Seth complaining " no , he put me on hold , I 'll find out in a minute ! "
All of the calls were coming from the same department .
The Network Layout
In theory , the undisclosed department of the government where Dario worked ( let 's call it the " Department of Government " ) had a pretty decent network setup .
In practice , the situation was n't so rosy .
The year was 1996 , and Dario was babysitting said network – and it was a very fussy baby .
Seldom did a day go by without a user losing connectivity to one of the servers .
The network was laid out like so :
A thick 10 Base5 " backbone " cable , with intrusive taps that provided them with AUI drops .
The tap would pierce the 10 Base5 cable and had an AUI connector on the other side .
From there , an AUI cable could connect to the NIC on the back of a server .
Several 10 Base2 hubs .
There were a dozen or so , each of which had roughly 20 computers on it .
The occasional fiber link to other buildings .
And with no false ceiling or floor to run the cables through , cables were draped from the ceilings with taps dangling like party streamers for the worst party you 've ever been to .
For each new system , Dario would have to run a cable down from the ceiling , cut it , add a T connector , hook the connector up to the 10 Base2 / BNC connector on the computer , go back up with the cable , run it to the next machine , and so on , ultimately ending the line in a terminator .
And throughout all of it , Dario had to keep in mind the minimum distance between computers , the maximum cable lengths , etc. , as required by the 802.3 standard .
90 % of the issues could be fixed by the obvious ; going to the user 's desk , looking around , and identifying what 's missing from the picture .
Had someone unplugged the T connector from the NIC ?
Maybe ; the cleaning crew would do this fairly often for whatever reason .
Had the terminator been removed or pulled off ?
Maybe .
They had a tendency to fall off or disappear altogether , and Dario never found out why .
This issue was different , though .
Dario had a dozen users lose their access !
He packed up his toolbox , hooked one thumb in his belt , and marched into the accounting department 's area .
The Troubleshooting Process
" I'm Dario and I 'm here to fix the network , " he announced , embarrassed that he 'd accidentally said it in a low voice like a superhero .
" * ahem * I mean , I 'll be checking all of your computers , but I 'll try to stay out of everyone 's way . "
OK , time for computer # 1 .
Had the cleaning crew unplugged it ?
No .
The connection from the computer to the T connector was fine , no signs of damage to the cable .
Second , third , fourth , and so on – same deal .
Just to be sure , he verified the terminator was there .
No signs of distress .
Meanwhile , Dario was overhearing the grief that his users were experiencing .
With no network access , they could n't process payments .
Without being able to process payments , they were even later than usual on some already wildly overdue payments .
" No , we have IT here right now , but I do n't think they 'll be able to fix it , " one of the users said into her phone loudly .
" I know , " she continued , " yes , I know , " she said , pausing .
" Look , I can't help you until our network issues are resolved . "
Every time Dario looked up , he 'd catch a stink eye from one of the accountants .
Without any user confidence , and vendors being driven up a wall since they would n't get paid while the network issues persisted , Dario worked as quickly as he could .
He switched the segment to another port on the same hub , still nothing .
He replaced the hub entirely , still no change .
Well , except that the users had begun fashioning shivs from whatever they had on their desks .
Desperate Times
There was no other option – they had to call Carl , the cabling guy .
Carl answered his voice with a kind of sinister cheerfulness ; the kind that an overacting movie villain would have after successfully luring the hero into a trap .
" I 'm on another call , " he said .
" And I 'll have to charge extra for the rush job .
And for bringing some of my guys over to help .
And for some extra hardware and cables .
But do n't worry , we 'll have you up and running again in no time . "
Fine by me , Dario thought , since we wo n't be able to pay the invoice until our network works anyway .
While he waited for Carl to arrive , Dario figured he could check the computers again ; specifically the one that belonged to Helga .
Helga was a very large woman , and messy .
Her desk had stacks of papers , books , office supplies , wrappers , and folders , most of which were covered under a thick layer of dust .
Worse , the mess had extended onto the floor under her desk , which is why it was the only desk that Dario had n't given a thorough check previously .
The blight cloud that surrounded her desk was why Dario had given it the least thorough check before .
Down on all fours , coughing and rubbing his eyes as his lungs filled with dust , he started excavating Helga 's computer .
Helga 's system had its network cable securely attached .
All that for nothing , he thought as he stood up and dusted himself off .
Following the cable to the T connector , he found that that was securely connected as well .
About two inches from the connector , though , the cable was damaged .
Odd , Dario thought , this looks ... intentional .
Going in for a closer look , he found a bundle of 15 or so copper strands tightly twisted to make a thicker cable .
Following that cable led him back to her desk .
The cable was connected to an ancient - looking AM / FM radio .
From Miles Away
" Helga , do you know what this is about , " Dario asked , pointing to the cable .
" Oh , well , you see , I brought in this radio so I could listen to music while I work . "
" And ...? "
Dario pressed .
" And somehow the antenna came loose , and I lost it . "
" And ...? "
" And the reception was n't very good then . "
Dario did n't speak , he just waited for her to continue .
" Actually , no reception at all !
So Johnny fixed it and now I can listen to radio stations from miles away !
It 's incredible ! "
Dario's expression revealed that he was n't as impressed as she 'd expected .
So Helga and her , uh , let 's say " resourceful " friend , were using the network infrastructure as a giant radio antenna .
And sure , it took down the network , but you have n't heard " Forever Young " until you 've heard it via a building - sized antenna !
By simply disconnecting Helga 's cable , everyone else was able to work again .
Dario called off the visit from Carl the cabling guy , and went back to his desk to decompress .
The first course of action ?
Typing up and distributing a memo explicitly forbidding use of network cabling for purposes other than ... network cabling .
No extended - range antenna , no jumping rope , no hanging clothes to dry , nothing .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Pirates attacked a U.S. - flagged cargo ship off the coast of Somalia with rockets and automatic weapons , but failed to board the craft , the ship ’s owner said on Tuesday .
Greek - owned MV Irene E.M carrier is seen in an undated photo .

The crew of the Liberty Sun was unharmed , but the vessel suffered damage , according to a statement from Liberty Maritime Corp of Lake Success , New York .
The ship immediately requested help from the U.S. Navy and was now under escort , the statement said .
“ We are grateful and pleased that no one was injured and the crew and the ship are safe , ” it said .
Liberty Maritime said the pirates fired rocket - propelled grenades and automatic weapons at the vessel , which was carrying U.S. food aid for African nations and was en route to Mombasa , Kenya , from Houston , it said .
A spokesman for U.S. Central Command had no immediate comment on the incident .
It was the second attack in a week on a U.S. - flagged ship in the region .
On Sunday , U.S. snipers killed three Somali pirates and freed the American ship captain they had been holding hostage for five days .
Heavily armed pirates from lawless Somalia have been increasingly striking the busy Indian Ocean shipping lanes and strategic Gulf of Aden , capturing dozens of vessels , hundreds of hostages and making off with millions of dollars in ransoms .
Earlier on Tuesday , Somali pirates hijacked two more cargo vessels and opened fire on a third in attacks that showed a determination to go on striking at shipping on the region ’s strategic trade routes .
The attacks were a clear sign pirate gangs have not been deterred by two raids in recent days in which U.S. and French special forces killed five pirates .
Technik
Die Provider sollen ihre Nameserver so umbauen , daß Webseiten , die das BKA aussucht und ihnen nennt , nicht erreichbar sind und dem Nutzer bei Aufruf stattdessen eine Sperrseite angezeigt wird .
Gleichzeitig soll das BKA jederzeit abrufen könne , welche Nutzer auf Webseiten aus dieser Liste zugreifen wollten und stattdessen auf die Sperrseite geleitet wurden .
Ein normaler Internetnutzer , der seinen Nameserver nicht auf einen freien DNS - Server umstellt , sieht bestimmte Seiten nicht und erhält die Mitteilung , er wolle sich gerade Kinderpornografie ansehen .
Ob das stimmt , weiß er nicht und nachprüfen darf er das auch nicht , da ja schon die Suche nach Kinderpornografie strafbar ist .
Der Nutzer muss sich in diesem Moment weiterhin im Klaren sein , daß er gerade etwas getan hat , was das BKA als illegal ansieht und als Grund ansehen kann , gegen ihn vorzugehen .
Die allein schon technisch verursachten Risiken für jeden Internetnutzer sind immens , noch dazu , weil man damit auch noch eine perfide Beweisumkehr eingebaut hat :
Sie müssen künftig ihre Unschuld beweisen , z.B. daß sie " versehentlich " die gesperrte Seite angesteuert haben .
Viel Spaß beim Versuch , Richtern TinyUrls , iFrames , Rootkitangriffe , Hidden Scripting und so weiter zu erklären , wenn Sie überhaupt wissen , was das ist .
Die Lösung zunächst : Den Nameserver umstellen , um sich dieser Gefahr vollständig zu entziehen .
Geht schnell und kann jeder .
Die Technik ist allerdings interessanterweise das kleinste Problem in dieser ganzen Geschichte .
Es gibt Staaten , die in ihren Zensurbemühungen schon wesentlich weiter sind .
Die Menschen dort können dennoch sowohl anonym als auch unzensiert das Internet benutzen .
Das Internet ist von Nerds gebaut worden .
Ein Staat kann da so viel fordern wie er will , er wird das Netz auf technischer Ebene never ever kontrollieren können .
Verwaltung
Hier liegen die springende Punkte , die das Ganze zum Zensurinstrument machen :
1 . Die gesperrten Inhalte stehen auf einer Liste , die das BKA direkt und ohne Prüfungsinstanz erstellt und die die Provider möglichst ohne sie anzuschauen zu installieren haben .
Es entscheidet kein Richter über den Inhalt , es überprüft keine unabhängige Institution über die Rechtmäßigkeit , es gibt keine Regelung , wie Adressen überhaupt wieder von der Liste gelöscht werden könnten .
Die Polizei , die Verbrecher verfolgt , bestimmt , welcher Wunsch nach welcher Information ein Verbrechen ist .
Vorab zu definieren , was ein Verbrechen ist und hinterher darüber zu entscheiden , ob ein Verbrechen begangen wurde ist aber nicht Aufgabe der Polizei .
2. Die Liste ist geheim .
So lange diese Liste nicht in die Öffentlichkeit gerät kann alles drinstehen und nichts davon muss gerechtfertigt werden .
Wer das in Frage stellt wird zum Verdächtigen .
Wie Zensur in Reinform eben funktioniert .
3 . Der Gesetzentwurf ist schwammig genug , daß das BKA im Prinzip alles in die Liste setzen kann .
Da im Web jeder I nhalt nur einen Klick weiter vom letzten entfernt ist und das Gesetz möchte , daß auch " mittelbare " Seiten gesperrt werden können , kann somit de facto auch jede Seite gesperrt werden .
4. Das System soll die direkte Verfolgung von Zugriffen erlauben .
es wird nicht nur gesperrt , sondern es kann auch nachgeschaut werden , wer sich die gesperrten Seiten ansehen will .
Dies kann dann
Anlass für verdeckte Überwachungen , Hausdurchsuchungen und andere existenzbedrohende Vorgänge sein .
Die Staatsanwälte dieses Landes üben ja seit einiger Zeit kräftig an der Vorverurteilungsfront , indem Sie inzwischen gerne mal Pressemitteilungen über eingeleitete Verfahren rausgeben und die Presse direkt zu möglichst spektakulär und öffentlichkeitswirksam inszenierten Verhaftungen mitnehmen ( Zumwinkel , Tauss , Frau B. ) .
Psychologie
Womit wir schon beim gewünschten Effekt von Zensur sind : Die Einführung der Schere im Kopf .
Die wirksame Selbstzensur , weil man nicht weiß , was eventuell passiert , wenn man zu laut und deutlich Kritik äußert .
Die Geheimhaltung der Sperrliste und ihre völlige Unverbindlichkeit durch das Fehlen jeglicher Kontolle ist ein bewußt eingesetzes Instrument , um Verunsicherung zu erzeugen .
Ein anderes ist die Verknüpfung mit dem Thema Kinderpornografie , womit wir wieder am Beginn dieses Artikels wären .
Man weiß ja inzwischen , daß auch nur der leiseste Ruch , man könnte eventuell irgendwas mit Kindesmissbrauch und Pädophilen zu tun haben , die Existenz vernichten kann , selbst wenn hinterher rauskommt , daß tatsächlich nichts an den Vorwürfen dran war .
Wie nahezu generell nichts rauskommt .
Das ist ein so extrem starkes und wirksames Druckmittel , was natürlich beispielsweise ein Herr Gorny sofort erkennt , weil sein Versuch , diese Schere im Kopf einzuführen ( durch den Versuch , Filesharing als schreckliches Verbrechen zu diskriminieren ) , wirkungslos blieb und er sich nun an den besser funktionierenden Trigger dranhängt ( indem er Urheberrechtsverletzung mit Kindesmissbrauch gleichsetzt ) .
Die Justizministerin gibt dann noch Tipps in die richtigen Richtungen , die natürlich prompt reagieren .
Überhaupt , das mal ganz nebenbei , finde ich es immer wieder seltsam , daß Frau Zypries immer wieder als Warnerin vermittelt wird .
Dabei war - so sagt sie zumindest - sie es , die den Gesetzentwurf gegenüber dem Vorabvertrag von Frau von der Leyen verschärfen ließ und dieser nun schon den Zugriff auf Stopp - Seiten verfolgen lassen will .
Um die Frage zu beantworten , warum und wann es in einer Gesellschaft überhaupt dazu kommen kann , daß ein Teil davon meint , einen solchen Eingriff vornehmen zu müssen und der andere Teil ( zu dem ich u.a. mich zähle ) darin ein so massives Unrecht sieht , das es zu bekämpfen gilt , kann man sich bitte den Artikel " Kampf der Kulturen " drüben bei netzpolitik.org durchlesen .

Microsoft recently released another ad in its “ Laptop Hunter ” series where they follow individuals looking for a computer with certain specifications .
If they can find it for under a certain price , Microsoft foots the bill .
Wow , I wonder if Sony has a similar deal for their LCD TV’s ?
In Microsoft ’s latest ad , we meet Giampaolo , a dashing young fellow looking for a powerful laptop for under $ 1500 .
He ends up at Fry ’s where he decides to check out some Macs .
Upon examining what seems to be a Macbook he remarks , “ This is soo Sexy . ”
But it ’s not love at first sight for Giampolo as he goes on to take a few jabs at Apple .
But Macs to me are about aesthetics more than they are about the computing power .
I do n’t want to pay for the brand , I want to pay for the computer .
Hmm , makes you wonder why he even checked out the Macs in the first place .
Giampaolo , who ’s a recent engineering grad , eventually ends up purchasing an HP HDX 16 .
Giampaolo ’s statements echo recent sentiments from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer where he said that consumers do n’t want to pay $ 500 more for a logo in tough economic times .
Are Microsoft ’s new commercials effective ?
These commercials are admittedly entertaining , but they fail to adequately address the real reasons users decide to switch to the Mac .
Microsoft still can’t come to grips with the fact that people are n’t buying Apple products to be “ cool ” , but rather because they deem the OS and user experience worthy of a premium .
It ’s not about the logo , it ’s about the quality that the logo has come to represent .
If Microsoft truly believes that people buy Apple products for the logo , how can they honestly expect their own products to compete when they ’re not even taking competitors seriously .
I mean , it ’s easy to dismiss the iPhone and the Mac , for example , if you think its advantages are minimal , and its success simply the result of some fad .
When will Microsoft learn that this ridiculous notion of “ coolness ” barely drives any significant sales at all .
There ’s a distinct difference between buying a product that you think is cool , and buying a product because you think it will make you cool .
People buy Macs because they can do cool things with them straight out of the box , not because they think they ’ll all of a sudden become popular and respected in their social circle .
If Microsoft wants to get people excited about using Windows , it needs to spend more time focusing on its own OS , and less time focusing on the notion of the “ cool Mac user . ”
Many young Swedes support Pirate Bay 's file - sharing system
Sweden 's Pirate Party says it has had a surge in membership , giving its leaders hope that anti-corporate feeling will translate into electoral success .
The party is campaigning in the June European elections , fielding 20 candidates .
It wants sweeping reform of copyright law and an end to patents .
The membership boost followed the jailing last week of four founders of a file - sharing website , The Pirate Bay .
The party says membership soared from 14,711 to 36,624 in just a few days .
Party leader Rick Falkvinge told BBC
News that " in terms of membership it is now the fourth largest party in Sweden " .
" If everybody who is angry about the Pirate Bay verdict votes then we 'll get at least one MEP , " he said , referring to the elections for the European Parliament .
Landmark case
Hundreds of supporters of Pirate Bay demonstrated in the Swedish capital Stockholm on Saturday , some of them waving Jolly Roger flags .
In the verdict against the world 's most high - profile file - sharing website , the Stockholm district court found Frederik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Carl Lundstrom and Peter Sunde guilty of breaking copyright law and sentenced them to a year in jail .
They were also ordered to pay $ 4.5 m ( £ 3 m ) in damages .
Record companies welcomed the verdict , but the men plan to appeal .
Mr Falkvinge said support for the Pirate Party was not only coming from young people , but also " a considerably older crowd saying ' enough is enough ' . "
" They see how these laws break civil liberties in an unacceptable way , " he said .
He said the party membership was split about 50 - 50 between people aged under 25 and over .
But its youth section is " by far the largest " among Swedish political parties , he added .
The party says it has only three issues on its agenda : " to fundamentally reform copyright law , get rid of the patent system and ensure that citizens ' rights to privacy are respected " .
Mr Falkvinge said it was funded entirely by private donations , typically of 100 kronor ( £8 ; $ 12 ) .
The Pirate Bay , with an estimated 22 million users , is reckoned to be the most popular of the many file - sharing sites on the internet .
Its success angered executives and artists in the music , TV and film industries , who saw the Swedish case as an important step in stamping out the illegal sharing of copyrighted media .
The below is an extract from Fred Brooks ' ( Frederick P. Brooks , Jr. ) book , The Mythical Man-Month .
This is one of the best explanations of why programming is so interesting .
It touches on all aspects of the mystique of programming .
If you have n't read the book , go out , buy it , and read it .
The book was first published in 1974 and then republished in 1995 .
What Fred Brooks had to say then based on his experiences with the development of the OS / 360 system is still relevant today .

Why is programming fun ?
What delights may its practioner expect as his reward ?
First is the sheer joy of making things .
As the child delights in his mud pie , so the adult enjoys building things , especially things of his own design .
I think this delight must be an image of God 's delight in making things , a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake .
Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people .
Deep within , we want others to use our work and to find it helpful .
In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child 's first clay pencil holder " for Daddy 's office . "
Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle - like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles , playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning .
The programmed computer has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism , carried to the ultimate .
Fourth is the joy of always learning , which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task .
In one way or another the problem is ever new , and its solver learns something : sometimes practical , sometimes theoretical , and sometimes both .
Finally , there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium .
The programmer , like the poet , works only slightly removed from pure thought - stuff .
He builds his castles in the air , from air , creating by exertion of the imagination .
Few media of creation are so flexible , so easy to polish and rework , so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures . (...)
Yet the program construct , unlike the poet 's words , is real in the sense that it moves and works , producing visible outputs separately from the construct itself .
It prints results , draws pictures , produces sounds , moves arms .
The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time .
One types the correct incantation on a keyboard , and a display screen comes to life , showing things that never were nor could be .
Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men .
AT&T has an exclusive iPhone deal through at least 2010 , but it may not extend to the non-iPhone " media pad " that Apple is reportedly building .
Apple and Verizon Wireless may have found a sneaky way to work together without violating Apple 's exclusivity contract with AT&T , which runs at least through 2010 .
As we reported in 2007 , AT&T 's contract with Apple covers " all models " of the iPhone .
But it only covers iPhones .
So if Apple builds something that is n't an iPhone , well , all bets are off .
If BusinessWeek is to be believed , Apple is working on a " media pad that would let users listen to music , view photos , and watch high - definition videos , " and which would " place calls over a Wi - Fi connection . "
If the device does n't make cellular voice calls , it may be able to avoid the iPhone 's AT&T exclusivity .
According to BusinessWeek , Apple has been talking to Verizon Wireless about the device , as well as about another " iPhone - like " device which may be the .
Verizon has already been experimenting in the VOIP media pad space with the , a home - based media pad that makes Wi -Fi calls .
Apple 's product would hopefully work better than the Hub , though .
Getting an iPhone Mini onto Verizon before 2010 may prove much more difficult than launching a media pad , because of the iPhone exclusivity contract with AT&T .
In any case , no deal has yet been sealed , BusinessWeek said .
Yesterday , USA Today reported that Verizon and Apple are talking about possibly introducing .
Comments from Verizon's CEO Ivan Seidenberg and Apple 's COO Tim Cook have led us to believe that device would run on Verizon 's upcoming LTE network , not the carrier 's current CDMA network , as USA Today reported .
We expect Apple to announce the next iPhone on June 9 .
Notre Dame President Fr. John Jenkins continues to flail about for an adequate response ( though short of resigning , there is n't an adequate response ) to his monumental gaff of bestowing an honorary doctor of laws degree on a president who has spent his entire political career seeing to it that millions of human beings are excluded from the protection of law .
Jenkin's latest lunge
is for the life ring stamped " canon lawyers we consulted " .
Figures .
It is paradigmatic of the theological Left to ignore canon law when it poses the slightest inconvenience for its plans , but to hide behind canons ( or at least behind canonists , even anonymous ones ) when they afford some cover ( however thin ) for obvious blunders or malfeasance .
And so Jenkins , invoking unidentified canon lawyers , holds that the USCCB 's 2004 statement , "
Catholics in Political Life
" , merely restricts Catholic institutions from honoring Catholics whose public record evidences disdain for fundamental moral principles .
Is the man serious ?
Does Jenkins really think that Catholic bishops would countenance a Catholic institution honoring a philanthropic murderer , or a free - speech crusading pornographer , or a right - to - privacy pimp , provided merely that the awardee was not a Catholic ?
Really , that 's too bizarre for words .
But speaking of words , Jenkins ' unnamed canon lawyers ( assuming , by the way , that they were answering the question Jenkins thought he was asking , and that Jenkins understood and is accurately conveying their response ) tell him that " by definition , only Catholics who implicitly recognize the authority of Church teaching can act in ' defiance ' of it . "
Huh ?
What 's this " by definition " stuff ?
What definition ?
A definition of " defiance " ?
The word " defiance " is not in the Code .
Even the Latin pertinacia does not seem to apply to our facts , so , what exactly is Jenkins talking about here ?
I do n't know , but whatever Jenkins or his canonists hope it means , the sentence he / they put so much stock in was obviously not drafted to stand up to close textual parsing .
Else , all a Catholic would have to do to avoid the charge of acting in " defiance " of Church authority would be to decline recognizing Church authority in the first place !
Likewise , watch how Jenkin 's claim that bestowing an honorary doctorate on the pro-abortion movement 's most powerful politician ever does not " suggest support " for the politician 's pro-abortion record , can be parsed into a defense of Jenkins : an honorary doctorate of law does not " suggest " support for a politicians ' legal philosophy , no , instead it screams it .
Therefore , Jenkins is not guilty of " suggesting " support .
Are n't word games fun ?
Seriously , what I wonder is , why , amid the canon lawyers Jenkins claims to have consulted , not one , it seems , pointed out the most obvious solutions to their client 's problem :
The USCCB 's statement applies only to " Catholic institutions " , right ?
Well , all Jenkins and the ND board need do is declare that Notre Dame is not a " Catholic institution " , and poof ! all these problems disappear .
Notre Dame could confer honorary doctorates in law on anybody it wants after that , even on people who have built a career out of denying unborn babies the protection of law , and nary a bishop would say a word about it .
Police officers accused of drunken driving .
A female officer 's alleged promiscuity and infidelity .
A commander whose critics labeled his son a child molester .
Jeff Pataky said he uses negative complaints and anonymous tips to fuel his blogging crusade against Phoenix police .
A headline on his Web site suggests rewards would be provided for " dirt " on police indiscretions .
Pataky , a former software sales and marketing executive who now focuses his energy shoveling content on www.badphoenixcops.com, said he believes his online criticism of the department - along with past criticisms of police investigations - led officers to serve a search warrant at his home last week .
Police officials said Wednesday that a Phoenix detective prompted the investigation after complaining about harassment , though they declined further comment .
Pataky said he felt the investigation was a response to a lawsuit he filed on Monday in U.S. District Court saying he was maliciously prosecuted by police in 2007 after his ex-wife accused him of harassment , a case later dropped .
In his lawsuit he 's asking for an unspecified amount for damages .
City officials declined to comment on pending litigation .
Pataky 's blog is known in law - enforcement circles for its off - color language that , according to the blogger , is aimed at Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris , Maricopa County Andrew Thomas and other public officials .
" Too bad .
They need to get over it , " Pataky said .
" They are held to a higher accountability . "
Pataky said he edits the blog and works with four or five people who receive tips from a variety of sources , including sworn and retired officers .
Investigators confiscated computer material and other items from Pataky 's north Phoenix home , which he considered a threat to quit writing .
" We have heard internally from our police sources that they purposefully did this to stop me , " Pataky said .
" They took my cable modem and wireless router .
Anyone worth their salt knows nothing is stored in the cable modem . "
Phoenix Assistant Chief Andy Anderson said the harassment case is unique because of the connection to an unaccredited grassroots Web site .
He said the blog is one part of the case , though he did not provide specifics of the ongoing investigation .
" This is n't about the blog , " Anderson said .
" That 's just where the investigation led . "
Police also served a separate search warrant at the home of former homicide Detective David Barnes , one of the investigators on the " Baseline Rapist " case .
Barnes was demoted from the homicide unit to patrol after he went public one year ago with claims of mismanaged evidence at the city 's crime lab .
Mark Spencer , president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association , said he was concerned about questionable probable cause to enter Barnes ' house .
The union , which claims no affiliation with Pataky 's blog , will represent Barnes through the internal investigation .
In the city of Oslo in Norway , the local government has a green - tinted vision - a vision that entails the usage of sewage as a source of renewable energy .
In the city of Oslo in Norway , the local government has a green - tinted vision - a vision that entails the usage of sewage as a source of renewable energy .
The city 's Bekkelaget sewage treatment plant handles wastes from 250,000 people and the ones in charge of this particular project sees that " waste " as something more .
To be exact , the plan is to introduce public buses that run on biofuel by 2010 .
And by " biofuel , " I meant methane derives from sewage sludge .
" It 's a win - win situation :
It 's carbon neutral , it hardly pollutes the environment , it 's less noisy and its endlessly renewable , " a project member called Ole Jakob Johansen says .
The collected human wastes from 250,000 people can apparently produce enough biomethane to run a total of 80 buses for 62,000 miles each .
The result is a carbon neutral operation and emissions which are 78 percent less in nitrogen oxide and 98 percent in less solid particles than usual .
If the project pulls through , the biomethane would cost 98 cents per liter .
And , the moment the whole Oslo bus fleet converts , Oslo 's carbon dioxide emissions will be reduced by 30,000 per annum .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : priority - sync - 0.1.0.1 : Cooperative task prioritization .
http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/priority-sync
$ cabal install priority - sync git clone
http://www.downstairspeople.org/git/priority-sync.git
Feedback will be greatly appreciated .
This package is a spin - off from my work on roguestar , where I need to do significant background processing while retaining enough resources to perform smooth animation .
The following is the front - page documentation for the package .
In a simple use case , we want to run some expensive tasks in prioritized order , so that only one task is running on each CPU ( or hardware thread ) at any time .
For this simple case , four operations are needed : simpleTaskPool , schedule , claim , and startQueue .
let expensiveTask = threadDelay 1000000 pool <- simpleTaskPool forkIO $ claim Acquire ( schedule pool 1 ) $ putStrLn " Task 1 started . . . " >> expensiveTask >> putStrLn " Task 1 completed . " forkIO $ claim Acquire ( schedule pool 3 ) $ putStrLn " Task 3 started . . . " >> expensiveTask >> putStrLn " Task 3 completed . " forkIO $ claim Acquire ( schedule pool 2 ) $ putStrLn " Task 2 started . . . " >> expensiveTask >> putStrLn " Task 2 completed . " threadDelay 100000 -- contrive to wait for all tasks to become enqueued putStrLn " Starting pool : " startQueue pool threadDelay 4000000 -- contrive to wait for all tasks to become dequeued A TaskPool combines Rooms and Queues in an efficient easy - to - use - interface .
Rooms provide fully reentrant synchronization to any number of threads based on arbitrary resource constraints .
For example , the Room from a simpleTaskPool is constrained by GHC.numCapabilities .
Queues provide task prioritization .
A Queue systematically examines ( to a configurable depth ) all waiting threads with their priorities and resource constraints and wakes the most eagerly prioritized thread whose constraints can be satisfied .
TaskPools are not thread pools .
The concept is similar to IO Completion Ports .
There are no worker threads .
If a number of threads are waiting , the thread that is most likely to be processed next is woken and temporarily serves as a working thread .
Rooms , Queues , and TaskPools are backed by carefully written STM ( software transactional memory ) transactions .
A salient feature is that , because any thread can participate , a TaskPool supports both bound threads and threads created with forkOnIO .

Home Detecting Data Race and Atomicity Violation via Typestate - Guided Static Analysis Detecting Data Race and Atomicity Violation via Typestate - Guided Static Analysis .
Yue Yang , Anna Gringauze , Dinghao Wu , Henning Rohde .
Aug. 2008
The correctness of typestate properties in a multithreaded program often depends on the assumption of certain concurrency invariants .
However , standard typestate analysis and concurrency analysis are disjoint in that the former is unable to understand threading effects and the latter does not take typestate properties into consideration .
We combine these two previously separate approaches and develop a novel typestate - driven concurrency analysis for detecting race conditions and atomicity violations .
Our analysis is based on a reformulation of typestate systems in which state transitions of a shared variable are controlled by the locking state of that variable .
By combining typestate checking with lockset analysis , we can selectively transfer the typestate to a transient state to simulate the thread interference effect , thus uncovering a new class of typestate errors directly related to low - level or high - level data races .
Such a concurrency bug is more likely to be harmful , compared with those found by existing concurrency checkers , because there exists a concrete evidence that it may eventually lead to a typestate error as well .
We have implemented a race and atomicity checker for C/C++ programs by extending a NULL pointer dereference analysis .
To support large legacy code , our approach does not require a priori annotations ; instead , it automatically infers the lock / data guardianship relation and variable correlations .
We have applied the toolset to check a future version of the Windows operating system , finding many concurrency errors that cannot be discovered by previous tools .
Typestates extend the ordinary types by recoding the state of objects and allowing the safety violations that stem from operations being invoked on objects that are in the wrong state .

Fulham Down Nine - Man Manchester United
We have a title race : Manchester United have lost consecutive league games to allow Liverpool and Chelsea a glimpse of the top of the table .
Murphy and Gera netted the strikes to give Fulham the win over nine - man United ...
Fulham 2 - 0 Manchester United
Fulham had not won against United here since 1964 , and against a frustrated rival , executed their gameplan to perfection to stop the rot .
Home form , a boon earlier in the season , had begun to wobble of late but this result will augment the Cottagers ' European hopes .
Fulham triumphed thanks to a first - half Danny Murphy penalty and a goal on the break by Zoltan Gera with two minutes to play .
Each goal brought a United dismissal ; Paul Scholes was sent off prior to the Murphy penalty for handling , while Wayne Rooney blew his top in the wake of Gera 's clincher .
There were off - days for Ronaldo , Berbatov and company , and despite battering Fulham for large swathes of the second half , Manchester United fell .
Not a good day at the office for Sir Alex .
It may be , for him at least , squeaky bum time .
First Half
Sir Alex Ferguson shuffled his deck , making some alterations to the side that lost to Liverpool last weekend ; Dimitar Berbatov replaced Wayne Rooney in an attacking capacity for the visitors in one of their more noteworthy changes , but it was Ferguson stalwart Scholes who was to be the chief protagonist in the first period .
Fulham , for their part , named the same XI that won at Bolton Wanderers last week and started on the front foot .
Clint Dempsey went close early on with a drive , before United had a decent chance of their own .
Patrice Evra , booked for diving at the end of the half , crossed from the left but Berbatov could n't direct his header on the target .
The hosts maintained control of the game , dictated the pace in the opening stages and made United uncomfortable on a ground on which they triumphed 4 - 0 only a fortnight ago .
Bobby Zamora had a clutch of first half chances , but could n't convert .
He sent the first of a few speculative drives wide on the quarter - hour .
Fulham 's early dominance was rewarded as soon as the 17th minute , when the Cottagers were given a penalty and Ferguson 's side reduced to ten men .
Simon Davies fired in a corner , which was flicked on by Zamora .
His effort prompted a handball on the line by Paul Scholes , who was shown the red card .
Danny Murphy , not for the first time in his career , netted a penalty against the Red Devils .
The northern side failed to rouse themselves and were lucky not to be two - down on 20 minutes when Van der Sar saved from Zamora .
Zamora was again repelled by the occupied Dutchman before Dempsey stuck narrowly wide on the half - hour , as United continued to be sub-par .
Dickson Etuhu , from a Dempsey cross , made Van der Sar work again ; Rio Ferdinand and Jonny Evans could not get to grips with their adversaries .
Zamora , one of the more prominent first half performers , then unleashed a vicious strike , which was well - fielded by Van der Sar .
The champions went in at half - time a shadow of their selves ; their game was blighted by a lack of responsibility and a palpable crisis of confidence in possession .
Second Half
No doubt on the end of the hairdryer treatment at half - time , it was a vastly improved Manchester United that appeared after the break .
Park Ji
Sung fired narrowly over immediately , as the world champions attempted to gain parity .
United dictated the second half tempo , but with their new - found attacking instincts now functioning , there remained the danger of a counterattack .
Nonetheless , a Ronaldo header , from Darren Fletcher 's cross served to remind the Londoners who they were dealing with .
Just wide on that occasion .
A Zamora shot , from an unlikely angle , alleviated the Fulham pressure and gave United a jitter before Rooney fed Ronaldo to shoot straight at Schwarzer on the hour .
Fletcher was next to try his luck , before a combination of Rooney and Ronaldo almost prised Hodgson 's side open .
The Scouser crossed from the right and Ronaldo , frustrated to the point of a booking , could only direct his header at Australia 's number 1 .
The custodian had to be on full alert moments later , pulling off an incredible pair of saves to protect Fulham 's clean sheet .
Park fired from close range and was denied ; Rooney 's follow up was shut out by Schwarzer in stunning fashion .
The wave of pressure never let up ; Ferdinand , as well as Ronaldo and Rooney had another chance apiece as the game ebbed towards the last 15 minutes .
However , that threat of a counterattack ultimately outdid the Champions League holders .
Pouring forward , Ferguson 's side were caught by Andy Johnson running down the right with only two minutes on the clock .
The Red Devils had scant cover when Johnson sent the cross over .
Substitute Zoltan Gera was well placed in the box to control and fire an overhead shot into the corner to sink United .
Wayne Rooney 's temper then further agonised Sir Alex ; throwing the ball away , the England forward was handed a second yellow card to reduce his side to nine men .
Facing fixtures with their cushion at the top eroded away is one thing , doing so without Nemanja Vidic , Scholes and Rooney is quite another .
Line Ups :
Fulham ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : Schwarzer - Paintsil , Hughes , Hangeland , Konchesky - Etuhu , Murphy ( Dacourt 67 ' ) , Davies , Dempsey ( Gera 82 ' ) - Zamora ( Kamara 77 ' ) , Johnson
Manchester United ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : van der Sar - O'Shea ( Tevez 70 ' ) , Evans , Ferdinand , Evra - Fletcher , Scholes , Park , Giggs - Ronaldo , Berbatov ( Rooney h/t )

A Warm TV Can Drive Away Feelings of Loneliness and Rejection
Studies find that illusionary relationships with TV characters can give us real pleasure
BUFFALO , N.Y . --
Not all technology meets human needs , and some technologies provide only the illusion of having met your needs .
But new research by psychologists at the University at Buffalo and Miami University , Ohio , indicates that illusionary relationships with the characters and personalities on favorite TV shows can provide people with feelings of belonging , even in the face of low self esteem or after being rejected by friends or family members .
The findings are described in four studies published in the current issue of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology .
" The research provides evidence for the ' social surrogacy hypothesis , ' which holds that humans can use technologies , like television , to provide the experience of belonging when no real belongingness has been experienced , " says one of the study 's authors , Shira Gabriel , Ph.D. , UB assistant professor of psychology .
" We also argue that other commonplace technologies such as movies , music or interactive video games , as well as television , can fulfill this need . "
Shira 's co-authors are Jaye L. Derrick , Ph.D. , postdoctoral associate and adjunct instructor of psychology at UB , and Kurt Hugenberg , Ph.D. , assistant professor of psychology at Miami University .
The first study , of 701 undergraduate students , used the Loneliness Activities Scale and the Likelihood of Feeling Lonely Scale to find that subjects reported tuning to favored television programs when they felt lonely and felt less lonely when viewing those programs .
Study 2 used essays to experimentally manipulate the belongingness needs of 102 undergraduate subjects and assess the importance of their favored television programs when those needs were stimulated .
Participants whose belongingness needs were aroused reveled longer in their descriptions of favored television programs than in descriptions of non-favored programs , the study found .
Study 3 of 116 participants employed the Rosenberg Self - Esteem Scale , the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and an eight - item measure of feelings of rejection to find that thinking about favored television programs buffered subjects against drops in self - esteem , increases in negative mood and feelings of rejection commonly elicited by threats to close relationships .
Study 4 asked 222 participants to write a 10 - minute essay about their favorite television program , and then to write about programs they watch " when nothing else is on , " or about experiencing an academic achievement .
They were then asked to verbally describe what they had written in as much detail as possible .
After writing about favored television programs , the subjects verbally expressed fewer feelings of loneliness or exclusion than when verbally describing either of the two control situations ( essays about programs watched when nothing else is on , academic achievement ) .
This is evidence , say the researchers , that illusionary or " parasocial " relationships with television characters or personalities can ease belongingness needs .
It remains an open question , say the researchers , whether social surrogacy suppresses belongingness needs or actually fulfills them , and they acknowledge that the kind of social surrogacy provoked by these programs can be a poor substitution for " real " human - to - human experience .
" Turning one 's back on family and friends for the solace of television may be maladaptive and leave a person with fewer resources over time , " says UB 's Derrick , " but for those who have difficulty experiencing social interaction because of physical or environmental constraints , technologically induced belongingness may offer comfort . "
The University at Buffalo is a premier research - intensive public university , a flagship institution in the State University of New York system and its largest and most comprehensive campus .
UB 's more than 28,000 students pursue their academic interests through more than 300 undergraduate , graduate and professional degree programs .
Founded in 1846 , the University at Buffalo is a member of the Association of American Universities .
As the nation copes with increasing numbers of obese Americans , United Airlines has joined the list of air carriers making overweight passengers pay more to fly .
As of Wednesday , passengers too large to fit comfortably in a coach seat may be required to buy a second ticket or upgrade to business class , where seats are larger -- if United ’s flight attendants can’t find two open seats for them .
The carrier , whose parent company is Chicago - based UAL Corp. , said it decided to adopt the tougher policy after receiving more than 700 complaints last year from passengers “ who did not have a comfortable flight because the person next to them infringed on their seat , ” spokeswoman Robin Urbanski said .
How to accommodate severely overweight passengers is an issue that has long rankled air travelers .
Issues of weight and seat proximity have become more sensitive in recent years as airlines narrow seat widths and flights have become fuller .

But as airlines adopt or toughen policies for obese passengers , some question how they can enforce such measures fairly .
“ How do you eyeball someone and decide they ’re not going to fit ? ” said aviation consultant Robert Mann , president of R.W. Mann & Co . “ From a knees - to - seat - back perspective , I do n’t fit .
I ’m 6 feet , 4 inches .
“ It ’s reached the point where it ’s essentially impossible to sit in coach and have the person in front of you recline . ”
Southwest Airlines requires passengers who ca n’t comfortably lower their armrests to purchase tickets for two adjacent seats .
Southwest will refund the cost of the second seat if a flight is n’t sold out .

Although the policy has been on Southwest Airlines Co.'s books for a quarter of a century , the low - fare carrier faced a backlash when it reminded consumers of its standards for larger passengers in 2002 , as Southwest switched from plastic boarding cards to electronic tickets .
Southwest still gets plenty of mail on the issue , spokeswoman Brandy King said .
But the upset customers are likelier to be passengers who believe they did n’t have enough room on a flight .
United ’s flight attendants , who will have the delicate task of enforcing the new policy , have traditionally sought to accommodate , free of charge , passengers who spill over their seats .
That has n’t changed .
“ We ’ll first try to re-accommodate you on another seat on the flight , ” Urbanski said .
“ If the flight is full , and that ’s not often the case these days , you ’ll be bumped from the flight . ”
If this occurs , passengers will be forced to find a flight with open seating , buy two seats or pay for an upgrade to a class of service with wide seats .

United , the nation ’s third - largest carrier , said it would waive fees normally charged for changing travel plans .
If seating is not available and a passenger decides not to travel , the ticket will be refunded without any penalty , even if it is a nonrefundable ticket .

* Virus is carried on hands
* Simple hygiene measures are highly effective
WASHINGTON , April 25 ( Reuters ) - Worried about swine flu ?
There is one easy way to protect against infection , health experts agree -- handwashing .
Global health officials are worried about an unusual new strain of flu that may have killed as many as 68 people in Mexico , with 1,000 showing possible symptoms .
It has infected at least eight people in the United States .
[ ID :nN24462379 ]
Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health said they expected to find more cases in the coming days and weeks .
Little can be done to prevent an outbreak of flu from spreading , health experts caution , but they say common sense measures can help individuals protect themselves .
Number one is hand - washing , they say -- a surprisingly effective way to prevent all sorts of diseases , including ordinary influenza and the new and mysterious swine flu virus .
“ Cover your cough or your sneeze , wash your hands frequently , ” advised Dr. Richard Besser , acting CDC director .
Influenza can spread in coughs or sneezes , but an increasing body of evidence shows little particles of virus can linger on tabletops , telephones and other surfaces and be transferred via the fingers to the mouth , nose or eyes .
Alcohol - based gel or foam hand sanitizers work well to destroy viruses and bacteria .
Anyone with flu - like symptoms such as a sudden fever , cough or muscle aches should stay away from work or public transportation and should see a doctor to be tested .
STAYING HOME
“ If you have the flu , then you should n’t be getting on the bus or getting on the plane and traveling , ” Besser told reporters in a telephone briefing .
“ Social distancing ” is another tactic .
It means staying away from other people who might be infected and can include avoiding large gatherings , spreading out a little at work , or perhaps staying home and lying low if an infection is spreading in a community .
Flu experts have also long advised against trying to stockpile personal supplies of antivirals .
Tamiflu and Relenza are two drugs shown to work against the current strains of seasonal influenza .
Tamiflu or oseltamivir , invented by Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O and marketed by Roche AG ROG.VX , is a pill while GlaxoSmithKline 's GSK .
LGSK .N Relenza , known generically as zanamivir , is inhaled .
Both drugs treat a flu infection , making it less serious and perhaps making the illness last fewer days .
But they must be taken within 48 hours of the first symptoms to do any good .
They can also prevent infection with garden - variety flu if taken , for example , by a family member caring for a sick relative .
No one knows if they will do the same with the new swine flu .
And the average person is not going to know when , precisely , to begin taking the drug .
Many infections look like flu , says pediatrician and immunologist Dr. Anne Moscona of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York .
Viruses and bacteria alike can evolve resistance to drugs they encounter frequently .
“ If you have Tamiflu at home and you take it for a cold or give it for a respiratory virus that is not influenza , we will be unable to use these drugs when we encounter a lethal strain of flu , ” Moscona says .

I spent 24 hours in the slammer the other day .
My crime ?
Well , the police could n’t tell me when they locked me up .
The prosecutor and judge could n’t either , when I was arraigned the following day .
I found out for myself when I researched the matter a few days after being released : I had been cited for walking my dog off the leash – once , six years ago .
Welcome to the ugly underside of the zero - tolerance era , where insignificant rule violations get inflated into criminal infractions .
Here ’s how it worked with me : a gaggle of transit cops stopped me after they saw me walk between two subway cars on my way to work .
This , they told me , was against the rules .
They asked for ID and typed my name into a hand - held computer .
Up came that old citation that I did n’t know about and they could n’t tell me about .
I was immediately handcuffed and brought to the precinct .
There , I waited in a holding cell , then was fingerprinted ( post - CSI memo : they now take the fingers , the thumbs , the palms , and the sides of both hands ) and had the contents of my shoulder bag inventoried .
I could hardly believe it : I was being arrested without ever having committed a crime .
Read more …
I was held overnight in the Midtown North Precinct lock - up ( shoelaces and belt confiscated , meals courtesy of the McDonald ’s dollar menu ) .
In the morning , my fellow convicts and I were led , chain - gang style , to the Manhattan Community Court next door .
The judge there dismissed the charge against me – because no one ever does time for that kind of crime .
A few days later , at Brooklyn ’s central court , my warrant was lifted for “ time served ” – again because no one is ever locked up for breaking the leash law .
If the cops had simply written me a ticket , I would have paid it , and I would have also had to pay to vacate my outstanding warrant .
But by cuffing me and holding me overnight , the city spent quite a bit of money ( it took two police officers approximately six hours each just to arrest and process me ) , while the fines assessed against me were rescinded .
While I was inside , I was astounded by the kinds of things that take up police and court time .
A couple of people nabbed for being in various parks after dark .
One of them was walking his dog .
Two young men accused of riding their bicycles on the sidewalk .
Three people arrested for sleeping in a subway station .
My roommate in the lock - up was an articulate and self - aware 60 - year - old whose sin was that he bought a bottle of booze and had taken a swig on the street .
In the cell next to us : two costumed Mariachis busted for busking on the subway .
They were repeat offenders .
Their weapons : a guitar and an accordion .
With zero tolerance , we have finally done it :
We have criminalized everyday life .
After all , in the course of their life people sometimes ride their bikes on the sidewalks .
And once upon a time not too long ago , it was normal to go into the parks after dark .
My friends and I did all the time , particularly if we had time to kill before or after the opera , the symphony , or a jazz or rock concert .
We walked brazenly between subway cars .
Some of us even – horror of horrors !
– played music on the street or in the subway without a license .
And , though my parents would not be happy to know it even now , we sometimes drank beer in public – making sure , in an important but legally meaningless gesture , that the bottle was in a paper bag .
If I did any of this on a regular basis today , I ’d probably be considered a behavioral recidivist and sent to Riker ’s Island .
I can laugh away my time in a cell — my life suddenly turned into an update of “ Alice ’s Restaurant . ”
But I get angry when I think of kids in their teens or 20s being treated the way I was .
I ’m not against hard time for criminal , violent or anti-social behavior .
But slapping young people behind bars and giving them an arrest record simply because the normal things they do are trivial rule violations is not only wasteful , it ’s downright criminal .

Editor ’s note :
The Giuliani administration highlighted its increase of “ quality of life ” summonses , but statistics from the annual Mayor ’s Management Report indicate that the Bloomberg administration has been just as zealous .
The number of such summonses under Giuliani reached its height in fiscal 2001 , hitting 523,000 .
After a dip in 2002 , the number of “ quality of life ” summonses rose under Mayor Bloomberg to more than 700,000 in fiscal 2004 .
They ’ve declined since then to 527,000 in fiscal 2008 — still higher than under the previous mayor .
The city ’s courts , meanwhile , have registered an uptick in the number of people getting arraigned on minor charges :
In 2007 , the last year for which the court system published statistics , the number of arraignments for infractions and violations was the highest in 10 years – 20 percent greater than the previous year .
Even so , Mr. Medvedev ’s timing was notable .
He is expected to hold his first meeting with President Obama in early April in London on the sidelines of the summit gathering of the Group of 20 , which comprises industrialized and developing countries and the European Union .
He has said recently that he is looking forward to the meeting , and both he and Russia ’s paramount leader , Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin , have expressed measured optimism about improving relations with the United States under the new administration .
The Obama administration played down the significance of Mr. Medvedev ’s remarks , with the White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs , saying they were “ largely for domestic consumption . ”
He added that “ NATO and the United States have worked and will continue to work with Russia on issues of mutual concern , specifically in areas like terrorism and proliferation . ”
Nevertheless , Mr. Medvedev ’s comments on Tuesday indicated that the Kremlin did not want the United States and its NATO allies to presume that Russia was coming to the table in London from a position of weakness .
“ An analysis of the military and political situation in the world shows that there are a range of regions where there remains serious potential for conflicts , ” Mr. Medvedev said .
“ Threats remain that can bring about local crises and international terrorism .
NATO is not halting its efforts to widen its military infrastructure near the borders of our country .
All of this demands a quality modernization of our armed forces . ”
Appleland is becoming progressively flatter and , at the same time , less usable .
Apple has released a series of revolutionary products over the last several years , from System X to the iPhone .
All represent Herculean software efforts .
With such marked changes , one can expect that early releases will tend toward the primitive .
Over time , users can expect missing functionality to fill in .
For the most part , this has occurred and will continue to do so , with even highly - sophisticated features appearing , such as copy and paste .
Who ’s talking ?
Bruce Tognazzini was hired at Apple by Steve Jobs and Jef Raskin in 1978 , where he remained for 14 years , founding the Apple Human Interface Group .
He remains a major Apple fan , which is why , when they 're doing wrong , he feels compelled to talk about it .
Filling in obvious features , however , is only one aspect of software evolution .
Equally important is keeping up with the users .
The beginner today will be the expert of tomorrow .
The user with 200 photos today will be the user with 2000 a year from now .
The user with 10 songs today will be the user with 100 songs six months from now .
The user with one or two extra apps on the iPhone will be the user with 100 apps three months from now .
Scaling Up
The great software applications usually did n’t start out that way .
20 years ago , there was a simple application on the Mac for doing basic edits on photos .
It was called Photoshop .
Today , Photoshop is a powerhouse of sophistication , capable of working miracles in the hands of a professional .
Adobe has been in lock - step with their users , increasing Photoshop ’s sophistication even as their users increased in theirs .
Apple , on the other hand , nowadays comes out with an initial , visually - simple model , and then just sticks with it as their users quickly outgrow it , resulting in their software appearing , over time , to lose power , instead of gaining it .
For several years in the Jobsian Regime , I put down this perpetual primitivism as just a lack of resources .
Now , I think it ’s more .
I think it ’s a naive , misplaced belief that flatter is better .
The Apple Flatland Aesthetic
The new Apple seems to subscribe to the belief that visual simplicity equals actual simplicity .
This proposition indeed holds true on day - one of a person ’s adventures in computing .
It may even hold true on day 90 .
It does not hold true in years one and three and ten , when the user is struggling to corral thousands of documents with the same tool that was visually - optimized for 20 .
Properly - designed interfaces scale , so that they support the new user as well as the expert .
One of the beauties of Photoshop is that , even after all these years , with all its increased complexity , it still is able to be a simple application for doing basic edits on photos .
( A new user can become productive in Photoshop in 10 minutes , even if it takes another 10 years to learn everything .
)
So how do you present a new user with an object that is not overwhelming , while at the same time offering advanced users the ability to handle greatly - scaled tasks ?
In some case , you can design a single object that scales from the simple case to the highly complex .
The Folder is such an object .
A folder with 20 documents is visually simple , but so is a folder with 20 folders , even though each of those 20 folders , in turn , may contain another 20 folders , each with 20 documents , for 8000 documents in all .
The second strategy is to migrate users to more complex objects by offering an object of utility matched to the needs of new users , then replacing that object with one of more complexity later on .
For example , the iPhone user may start out using the supplied Weather app with its useful , but primitive level of information " it 's gonna rain today " but shift to accuWeather in the midst of their first thunderstorm ( such as I 'm experiencing as I ’m writing this ) .
These users already know it 's raining outside ; they want to look at a radar map to see how much worse it 's going to get and how long before it 's over .
Having a single , perfecly - scalable object is the ideal solution , since it means the user does n't have to start over , but having multiple choices of objects may be necessary if the evolving complexity is sufficiently advanced .
Let ’s look at several examples of where Apple , on the Macintosh , is doing neither , but is , instead , just sticking with a beginner object , even when that object has long since become overwhelmed .
In each case , you will see that the beginner object is flathierarchy free which is both what makes it so approachable for the new user and so utterly useless for the advanced user .
The Macintosh Dock Apple ’s flatness mania first became apparent with the Macintosh Dock .
While an effective sales tool , it rapidly becomes a hinderance as users progress .
The Dock can handle perhaps 12 or 15 applications sort of well .
As an experienced user , I can't use the Dock to hold my running applications and my 461 current favorite applications , folders , and documents because I do n’t have a ten - foot wide screen .
Instead , I used two separate shareware applications to cover both of the Dock 's two main functions .
One , called ASM , shows me all my running applications , including their names , in an alphabetical list , without taking up any precious desktop space to do so , since it displays them from a pull - down menu in the menu bar , just as System 9 used to do .
I gain single - click access to all 461 of my favorites by using another small shareware program called DragThing .
Whereas the Dock is flat ; DragThing is not .
I ’ve created 19 different tabs in DragThing that encircle my desktop .
Hovering over any one of them opens its drawer , displaying all its files and folders .
For example , my Database tab shows all my databases for immediate access .
( DragThing offers the added bonus of letting you restore the Trash Can to the desktop , where it belongs . )
The Dock does an excellent job of representing to potential customers the open , friendly face of an Apple computer , however , it does n’t even begin to scale .
This is a situation where Apple needs to offer a second , compact , hierarchical object that is still Mac - like , but scales beyond the needs of the beginner .
Safari Safari's add - a- bookmark opens up all the bookmark folders at once , giving the user a single , linear list .
The new user can then plunk down a new bookmark among the eight or ten existing ones without having to worry about opening folders to do so .
Nice .
It ’s not much of a solution , though , for that same user a year later , when he or she has hit 200 bookmarks and the list is seven or eight screenfulls tall .
What should Apple do ?
Is this a case where it becomes time for users to switch to a more complex mechanism ?
No .
The fundamental approach is backwards .
Apple is already providing an excellent mechanism for selecting a bookmark .
Why not use that same mechanism for storing new ones ?
To add a bookmark , the user should just pull down the regular bookmarks , navigate in the usual way to the subfolder desired , then release on an “ add bookmark here ” item found within each subfolder .
Comedian Steven
Wright once announced that a friend had given him a map of the United States , “ actual size . ”
When you ’ve already given your users an actual - size map of something , be it bookmarks or anything else , it is usually a mistake to come up with some alternate way to perform the same navigation .
( Fortunately , there is a work - around to the bookmarks problem : Open a second window and open up all bookmarks within it .
Then , drag the Favicon [ the icon next to the URL ] to where you would like it to be . )
iPhoto iPhoto aggregates incoming photos in objects called , “ Events . ” A typical event might hold all the photos you took at the baseball game last weekend .
By adding keywords to the photos , they can be later drawn up into albums reflecting , for example , all ball game photos you ’ve ever taken or all photos featuring your favorite player at bat .
i Photo allows you to view just under 30 events at once , all laid out with giant thumbnails , so , for the first few months , the mechanism works quite well .
I currently have 522 events holding more than 13,000 photographs total .
It takes 19 clicks in the scroll bar to view all 20 screenfulls of them and an average of 38 clicks to find the one I ’m looking for , since I usually miss it the first couple of times around .
Apple provides no alternate view other than giant thumbnails , and , in keeping with Flatland , no way of dropping groups of events into folders .
Keywording lets me overcome what would be a fatal design flaw , since I can zero in on a particular event by typing in keywords I know are associated with it , but this scheme works in spite of Apple ’s best efforts , not because of it .
Keywords have also been kept linear , with iPhoto just producing a gigantic blob of text displaying all the keywords in a matrix , and , by " all , " I mean about 20 % of them .
( The rest remain permanently hidden from view , since the blob is n't big enough to show them . )
Fortunately , for those people who have outgrown iPhoto ’s native capabilities , Shareware has again come to the rescue in the form of Keyword Manager from Bullstorm .
This add - on is not only greatly superior to the Flatland keywording system within iPhoto , it beats the keywording system within Aperture , Apple ’s pro version of iPhoto .
With Keyword Manager , users can nest their keywords as deeply as they wish , and choosing a keyword deep in the hierarchy will automatically also keyword the photo with every keyword in the hierarchy above it .
For example , if I add the keyword , Aircraft Carrier , it will add Warship , Ship , and Vessel .
Later , searching for any of these will find the photo .
When I open Keyword Manager , I see 14 categories .
When I open Apple 's presentation , intended to be visually - simpler , I see more than 100 keywords .
I actually have over 1200 keywords , and I can get to any one within three clicks with Keyword Manager .
With Apple 's scheme , I can't get to them at all unless the keyword I 'm looking for is in the 100 iPhoto will show me .
The rest are permanently hidden .
When an aesthetic gets this much in the way , it 's time for it to go .
The fact that it 's hung on this long is rather amazing , since Apple tends not to cling to bad ideas .
I suspect this bad idea has been hanging out in Apple 's collective subconcious for several years now , unquestioned and , with probably a great deal of effort , somehow not noticed , although how you do n't notice for eight years that 90 + % of any serious user 's keywords are just simply inaccessible is beyond me .
What Apple needs to do about iPhoto Allow nesting of events
Offer alternate views of Events , including a list view , so more than 30 events can be seen in a single screenfull .
Buy Keyword Manager and add it to iPhoto
What Apple needs to do in general Apple needs to take a fresh look at all of their products across the board , specifically looking for where old decisions favoring new users are now dragging those same users down .
Of course it 's a good idea to avoid complexity , including hierarchies , where possible , but some tasks are inherently complex .
Go for visual and behavioral simplicity where it works , but be prepared to back off .

I thought , " What would make Law & Order a more interesting show ...? "
by Don Paskini
George Osborne has announced a new Tory policy which I do n’t understand : they want to give every household a new entitlement to £ 6,500 of energy saving technologies .
They provide government guarantees to enable companies to borrow the money to install this energy saving equipment in homes across the country .
This money would be repaid through savings on energy bills resulting from the improved energy efficiency .
So homeowners would be given the opportunity to have energy saving equipment fitted to their homes without any upfront costs .
They claim this will unleash £ 20 billion of private investment if half of all households take this up .
So if I ’ve got this right , homeowners can in effect borrow £ 6,500 to get energy saving equipment installed , and then pay it back over the next few years out of savings from lower energy bills .
The thing I do n’t understand is how this fits with the Tory economic argument that Debt is Bad .
The average yearly energy bill , according to moneysupermarket.com , is £ 1,350 , so it is going to take people an awfully long time to pay back £ 6,500 out of the savings from lower energy bills .
So either a large chunk of this £ 20 billion is going to be paid upfront by the government and not recovered ( which means in effect higher government spending , which the Tories oppose ) or it means people taking on extra debt and paying it off over ten or more years ( the Tories say private debt is currently too high already , so it is strange that they would have policies which encourage more of it ) .
I think that with some considerable tweaks , the government funding the installation of energy saving technologies in homes is probably a good idea ( though , for example , it seems a bit harsh that under the Tory plans people like me who rent ca n’t get it installed and it is only for people who own their own homes ) .
But it is interesting that this new flagship
Tory policy contradicts their overall economic strategy and analysis and instead appears to be more influenced by Labour ’s and Barack Obama ’s approach of the government spending more money in the short term in order that we can all reap the benefits in the longer term .
Law enforcement officials are vastly expanding their collection of DNA to include millions more people who have been arrested or detained but not yet convicted .
The move , intended to help solve more crimes , is raising concerns about the privacy of petty offenders and people who are presumed innocent .
Until now , the federal government genetically tracked only convicts .
But starting this month , the Federal Bureau of Investigation will join 15 states that collect DNA samples from those awaiting trial and will collect DNA from detained immigrants — the vanguard of a growing class of genetic registrants .
The F.B.I. , with a DNA database of 6.7 million profiles , expects to accelerate its growth rate from 80,000 new entries a year to 1.2 million by 2012 — a 15 - fold increase .
F.B.I. officials say they expect DNA processing backlogs — which now stand at more than 500,000 cases — to increase .
Law enforcement officials say that expanding the DNA databanks to include legally innocent people will help solve more violent crimes .
They point out that DNA has helped convict thousands of criminals and has exonerated more than 200 wrongfully convicted people .
Ok you might know ( or have heard ) about Bushwick , Brooklyn .
Either about the high crime or the Hipster population that moves there .
Either case , Bushwick still has a big population of poor minorities and immigrants living there .
But there is no denying that a lot of Hipsters ( young not - so - rich people ) have been moving there ( either from Manhattan , the suburbs , or other cities ) for a while since having been price out of Manhattan and lately from Williamsburg as well .
So what kind of world do these Hipsters create in Bushwick for themselves and what do they do there ?
Well these photos are all based in Bushwick and will probably help you get to know more about the Hipster world in Bushwick .
NOTE : I only made this thread about Hipsters , not about the other local population community that lives there , hence the title of the thread .
So heads up .
Some information about Bushwick : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushwick,_Brooklyn
This is a new area in NYC were young people ( not the rich type / Yuppies and majority white ) are moving to .
A neighborhood called Bushwick in Brooklyn .
The area is right next to another hip ( or bohemian ) area called Williamsburg .
But lately rich people and Europeans have been moving there and the not so rich ones are been push out to Bushiwick ( or other areas in NYC ) .
Now Bushwick still has a predominately minority and immigrant population , but there has n't been major displacement yet .
Yeah , the Hipsters ( or young people ) live among the locals .
But there is some tensions as rents keep on rising though .
But with the economy as bad as it is right now , I do n't think that rent will keep on rising any further .
In fact I think that rents will drop .
The neighborhood still has its drugs and crime issues and bad schools .
But it has gotten better these last couple of years .
This neighborhood still is consider one of the bad neighborhoods in the city .
Back in the 70's to the 90's this neighborhood was one of the worst in the city .
It had the most abandonment and burn out properties in the city .
There have been some new residential conversions and new construction lately , but not much to make an impact .
Most of Bushwick still is full of older buildings and housing .
The shopping options in the neighborhoods still pretty much serve the neighborhood older local population .
That is , minorities and immigrant based .
There have been a few hipsters shopping options lately , like some new bars , restaurants , coffee shops , stage space and some art galleries that cater to them , as obvious with some of these photos .
But a lot of the hipster action still is a train ride away into Williamsburg or into Manhattan .

PolitiFact has won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for our coverage of the 2008 election .
The Pulitzer Board announced the prize during a news conference Monday afternoon at Columbia University in New York .
The board cited PolitiFact 's use of " probing reporters and the power of the World Wide Web to examine more than 750 political claims , separating rhetoric from truth to enlighten voters . "
Neil Brown , executive editor of the St. Petersburg Times , which launched PolitiFact in August 2007 , said the award was " proof that the Web is not a death sentence for newspapers .
In fact , PolitiFact marries the power of old - fashioned shoe - leather journalism with an extraordinarily powerful way to present it . "
Jack McElroy , editor of the Knoxville News Sentinel , wrote that our award was " the most unusual , and most important , Pulitzer Prize this year . "
He wrote , " Online databases are rapidly becoming one of the important tools of watchdog journalism in the digital age .
Identifying PolitiFact as the best national reporting of the year will only speed that trend . "
During the campaign , PolitiFact had a staff of five Times reporters and editors , plus the support of researchers and writers from Congressional Quarterly , a sister company of the Times .
PolitiFact relaunched in January to fact - check Congress and the White House , and added the Obameter , a feature that tracks President Barack Obama ’s campaign promises .
PolitiFact 's award was one of two Pulitzer Prizes awarded to the St. Petersburg Times Monday .
The newspaper also was honored in the Feature Writing category .
PolitiFact has begun fact - checking the statements made by cable TV hosts and political pundits and , as the midterm elections near , will expand its fact - checking of state and local races , starting in Florida .

Rush Limbaugh : Voice of the People
Rush Limbaugh quotes put into the mouths of " regular people " to see if it makes sense for the GOP to suggest that he is the voice of “ real America . ”
DOHA ( Reuters ) - OPEC will slash its forecast for 2009 oil demand by one million barrels per day in its monthly report due out later in March , the group ’s secretary general told reporters on Monday .
All options were on the table when the group ’s ministers meet to discuss oil supply on March 15 , Abdullah al - Badri told reporters on the sidelines of an energy conference .
The oil price was “ not really acceptable ” to OPEC but was also not as bad as it could be given the state of the global economy , Badri said .
OPEC supply cuts since September last year had helped stabilize the price , he added .
Microsoft has an early beta of a new product called Vine .
Currently available for beta testers in Seattle , it 's a location - aware social networking application focused on being a robust means of local communication that 'll work even in times of emergency .
It 's a desktop client ( available for Windows only ) , and you can also post to it via e-mail or SMS .
It gathers local news from 20,000 sources and displays it on a map .
It lets you post alerts ( short messages ) and reports ( longer posts ) .
Finally , it integrates with Facebook , while Twitter integration will be added at a later date .
Now , when it comes to online stuff from Microsoft , it 's usually " me , too " services .
Sometimes , though , the talented folks that are working in those odd research departments come up with a really good idea .
A social network for emergencies seems important , clever and marketable ; the problem , however , is that for a social network to thrive , it needs a lot of users .
And I 'm not sure that Microsoft will be able to get them .
Vine 's biggest problem is that it competes with Twitter and Facebook .
The fact that it offers a slightly more structured way to communicate might not mean much to the end users ; they 're used to getting their emergency news and reports from Twitter , even if it only means simple 140 - character messages .
And yes ,
Vine promises robustness ( the details on how , exactly , are sketchy ) , and Twitter has long been notorious for its instability ( it 's working much better lately , though ) .
Even if Twitter is down , however , Facebook 's status update can always step in .
Is there room for another contender ?
It depends .
Vine does offer a lot that Twitter does n't .
However , both Twitter and Facebook are growing extremely fast , and Vine is still in early beta .
If Microsoft lets it linger too long , it might never catch up .
Wisconsin 's contribution to obstructionism
This is an area that has been especially hard hit by economic trends .
Recent months have seen the closing of the Delphi plant in Oak Creek , ending 3,500 union jobs averaging $ 26 an hour , along with 300 salaried jobs .
Massive layoffs have gutted the once - bustling factory town of Racine , where CNH now has just 680 workers producing tractors , down from 3,400 in 1979 .
Chrysler 's workforce in Kenosha has been whittled down to 600 , one - tenth of the level in 1988 .
And Janesville is suffering through the loss of its last 1,800 autoworker jobs after General Motors shut down the plant late last year .
... Ryan 's claim that Obama was repeating the " mistakes " of FDR was a peculiar position that brought ridicule from Democrats and pundits like Rachel Maddow of MSNBC .
Almost all historians credit Roosevelt for lowering unemployment from about 25 % to just under 10 % through public spending and for extending economic security to millions by allowing unionization and creating the Social Security Act .
Instead of public - sector spending to create jobs and stimulate spending , Ryan urged a package of tax cuts .
As he put it , " We missed an opportunity today to enact an economic stimulus package that empowers the engines of economic growth . "
While he represents one of the nation 's most economically devastated districts , Ryan touts the virtues of unregulated free - market capitalism .
He favors trade agreements blamed for sending jobs overseas and opposes universal health care ( and even the broadly supported S - CHIP health program for children ) .
• Partial privatization of Social Security , with the federal government promising to cover stock - market losses , a feature that would have proved catastrophic with the Wall Street meltdown .
• Individual " ownership " of health insurance , highlighted by a $ 5,000 family tax credit for families -- well short of the average 2008 cost of $ 15,600 for a family of four , as tabulated by the Millman Medical Index .
• A fresh round of tax cuts to encourage employers to hire more workers .
Ryan continues to oppose government job - creation efforts while actively promoting " free trade " agreements of the sort blamed for major job losses in his district .
For instance , Delphi workers in Oak Creek were undercut by the corporation 's 50 plants in Mexico , where labor costs are about one - tenth what they are here .
General Motors built a plant duplicating its Janesville product lines in Silao , Mexico .
And Rainfair shut its plant in Racine to move jobs to China , where industrial wages average about 3 % of the U.S .
Throughout the district , job losses have led to mounting poverty and growing desperation .
" Unemployment is up to 15.6 % in the city of Racine , " says Ron Thomas , the local AFL - CIO secretary and United Way labor liaison .
" It 's a scary situation right now .
Those of us who were baby boomers had the notion that after the Great Depression , we 'd never see anything like that again , with all the protections for the unemployed put in place .
But with globalization , the free - trade agreements and cutback in the safety net , we 're wondering about the future . "
Racine 's Health Care Network , started in the grim days of the early 1980s to pair low - income people with health professionals who donate their time , now has a waiting list of 3,000 people .
Thomas , who helped get this group established and serves on its board , notes that Ryan has twice voted against a bill to provide subsidized health insurance to low - and moderate - income children and some of their parents .
He 's amazed at the gulf between the district 's needs and Ryan 's voting record : " With the economy the way it is , we need health care and we need a jumpstart for jobs . "
Ten miles further south along Lake Michigan , the blue - collar community of Kenosha is also suffering .
" It 's a disaster , " says Judy Jensen , the Labor Council secretary - treasurer .
" The food pantries have really seen a spike in demand , but we also now see people who used to volunteer and donate to the food banks coming in for food . "
" Our industrial base is now in China and other places , " adds local AFL - CIO president Ron Frederick .
" Every place around here has laid people off . "
The risk for Ryan is whether his increasingly visible and prominent role will be undercut by the resentment some of his constituents feel toward Republican policies ...
Ryan has consistently backed deregulatory policies favored by the financial industry .
These policies set the stage for the sub - prime housing debacle , which in turn toppled major Wall Street banks that had invested heavily in " derivatives " that were supposed to divide up the risk of the sub - prime mortgages .
In 1999 , Ryan voted for the repeal of Depression - era legislation meant to minimize the risk undertaken by commercial banks .
He backed the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act that allowed commercial banks to engage in much riskier investment banking and insurance .
In 2000 , Ryan voted for the Commodity Futures Trading Modernization Act , which blocked federal regulation of derivatives .
A once - obscure stock - market maneuver , derivatives became a popular means of speculating on the future financial health of specific assets .
Many investors steered clear , with billionaire Warren Buffett bluntly describing derivatives as " financial weapons of mass destruction . "
But major banks on Wall Street bought billions of derivatives on sub - prime housing mortgages .
Ryan , in November 2007 , also opposed imposing new regulations on the then - burgeoning sub - prime mortgage industry .
When the bubble in housing prices popped , the banks were stuck with vast losses .
The Wall Street crash soon followed , along with the economic catastrophe that hit Ryan 's district hard .
To counter damage caused by their role in keeping the sub - prime mortgage industry and Wall Street deregulated , Ryan and other Budget Committee Republicans issued a Jan. 8 analysis called Roots of the Crisis , almost entirely devoted to obscure government policies with no specific mention of the Wall Street bankers who lost hundreds of billions while rewarding themselves with $ 18.4 billion in bonuses .
The harshest criticism by Ryan and his GOP colleagues on the Budget Committee was contained in a single , remarkably tepid phrase : " The financial crisis that unfolded this year had numerous causes , and Wall Street is not free of blame . "
Why the kid -gloves treatment of the financial industry ?
In an analysis called Sold Out : How Wall Street and Washington Betrayed America , the watchdog groups Essential Information and Consumer Education Foundation note that Wall Street has over the last decade " showered Washington with over $ 1.7 billion in what are prettily described as ' campaign contributions ' and ... another $ 3.4 billion on lobbyists whose job it was to press for deregulation . "
In return , the banks were able to " get rid of many of the reforms enacted after the Great Depression and to operate , for most of the last 10 years , without any effective rules or constraints whatsoever . "
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , Ryan 's largest set of contributions from 1998 to 2008 came from the financial , real estate and insurance sector , clocking in at $ 1,555,321 .
While Ryan claimed that the bank bailout " sucks , " he nonetheless voted for it .
Among speakers scheduled to titillate teabagger rallies are Florida Congressman Ander Crenshaw ( appearing in Jacksonville ) , Arizona Congressman John Shadegg ( appearing in Phoenix ) , North Carolina Congresswoman Susan Myrick ( appearing in Charlotte ) and Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan ( appearing in Madison ) .
All cast the Tory vote for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , which gave hundreds of billions of dollars to banks and speculators .
No doubt , Ryan 's the worst hypocrite in the bunch .
The ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee has emerged as the GOPs pointman on " fiscal responsibility " issues .
Yet , this Tory legislator played a key role in passing the Wall Street bailout last fall , rallying Republican votes for the measure when sincere conservatives wanted to vote " no " to the $ 800 - billion giveaway with Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders , who said , " rescuing the economy does not mean we have to just give away $ 700 billion of taxpayer money to the banks , " and Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold , who said , " Taxpayers deserve a plan that puts their concerns ahead of those who got us into this mess . "
Technically , Ryan represents Janesville , Wisconsin , but his real designation ought to be : Paul Ryan , R - Wall Street .
Janesville is , or at least was , a manufacturing town .
Yet , Ryan has since his election to the House in 1998 consistently voted for free - trade pacts -- including the extension of most - favored nation trading status to China -- that have been devastating to the community and others in his southeastern Wisconsin district .
How devastating , last winter , the sprawling General Motor plant that had been the community 's top employer for nine decades , was shuttered .
What was Ryan doing in the months before the plant closed ?
Campaigning for a scheme to gamble Social Security funds on the stock market and gut Medicare and Medicaid .
Had Ryan gotten his way , tens of millions of Americans who lost most of their retirement savings when the stock market crashed in the fall would also have lost much of their Social Security safety net .
And they would have had an even harder time getting access to medical care .
Fiscally responsible ?
Not Paul Ryan .
His whole career has been about redistributing wealth upward , rewriting trade rules to favor multinational corporations , robbing the federal treasury to enrich his banking industry benefactors and running up debts to bail out Wall Street .
If Sam Adams had encountered this Tory , they would have tossed him in Boston Harbor with those crates of tea .
The new issue of Madison 's weekly news magazine , , shines a spotlight on the area 's most conservative member of Congress , Paul Ryan , by asking whether he risks losing support back home in a moderate swing district by becoming a spokesperson for his extremist political party .
The southeast Wisconsin district went from supporting Bush by 8 points in 2004 to supporting Obama by 4 points last November .
The district includes 33,000 unemployed workers who look forward to President Obama 's stimulus programs as a major component to their families ' salvations .
Suddenly all over national TV they 're watching their own congressman take on the role , ineptly , of the anti-Obama .
Ryan did n't only vote against the stimulus plan , he became the GOP mouthpiece against it -- a plan that features an extension of unemployment benefits and massive job - producing public works programs .
And Ryan did n't only betray his constituents on this one bill .
He 's in the forefront of die - hard obstructionists who are opposing everything Obama tries to accomplish -- no matter how badly these problems are hurting the folks back home .
So far only 4,468 families have lost their homes to predatory banksters in WI - 01 .
Ryan helped rally right - wing Republicans in the House to vote against allowing bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of the loans .
Fortunately the bill passed despite his shrill objections -- especially fortunate for the estimated 14,874 homeowners in WI - 01 projected to be foreclosed on in the next 4 years .
Only 7 Republicans broke with Ryan and the rest of the obstructionist GOP House leadership and voted in favor of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 , which passed 234- 191 on March 5 .
All of the biggest Republican recipients of legalized bribes from the banksters , like Ryan ( $ 1,555,321 ) , Spencer Bachus ( R - AL - $ 3,789,474 ) , Eric Cantor ( R- VA - $ 3,121,188 ) , John Boehner ( R- OH - $ 3,045,809 ) , Pete Sessions ( R- TX - $ 2,730,126 ) , and Roy Blunt ( R- MO - $ 2,639,105 ) , i.e. , the entire Republican House leadership , voted against the bill .
In this morning ' sPaul Krugman , in trying to explain the Republican strategy of mindless obstructionism Ryan has decided to bet his future on , declares that it does n’t feel right to make fun of crazy people Ryan is a spokesperson for a fringe faction of the GOP that says the Bush Regime was n't right - wing enough .
But Ryan was a complete Bush rubber stamp for almost his entire political career , having been first elected 2 years before Bush .
A deregulation fanatic and a tax - cuts - for - the - rich jihadi , Ryan helped push through a programs of cuts that cost the federal government $ 1.4 trillion and saves the average family in southeast Wisconsin around $ 29 / year -- although the tiny handful of families making over $ 1.1 million save almost $ 18,000 a year .
Ryan 's vision for the future :
In other words : more of what brought us to where we are : trickle down voodoo economics that has destroyed the American middle class with pie - in - the - sky right - wing ideology .
His critics point out that Ryan 's vision " represents a continuation of failed past policies and is thus ill - suited for this moment in history , especially in Ryan 's deeply suffering district . "
If there is no money in the real world economy , companies wo n't invest even if Republican clowns like Ryan stand on their heads and sing -- because outside of GOP think tanks Inside the Beltway it is common sense that businessmen do n't make more products when there is no market for them .
That 's the fatal flaw in what passes for Ryan 's logic .
Ryan is the most vulnerable of the hardcore obstructionist Republican leaders up for re-election next year .
His Herbert Hoover - like alternative budget helped spawn a fundraising effort StopPaulRyan , which is seeking to replace him with a suitable progressive .
The first 20 contributors today will receive a copy of the 2 - CD set , by Americana singer - songerwriter Matt Keating .
Another reason to support Blue America 's ongoing efforts to replace reactionary , anti-family wingers with progressives ( music by WI - 01's best band ever ) : There are many reasons to replace Paul Ryan .
Please help us do it by donating even $ 5 or $ 10 through a special StopPaulRyan ActBlue page .
Thanks !

Beware The Tories In Your Ranks Don't forget : Stop Paul Ryan , before it 's too late .

When Sweden ’s government was led by ex-Prime Minister Goran Persson , it was apparently aware that the United States was using the country as a transit point for secret CIA flights carrying suspected terrorists .
The US denied the clandestine flights at the time , but a report issued in the Expressen newspaper reveals that Swedish defence forces ran covert surveillance in 2005 of a US military plane at Stockholm ’s Arlanda Airport .
The Swedish surveillance team confirmed government suspicions that the CIA was actually using its rendition flights to force prisoners out of America against their will .
The report states that the CIA plane they monitored was filled with prisoners chained and cloaked in black hoods .
If there was any question as to the veracity of these claims , the Swedish defence department confirmed to the Expressen that the operation did in fact take place as described .
The findings of the operation were reported back to the defence department , which was headed at the time by Leni Bjorklund .
The Swedish government , however , failed to lodge any formal or official complaint to the US authorities .
The Local reports that Sweden ’s foreign minister in 2006 , Laila Freivalds , stated to the TT news agency that the government was not aware of any illegal CIA activity on Swedish territory .
But it would appear , now , that this was not the case .
The cavalier use of brute government force has become routine , but the emerging story of how Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke forced CEO Ken Lewis to blow up Bank of America is still shocking .
It 's a case study in the ways that panicky regulators have so often botched the bailout and made the financial crisis worse .
In the name of containing " systemic risk , " our regulators spread it .
In order to keep Mr. Lewis quiet , they all but ordered him to deceive his own shareholders .
And in the name of restoring financial confidence , they ...
As we noted last week , Apple ’s vetting procedure for its iPhone app store is mysterious to say the least .
While the decisions have involved everything from technical to licensing issues , the company appears to be particularly inconsistent on matters of taste .
It rejected an official South Park app which would have delivered clips of the show to users , but approved a baby - shaking game ( only to withdraw it after the inevitable outrage ) .
Now a development company has detailed its journey to get an application approved , a journey which strongly suggests the vetting procedure involves automated keywords as much as human judgment .
Alkali Media twice failed to get approval for Crudebox , an application which features a soundboard of “ 16 high - quality and mildly disgusting sounds ” .
( The firm is run by three recent business and advertising university graduates … )
The app was initially rejected for failing to meet Apple ’s requirement that “ Applications must not contain any obscene , pornographic , offensive or defamatory content or materials of any kind ( text , graphics , images , photographs , etc. ) , or other content or materials that in Apple ’s reasonable judgement may be found objectionable by iPhone or iPod touch users . ”
After the firm tweaked the app to remove one sound , a female orgasm , it got the thumbs down again .
Rather than go through the process repeatedly to figure out exactly which sounds were causing the problem , the developers decided to simply give it a makeover .
In the revised version , the functionality was unchanged – users still get the same collection of sounds .
However , Crudebox became Prudebox , a snot - like background became a collection of sunflowers , and several buttons were renamed .
For example , users can now ‘ Sicky ’ rather than ‘ Vomit ’ , while the option to ‘ Fart ’ is now ‘ Toot ’ .
So did this revamp , in which you can make a fart sound but you ca n’t call it that , get Apple ’s approval ?
Darn tootin’ , it did !
International navies have been moving to arrest suspected pirates A Russian warship has seized a pirate vessel with 29 people on board off the Somali coast , Russian news reports say .
Guns and navigation equipment were found during a search of the pirate boat , officials were quoted as saying .
They said the suspected pirates were thought to have launched two unsuccessful attacks against a tanker with a Russian crew .
Russia is one of the countries that has deployed naval ships against pirates operating in the area .
See map of how piracy is affecting the region and countries around the world Navies from Nato , the EU , Japan , China , India , Yemen , US Malaysia and Singapore have also been patrolling the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden .
However , the number of attacks has continued to rise .
Somali pirates have hijacked 25 vessels since the beginning of this year and are holding more than 260 crew around the stronghold of Eyl in northern Somalia , according to the International Maritime Bureau .
Naval patrols have captured pirates on a number of occasions .
Some have been put on trial in Kenya , while France has charged three suspected pirates and a Somali teenager is facing trial in the US .
Earlier on Tuesday , regional leaders in Somalia 's northern Puntland region told the BBC they have put together a militia of fishermen to catch pirates .
Twelve armed pirates in two boats have been captured by the vigilante groups , they said .
When first loaded , the map 's focus falls on Somalia where most of the pirates are based .

A Melbourne man has completed a six - month - long quest to turn topography into typography .
Rhett Dashwood has just published a Google Maps alphabet featuring all 26 letters which he found in man-made or naturally - occurring formations .
The 32 - year - old creative director set himself the task of tracking down all the letters in his home state of Victoria using the Google Maps satellite view .
President Obama ’s promise to restore science to its rightful place raises a question regarding the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) .
Is forensic science already well in hand , but just not the honesty to apply it ?
Soon , the nominee for the Secretary of Commerce , Gov. Gary Locke , goes before the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation for confirmation .
This position provides management oversight of NIST , among other things .
Once confirmed , this person will select the new Director of NIST .
The Senate should question Gov. Locke on his assessment of NIST ’s past practices and intentions going forward .
Case in point is the NIST final report on World Trade Center 7 , the 47 - story high - rise that collapsed on September 11 , 2001 .
The report ’s authors explained in precise technical terms , the North side of the building ( the side they were measuring ) underwent a 2.25 - second free - fall drop , extending approximately 8 stories .
This agreed very closely with observations made during the opportunity for public comments .
The whole process of requesting public comments to the draft final report , receiving them , and updating the final report where warranted was very commendable .
The problem comes with the NIST interpretation of the significance of this updated information .
The NIST authors did need to make a comment , in that they stated in their draft report that the visible part of the collapse had accelerated downward at 40 % of free fall .
Their comment was in essence , when they looked at a longer period of time ( 5.4 sec. ) encompassing this intermediary 2.25 - sec. stage , then the three stages of collapse progression are consistent with the results of their global collapse analyses , i.e. , their analytical model .
Their analytical model did not contain the mechanism for free fall .
Yet , they called the overall results consistent with their model .
NIST has not faced up to the significance of free fall .
Is declaring the overall results consistent with their model the NIST way of sweeping the dirty implications of free fall under the proverbial carpet ?
A free - fall drop of 8 stories raises the obvious question , what was going on with 8 stories of structure that allowed the upper visible section of the building to fall through it unrestricted ?
The NIST analytical model produces an answer that columns were buckling .
In fact , it might be said , the theme of the NIST WTC7 Final Report was fire and buckling .
A search on the word , “ buckling , ” comes up with 42 times the word is used .
Whereas , “ free fall ” only produces 6 matches , and all but one of those are in reference to the overall collapse being 40 % slower than free fall , or the definition of free fall , itself .
The degree to which NIST has apparently tried to hide the 8 stories of free fall drop can be seen in the care taken to hide it on the NIST WTC webpage .
On that webpage , among items pertaining to WTC7 , the link to the press release for the final report is listed first .
This press release lists a number of changes between the final report , and the draft final report issued earlier for public comments .
Surprisingly , or maybe dishonestly would be a better choice of word , free fall is not even mentioned .
In the Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ ) section , there is one question on free fall .
The answer given is essentially the same as given in the Final Report , but for one exception .
In explaining Stage 2 , which was the period during which free - fall occurred , the answer states , “ During Stage 2 , the north face descended essentially in free fall , indicating negligible support from the structure below .
This is consistent with the structural analysis model which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above . ”
This makes it clear , and incorrect in doing so , that the consistency between the measurements and the model was during Stage 2 .
Whereas , the Final Report only claims consistency between measurements and model when the entire collapse time is considered .
The reason NIST is making such an effort to hide free fall is it strongly suggests explosives were involved .
NIST did a superficial explosives study , referred to in the Final Report as “ Hypothetical Blast Scenarios . ”
The study should be viewed with skepticism , in that it made the unreasonable assumption that any explosives would have to have been planted after the attacks on the Twin Towers , but before the collapse of WTC7 .
A very limited time frame , indeed .
NIST just did not make an honest effort to consider an explosives scenario .
Whether at the Confirmation Hearings of Gov. Locke for Secretary of Commerce , or the Truth and Reconciliation Hearings of Sen. Patrick Leahy , these matters of questionable science and matters of dishonesty at NIST need to come out into the light of day .
The public needs to know once and for all , what caused the destruction of WTC7 .

Nearly 4 million home burglaries occur in the United States each year .
Not only does being burglarized cost you lots of money , it can make you question your sense of security as well .
Often times , people who are the victim of a home burglary will have a hard time sleeping at night due to the stress a situation like this causes .
Your main goal following a burglary should be finding ways to secure your home .
For years , homeowners have been using the power of security cameras to keep thieves at bay .
With all of the home camera system options on the market , finding the right one can be challenging .
Before making a decision regarding which system to purchase , be sure to consult with security professionals .
These professionals will take into account things like how big your home is and how much money you have in the budget before recommending a system .
The following are some of the reasons why installing a home camera system is a good idea .
1. A Great Way to Enhance Your Current Home Security System
It is hard to put a price tag on your family ’s safety .
This is why you need to avoid getting caught up on the price of a home camera system .
Using a camera to enhance a home security system you have in place is a great idea .
The good thing about home camera systems is that they come in all shapes and sizes .
This means you should have no problem finding a system that fits your unique needs .
Adding a second layer of protection to your home will make it an impenetrable fortress .
While a home security system can detect break - ins and notify the authorities , they will not be able to catch criminals in the act .
With a top of the line camera system , you can catch these crooks red-handed .
You can find more info about the benefits of security cameras with a bit of online research .
2. Monitor Your Home From Anywhere
Over the last decade , the home camera system industry has undergone a number of changes .
It seems like there are new innovations in camera technology with each passing day .
One of the most popular and helpful features modern camera systems have is remote viewing .
With this feature , you can look in on your home from anywhere if you have an Internet connection .
If you are away on business , you can check in on your prized possession from your cell phone or laptop .
Not only can remote viewing provide you with peace of mind , it can also help you catch burglars in the act .
Most remote viewing systems will send you an alert when cameras sense motion .
Receiving these real - time alerts allow you to act quickly in the event of an attempted burglary .
3. A Home Camera System Can Save You Money
Some homeowners get so fixated on the price of a home cameras system that they fail to see the big picture .
In most cases , adding security cameras to your home can help to reduce insurance premiums .
These cameras can also save you money by helping you deter would - be thieves .
Home burglaries can result in thousands of dollars ’ worth of merchandise disappearing .
Rather than focusing solely on price when choosing a camera system , try thinking about how many features the system offers .
Trying to skimp on the quality of a security system to save money is a bad idea .
Lower - quality cameras will be unable to provide you with the crisp and clear picture you need .
4. Video Cameras Provide You With Evidence
Career burglars are always looking for an easy mark .
If these criminals see a home that appears to be without a security system or cameras , they may try to break - in .
One of the best benefits that comes with installing a camera system is the proof it provides in the event of a burglary .
If your security cameras do their job , you will have footage of a person committing a crime .
This footage can be used in the court of law when trying to convict this person of their crimes .
Without concrete proof like video evidence , it can be extremely difficult to put a burglar behind bars .
While you may never need to use your camera system for this purpose , its good to know it is there to protect you and your family .
Being at home when a burglary occurs can be a horrifying experience .
In some instances , homeowners will not have access to a phone to call the authorities on their own .
Having both security cameras and a security system will allow you to let the company monitoring your system contact the authorities for you .
With their help , you can get the authorities on the way to diffuse this dangerous and stressful situation .
You need to view the purchase of security cameras and a security system as long - term investments .
The cost you pay for these tools is worth it considering the increased security they provide your home .
6 . These Cameras Can Be Mounted on the Inside and Outside of Your Home
Are you looking for a way to protect both the interior and exterior portion of your residence ?
If you answered yes , then a security camera system is your best bet .
Most people fail to realize that these cameras can be used in both the outside and inside of a home .
If you are going to put security cameras on the outside of the home , they need to be weatherproofed .
A camera installation professional can help you find the right housing to offer protection to your outdoor cameras .
Avoid DIY Security Camera Installation
Trying to install a home camera system without professional help can be disastrous .
The last thing you want to do is damage your new camera due to a lack of experience , which is why hiring professionals is a wise move .

But there ’s a deeper problem : Europe ’s economic and monetary integration has run too far ahead of its political institutions .
The economies of Europe ’s many nations are almost as tightly linked as the economies of America ’s many states  and most of Europe shares a common currency .
But unlike America , Europe does n’t have the kind of continentwide institutions needed to deal with a continentwide crisis .
This is a major reason for the lack of fiscal action : there ’s no government in a position to take responsibility for the European economy as a whole .
What Europe has , instead , are national governments , each of which is reluctant to run up large debts to finance a stimulus that will convey many if not most of its benefits to voters in other countries .
You might expect monetary policy to be more forceful .
After all , while there is n’t a European government , there is a European Central Bank .
But the E.C.B. is n’t like the Fed , which can afford to be adventurous because it ’s backed by a unitary national government  a government that has already moved to share the risks of the Fed ’s boldness , and will surely cover the Fed ’s losses if its efforts to unfreeze financial markets go bad .
The E.C.B. , which must answer to 16 often - quarreling governments , ca n’t count on the same level of support .
Europe , in other words , is turning out to be structurally weak in a time of crisis .
The biggest question is what will happen to those European economies that boomed in the easy - money environment of a few years ago , Spain in particular .
For much of the past decade Spain was Europe ’s Florida , its economy buoyed by a huge speculative housing boom .
As in Florida , boom has now turned to bust .
Now Spain needs to find new sources of income and employment to replace the lost jobs in construction .
In the past , Spain would have sought improved competitiveness by devaluing its currency .
But now it ’s on the euro  and the only way forward seems to be a grinding process of wage cuts .
This process would have been difficult in the best of times ; it will be almost inconceivably painful if , as seems all too likely , the European economy as a whole is depressed and tending toward deflation for years to come .
For those of you unfamiliar with Radack , she worked at DoJ as an ethics advisor .
She vehemently disputed the Administration 's position that wounded American Taliban John Walker Lindh could be questioned without an attorney present .
Evidence also suggests that Walker was either tortured and / or refused medical treatment for his wounds until he satisfactorily answered the interrogators questions .
In December 2001 , while working at the Professional Responsibility and Advisory Office of the U.S. Department of Justice , Radack received an inquiry from the FBI about whether Lindh could be questioned without the presence of counsel .
Radack responded that this was not permitted by law , since Lindh ’s father had already retained a lawyer for him .
The FBI nevertheless questioned Lindh without the presence of his lawyer .
Radack thus advised that the confession should be sealed and could not be used in a criminal case against Lindh .
The prosecution ignored her advice and used the evidence .
Furthermore , Attorney General John Ashcroft stated that “ to our knowledge , ( Lindh ) has not chosen a lawyer ( at the time of interrogation ) ” .
Radack received an harsh job performance evaluation just two weeks after charges were filed against Lindh .
Constitutional scholar Bruce Fein , a former Reagan Administration official , found the allegations so egregious that he agreed to defend her pro bono .
In March 2002 , shortly before Radack ’s employment at the Justice Department ended , U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III , who was presiding over the Lindh case , requested copies of the Justice Department ’s internal correspondence on the case .
The most important e-mails that Radack had sent in the case and which undermined the public statements by the Justice Department had meanwhile been removed from the official Lindh file in violation of the rules of federal procedure .
Radack recovered the e-mails and informed her supervisor that her department had not complied with the court order .
Radack passed her e-mails to reporters at Newsweek .
Of course , in the leak obsessed Bush Administration which selectively leaked like a Dutch Boy with his finger in the proverbial dike decided to investigate her for releasing the e-mails .
In June 2002 , the District Court ordered the Justice Department to investigate the origins of the e-mails .
Instead of investigating the cover - up , the Justice Department put Radack under criminal investigation after she declined to speak at length to investigators .
Ronald Powell , a special agent for the Justice Department 's Office of the Inspector General , informed Radack 's new employer of the investigation and questioned its staff and lawyers , and Radack lost her job as a result .
U.S. senator Ted Kennedy submitted questions about this affair to Attorney General John Ashcroft in March 2003 and expressed concern about her situation in May 2003 .
After some time , the criminal investigation was closed with no charges , but her case was referred to the state bar of Maryland , which eventually cleared her of all wrongdoing .
I should note that Radack had difficulty finding a job as an attorney before the Maryland Bar cleared her since no firm would hire a lawyer under investigation by the Bar Association .
Radack was also on the No Fly List and subject to a number of indignities that most of us have never experienced nor would they want to .
For a list of articles on Radack or by her , go to herweb site .
Radack risked her career because as an officer of the court she had a duty to report criminal activity and she felt the decision to torture Lindh and deny him legal counsel was indeed criminal .
Moreover , she risked prosecution from the most politicized DoJ in American history because she had the chutzpah to correct the lies of the torture enablers in the Administration .
According to her own website , Radack was convinced by Daniel Ellsburg and Ray McGovern to publish her book Canary in a Coalmine .
They understood that this administration was breaking our laws and why I was forced to became a whistle blower .
They understood why I was so angry and why I 'm still angry .
After all , I had been a proud member of the Department of Justice and they knew that it meant the world to me .
So they convinced me to keep fighting for the very existence of Justice within the Department of Justice And our country at large .
Contrast the risks that Radack took to the craven behavior of the Gang of Eight which knew some details of the torture program but stood by silent as American soldiers died as blowback from the ill - fated and sadistic torture program of the Pinnochet , er Bush Administration .
UPDATE :
First time ever on Rec list !
Thank you so much for all of your feedback .
UPDATE 2 :
I received a comment from Jesselyn Radack , and IMO it is worth repeating in the body of the diary .
" ... There are lots of tentacles to pursue here , but to the key question of your diary , I have applied to positions within the Department of Justice , specifically the Office of Legal Counsel that wrote the horrendous torture memos , and also the Civil Division -- which is headed by the recently - confirmed Tony West -- John Walker Lindh 's attorney .
No response . "
Update 3 :
I received some additional comments from Jesselyn regarding the torture memos .
Here are her thoughts on the subject , which bear repeating :
Prosecute .
Not prosecuting because it's a bad time politically is . . . political .
Politics should not affect the rule of law .
Period .
Obama , with the highest respect due , stand down .
Let Eric Holder and Congress do their jobs .
We complained about the Justice Department being politicized during the Bush Administration , but your constant and conflicting comments are giving the same appearance .
I would agree with that statement since IMO the Obama Administration is so fearful of being accused of Rovian politics that it has offended the sensibilities of millions of Americans who do n't want torture or warrantless wiretapping done in their names .
Jesselyn predicts that the next round of torture photos will be even more shocking than what we saw five years ago at Abu Gharib :
The additional photos scheduled to be released on May 28 are even worse that what we 've seen .
But Abu Ghraib should have been enough .
Hooded people hooked up to electrodes standing on a box should be enough .
There is more direct evidence in the public either than in most circumstantial cases .
Think " silver platter doctrine . "
The case for war crimes is presented on a silver platter , tied up with a bow , with a cherry on top .
I do n't know why even liberal newspapers like the New York Times have said that " criminal prosecution " is unlikely for the torture lawyers .
The Justice Department 's internal watchdog , the Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) can make bar referrals and referrals for criminal prosecution .
It referred me for both .
The fact that they have not done so with John Yoo , Jay Bybee and their ilk speaks for itself .
Why imbue this office with any credibility whatsoever ?
Moeover , she noted that the Obama announcement to not prosecute CIA personnel — which by itself was a naked political decision — was wrong on the merits :
I submit that granting blanket immunity -- meaning total ( transactional ) immunity to the CIA was premature , given that it preceded the recent release of the Senate reports , which said the torture program originated with the CIA .
Immunity deals are supposed to be a two way street -- if the CIA gets immunity , then the whole truth should be laid bare before the public for a true public accounting .
There are no Fifth Amendment concerns about self - incrimination because the CIA has been given a free pass .
So formalize the immunity deal .
Immunity for the whole truth .
That is what we want .
This is not , nor has it ever been a partisan witch hunt .
Torture is always a crime .
If this had been done by the Obama Administration , I would feel the same way .

Bacteria are single cell organisms with no nervous system or brain .
So how do individual bacterial cells living as part of a complex community called a biofilm " decide " between different physiological processes ( such as movement or producing the " glue " that forms the biofilm ) ?
In the 2009 Fleming lecture , given at the Society for General Microbiology 's meeting in Harrogate March 30 , Dr Nicola Stanley - Wall from the University of Dundee explained that it is important to understand how biofilms form as they are often the basis of chronic infections and also of bioremediation processes .
More detailed information on how bacteria develop into biofilms will allow scientists to work on alternative strategies to treat biofilm related infections and may improve technologies for waste water treatment plants or microbial fuel cells .
Using a soil bacterium called Bacillus subtilis , Dr Stanley - Wall has investigated the genes and proteins required for biofilms to develop .
She has shown that a protein called DegU helps the individual bacteria to " decide " whether to form a biofilm or not .
" Presumably the bacteria need to achieve the best outcome in response to changes in environmental conditions .
DegU protein enables the bacteria to switch between swarming movement and the production of biofilm materials to suit the particular circumstances , " said Dr Stanley - Wall .

第二種免費的策略就相當的高明了，這是一種迂迴戰術，表面上看起來免費，其實是一個無底洞，網路遊戲《征途》就是採用這種策略，甚至被網民視為中國十大燒錢網路遊戲之首，根據《財經時報》的報導，一份來自某網遊公司的資料顯示，以一款平均線上十萬人的網遊為例，傳統的點卡計費模式可以做到人均消費3-4元/天，月收入約達1000萬元；而免費網遊模式收費好的則可以做到人均消費5元/天，月收入達1500萬元...
由最早的盛大《傳奇2》發展到現在，已經幾乎所有的網路遊戲都免費化，但是靠著遊戲中用以過關的道具來銷售，這種增值服務的暴利更是驚人，有遊戲迷提到，這樣的遊戲讓他每個月所花的錢，比之前多出幾倍，而這個過去在遊戲迷同好之間，最可恥的花錢買道具，現在卻受到這些網遊提供商的倡導...
此外，包含防毒殺毒軟體也走上這條路，例如：中國知名的金山、奇虎360安全衛士等，都是打著免費使用的口號，他們不外乎是想以此打擊競爭對手，建立更大的市場規模，而或許他們也藉由防毒專業的角色與擔保，向用戶們介紹一些常用或者好用的軟體，從中向這些軟體收取廣告費，甚至是依據下載安裝數量收費...
而相同的在網路上免費提 供Windows修正版、破解版的這些提供網站，諸如前幾個月內地被微軟查抄的番茄花園，或其他的雨林木風，都是相似的操作手法，而這都一再的驗證「免費的才是最貴的」這個道理...
而除了這些外，像MSN、Google 、Facebook等，則在其用戶基礎之下建立的龐大的廣告播放系統...
用戶在享用這些免費的資源過程中，或許會不堪其擾，因為何時電腦會出現一個IE廣告，或者莫名奇妙出現一個未知軟體都不知道，而提供商卻從中賺取了不少的廣告收入...
所以千萬不要輕忽使用者付費的這個觀念，當真正看到一個免費服務的時候，還是先想想提供者背後的意義吧...

10 Things Every Parent , Teenager & Teacher Should Know About Marijuana " Prohibition ... goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man 's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes .
A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded . " --
Abraham Lincoln December , 1840
This pamphlet was researched and produced as a public service by the Family Council on Drug Awareness P.O. Box 71093 , LA CA 90071-0093 Additional copies available from : BACH , PO Box 71093 , L.A. , CA 90071-0093 35 cents apiece , Ten for $ 2.00 , 100 for $ 10 1 Q . What is Marijuana ?
A. " Marijuana " refers to the dried leaves and flowers of the cannabis plant [ 1 ] , which contain the non-narcotic chemical THC at various potencies .
It is smoked or eaten to produce the feeling of being " high . "
The different strains of this herb produce different sensual effects , ranging from sedative to stimulant .
2 Q. Who Uses Marijuana ?
A . There is no simple profile of a typical marijuana user .
It has been used for 1000s of years for medical , social , and religious reasons and for relaxation [ 2 ] .
Several of our Presidents [ 3 ] are believed to have smoked it .
One out of every five Americans say they have tried it .
And it is still popular among artists , writers , musicians , activists , lawyers , inventors , working people , etc. 3 Q. How Long Have People Been Using Marijuana ?
A. Marijuana has been used since ancient times [ 4 ] .
While field hands and working people have often smoked the raw plant , aristocrats historically prefer hashish [ 5 ] made from the cured flowers of the plant .
It was not seen as a problem until a calculated disinformation [ sic ] campaign was launched in the 1930s [ 6 ] , and the first American laws against using it were passed [ 7 ] .
4 Q. Is Marijuana Addictive ?
A . No , it is not [ 8 ] .
Most users are moderate consumers who smoke it socially to relax .
We now know that 10 % of our population have " addictive personalities " and they are neither more nor less likely to overindulge in cannabis than in anything else .
On a relative scale , marijuana is less habit forming than either sugar or chocolate but more so than anchovies .
Sociologists report a general pattern of marijuana use that peaks in the early adult years , followed by a period of levelling off and then a gradual reduction in use [ 9 ] .
5 Q. Has Anyone Ever Died From Smoking Marijuana ?
A . No ; not one single case , not ever .
THC is one of the few chemicals for which there is no known toxic amount [ 10 ] .
The federal agency NIDA says that autopsies reveal that 75 people per year are high on marijuana when they die : this does not mean that marijuana caused or was even a factor in their deaths .
The chart below compares the number of deaths attributable to selected substances in a typical year : Tobacco ............................... 340,000 - 395,000 Alcohol ( excluding crime / accidents ) ............. 125,000 + Drug Overdose ( prescription ) ............ 24,000 - 27,000 Drug Overdose ( illegal ) ................... 3,800 - 5,200 Marijuana ............................................. 0 * Source : U.S. Government Bureau of Mortality Statistics , 1987 6 Q. Does Marijuana Lead to Crime and / or Hard Drugs ?
A. No [ 11 ] .
The only crime most marijuana users commit is that they use marijuana .
And , while many people who abuse dangerous drugs also smoke marijuana , the old " stepping stone " theory is now discredited , since virtually all of them started out " using " legal drugs like sugar , coffee , cigarettes , alcohol , etc. 7 Q. Does Marijuana Make People Violent ?
A. No .
In fact , Federal Bureau of Narcotics director Harry Anslinger once told Congress just the opposite - that it leads to non-violence and pacifism [ 12 ] .
If he was telling the truth ( which he and key federal agencies have not often done regarding marijuana ) , then re-legalizing marijuana should be considered as one way to curb violence in our cities .
The simple fact is that marijuana does not change your basic personality .
The government says that over 20 million Americans still smoke it , probably including some of the nicest people you know .
8 Q. How Does Marijuana Affect Your Health ?
A. Smoking anything is not healthy , but marijuana is less dangerous than tobacco and people smoke less of it at a time .
This health risk can be avoided by eating the plant instead of smoking it [ 13 ] , or can be reduced by smoking smaller amounts of stronger marijuana .
There is no proof that marijuana causes serious health or sexual problems [ 14 ] but , like alcohol , its use by children or adolescents is discouraged .
Cannabis is a medicinal herb that has hundreds of proven , valuable theraputic uses - from stress reduction to glaucoma to asthma to cancer therapy , etc. [ 15 ] .
9 Q. What About All Those Scary Statistics and Studies ?
A . Most were prepared as scare tactics for the government by Dr. Gabriel Nahas , and were so biased and unscientific that Nahas was fired by the National Institute of Health [ 16 ] and finally renounced his own studies as meaningless [ 17 ] .
For one experiment , he suffocated monkeys for five minutes at a time , using proportionately more smoke than the average user inhales in an entire lifetime [ 18 ] .
The other studies that claim sensational health risks are also suspect , since they lack controls and produce results which cannot be replicated or independently verified [ 19 ] .
10 Q. What Can I Do About Marijuana ?
A . No independent government panel that has studied marijuana has ever recommended jail for users [ 20 ] .
Concerned persons should therefore ask their legislators to re-legalize and tax this plant , subject to age limits and regulations similar to those on alcohol and tobacco .

This article is the first of a series on Dependency Injection in general and the implementation of a Dependency Injection Container in PHP .
Today , I wo n't talk about the container yet as I first want to introduce the concept of Dependency Injection with some concrete examples that will hopefully demonstrate the problems it tries to solve and the benefits it gives to the developer .
If you already knows the concept of Dependency Injection , you can safely skip this article and instead wait for the next one .
Dependency Injection is probably one of the most dead simple design pattern I know .
And odds are you have probably already used Dependency Injection .
But it is also one of the most difficult one to explain well .
I think it is partly due to the nonsense examples used in most introductions to Dependency Injection .
I have tried to come up with examples that fits the PHP world better .
As PHP is a language mainly used for web development , let 's take a simple Web example .
To overcome the statelessness of the HTTP protocol , web applications need a way to store user information between web requests .
This is of course quite simple to achieve by using a cookie , or even better , by using the built - in PHP session mechanism :
$ _SESSION [' language ' ] = ' fr ' ;
The above code stores the user language in the language session variable .
So , for all subsequent requests of the same user , the language will be available in the global $ _SESSION array :
$ user_language = $ _SESSION [' language ' ] ;
As Dependency Injection only makes sense in an Object - Oriented world , let 's pretend we have a SessionStorage class that wraps the PHP session mechanism :
class SessionStorage { function __construct ( $cookieName = ' PHP_SESS_ID ') { session_name ( $ cookieName ) ; session_start ( ) ; } function set ( $key , $ value ) { $ _SESSION [ $ key ] = $ value ; } function get ( $ key ) { return $ _SESSION [ $key ] ; } // ... }
... and a User class that provides a nice high - level interface :
class User { protected $ storage ; function __construct ( ) { $ this -> storage = new SessionStorage ( ) ; } function setLanguage ( $ language ) { $ this -> storage - > set ( ' language ' , $ language ) ; } function getLanguage ( ) { return $ this -> storage -> get ( ' language ' ) ; } // ... }
Those classes are simple enough and using the User class is also rather easy :
$ user = new User ( ) ; $ user -> setLanguage ( ' fr ' ) ; $ user_language = $ user-> getLanguage ( ) ;
All is good and well ... until you want more flexibility .
What if you want to change the session cookie name for instance ?
Here are some random possibilities :
Hardcode the name in the User class in the SessionStorage constructor :
class User { function __construct ( ) { $ this -> storage = new SessionStorage ( ' SESSION_ID ' ) ; } // ... }
Define a constant outside of the User class :
class User { function __construct ( ) { $ this -> storage = new SessionStorage ( STORAGE_SESSION_NAME ) ; } // ... } define ( ' STORAGE_SESSION_NAME ' , ' SESSION_ID ' ) ;
Add the session name as a User constructor argument :
class User { function __construct ( $sessionName ) { $ this -> storage = new SessionStorage ( $sessionName ) ; } // ... } $ user = new User ( ' SESSION_ID ' ) ;
Add an array of options for the storage class :
class User { function __construct ( $storageOptions ) { $ this ->storage = new SessionStorage ( $storageOptions [' session_name ' ] ) ; } // ... } $user = new User( array ( ' session_name ' => ' SESSION_ID ' ) ) ;
All these alternatives are quite bad .
Hardcoding the session name in the User class does not really solve the problem as you cannot easily change your mind later on without changing the User class again .
Using a constant is also a bad idea as the User class now depends on a constant to be set .
Passing the session name as an argument or as an array of options is probably the best solution , but it still smells bad .
It clutters the User constructor arguments with things that are not relevant to the object itself .
But there is yet another problem that cannot be solved easily : How can I change the SessionStorage class ?
For instance , to replace it with a mock object to ease testing .
Or perhaps because you want to store the sessions in a database table or in memory .
That 's impossible with the current implementation , except if you change the User class .
Enter Dependency Injection .
Instead of creating the SessionStorage object inside the User class , let 's inject the SessionStorage object in the User object by passing it as a constructor argument :
class User { function __construct ( $ storage ) { $ this -> storage = $ storage ; } // ... }
That 's Dependency Injection .
Nothing more !
Using the User class is now a bit more involving as you first need to create the SessionStorage object :
$ storage = new SessionStorage ( ' SESSION_ID ' ) ; $ user = new User ( $storage ) ;
Now , configuring the session storage object is dead simple , and replacing the session storage class is also very easy .
And everything is possible without changing the User class thanks to the better separation of concerns .
The Pico Container website describes Dependency Injection like this :
" Dependency Injection is where components are given their dependencies through their constructors , methods , or directly into fields . "
As any other design pattern , Dependency Injection also has some anti-patterns .
The Pico Container website describes some of them .
Dependency Injection is not restricted to constructor injection :
Constructor Injection :
class User { function __construct ( $ storage ) { $ this -> storage = $ storage ; } // ... }
Setter Injection :
class User { function setSessionStorage ( $ storage ) { $ this -> storage = $ storage ; } // ... }
Property Injection :
class User { public $ sessionStorage ; } $user -> sessionStorage = $ storage ;
As a rule of thumb , constructor injection is best for required dependencies , like in our example , and setter injection is best for optional dependencies , like a cache object for instance .
Nowadays , most modern PHP frameworks heavily use Dependency Injection to provide a set of decoupled but cohesive components :
// symfony : A constructor injection example $ dispatcher = new sfEventDispatcher ( ) ; $ storage = new sfMySQLSessionStorage ( array ( ' database ' => ' session ' , ' db_table ' => ' session ' ) ) ; $user = new sfUser ( $ dispatcher , $ storage , array ( ' default_culture ' => 'en ' ) ) ; // Zend Framework : A setter injection example $ transport = new Zend_Mail_Transport_Smtp('smtp.gmail.com ' , array ( ' auth ' => ' login ' , ' username ' => ' foo ' , ' password ' => ' bar ' , ' ssl ' => ' ssl ' , ' port ' => 465 , ) ) ; $ mailer = new Zend_Mail ( ) ; $ mailer ->setDefaultTransport ( $ transport ) ;
If you are interested in learning more about Dependency Injection , I highly recommend you read the Martin Fowler introduction or the excellent Jeff More presentation .
You can also have a look at a presentation I gave last year on Dependency Injection , where I talk in more detail on the example I have talked about in this article .
That 's all for today .
I hope you now have a better understanding of the Dependency Injection concept .
In the next installment of this series , I will talk about Dependency Injection Containers .

It 's one thing to follow the teachings of Jesus , but it 's another thing to try to eat like him , talk like him , look like him , even vote like him .
After reading the book " A Year of Living Biblically , " by A.J. Jacobs , former pastor Ed Dobson decided to devote a year trying to live as Jesus did , based on what is written about him in the Bible and other historical documents .
" I read that book a little over a year ago , and I thought , well , if a secular Jew could do this , certainly a follower of Jesus could , " Dobson said today on " Good Morning America Weekend . "
Dobson , the vice president of spiritual formation at Cornerstone University in Grand Rapids , Mich. , said he did not shave , ate kosher , observed the Sabbath and read through the gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John every week .
He even had a couple of beers along the way .
" I would often go down to the bar , sit up at the counter , drink a beer and talk about God , which Jesus was accused of being a glutton and a drunkard , " he said .
The most difficult part of the challenge , Dobson said , was obeying Jesus ' teachings , particularly the idea of blessing the people who persecute you .
" My youngest son did two tours in Iraq , and on the last tour , a friend of his was killed in action and my wife and I went for the visitation and I was overwhelmed with grief and also with anger for the people who had made the roadside bomb , planted it and detonated it , " he said .
" And then I finally realized I had to pray for them and bless them , which is very , very hard to do . "
Dobson even voted in the presidential race as he thought Jesus would .
Dobson pulled the lever for Barack Obama , saying it was the first time he ever voted for a Democrat .
" I decided since I had read through the gospels at that point over 30 times , I wanted to know who best represented the fundamental teachings of Jesus , and I felt that he more than any other candidate represented the teachings of Jesus , so I voted for him , " Dobson said .
Dobson 's message to others heading into the new year is to start reading the Bible , which he acknowledged can be demanding .
" I would encourage people , whether you 've ever read the Bible or not , begin reading the Bible , and just listen to what God has to say . "
Two major features that I 've been wanting to implement for ages are now in SVN trunk , and due for imminent release with South 0.5 .
They are :
ORM Freezing : Much like the strangely similar feature of Migratory ( which is what inspired this ) , South now has the ability to ' freeze ' models to make them accessible inside the migration , so you can write data migrations more easily .
Things like fake models needed for the other ends of ForeignKeys ( when creating tables and the like ) are also now implemented using the same system , to make things cleaner .
Automatic change detection :
Before this was impossible , but now , if you freeze all of an app 's models into a migration , South can compare that with the current state and automatically write a migration for the changes that have occurred .
There 's a setting to automatically freeze the app into every migration to make this more usable , too .
I 'm very excited about these new features ; they should make the next release of South one not to be missed .
There 's also other changes under the hood , as well , including a new , much more robust models .
py parser .
Documentation for these features is up already , and the tutorial will be extended ( given a second part ) soon , in order to cover them - they 're features we want everyone using , since they 'll save you time , and , hopefully stress .
If you feel like testing the new features before the next release , just check out trunk and have a play .
Your feedback is also more than welcome on our new South mailing list , which you should also have a look at .
Rates have fallen for almost every type of crime in San Francisco in the first three months of the year , and city leaders do n't know why .
All kinds of violent crime are down by 20 percent so far this year , and homicides have dropped more than 60 percent , according to crime statistics released by the city Thursday .
There were 11 homicides reported in the first three months of 2009 , compared with 28 in the same time period last year .
Generally , crime rates climb during economic downturns , criminal analysts say .
The fact that they 've dropped off so far this year could be a sign that new crime - fighting efforts focused in particular neighborhoods are starting to work - or it could just be good luck , Mayor Gavin Newsom said .
" Sometimes these things are just inexplicable , " Newsom said .
" Last year homicides went up , and I thought we were making a lot of progress . "
The Police Department counts 97 homicides in San Francisco last year , not including one person who died at Ocean Beach and whose death is being investigated by the U.S. Park Service , and one person who died in March but whose death was n't ruled a homicide until this year .
The department counts 11 homicides so far this year , including the death from March 2008 .
Rapes , robberies and aggravated assault cases all have dropped off this year , by 18 percent to 24 percent .
Property crimes - including arson , burglary and auto theft - have fallen 20 percent so far .
Police Chief Heather
Fong said one possible explanation for the drop in crime is the city 's new " zoned " policing , a program that started in February 2008 and involves focusing police resources in the most crime - ridden communities .
Authorities said two months ago that in the first year of the new policy , homicides dropped just 6 percent in the city overall , but fell 34 percent in the targeted communities - the Tenderloin , Western Addition , Mission , Bayview and Visitacion Valley .
Also helpful , Fong said , is that the city has finally reached full staffing levels , adding more than 400 patrol officers to bring the total full - time policing staff to 1,971 officers .
The city has not been able to reach that level since San Francisco residents voted to require it in 1994 .
Fong noted that San Francisco has n't been hit as hard by the recession as have other communities in the United States , which could be a reason crime rates have n't climbed .
But she said the department has seen more " get rich quick " scams that single out people who do n't speak English .
" It 's great to see reductions in crime , " Fong said .
" Now our work is to sustain that . "
Not working is perhaps the truest definition of what it means to be disabled .
— Louis Harris & Associates , The Survey of Disabled Americans : Bringing Disabled Americans Into the Mainstream ( International Center for the Disabled , 1986 )
The refusal to employ disabled people in Argentina has persisted for decades .
1
Neither the political and economic orientation of those in government nor periods of economic expansion and job creation have favored the hiring of the disabled .
Although the National Congress has passed a series of laws , including job quotas in 1981 , an anti-discrimination law in 1988 , and constitutional mandates on human rights in 1994 , these norms are in practice rarely enforced .
Laws regarding accessibility in urban areas , construction , and transportation have suffered a similar fate .
The courts have become a battleground , with disabled people litigating for compliance , while employers and the government contest any ruling in favor of mandatory employment and inclusive living conditions .
Isabel Ferreira , a lawyer in charge of disability cases at the Buenos Aires Ombudsman ’s Office , and a wheelchair user herself since Argentina ’s polio epidemic in the 1950s , calls the legislation “ a demagogic expression of good intentions . ”
As such , she says , the legislation is repeatedly infringed with impunity .
“ The strategy of using the courts to define and enforce public policies reveals the absence or ineffectiveness of these policies , ” she says , “ and explains why people with disabilities must intervene so that they are on the government ’s agenda . ”
The late Marcelo Morgenstern , an Argentine disability rights activist who was tortured into blindness during the dictatorship , once put it : “ The challenge of disability concerns our right to earn a living , to assert ourselves as workers against those who wield political and economic power , with an argument that goes to the root of the problem of unemployment and precarious employment among the most stricken sectors . ”
Argentine disability organizations , usually led by the non-disabled , are nearly always informed by a medical perspective and have mainly focused on “ assistant services ” — that is , performing tasks and chores for disabled people rather than creating the conditions that would enable them to function autonomously .
This is no surprise .
Prevailing attitudes treat disability as if it were an illness , and disabled people as if they were chronic patients requiring lifelong care .
As a result , the disabled have been grouped by type : the deaf , the blind , the physically handicapped , the mentally disabled , and so on .
In Argentina , the first break with this categorical thinking took place in the 1970s , during the military dictatorship , when disabled activists established a group called the Crippled Peronist Front , aimed at redressing disabled people ’s grievances and defending their rights .
Both the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance ( a right - wing parapolice group also known as the Triple A ) and the military dictatorship itself kidnapped , tortured , and “ disappeared ” many of its members .
Following this , while the military dictatorship remained in power , the Argentine Corporation of the Disabled was founded , under the tutelage of the National Director of Rehabilitation , and pushed for disability legislation .
But the only law passed at the time and consistently complied with since regulates the importation of vehicles for the disabled , a measure that particularly benefits those of the upper middle class .
In 1998 , people with the most diverse disabilities and their sympathizers established the Disability Rights Network ( REDI ) .
It began by pressuring the Buenos Aires Legislature to ensure that elevators be accessible to wheelchair users .
An ordinance mandated that building owners replace old elevator doors with presumably safer ones , but it did not take into account the amount of space required to accommodate wheelchairs .
As a result , many of the city ’s wheelchair users remained locked inside their homes , unable to go to work , visit relatives , or attend rehabilitation .
The next year the Buenos Aires legislature passed a law requiring wheelchair accessibility in elevators , but REDI had to press for a second law for it to be enforced immediately .
Finally , in 2003 , the city ’s building code was revised to include accessibility guidelines all buildings to be built in the future .
This included apartment buildings , guaranteeing at least one bathroom and bedroom to be wheelchair accessible in each apartment , as well as general building access ( entrance , elevator , hallways ) .
REDI also extended its demands to include accessible public transportation , compliance with job quotas , and the recovery of federal funds destined to disability programs , funds that were illegally diverted to the national budget .
The organization also broadened its demand for accessibility to all urban spaces and buildings and succeeded in modifying the Buenos Aires building code .
Based on that experience , REDI launched a national campaign for accessible cities .
The Argentine economic crisis of 2001 – 02 , in which unemployment skyrocketed , proved to be a decisive moment for disabled rights activists .
“ We recognized that our issues were not insulated from broader political and economic ones and that our fundamental demands converged with those of other organizations of the unemployed and of those who are structurally left out of the productive system , ” says Carolina Buceta , a blind psychologist and president of REDI .
“ So , in the middle of the 2001 crisis , we came up with the following idea : ‘ Joining other struggles , we advance our own . ’ ”
REDI called on prominent Argentine human rights organizations , including the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights , the Center for Legal and Social Studies , and the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo , to gain support for specific demands and , at times , to join forces .
The economic crisis exposed the intimate relationship between disability and poverty , allowing REDI to establish ties with the Social Forum on Health , the National Assembly of Employed and Unemployed Workers , and the neighborhood assemblies that emerged during the period of “ Throw Them All Out ! ” ( ¡que se vayan todos ! ) .
For Facundo Chávez Penillas , a lawyer , wheelchair user , and secretary of REDI , “ These relations helped us break with the traditional image and tendency to form disability ghettos , reaffirmed our necessary role in defining public policies and programs that affect us , and brought into the limelight the concept of ‘ nothing about us without us . ’ ”

If chronic unemployment is the defining characteristic of the disabled , it is also , in a sense , their shared “ illness , ” irrespective of each individual ’s specific limitations .
In 2003 , the International Labor Organization reported that unemployment rates among disabled people reached 80 % or more in many developing countries , while Argentina ’s National Ministry of Labor says that , at most , only one out of 10 disabled Argentines has a job , and less than 1 % of national government jobs are held by disabled people , when by law it should be 4%.2
With the notable exception of upper - and upper - middle - class disabled people , the overwhelming majority survive on various forms of charity .
For the most part , families bear the brunt and are further impoverished by the presence of a homebound disabled person .
Few families can afford one less income earner , let alone absorb the extra expense associated with disability care .
Limited governmental social benefits — when the disabled and their families learn of their existence and succeed in qualifying for them — are meager , though sometimes augmented by charitable and religious institutions .
As a last resort , many disabled people turn to begging .
Usually , when a disabled person manages to find a job , the pay is much lower compared to what a non -disabled person earns , and work quite often goes unpaid during inordinately long periods of training .
Moreover , their working conditions tend to be worse , given the lack of accessible facilities , ergonomically designed tools , or appropriate communication systems .
In addition to these and other straightforward abuses , disabled people are often assigned tasks with no or little regard for their abilities .
Facundo Ferro , 27 , has a slight mental disability and says he can find only unpaid internships at NGOs .
“ Photocopying , doing errands , filing , ” he says .
“ Nobody hires me full - time .
I assist the coach of the basketball - on - wheels team .
But I never see a cent .
Promises nobody keeps . ”
Unemployment and pay discrimination , not only for disabled people , is a worldwide phenomenon .
In the neoliberal era , governments in the leading developed countries , as well as in underdeveloped ones , have been dismantling the remarkable social achievements that followed World War II ( retirement pensions , social services , public health and education ) , gradually eroding safety nets underlying job security and establishing precarious employment .
3
These policies , designed to benefit the rich at the expense of the poor , have further impoverished those with disabilities .
Economists Robert Haveman and Barbara Wolfe , commenting on the United States , noted in 1999 that the poverty rate among working - age disabled people was about three times that of those without disabilities .
“ From 1972 to 1987 , ” they added , “ average earnings of disabled males decreased from nearly $ 19,000 to somewhat more than $ 11,000 , and from about three - fourths of the earnings of the nondisabled to about one - half . ”
This was even more pronounced among disabled women and black men , they reported .
4
According to another pair of researchers , Andrew Houtenville and Adam Adler , from 1980 to 2000 , the relative employment rate of U.S. disabled people ( that is , the employment of those with a disability as a percentage of the employment of those without a one ) dropped dramatically from 43 % to 38.6 % .
Meanwhile , in the same period , disabled people ’s relative median household size - adjusted income ( expressed as a percentage of the nondisabled population ’s relative median household size - adjusted income ) dropped from 53.7 % to 50.9 % .
This trend suggests that disabled people are more seriously affected than others during periods of high unemployment .

While there have always been persons with physical , sensory , or cognitive limitations , their place under the different modes in which societies have organized their productive systems has changed over time .
6
Under slavery , people worked , healthy , sick , or injured , until they died and were replaced .
Tasks were largely manual and simple .
7
Under feudalism , people worked for their subsistence and owed a significant part of their production to their feudal lords .
Those who had some limitations contributed whatever they could to the family economy ; some even displayed skills as artisans .
With the emergence of industrialization , which demanded a technical division of labor and set the basis for the capitalist mode of production , employment of labor power in exchange for a salary developed .
Owners of the means of production sought to hire only those they considered capable of carrying out repetitive tasks and enduring long working hours , under often dangerous , subhuman conditions .
In this context , the concept of disability evolved to mean the inability to work productively or , more pointedly , to be exploited and produce profits for factory owners .
8
This system demands that workers work not only enough hours to generate a value equivalent to their wage , but also additional hours to generate a surplus value , which is largely converted into profits .
To augment these profits , the capitalist makes sure that most of the workday consists of surplus labor .
This is achieved by different means : extending the workday , applying technological improvements , imposing faster rhythms of production , and paying the lowest possible wage .
If a worker is suspected of being incapable of satisfying these conditions , he or she is discarded as useless .
Thus , with the development of capitalism , we witness the emergence of a population in which poverty and disability converge .
This sector includes not only those who cannot join the workforce as wage laborers , but also those who are expelled from the workforce as a result of job - related injuries and illnesses , or by substandard living conditions , overcrowding , and malnutrition .
In 1998 , as precarious working conditions became the norm in Argentina , the Buenos Aires newspaper Página 12 carried a story exposing the ordeal of young women working in a car parts factory on the outskirts of the city : “ In a matter of months , their hands swell , they suffer tendinitis , are injected with cortisone like soccer players so they can continue working , and then wind up in surgery .
One of these workers , 20 years old , has been operated on twice and , according to her lawyers and the labor union , has been virtually excluded for life from the labor market . ”
Twenty more workers suffered the same fate .9
When workers like these become disabled , employers induce them to retire on disability benefits , in effect expecting that their families and the government will look after those who have lost their full productive capacities .
Thus , disabled workers join the large mass of the chronically unemployed , while many working - age disabled people are outright excluded from the productive system .
This negation of the right to earn a living unveils the true meaning of disability and helps explain why working - age disabled people cannot find jobs , despite labor quota laws and economic incentives for employers .
The twofold movement of exclusion and expulsion positions disability as a condition of non-exploitation or , on occasion , of super - exploitation .
According to Ana Dones , who heads a sheltered workshop ( an organization that provides training and employment for disabled people in a supportive environment ) , almost half of the more than 10,000 Argentine workers in some 300 such workshops work under subcontract for private firms , earning less than one third the minimum wage .
This is a case of super - exploitation made possible by Argentine government subsidies , while the Ministry of Labor continues to sit on an eight - year - old bill that would have mainstreamed these workers ’ employment status .
Meanwhile , the disabled population increases due to inadequate fetal and child nutrition , poor access to vaccines , lack of early detection and health care , occupational dangers , lax environmental protection , among other problems .
Regrettably , worsening conditions on the job , stimulated by weakened occupational health and safety regulations , have left workers unprotected and made it cheaper for employers to compensate them , or their close relatives , for on - the - job injuries and even death , than to implement preventive measures .
It is a system that produces poverty and disability .
*
Lack of adequate educational preparation among disabled people is alarmingly pervasive and contributes to their collective underclass status .
According to Argentina ’s National Census Bureau , one out of every three disabled persons has not completed elementary school , compared to one out of every 10 in the total population .
Other comparisons between Argentine disabled people and the country ’s total population are quite telling : Only 17.8 % of disabled Argentines have concluded their high school studies , versus 37.1 % in the total population .
Nine percent do not know how to read and write , compared to 2 % in the total population .
And the illiteracy rate is particularly high among those who could enter the labor market : 20.9 % among disabled people 15 to 29 years old , compared to 0.8 % in the total population for the same age bracket .10
Parents face enormous difficulties in seeking to enroll children who have physical disabilities , but no cognitive or intellectual limitations , in regular schools , according to a 2005 study .
Parents complained of Kafkaesque paths leading to dead - end streets and referrals to special - education schools , in the absence of physically accessible ones .
Interviews with educators , school authorities , and parents revealed a fundamental bias in the educational system :
Expectations of these children are so low that they are neither stimulated to their full capacity nor educated well enough to prepare them for work .
Too often , this below - standard schooling seems a pretense for normality rather than a path toward effective social inclusion .
As a result , these children tend to underperform and , in the long run , fail to secure employment .
11
Thus many disabled people reach working age without the know - how to become workers or keep a job .
Equally unfortunate : Even if a disabled person is prepared for employment and has the requisite skills , his or her qualifications may not be recognized , and if they are , the person is often assigned tasks that disregard his or her prior training .
In an even more likely scenario , disabled people may simply not be taken into account at all , their labor presumed to be unprofitable .

Dardo López is deaf ; he reads lips and speaks perfectly .
“ I wanted to be an optician , ” he says .
“ I graduated from the University of Buenos Aires .
I was interviewed , even at that chain of opticians in the shopping malls .
But nobody gave me a job .
Down deep , they did not believe I could make lenses , or that I could interact with clients .
I was shocked .
Is my license worthless ?
Look , I ’ve traveled in Europe and got by in English , French , and Italian .
I was even able to manage in Sweden and Finland .
Interact with clients ?
Please ! ”
López ’s plight is just one example of thousands that demonstrate how an inflexible system , rife with biases , undermines human potential .
It is widely believed that disabled people will disrupt the work ethic , force employers to make expensive adjustments , and fail to produce enough to be profitable .
As Haveman and Wolfe note , “ The norm most commonly adopted concerns the ability to carry out the tasks of a commonly accepted occupation — that is , the ability to engage in sufficient work to ‘ earn a living ’ ” ; “ the focus is on the ability of persons with physical or mental limitations to adjust to their work environment .
” 12
Despite widespread demands for accessibility , the notion that the work environment should adapt itself to disabled employees rather than the other way around does not prevail .
Quite the contrary :
If disabled people are unable to adjust , the usual thinking goes , they are n’t fit to work .
As such , equal opportunity for the disabled person becomes merely the opportunity to apply for a job whose working conditions likely bar that person from performing it .
Flawed as this thinking is , workers who fail to comply are at fault , not the employers .
Under this system of production , the worker can only offer his labor , while the employer dictates the work and the necessary means of production , including the conditions of production .
According to Silvia Coriat , an architect at Fundación Rumbos , an Argentine NGO that focuses on accessibility from a human rights perspective : “ The most advanced legislation on accessibility introduces the concept of ‘ reasonable adjustments . ’
But its definition , essentially economic , restricts its application to a decision based on criteria of profitable investment in business , or to budget allocations in government .
A presumably ‘ expensive ’ right winds up being no right at all . ”
Why does government fail to comply with job quotas , as mandated by law , even when it does not formally have to profit from the labor of its employees ?
Perhaps because government ’s fundamental role is to guarantee the workings of the system and its ideological foundations .
If it complied with the mandated quota , disabled people might demonstrate their capacity to carry out socially productive functions and could thereby demand employment in the remaining sectors of the economy .
This precedent , however , would expose the logic behind employing workers in the private sector ( making profits ) and would undermine the very existence of a reserve labor force ( the unemployed ) , which capitalism needs to maintain low wages and enforce long work hours , thereby maximizing profits .
It is no surprise , then , that the major obstacle to equality of opportunities is the absence of real and sustainable job opportunities for the disabled .
When asked to explain the current status quo , government officials customarily reply , “ If we hire a disabled person , what do we tell the rest ? ” as the mayor of Almirante Brown , a municipality on the outskirts of Buenos Aires , put it when forced to hire a wheelchair user as a full - time employee , under pressure from an organization of unemployed workers .
Given this attitude , equal opportunities through signing up on “ job application lists ” are reduced to a pipe dream , with jobs never materializing .
Ostensibly , the notion of equal opportunities provides workers equal standing to compete for scarce jobs , disguising the fact that the decision - making power , as to whether jobs are offered and who is hired , rests among businesspeople and government employers .
The workers have no decision - making power at all in this regard .
13
In fact , when job vacancies are presumably available to the disabled , definitions of suitability and the absence of training programs to acquire or strengthen on - the - job skills are formidable obstacles for these potential hires .
*
In the long term , according to Argentine economist Marcelo Ramal , disability and work will only be compatible once social relations founded on appropriating surplus labor are abolished .
Yet , as Ramal says , capitalism ’s development of productive forces has created the very means of overcoming the limitations of disability in the workplace .
For example , workers are largely indistinguishable when working a computer monitor or workstation ( there are even computer reading programs for the blind and writing programs for those who cannot use their hands ) .
“ The same social regime that condemns disabled people to unemployment , ” Ramal says , “ has created the conditions for equalizing them on the job , but for this to take place , these persons must emancipate themselves from being producers of surplus value , that is , of profits for others . ”
Not all people , disabled or not , display the same productive capacity , which depends not only on personal characteristics but also on working conditions , including the technical means available .
If disabled people did not have to generate profits for others , many of them could gain access to employment .
Optimally , their contributions to social production , based on their capabilities , even if these were limited , would suffice .
The right to earn a living by working should be guaranteed to all , regardless of whether or not one can generate surplus value .
In the short term , disabled people could focus their organizing efforts on labor unions , so that these pressure employers ( public or private ) to stop laying off workers when they become disabled , and demand the mandatory hiring of disabled people who are on application lists or in job pools , as required by applicable law .
In turn , government should ensure that disabled people ’s wages do not fall below the cost of a basket of basic goods — an indispensable starting point for dismantling the vicious cycle of disability and poverty .

I use the term disabled people or the disabled instead of persons with disabilities , since the former are more in line with a social understanding that puts the focus on oppression , whereas the latter emphasizes the individual ’s identity as defined by his or her physical , sensory , or mental impairment .
Any of these names , however , are preferable to those that pretend to free the concept of negative connotations or to make it politically correct , like persons with special needs , special persons , persons with different capabilities , and the challenged .

A freelance science and health journalist , Maggie lives in Minneapolis , brain dumps on Twitter , and writes quite often for mental_floss magazine .
They said it could n't be done .
" They " say a lot of things .
And if the story of mediocre - painter turned master - art - forger Han van Meegeren teaches us anything , it 's that the gate - keepers do n't always know what they 're talking about .
If there 's one thing sure to make me latch onto a bit of history like dried Jet glue on the fingers of architecture students , it 's real - life stories that come out seemingly tailor - made for Greek theater .
Naturally , you 'll find a longer version of this tale in Be Amazing .
Fool the Art World
Launching his career in the 1920s and 30s , Dutch painter Han van Meegeren utterly failed to take critics by storm .
Apparently committed to toiling on realistic portraiture while everybody else was trying to be Picasso , van Meegeren seemed doomed to the fate of a " never was . "
But when a critic derided his work as " lacking originality , " the frustrated artist hatched a plan that would prove his talent and make his foes look like idiots .
Ironically , the plan involved abandoning any pretense at originality whatsoever .
Instead , van Meegeren set out to become the greatest art forger who ever lived ; not merely copying known works of his hero , Jan Vermeer , but producing new paintings that would combine Vermeer 's literal and artistic signatures with van Meegeren 's own critically panned style of painting .
Van Meegeren originally planned to create just one of these paintings , make it an international sensation and then reveal the truth to a very small and sorry art world .
But plans–as plans are wont to do–went awry .
Fool Yourself
To pull off the deception , van Meegeren learned how to mix Renaissance - era paints , prepare canvasses the way Vermeer would have and artificially age his paintings .
The result : The Disciples at Emmaus , a never - before - seen , newly discovered Vermeer that was quickly a hit with art collectors across Europe .
In fact , the whole thing was so successful that van Meegeren abandoned the " expose critics as frauds " step of his plan and , instead , sold Emmaus for the equivalent of $ 4 million , and began work on another " Vermeer " .
Over the next five years , he went on to sell another $ 60 million worth of forged art .
Fool the Nazis , Fool the Allies and Almost Get Yourself Killed
The long con came to a screeching end in 1945 , when Allied forces found a previously unknown Vermeer hidden in a salt mine along with piles of other Nazi - pilfered works of art .
Using the Third Reich 's infamously well - organized record keeping , authorities tracked the piece to Field Marshall Herman Goering , who'd bought it from some Dutch art dealer named van Meegeren .
Brought in for questioning , van Meegeren refused to give up the name of the painting 's rightful owners and was sent to prison on charges of treason , a crime punishable by death .
Six weeks on death row and van Meegeren cracked , announcing somewhat histrionically that he 'd painting the thing himself .
Awkwardly , nobody believed him .
The painter was given one final chance .
If he could forge another painting , charges would be dropped .
Armed with his art supplies and court - appointed witnesses , van Meegeren turned out another " Vermeer " that shocked both jailers and art critics with its verisimilitude … and turned van Meegeren from a traitor into a public hero who'd outwitted the Nazis .
Of course , authorities were not 100 percent forgiving .
Although the charge of treason was dropped , van Meegeren did spend a year in jail for profiting off forgery .

Seduction 101 for Logicians and Economists
How logic can get you into trouble , romantically or financially .
April 5 , 2009  --
Elementary propositional logic ( the logic of " and , " " or , " " not , " and " if ... then ... " ) can sometimes give rise to vexing puzzles .
Here is one rather whimsical example that occurred to me after reading about Bernard Madoff 's Ponzi scheme ( and others ) and being struck by the word " seductive " appearing in some of the news accounts .
Being a logician , I thought of a kind of seduction that relies on logic rather than psychology to ensnare and entangle its targets .
Seduction by a Logician
Let me first state the puzzle in terms of a more standard sort of seduction .
Suppose a man flirts with a woman and then asks her , " Will you solemnly promise to give me right now your telephone number if I make a true statement and , conversely , not give me your number if I make a false statement ? "
Maybe he can soften the statement a bit , but let 's assume that this is its gist .
Feeling that this is a flattering and benign request , the woman promises to give him her number if and only if he makes a true statement .
The man then makes his statement : " You will neither give me your telephone number now nor will you sleep with me tonight . "
What 's the trick ?
Note that she can't give him her number since , if she were to do so , his statement would be made false , and so she would have broken her promise to give him her number only if he made a true statement .
( This is the crux of it . )
Therefore , she must not give him her number under any circumstances .
But if she also refuses to sleep with him , his statement becomes true , and this would require her to give him her number .
The only way she can keep her promise is to sleep with him so that his statement becomes false .
The woman 's seemingly innocuous promise ensnares her .
Fortunately or unfortunately , I suspect that the class of people for whom this seduction technique would prove effective is probably rather small .
Nevertheless , it might make an interesting premise for a Star Trek episode or perhaps form part of a logicians ' dating manual .
A Similar Financial Con Game
Consider now a slight variant of the above story .
Suppose an investment con man is talking to a prospective client .
He flatters the client , tells him about the stock newsletter he e-mails to his clients , and asks , " Will you right now solemnly promise to give me your e-mail address if I make a true statement and , conversely , not give it to me it if I make a false statement ? "
Feeling that this is a harmless request to consider his newsletter , the prospective client promises .
The con man then makes the statement : " You will neither invest all your money with me today nor give me your e-mail address . "
As with the seduction above , note that the prospective client can't give the con man his e-mail address since if he were to do so , the con man 's statement would be made false , and so he would have broken his promise to give him his e-mail address only if the con man made a true statement .
Therefore , he must not give the man his e-mail address under any circumstances .
But if he also refuses to invest all his money with the con man , the latter 's statement becomes true , and this would require him to give his e-mail address .
The only way the prospective client can keep his promise is to invest all his money with the con man so that the latter 's statement becomes false .
Again , a seemingly innocuous promise ensnares somebody .
Seduction , whether with an amorous or an acquisitive intent , often follows the same interactive pattern , the hook sometimes being logical , sometimes psychological .
Propositional Logic
One might think this example absurdly unrealistic , but consider the opaqueness of derivatives and other complicated financial instruments .
There too , the commitments one unknowingly takes on are invisible and substantial .
The seduction scam is child 's play compared to securitized mortgages .
Nevertheless , perhaps more typical than the seduction question is the following , which is still a matter of elementary propositional logic .
The question :
For the following set of premises , determine whether the conclusion below ( the part after " Hence " ) follows from them .
( Do n't worry about whether the premises are true or false . )
If private sector investment stays the same , then government spending will increase or more unemployment will result .
If government spending will not increase , taxes can be cut .
If taxes can be cut and private sector investment stays the same , then more unemployment will not result .
Hence government spending will increase .
There are , of course , simple techniques for deciding if the conclusion follows from the premises in propositional logic or whether a set of such statements is consistent , but from sad experience and casual observation , I suspect that only a sprinkling of policy - makers know them .
In any case , the real economy is complex , interactive , convoluted and impossible to describe with elementary propositional logic .
The logic required is more extensive , involving quantifiers -- words like " all , " and " some " and " none . "
An adequate description also calls on arithmetic , probability , and statistics , calculus , and differential equations , non-linear dynamics , etc .
It 's not too surprising that few if any people can assert with much confidence that we should take this economic course rather than that and come to this conclusion rather than another .
There are , however , some conclusions using propositional logic that can be made with the utmost confidence .
Recall the logician / economist riding an elevator who , when the doors open , is asked whether the elevator is going up or down .
He replies , " Yes . "

If you ’re looking for a classic , no modifications , authentic recipe for Chicken Scallopine / Scallopini , this probably is n’t it .
If you ’re looking for a dadgum delicious pasta dish that ’s perfect for either family or company , you ’ve landed in the right spot .
The Cast of Characters : Olive Oil , Butter , Linguine , Boneless / Skinless Chicken Breasteses , Flour ( not pictured ) , Lemons ( or lemon juice ) , White Wine , Cream , Parmesan Cheese , Parsley , Capers , and Chicken Broth ( optional )
Cook the linguine according to package directions .
You ’ll want it al dente — not too mushy ; with a nice bite .
First , we ’re going to flatten the chicken breasts .
The butcher at the tiny grocery store in my small town offers these perfectly trimmed chicken breasts and I love them .
If you do n’t have them available , just buy regular boneless breasts and either trim them yourself OR cut them into manageable pieces AFTER you flatten them .
One at a time , place the chicken breasteses between two sheets of waxed paper .
This will keep minuscule bits of raw chicken from hitting you in the eye or flying across the room and landing on your TV screen .
With a mallet or a rolling pin , whack the heck out of the chicken breast so that it ’s a uniform thickness .
It does n’t have to be paper thin ; the point is to even it out so the entire breast cooks evenly .
As you flatten the breasts , place them on a separate plate .
Wash and slice 2 packages ( about 12 ounces ) white mushrooms pretty thinly .
Season both sides of each chicken breast with salt and pepper …
Then place each chicken breast in a bowl of flour , just to dredge .
Press the chicken into the flour to adequately cover .
Repeat with all the chicken breasts and have them ready on a plate .
In a large skillet over medium heat , melt 2 tablespoons olive oil and 4 tablespoons butter .
The butter will give the chicken a nice golden color , and the olive oil will allow the oil / butter mix to get hotter than it could if it was straight butter .
Whew .
That was exhausting .
When it ’s sizzling ( but not burned ) , place four chicken breasts into the pan .
If your stove gets hot , decrease the heat to medium - low so the butter wo n’t burn .
Cook for about two minutes on the first side …
Then flip them to the other side and continue cooking for two to three additional minutes .
Because the breasts are thin , they really wo n’t take long to cook .
Also keep in mind that they ’ll continue cooking just a bit after you remove them from the pan .
So do n’t overdo !
Remove these from the pan when they ’re done , then fry the other two breasts until golden .
The whole time , monitor the butter / oil and make sure it ’s not turning black .
Remove the pan from heat if the butter starts to burn .
After you remove the chicken , throw in the mushrooms .
Note that my butter / oil is nice and brown … but I would n’t have wanted it to get much darker than this .
There ’s dark and flavorful … and then there ’s charred .
And charred does n’t work too well .
Stir around the mushroom to coat them in the butter and oil .
Notice the good stuff in the bottom of the pan .
Pour in 1 cup of dry white wine .
( If you ’re not a wino , you can use low sodium chicken broth . )
Not that anyone cares , but in case there ’s a secret Lenten Police Force watching : I did n’t drink any .
Just ask God .
Right after that , squeeze in the juice of half a lemon .
If it ’s not really juicy , go ahead and squeeze in the other half , too .
Stir this around , scraping the bottom of the pan , then allow the mushrooms to cook vigorously for about a minute .
In no time at all , the liquid will reduce and become darker in color .
I ca n’t tell you how good my kitchen smells right about now .
I cant tell you how much I love mushrooms .
Reduce the heat to low and pour in 1/2 cup heavy cream .
If you ’re wanting to go a little lighter , I SUPPOSE you could use half - and - half .
Or , for a much lighter approach , just splash in some chicken broth to make it a little soupier .
Me ?
I ’m sticking with the cream .
It ’s a middle child thing .
Or is it a ranch wife thing ?
Or a mother - of - four thing ?
I ’m always confusing which labels I use for which rationalizations .
Stir the mixture together , THEN … add 1 heaping tablespoon of capers .
Honestly , I try not to like capers .
I want not to like capers .
They ’re weird little greenish - brownish mystery pellets .
But the flavor — OH , the flavor they impart .
They ’re tangy and special .
Trust me .
Throw in a generous amount of chopped Italian parsley — probably two to three tablespoons .
Now stir it together and turn off the heat and just look at the sauce you have created .
It ’s tangy .
It ’s creamy .
It ’s lemony .
It ’s savory .
It ’s good .
Oh , is it ever good .
*IMPORTANT : Be sure to taste the sauce at this point , and add plenty of salt and black pepper .
Make sure it ’s adequately salted !
Now , it ’s REALLY impressive to serve the linguine , chicken and sauce in a big heap on a gigantic platter .
But you can also just plate it up individually .
I ’m doing two chicken breasts on this plate .
Marlboro Man and I will share it , just like the doggies do in Lady and the Tramp .
Only we smell better .
Most of the time .
And I ’ll eat his mushrooms .
Marlboro Man does n’t do mushrooms .
Spoon the mushrooms and sauce all over the top , making sure you get plenty of liquid on the pasta .
And please , for my sake , do n’t skimp .
This is good stuff , people .
It ’s to be enjoyed .
Notice the golden brown color of the chicken .
And the crunchy crust is a delicious contrast to the soft pasta and shrooms .
Do n’t forget to sprinkle plenty of grated Parmesan over the top .
Because a - pasta without a - cheese is like a -kiss without a -squeeze .
Do n’t you forget it .
You ’ll love this one .
It ’s a keeper .
People will fall in love instantly .
They ’ll like the pasta , too .
Enjoy !
Love ,

Ah yes , large satellites will beam vast amounts of clean energy from the sun to earth , 24/7 , base load style .
Let ’s try to look past the headlines …
First of all , this idea is n’t quite as old as the hills , but it ’s at least several decades old , depending on what you consider to be the origin of it .
Issac Asimov wrote about it in 1941 :
If solar power from space seems to have a science fiction ring to it , it ’s because it does .
The concept was first proposed in 1941 by science fiction author Isaac Asimov in his book “ Reason , ” about a space station that collects solar energy and beams it to Earth .
“ The dots to which our energy beams are directed … are cold and hard and human beings like myself live upon their surfaces – many billions of them …
Our beams feed these worlds energy drawn from … the Sun , ” he wrote , theorizing microwaves for transmission .
So , what ’s the story with Solaren , the company that ’s allegedly going to supply PG&E with 200 megawatts of electricity from outer space , beginning in 2016 ?
D&B reports the company ’s address as 32 MONTEREY CT MANHATTAN BEACH , CA 90266 .
Well , I do n’t know about you , but all I see are condos near a golf course .
Check White Pages and , yes , we ’re looking at the CEOs housing complex .
Ok , so Gary T. Spirnak , CEO of Solaren , is running this show from home .
With regard to investors , this CleanTech article states :
Solaren says it has a few million dollars in startup funding , but no paying customers , and its web site consists of one page with an animated company logo .
( You must see the website : solarenspace.com . )
According to Green Tech Media :
Calvin Boerman , Solaren ’s director of energy services , told Dow Jones Newswires that the company is funded with seed money from Sprinak and other unnamed investors , and is actively seeking more funding .
Just so that we ’re all clear on this : A guy called Gary Spirnak , listing his house as his company ’s headquarters , has a plan to launch satellites into space to beam energy to the earth , and has attracted millions of dollars in seed money .
What is Gary Spirnak ’s background ?
According to the Green Tech Media story above , Spirnak is , “ A former U.S. Air Force spacecraft project engineer and director of advanced digital applications at Boeing Satellite Systems … ”
Hold it right there .
Gary Spirnak ’s previous work dealt with black world military projects .
But as director of that crypt at Boeing , he was n’t just your average wrench turner .
He would have been one of the high priests , with knowledge of multiple , absurdly compartmented projects .
Ahhhhhhhhh .
Ok , so we do n’t just have a guy in his house who managed to convince angel investors to hand over millions of dollars .
We have a guy in his house , who has been involved with some of the most sensitive military secrets in existence , who managed to convince angel investors to hand over millions of dollars .
Maybe this is weird .
Maybe it is n’t .
But you know what it reminds me of ?
Iridium .
Billions of dollars in private capital were spent to build that thing , and after a spectacular bankruptcy , the CIA basically bought it for pennies on the dollar .
Would this Solaren bird really be used to generate clean power for PG&E .
Maybe .
Probably .
What else might it wind up being used for ?
Let ’s ask DARPA !
The following is from Space - Based Solar Power As an Opportunity for Strategic Security , Report to the National Security Space Office , October 10 , 2007 :
For the DoD specifically , beamed energy from space in quantities greater than 5 MWe has the potential to be a disruptive game changer on the battlefield .
SBSP and its enabling wireless power transmission technology could facilitate extremely flexible “ energy on demand ” for combat units and installations across an entire theater , while significantly reducing dependence on vulnerable over - land fuel deliveries .
SBSP could also enable entirely new force structures and capabilities such as ultra long - endurance airborne or terrestrial surveillance or combat systems to include the individual soldier himself .
In short :
The various death ray projects would have a viable power source .
Finally , I pulled the patent on the Solaren technology : U.S. Patent 6936760 Space - based power system .
What ’s James E. Rogers ’ background ?
He ’s the first inventor listed on the patent , but I could n’t find his name associated with Solaren in any other way .
Let ’s be on the lookout for more interesting information on this .
Via : Next100 :
As part of PG&E ’s commitment to providing more renewable energy to its customers , the utility has supported a wide range of technologies , including wind , geothermal , biomass , wave and tidal , and at least a half dozen types of solar thermal and photovoltaic power .
Now PG&E is extending that approach to tap renewable energy at an entirely new level : solar power in space .
PG&E is seeking approval from state regulators for a power purchase agreement with Solaren Corp. , a Southern California company that has contracted to deliver 200 megawatts of clean , renewable power over a 15 year period .
Solaren says it plans to generate the power using solar panels in earth orbit , then convert it to radio frequency energy for transmission to a receiving station in Fresno County .
From there , the energy will be converted to electricity and fed into PG&E ’s power grid .
Defense Focus : Bears fly over Arctic Ocean
Although the Tupolev Tu-95 first flew in 1951 , it is now , nearly six decades later , a more formidable nuclear delivery device than it ever was before .
That is because the Tu-95's unusual turboprop , propeller - driven engines give it a much lower fuel consumption than comparable long - range jet - powered bombers like the Boeing B - 52 Stratofortress .
It therefore can stay aloft without refueling for long periods of time , making it a virtually invulnerable launching platform for its formidable armament of six Kh - 55 air - launched cruise missiles -- ALCMs .
by Martin Sieff
Washington ( UPI ) Feb 5 , 2009
Russia is continuing its new series of strategic nuclear bomber long - range missions over the Arctic Ocean .
Two Tupolev Tu-95
Bear strategic bombers crossed the Arctic Ocean and flew as far as Alaska , a Russian air force spokesman announced Jan. 28 .
" Two Tu -95 MS strategic bombers took off from an airbase in eastern Russia on Tuesday and successfully carried out a patrol mission over the neutral waters of the Arctic Ocean and near Alaska , " Lt. Col. Vladimir Drik informed RIA Novosti .
Drik said the flight lasted 10 hours , indicating it covered a distance of 4,500 to 5,000 miles , given the usual cruising speed of a turboprop - engine - powered Tu-95MS .
The crews of the two planes carried out instrumental flight exercises in arctic climate conditions , RIA Novosti said .
The flight was also notable for the kind of cat - and - mouse encounters with the U.S. Air Force reminiscent of the Cold War .
" En route , the bombers were accompanied for 10 minutes by four USAF F - 15 Eagle fighters , " Drik said .
The Russian air force in August 2007 revived its long - abandoned program of ambitious long - range strategic bomber patrol flights over the Pacific , Atlantic and Arctic oceans , fulfilling a directive of Russian President Vladimir Putin , who is now prime minister .
Although the Tupolev Tu-95 first flew in 1951 , it is now , nearly six decades later , a more formidable nuclear delivery device than it ever was before .
That is because the Tu-95's unusual turboprop , propeller - driven engines give it a much lower fuel consumption than comparable long - range jet - powered bombers like the Boeing B - 52 Stratofortress .
It therefore can stay aloft without refueling for long periods of time , making it a virtually invulnerable launching platform for its formidable armament of six Kh - 55 air - launched cruise missiles -- ALCMs .
The Kh - 55s ( NATO designation Kent As - 15 ) can carry nuclear warheads 2,000 miles flying at very low altitude at speeds of more than 1,700 mph , or Mach 2.8 .
Their high speeds and computerized guidance programs allowing them to follow the contours of the ground make them almost impossible to hit with conventional anti-ballistic missile defenses .
When Tu-95s fly into the operational range of U.S. air superiority combat fighters like the Boeing - McDonnell - Douglas F - 15 Eagle , they are sitting ducks for the U.S. combat aircraft because of their huge size , low speed and very poor maneuverability .
But in any war scenario , the Tu-95s would fly holding patterns in their own airspace or just beyond it , far out of range of U.S. combat fighters .
The arctic flights also serve to project military power and strengthen Russian claims to the continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean that have become increasingly accessible because of the melting of the arctic ice cap .
Russia wants to maximize its access to the untapped oil , gas and mineral wealth believed to be found there .
The Kremlin therefore has been dramatically stepping up its presence in the region through its new program of strategic bomber long - range flights and cruises by major warships .
RIA Novosti said the most recent strategic bomber exercise , like all the previous ones , had been conducted strictly in accord with international law concerning military flights in airspace over international waters and that the aircraft had not trespassed either intentionally or accidentally into the airspace of any neighboring states .
Pelosi backs anti-terror truth commission CONGRESS
FILE - In this April 2 , 2009 file photo , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif. , accompanied by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Md. , speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington .
So far this year , Congress has done what it does best _ spend a lot of money and make a lot of promises .
Now , as lawmakers return from a two - week spring break , comes the hard part , the actual crafting of legislation that will change how banks are regulated , health care is delivered and the nation consumes energy .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday endorsed the establishment of a formal truth commission to investigate Bush administration anti-terrorism policies , including an examination of former top Justice Department lawyers who crafted the legal justifications for what critics say was torture .
Such a probe could target UC Berkeley law Professor John Yoo , a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Bush Justice Department who was instrumental in crafting the interrogation memoranda , and his former boss , Jay Bybee , now a judge on the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
Pelosi's endorsement follows President Obama 's signal Tuesday that he was open to the idea .
Obama 's shift , in tandem with last week 's release by the administration of past memos describing brutal interrogation techniques on terror suspects , has touched a match to the seething controversy over whether there should be a public or legal accounting for Bush administration policies on torture and detention .
The Obama administration had initially downplayed any suggestion of prosecutions , provoking an outcry from the left .
Now the outcry is coming from the right , with even moderate Republican Sen.
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania warning that such investigations , without evidence of criminal acts , smack of a banana republic .
In a sit - down with reporters in her Capitol Hill conference room , Pelosi , a San Francisco Democrat , said the advantage of such a commission would be that " it removes all doubt that how we protect the American people is in a values - based way . "
She also said she knew several years ago that Rep. Jane Harman , D - Venice ( Los Angeles County ) , was overheard on a wiretap , a controversy that erupted early this week .
Liberal Democrats have been pressing the issue for months with little traction , given the Obama administration 's reluctance and fierce Republican resistance , but now are re-energized .
Republicans moved to dash what they called a retrospective tribunal that would unfairly target officials who followed legal guidance at the time and intimidate officials going forward .
A furor has also erupted over Obama National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair 's statements last week that " high - value information " came from the interrogations , indicating divisions within the administration .
State 's senators divided
California 's two Democratic senators are divided over an independent commission .
Sen. Barbara Boxer said she supports one , but Sen. Dianne Feinstein , who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee , said she already has under way a " thorough , bipartisan review " of detention and interrogation standards used over the past five years .
" I believe that the Intelligence Committee is the appropriate source for this kind of a review , and that the actual facts , actions , orders and behavior can be examined by intelligence professionals in a classified setting , " Feinstein said Wednesday .
" The committee will then review these findings and make a decision regarding what the committee would like to release , in terms of recommendations and findings .
This is the appropriate venue for this kind of serious look - back and review . "
Pelosi said the Obama administration 's policy on an investigation " has not been definitively stated . "
She said Attorney General Eric Holder told her that " those who received orders and acted upon these legal opinions would not be prosecuted - if that 's the word - held accountable , whatever , further action taken against them .
Our question among our members is , does that just go down , or does that go up ? " referring to whether top officials in charge of the policy would be investigated , as opposed to those carrying out orders .
Pelosi suggested that she would be interested in " the lawyers who gave these opinions " as well as testimony at a Senate judicial confirmation hearing , a veiled reference to Bybee .
" What is interesting to us is , were there counter opinions in the ( Bush ) administration ? "
Pelosi said .
" I think it gives further impetus among members to have some kind of truth commission as to what happened and why legal opinions were so one - sided . "
Sen . Patrick Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee , has been shopping the commission idea since February as a way to avoid the partisanship likely to erupt in a regular congressional committee investigation .
Leahy held a hearing on how a commission would work , but lacking GOP support , has not introduced a bill .
Specter , the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee , said the Justice Department already has all the facts .
' Banana republics '
" Once the administration has a key to the front door , which they 've had for several months , all they have to do is find the right filing cabinets and open them , which they 're already doing , " Specter said .
" I think the president is correct in saying that we ought to be looking forward and that you should n't prosecute people who operated in good faith relying on competent legal counsel .
If there is evidence of criminality , then the attorney general has the full authority and should prosecute it .
But going after the prior administration sounds like something they do in Latin America in banana republics . "
Pelosi also said she was briefed by federal officials several years ago that Harman was heard on a federal wiretap aimed at suspected Israeli spies .
Harman is under fire for allegedly agreeing to intervene in an Israeli spy case in exchange for help in lobbying Pelosi to secure the chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee , an appointment she did not get .
Harman has adamantly denied intervening in the case and called for public release of the full transcripts from the wiretaps .
Pelosi said she was never at liberty to share information from any classified briefing and never talked to Harman about it .
" When you are briefed on something , it is n't your information to share with anybody else , whether they 're briefing you on legal opinions or ... actions , " Pelosi said .
" You have no ability to share that information with someone else . "
As ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee in 2002 , Pelosi was also given a classified briefing by the Bush administration on interrogation techniques such as waterboarding , which simulates drowning .
Her office reissued her statement from Dec. 9 , 2007 , in which Pelosi said she was told that the administration was considering using such techniques in the future .
She also stated at the time that lawyers for the CIA and the Justice Department " had concluded that the techniques were legal .
I had no further briefings on the techniques .
Several months later , my successor as ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee , Jane Harman , was briefed more extensively and advised the techniques had in fact been employed .
It was my understanding at that time that Congresswoman Harman filed a letter in early 2003 to the CIA to protest the use of such techniques , a protest with which I concurred . "
Confidence in Harman
Pelosi expressed " great confidence " in Harman , calling her a " patriotic American .
She would never do anything to hurt her country . "
Pelosi acknowledged that she had a long friendship with wealthy Democratic donor Haim Saban , who has been alleged in various press accounts to have threatened to withdraw his donations to Pelosi if she failed to support Harman 's bid to chair the committee .
Pelosi insisted that her refusal to award Harman the chair had nothing to do with her opposition to Harman 's support for the Iraq invasion or anything other than the fact that Harman had served out her two allotted terms on the committee and would not be allowed another .
" Many , many of Jane 's friends talked to me about her being named chair , but never in a threatening way , " Pelosi said .

And this also highlights the extreme resistance by corporately - owned politicians in the U.S. to even acknowledging that the current EVM's are fundamentally screwed up ... because once that 's officially acknowledged then the next question is " Can they be made workable by the next election ? " .
And the only answer is , of course , " No. not with current technology . "
And then e-voting would be deposited on the ash heap of history .
So they fight with lies , obfuscation and backroom deals a battle they could not possibly win if it were based on facts and logic .
And add in the bothersome problem of some computer scientists who damn well should know better ( Shamos and Felten , to name a couple ) who have insisted that we can't get rid of the machines ... even when each of them has repeatedly proved that the machines are error - prone and hackable ... because that would somehow be " turning our back " on some nebulous " future technology . "
It 's an uphill fight , but perhaps it can be won by calling on its few active enablers to account for their actions .. , both the political and scientific enablers .

This is actually a good thing for our court system .
Court decisions from other countries have no weight or status as precedent in our system but courts in our country can survey decisions from other countries for whatever wisdom they may impart to an issue .
As an arguing point these decisions are fair game for citation and rationale arguments .
It 's a shame that we have to look to others for hope and guidance in matter so basic to a demoracy .

Keep in mind that the United States as the leader of the " occupying powers " insisted on conditions to the very German Constitution construed here that included : A. Complete rejection of " master race " ideology including the barbaric unequal treatment is justified toward others , and
B. Absolute inviolability and inalienability of human rights .
The USA SIGNED OFF on the Constitution because these conditions were met and the constitution went into effect May 23 , 1949 , about six months after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was declared by the United Nations .
One such " human right ' in article 21 of said declaration is " free " " genuine " elections with the will of the people the only basis of legitimate political power .
" Free " elections are free from fraud , harassment , cheating , etc. , so that the true will of the people is measured .
WIthout that inviolable , inalienable human right , the voting right " that protects all other rights " makes all other rights and protections meaningless .
Is self - government / voting / elections a human right ?
YOu can bet your ass it is , Millions of other people have .
Millions " paid in full " with their lives .
Rights ?
Yes .
But nobody has the right to take away or compromise the rights of OTHER people even if they 're willing to live with or tolerate compromise on their own rights .
Too busy to fight any harder for freedom ?
Do n't make YOUR problem everyone else 's problem by advocating the compromise of OTHER 'S rights .
No such thing as " half - free " or " Half democracy . "
How about free speech every other day as a compromise ?
Freedom from torture only on weekends ?
Is it " unreasonable " to insist on the full measure of one 's birthrights ?
Human rights ?
A compromised fundamental right is a VIOLATED fundamental right .
How many co-sponsors are there for Democracy 's Bill ?
When we insist on our rights and everybody else 's too it 's called " WIN , or MEET THE TYRANT . "
We either win , or find out precisely who and what it is that we 're up against that makes Washington DC so deaf to the call of democracy .
It 's a call that 's politically very popular , so the continued advocacy of de facto nontransparency is something to be sorted out , and that happens when we 're clear about insisting on all of our rights , or at least those appropriate for conquered Nazis .
Surely Americans deserve at least that ?
Rights are valuable things , if we do n't insist on them , others will be happy to take them .

The California Constitution requires :
SEC . 2.5 . A voter who casts a vote in an election in accordance with the laws of this State shall have that vote counted .
SEC .
4 . The Legislature shall prohibit improper practices that affect elections ....
SEC .
7 . Voting shall be secret .
The current generation of electronic voting systems would likewise be deemed illegal under the California Constitution :
1. Cannot confirm that a person 's vote was counted .
2. Cannot confirm that their vote was kept secret ( especially as it relates to absentee or mail - in ballots , or overseas military ballots via fax , etc. ) .
3 . The legislature has made mandatory requirements for any voting systems that are used .
Specifically that they ARE safe from fraud or manipulation .
SoS mitigations added to patch voting systems that fail to meet the mandatory requirements are not a integral part of those voting systems as submitted to the SoS for approval .
Therefore the very act of requiring mitigations ( conditions for use ) is an admission that the systems do not meet the requirements of law , which the California Constitution requires that they do .
Yet the citizens of this state are repeatedly forced to accept the results created by illegal voting systems .
When will those public officials whose sworn duty is to uphold the Constitution and the law be held accountable ?
Those officials include the Secretary of State , the Attorney General , and local election officials .
The basis for the German Supreme Court declaring the systems illegal is the same here .

Secret vote counting is not only unconstitutional in Germany , it ’s unconstitutional here in the good old U.S.A. , too !
I cited a couple of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions which hold that the right to vote includes the right to make sure that our votes are counted accurately in my article about Virginia Elections .
In addition , the state constitutions of Virginia and South Carolina prohibit counting votes in secret which is the only way a computer counts votes , and New Hampshire 's constitution requires votes to be counted in public .

Aircraft have a safety device called the ground proximity warning system .
It alerts the pilot to the imminent danger of what is technically known as " controlled flight into terrain " or what we would call a crash .
Aviation safety enthusiasts often morbidly discuss a possibly apocryphal remark made as a Colombian airliner approached Madrid 's Barajas airport too low .
After the accident , investigators discovered the cockpit voice recorder catching the synthesised voice of the GPWS ( with its annoying North American accent ) demanding : " Pull up !
Pull up ! "
Seconds later , the same CVR caught the South American pilot , flushed with low - level machismo , saying : " Shut up , gringo . "
The next part of the transcript has the deathly words " sound of impact " in square brackets .
Technology is making our lives faster , moving us through both the real and virtual worlds .
We can travel , both in body and mind , more often , with less expense and greater ease .
But does technology also make us more stupid ?
In the beginning IBM , then a manufacturer of mainframes , adopted the slogan : " Machines should work .
People should think . "
Fifty years on , that 's a distinction no longer so clear .
Is there an unspoken Faustian pact that we gain power at the expense of wisdom ?
It 's strange to ask such philosophically profound questions when toying with the latest touch - screen mobile , but let me tell you , thumbing through the garish Vodafone catalogue does inspire such speculations .
When we hand over responsibility and knowledge to machines , do we also lose free will ?
Do sophisticated new technologies enhance our abilities while diminishing our intelligence ?
Does downloading an " app " of a spirit level on an iPhone ( for about £ 0.59 ) , let alone a virtual whoopee cushion , not only make us appear , but also become , stupid ?
In the early days of in - car satellite navigation , German newspapers used to love running photographs of the roof of a BMW appearing just above the surface of the Elbe or Danube .
The primitive mapping methods recorded only roads , not rivers .
The result ?
Drivers slavishly obeyed instructions to " proceed for 10 miles " and then found themselves in the drink .
As a result , today if you programme a satnav in England and set a destination in mainland Europe , the more ones will prudently say : " Warning !
Channel crossing en route . "
All new technologies , going back to fire and the wheel , by way of movable type and light bulbs , de - skill people .
Old crafts are abandoned or lost in favour of automation .
And when you de -skill someone , you alter not only his culture , but his personality .
Satnav has done this to black - cab drivers .
Once this proud tribe had a private religion known as the Knowledge ; all of London 's streets had to be memorised .
It was an amazing feat achieved only after great effort , and consequently it was admired and therefore empowering and dignifying .
The Knowledge gave black - cab drivers what the marketeers call a " point of difference " .
Now any larrikin can buy a satnav for £ 199 and tell you how to get from Edmonton to Peckham by using rat runs .
The USP of the black cab has disappeared in a miasma of pixels .
As a result , some urban anthropologists have noted a change in behaviour of cab drivers .
Once known for courtesy and reliability , many have become sullen and aggressive .
This is because technology has democratised their proprietary knowledge and beliefs .
Or take your digital camera .
Of course , it 's a marvel , but while we have gained the ability to store and manipulate a thousand high - quality images at modest cost , we have lost something , too .
The efficient operation of an old film camera required the user to have a working knowledge of the laws of optics ; it was necessary to know about that strange , neo-mystical trade - off between shutter speed and sharpness .
Taking a picture with a 35 mm film camera employed physics and art .
And since real expense was involved in getting a print , more care was taken throughout .
" Painstaking " is not a word you associate with digital photography .
Then there is the phone .
Your phone will have internet access .
You can Google and Wiki your way through the world 's great libraries and galleries while you are on the move or stupefied in bed .
No one but a churl would deny that this is a benefit of nearly indescribable value , but it means " research " in the sense that , say , Sir Herbert Butterfield understood it has gone the way of the ducking stool and the chastity belt ( but not yet Scottish country dancing ) .
Who in their right mind would go to a library to check a date or a quote when they can be called up on the mobile or the laptop ?
I can hardly believe that I used to schlep to the British Museum or the London Library just to look something up .
The benefits are obvious but so , too , are the hazards .
When we outsource all memory , will we lose our own ?
After all , memory and self - identity are inextricable .
The brain is an organ and all healthy organs are improved by exercise .
But there are mechanical as well as philosophical problems associated with the multiplication of ever more sophisticated technologies .
I recently tried to alter the clock in an Audi Q5 and gave up in tears .
In the United States , blind people have been run over by slow - moving and absolutely silent examples of the neo-electric Toyota Prius .
Enhanced hygiene in healthcare has made patients more vulnerable to infections .
These perils of advanced technology are examples of the " revenge effect " described by Princeton academic Edward Tenner in his 1996 book Why Things Bite Back .
Tenner also explained that the idea of advanced technology getting worryingly out of control goes back to Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , written against the background of Manchester 's early - 19th - century Luddite riots , where protesters smashed the new de-skilling technology of their day .
But contemporary Luddites , if there actually are any , appear silent in comparison .
They are probably engrossed in their latest download .
Certainly , there 's a paradoxical character to technologies that makes you smarter and dumber simultaneously , but there are real new advantages , too .
Actually , it was n't all that great using the old Reading Room of the British Museum with its dogeared and yellow card index and malodorous tramps and weird opening hours .
And while it is a legitimate source of anxiety that a future generation may receive a communications implant on birth and go through life with a phone number and not a national insurance number , they will learn new skills the while .
Bores say that kids today are becoming illiterate , but they are becoming literate in different ways .
And more numerate , too , as Steven Johnson described in his 2005 book , Everything Bad Is Good for You .
They process masses of new data at very high speed and develop extraordinary hand - eye co-ordination skills .
They may not whittle sticks , but can programme machines and download software .
Participation in the more sophisticated computer games calls for spatial awareness and imaginative skills beyond the reach of , say , an Italian architect of the 16th century .
The haiku - like constraints of SMS force discipline , imagination and creativity .
Email means people write more letters , they just do n't happen to be on old - technology paper .
When we use the word " technology " today , we mean electronic communications , not steam or nuclear power .
The great thing about all communications technologies is that none ever entirely supersedes its predecessor .
Print did not replace writing and radio did not replace print .
Books are n't going away .
Technology is morally neutral - it 's people who are not .

NEW YORK , April 20 ( UPI ) --
There is increasing acceptance of marijuana in the United States , say some advocates , who Monday marked an unofficial day of celebration .
The April 20 ritual dates to the 1970s when a group of Northern California teenagers smoked marijuana daily at 4:20 p.m. , The New York Times reported Monday .

As the ritual spread in popularity , marijuana fans began using " 420 " as the code for smoking pot and designated April 20 as a day of celebration .
Today , 420 is openly celebrated at many colleges and in many cities , with some advocates of legal marijuana saying they sense greater acceptance of the drug , either as medicine or entertainment .
" There 's a sense that the notion of legalizing marijuana is starting to cross the fringes into mainstream debate , " said Ethan Nadelmann , executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance in Washington .
Police in many cities , however , said they would be on heightened alert Monday for people reveling in 420 celebrations .
In Kansas City , for example , police planned to saturate the streets looking for drivers under the influence of marijuana , The Kansas City Star reported .
This picture is so totally freaking cool I have half a mind not to explain , and just make you stare at it and boggle at just how freaking cool it is .
But of course I must explain it !
First off , what is it ?
Obviously , it 's a giant blue hand reaching for a giant piece of cosmic smoked salmon !
Dr. Manhattan must be hungry .
OK , duh , it 's a nebula , a vast structure of gas several light years across and located about 17,000 light years away from Earth .
Since this is a Chandra X - ray observatory image the gas must be terribly hot ; only the most energetic events can give off X - rays .
So what 's heating the gas ?
If you look at the wrist of the hand , you 'll see a brighter swirl of gas .
In the center of that blob is a tiny object , a neutron star called B1509 : an incredibly dense sphere of subatomic particles , leftover when a massive star goes supernova .
While the outer layers of the star explode outwards , the core of the star collapses , cramming twice the mass of the Sun into a ball only a few kilometers across .
This newly born neutron star -- called that because the pressure is so great in the collapsed object that electrons and protons are rammed together to form neutrons -- is basically the definition of the word incredible : it spins several times per second , has a surface gravity millions of times that of the Earth ( if you were on the surface you'd be crushed flatter than a good science fiction program 's chances to be renewed on Fox ) , and has a magnetic field 30 trillion times that of the Earth's .
Egads .
So how does that teeny tiny neutron star form this huge structure ?
It 's the magnetic field coupled with the rotation of the star .
As it spins , the star sweeps up gas surrounding in its magnetic field .
Through complicated processes that , to be honest , are not 100 % understood , the star fires this swept - up material out in twin beams from its poles , a bit like a lighthouse , though a million gazilion times stronger .
The gas colored red in this false - color image is from a nebula named RCW 89 , which is leftover gas from the original explosion of the supernova that formed the neutron star .
It 's close enough to the neutron star that when the beam of matter and energy slam into it , it heats up and glows .
The beams are extremely high energy ( colored blue in the image ) , and the gas in RCW 89 does n't get quite so hot , so it emits lower - energy X - rays .
But look at the red nebula : see how there are lots of hot spots , arranged in a loop or a horseshoe ?
It turns out the neutron star is n't just spinning , it 's also wobbling like a top does as it spins down .
This process , called precession , makes the beams point in different directions over time , basically carving out a giant circle in the sky .
That loop in the red gas is actually the historic record of where that beam hit the gas over the past millennium !
In fact , astronomers could measure how hot those knots of gas are and determine their age , and find that they have been emitting X - rays for a little over 1000 years , consistent with the date of the explosion .
In fact , as you go around the loop , each knot is slightly hotter then the next , which is just what you expect from a moving beam heating up the gas .
That also explains the fingers , too : each is a tower of gas heated by the beam as it made its giant sweeping circle in the sky .
So not only do they look like fingers , they 're also actually pointing to the knots of gas in RCW 89 , the neutron star 's way of saying " You 're next . "
The energies involved here are nothing short of mind - numbing .
The clumps of gas in RCW 89 are so hot that they are storing the same amount of energy as the Sun gives off in 3 million years .
If that really were a giant hand reaching for RCW 89 , it better be prepared for a nasty burn .
And of course , the pareidolia aspect of all this is impossible to deny .
It does look like a giant blue hand , and it really reminds me of the endoskeleton from a Terminator .
Or maybe I have my scifi shows wrong ...
... because now I 'm wondering if the Trek episode " Who Mourns for Adonis ? " was all just a pulsar magnetically - induced nightmare for the Enterprise crew ?
ATLANTA , March 16 ( UPI ) --
Body dissatisfaction -- independent of actual overweight status -- has an impact on suicidal behavior in U.S. girls , researchers said .
The researchers found the perception of being overweight among girls raised the probability of suicidal thoughts by 5.6 percent , the probability of a suicide attempts by 3.2 percent and the probability of injury causing suicide attempts by 0.6 percent .

" The prevalence of body dissatisfaction , among special populations of youths such as non-black girls , is significantly higher than the general youth population , even when the underlying weight is in a healthy range , " study co-author Inas Rashad of Georgia State University in Atlanta said in a statement .
" Interventions that identify and assist these youths and educate them regarding a healthy body image will succeed in lowering suicide attempts . "
The researchers found the risk of suicide by adolescent females has the potential to add about $ 280 million to $ 350 million to the costs of adolescent obesity , including the direct cost of illnesses and premature mortality .
" If being overweight not only imposes the usual healthcare and labor market costs , but also increases the risk of suicide , we need to take these costs into account when offering solutions , " Rashad said .
The study , based on 1999 - 2007 data from the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System , is scheduled to be published in Social Science and Medicine .
From The Hook :
Four years after the college safety nonprofit Security on Campus filed a complaint against UVA [ University of Virginia ] for its mishandling of sexual assault cases , the Department of Education has ruled that the university has , in fact , violated federal law by threatening victims of sexual assault with punishment if they spoke about their cases .
The ruling has major implications for victims of sexual assault on college campuses across the country , according to the man who filed the complaint on behalf of then - UVA student Annie Hylton , now Annie Hylton McLaughlin .
“ It means that victims ca n’t be silenced at UVA or anywhere else , ” says Daniel Carter , vice president of Security on Campus .
This is an important ruling which should eliminate an unfair restriction on those students who report rape to their college .
I read the official reason given for UVA 's policy , but I do n't believe that reason .
Colleges and universities know there is a difference between privacy rules restricting what college employees can say about disciplinary hearings and gag rules restricting what students can say .
The real goal of this gag rule seemed to be the protection of the college 's reputation at the expense of all those who reported rape .
If this protection of the college or university also effectively protected rapists then that seemed to be an acceptable trade - off .
If the official administrative response at these colleges was unfair or dangerous to the person who reported rape or to other unsuspecting students , the student who reported rape might have to choose between getting an education and speaking the truth about a current danger .
This gag rule could also force students who were raped to be powerless to defend themselves against lies spread by a student rapist or friends of that student rapist .
A rapist who was found guilty in college hearings could be wrongly assumed to have been found not guilty because that student faced absolutely no undeniable sanctions .
Students who would never torment someone they knew to be a rape victim might have felt justified in tormenting a genuine rape victim whom they did n't believe because that rape victim was not allowed to speak the truth about the official investigation .
Colleges should never have the power to demand secrecy from rape victims as the price for those rape victims getting even a shot at an appropriate response by the college or university .
If college administrators know that students who report rape can talk freely about problems in the official investigation and the official rulings while they are still students , the official response will most likely be less focused on the protection of the college .

I ’ve noticed these annoying little gadgets in the news more lately .
They ’re our latest fascination because they make it so easy to do something — but the definition of that something keeps expanding .
It ’s what they call a “ slippery slope ” because once you start descending it , you slip and slide and gain speed and soon you ’re into a much more serious business than you started out with .
Chicago could rake in â€œat least $ 200 millionâ€  a year â€ ” and wipe out the entire projected deficit for 2009 â€ ” by using its vast network of redlight and surveillance cameras to hunt down uninsured motorists , aldermen were told today .
An estimated 24 percent of all vehicles on the nationâ€™s roadways are not insured , adding $ 100a year to the annual insurance rate paid by responsible motorists .
But , aldermen clearly had dollar signs in their eyes after hearing InsureNetâ€™s pitch to enlist the cityâ€™s entire network of surveillance cameras â€ ” and install new ones at high - traffic locations â€ ” in the hunt for the uninsured .
The Sun Times
When there ’s a hammer lying around , the temptation to use it occurs — even if that use is to bash someone ’s head in .
We either try to target the tool , or the temptation .
With automated ticketing cameras , as with most technology , we have a tool that carries temptation in itself : without anyone even having to use it , it automagically gets those bad guys and makes life cheaper for the rest of us .
We knew that this would happen because these cameras have two temptations :
Get the bad guys
Hey , a little profit never hurt anyone , and we ’re broke
But being broke for a government is a self - fulfilling prophecy .
Get more money , spend more money , thus need more money .
It ’s like expanding your farm : every time you add an acre , you need more money to plant , water , dig , etc. that new acre .
At the nexus of “ profit ” and “ bad guys ” is a dangerous interzone where no one really cares about the victims , and everyone wants the cash or cash saved .
Sin taxes .
Prison rape .
Even internet piracy .
Our moral justifications become weapons because by assessing someone as a bad guy , we make it OK to take from them .
As more cities sign up and others invest their profits into more cameras , those companies expect increased revenue for years to come .
What ’s less clear is whether the cameras improve safety .
While studies show fewer T - bone crashes at lights with cameras and fewer drivers running red lights , the number of rear - end crashes increases .
The largest red - light camera company , Redflex Traffic Systems of Scottsdale , operates red - light or speed cameras in 22 states , and added 79 cities last year .
It signed a $ 32 million maintenance contract with Chicago last fall , and in just the last three weeks of last year , Redflex added five new cities .
Redflex saw net , after - tax profits of $ 10.6 million in fiscal year 2008 , up from $ 7.3 million the year before .
That ticket in Clive shows why : More than half of the $ 75 fine went to Redflex .
SJMN
Half of the profit goes to the corporation that installed the cameras .
But still , “ new ” money goes to the city .
And when they spend more money , they need more money , and start looking for a way to add more to their coffers .
Have we seen this pattern before ?
The Drug War cost law enforcement agencies lots of money to fight everyday .
When they seized guns and drugs , those items get destroyed , but what happens to money and cars impounded from these crimes ?
It actually gets reinvested to get narcotics off the streets ,
This equipment was made possible through drug forfeiture money that comes from car auctions and money seizures .
“ We ’ve been able to buy equipment if the city itself were having to fund it we would not be able to get , ” Chief Torres said .
“ They just would not be able to afford it . ”
Some critics accuse these officers who regularly patrol roadways of being highway pirates , but top - ranking officers said they make sure the seizures are tied to drugs .
In Jim Wells County , nearly $ 300,000 bought new patrol cars , laptop computers four drug dogs and a bomb sniffing dog .
KIIITV
The war on some drugs ( conspicuously , alcohol and tobacco were left out ) introduced this concept of zero tolerance seizure : if we find any drugs or drug money on your property , we seize it .
Boats .
Cars .
Houses .
Even business complexes .
Where does it end ?
Well , we always need money , and they ’re still bad guys .
I am not against destroying parasites , or exiling bad guys .
I am not really against confiscating their property .
But I would like to point out that it ’s a slippery slope .
The first generation sets it up , and uses it responsibly .
When there ’s new personnel , or new budget shortfalls , the use gets expanded .
Inch by inch , it creeps outward .
Red light cameras are going the same way .
At first the justification was that we would bust those who run red lights and make the streets safer … and profit .
But that cause / effect gets reversed , and so when we need some profit to fill up budget shortfalls , we go looking for new bad guys .
There ’s a disturbing possibility that search does n’t end .
Using non -green lightbulbs ?
Smoking in bed ?
Have n’t paid your TV tax ?
Here they come , because you ’re now a source of profit , having made yourself a “ bad guy ” by the ever - increasing definition of the hour .

Gordon Brown last night backed away from plans for a recession - busting spending spree in next month 's budget , after City investors delivered a stern message about the health of the public finances by shunning a sale of government debts for the first time since 2002 .
In New York to canvass support for a deal at next week 's G20 London summit on a worldwide economic rescue package , the prime minister said he had no plans to add to the £ 20bn fiscal stimulus announced by Alistair Darling last autumn , saying there were other " effective and quicker ways " of kick - starting demand .
Back in London , investors sent shockwaves through financial markets by shunning a £ 1.75 bn auction of government IOUs - gilts - amid mounting fears about the Treasury 's ability to pay for its bank bailouts and fill the hole left by collapsing tax revenues .
" This is a bit of a shot across the government 's bows , " said Jonathan Loynes , of Capital Economics .
The prime minister 's enthusiasm for an international economic agreement on tackling recession had been widely interpreted as an attempt to win political cover for a renewed spending spree at home , but he played that idea down yesterday .
" Nobody is suggesting that people come to the G20 meeting and put on the table the budget that they 're going to have for the next year .
What we are suggesting is that we have together to look at what we have done so far cumulatively , " he said .
The apparent volte face added to the impression that the government 's management of the economic crisis is descending into chaos , after Mervyn King , the Bank of England governor , who is overseeing the drastic policy of quantitative easing , raised doubts on Tuesday about whether another fiscal boost could be afforded .
Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrats '
Treasury spokesman , said : " The open warfare breaking out between No 10 , the Treasury and the Bank of England over the need for a further fiscal stimulus is clearly spooking the markets .
If there is one lesson the government should have learned by now , it is that creating uncertainty is economic masochism . "
The government 's Debt Management Office will have to borrow almost £ 150bn from the markets on Darling 's behalf over the next 12 months .
The IMF has suggested that Britain is heading for the biggest budget deficit among the G20 countries next year , at 11 % of GDP .
George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , seized on the auction news as vindication of the Conservatives ' argument that the government 's finances are in too perilous a state to permit a fresh round of fiscal stimulus .
" The risk is that at some point the government will not be able to fund its huge debts , and that could push up interest rates for families and businesses at the worst possible time , " he said .
City analysts said King 's remarks to the Treasury select committee on Tuesday that the Bank might not need to pursue its full £ 75 bn quantitative easing programme - which operates by buying gilts - had increased investors ' alarm .
" People have just started to be slightly nervous about the Bank 's commitment , " said John Wraith , gilt strategist at RBC Capital Markets .
Yesterday 's failed auction was of a relatively unusual 40 - year gilt , not covered by the Bank of England 's quantitative easing buyback , and the government can return to the market with bonds of a different duration .
But Wraith said it showed investors were spooked at the scale of funding required .
Markets fell in New York after weak demand for a sale of Treasury bonds also raised fears that investors were shying away from US government debt .
A Treasury spokesman said : " It would be wrong to read anything into the results of one auction event , which depends on the gilt on offer , demand and market conditions on the day . "
He said King had signed up to the G20's communique earlier this month in which finance ministers and central bankers promised to " take whatever action is necessary until growth is restored " .

Some Republicans are outraged at GOP chairman Michael Steele because he has refused to call President Barack Obama a Socialist .
The Republican National Conservative Caucus has been pushing the RNC to adopt a resolution calling on the Democratic Party to rename itself the Democratic Socialist Party .
Here is the resolution , “ RESOLVED , that we the members of the Republican National Committee recognize that the Democratic Party is dedicated to restructuring American society along socialist ideals ; and be it further RESOLVED , that we the members of the Republican National Committee call on the Democratic Party to be truthful and honest with the American people by acknowledging that they have evolved from a party of tax and spend to a party of tax and nationalize and , therefore , should agree to rename themselves the Democrat Socialist Party . ”
However Steele has said that he does n’t view Obama as a Socialist , “ We do n’t see this president so much as a socialist as we see him as a collectivist .
When you strip away this idea that the individual matters , for this concept of the collective – all of us pulling together and working towards some governmental goal – that ’s what I ’m more concerned about . ”

This is a real problem for Steele because his base is moving further right than he is willing to go .
Steele realizes that calling a president with a 64 % approval rating is probably not the best strategy for a party that is hoping to pick up seats in a mid-term election .
It is also likely that the GOP is going to lose the NY - 20 House special election that was contested in a heavily Republican district .
This dispute is bound to stir more problems in the RNC , where many members have been grumbling that Steele is n’t the correct person for the job .
All you need to know about the current state of the Republican Party is that their most hotly debated issue revolves around calling the Democrats Socialists .
They have become a party that is completely empty of ideas .
One would think that they might be working counter proposals for the economy and healthcare , but no , they are busy complaining that Michael Steele wo n’t call Obama a Socialist .
The GOP leadership does not understand that there is no quick fix to their problems .
There is n’t some magic word that will take Obama ’s popularity away .
I think Steele is right , but the RNC will probably end up dumping him anyway .

- Uzbl .
In my opinion , any program can only be really useful if it complies to the unix philosophy .
Web browsers are frequent violators of this principle .
Time to change that !
Right now uzbl is in a very early state but here are some ideas I would like to ( not ) implement
- each instance of uzbl renders 1 page ( eg it 's a small wrapper around webkit ) , no tabbing , tab previews , or speed dial
things .
we have window managers for that .
- simple ini config file ( " profile " ) for keyboard , network , .. settings
- implement some basic keyboard shortcuts for going up , down , refresh etc
- listen to signals and do useful stuff when triggered .
- open up a socket file / fifo /.. so we can easily control each instance by writing things like ' uri < foo > ' to
/tmp/uzbl-pid
- MAYBE ( if needed ) : 1 control application called uzblctrl or something .
use this to modify the behavior of a uzbl
instance ( change url , refresh ) .
use xdotool to get the window with focus .
eg uzblctrl - win < id > -url < http://>.
use xbindkeys to bind keys to call uzblctrl .
- no bookmark management builtin .
make your own solution .
for pulling a bookmark a plaintxt - based program using dmenu
would work great here .
combine with uzbltcrl and xbindkeys .
uzblctrl should support an option to query the current page so you can script something to add to your bookmarks .
use
zenity or something to add tags .
- similar story for history .
- no ad blocking built in .
use the power of /etc / hosts .
though uzblctrl should support an option to list all images on
a page , so you can easily pick the links to ads to add them to your / etc / hosts .
( dmenu can again be great here to
automate this )
- no download manager .
allow user to pick wget / curl / a custom script /...
- no build in command interpreters like ubiquity .
uzbl should be accessible and you should use a shell or similar .
to figure out :
- password management .
maybe an encrypted store that unlocks with an ssh key ?
- how to handle hyperlinks ?
number them like konqueror does ?
NOTE :
- My c skills are very rusty , it will take me a while to get back up to speed
JRuby 1.2 was released a few weeks ago ( InfoQ 's coverage of JRuby 1.2RC1 contains an overview of the changes ) .
With this release out of the way , the JRuby team now started exploring some new projects .
Ola Bini has been busy testing JRuby and Ioke on Google 's newly announced Java support for Google App Engine ( InfoQ 's coverage of Java on GAE ) .
Ola 's explains the requirements JRuby and Rails on GAE and how to set up a JRuby on Rails app :
You need a fairly new copy of JRuby .
Most of the changes needed to JRuby was added to JRuby trunk right after the JRuby 1.2 release , so check out and build something after that .
The newest Rails version works fine too .
Since GAE does n't support an RDBMS , there is no JDBC .
Ola provides Bumble , a wrapper around Google 's DataStore .
JRuby is just one of the JVM languages supported on GAE , others being Clojure or Rhino ( Google maintains a list of language support ) .
Ola also lists some of the GAE restrictions that cause problems for JVM languages ; examples are changes in reflection , threading , bytecode verification and others .
Meanwhile , Tom Enebo created JRuby - Parser , which extracts JRuby 's parser from JRuby and allows IDEs or other tools to use it without shipping the complete JRuby .
Charles Nutter started work on a new Ruby compiler , which aims to compile Ruby types to Java classes :
* It will use my bytecode DSL " BiteScript " , just like Duby does
* It will use the * runtime * definition of a class to generate the Java version
The second point is an important one .
Instead of having an offline compiler that inspects a file and generates code from it , the compiler will actually used the runtime class to create a Java version .
This means you 'll be able to use all the usual metaprogramming facilities , and at whatever point the compiler picks up your class it will see all those methods .
Charles also released a useful tool for generating bytecode with JRuby : BiteScript , an internal DSL for creating bytecode .
JVM bytecode mnemonics are mapped onto Ruby methods which generate the bytecodes ; methods for creating classes or methods complete the API and provide a compact way to generate class files .
For more information , see Charles ' post on the BiteScript release .
Q&A : Obama 's stimulus plan The Congressional Oversight Panel says the government overpaid for distressed financial assets and shares last year .
It says the US Treasury paid $ 78bn ( £ 53 bn ) more than it should when buying stakes in banks through the $ 700 bn Troubled Assets Relief Program ( Tarp ) .
The Treasury had paid $ 254bn in 2008 in return for shares in a number of troubled financial institutions .
The findings may influence Congress when it considers how to spend the remaining $ 350 bn in bail - out funds .
The oversight panel was established in October 2008 to " review of the state of financial markets and the regulatory system " , and to measure how effectively the government bail - out programmes were working to correct the problems .
' Better managed '
The new US Treasury Secretary , Tim Geithner , is expected to bring fresh proposals to Congress next week , outlining how the new administration wants to spend the rest of the bail - out money .
He is likely to accept that more of the bail - out money needs to go to help struggling homeowners and small businesses , releasing some of the money given to the banks .
And the administration has already signalled that it will introduce tough new limits on executive pay for banks that receive additional bail - outs .
With the US financial sector still troubled , there have been calls for additional funds to be made available .
But Democratic Senator Evan Bayh said that " there will be no additional funding for this programme without airtight assurances that it will be better managed " .
Rushed bail - out The US House of Representatives passed the $ 700 bn government plan to rescue the US financial sector in October last year , having rejected an earlier version of it .
The package was aimed at buying up the bad debts of failing financial institutions on Wall Street .
But it was rapidly switched to supplying additional capital to the banks , on terms that were not fully disclosed at the time .
Many members of Congress have been unhappy with how the distribution of Tarp funds has been handled .
The head of the oversight panel , Elizabeth Warren , told a congressional committee that after three months on the job , her panel is still not getting enough answers from the Treasury .
She described the bail - out as " an opaque process at best " .

Mexican Collapse Feeds Illegal Alien Problem In U.S .
Michael Cutler
This article on Fox News was brought to my attention by Bruce DeCell , a good friend who , given the circumstances under which we met , I would prefer that we had never met .
Bruce is a founding member of 9/11 Families for a Secure America ( 9/11 FSA ) .
He is a former New York City Police officer whose son- in - law was one of the many victims of the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 .
I serve as an advisor to 9/11 FSA and we often discuss the clear nexus between our nation ’s failures to secure its borders and create an immigration system that possesses meaningful integrity .
The Fox article actually deals with both of these critically important issues .
The current situation in Mexico is the direct result of the ever - increasing influence that the drug cartels wield in that country .
Corruption has historically been a way of life in Mexico .
The current situation involves an exponential increase in the corruption , but adds to that problem the factor of escalating violence as drug cartels , not unlike terrorist organizations , use violence and the threat of violence in conjunction with bribery to destabilize the federal government of Mexico , along with local governments in that beleaguered country .
In order to wield this much power , the cartels needed to get their hands on huge sums of cash .
The drug trade provided an infusion of billions of American dollars .
The narcotics flowed ( and continue to flow ) north and the proceeds of the drug trade flowed south – into the bulging coffers of the cartels .
The cash bought many things , including weapons and vehicles ( airplanes , boats , cars and trucks ) .
That cash also bought counterfeit identity documents and safe houses and provided the means by which the cartels could set up shop here , expanding the tendrils of its reach clear across the United States .
This cash has the potential to corrupt government bureaucrats on the federal and local level in Mexico , thus enabling the criminals – and potentially terrorists – to buy authentic Mexican passports and other identity documents , in false names to disguise the identity of criminals and terrorists .
It could also be used to similarly corrupt other officials of other Latin American countries to secure authentic identity documents in false names and nationalities .
Finally , that cash bought politicians , high ranking military officials and police officials .
Those who could not be bought are killed .
Many citizens of Mexico who bear no relationship to the drug trade are often caught up in the violence .
They are , in the term the military often uses , “ collateral damage . ”
By failing to secure our nation ’s borders , millions of illegal aliens have been able to enter the United States without leaving a trace of their arrival .
Among the millions of illegal aliens whose primary goal is to get an illegal job are thousands of criminal aliens involved in gangs and the drug trade .
Additional aliens are involved in other criminal enterprises .
Not all of these aliens are citizens of Mexico or even Latin America .
Many aliens come from other countries from other parts of the world .
Additionally , there are a significant number of illegal aliens who are citizens of so - called “ special interest ” countries .
These are the countries that are engaged in terrorism such as Syria , Iran , Afghanistan , Pakistan and others .
It is also an established fact that there are terrorist training camps located in the Tri-Border Region of Brazil .
By not securing our borders , our government has literally left the door open to all sorts of threats to the security of our nation and the safety of our citizens .
Yet there are still members of the United States Congress who are opposed to securing the border that must be secured to protect our nation and our citizens .
There are those within the open borders crowd who profess to be advocates for “ immigrant rights , ” but who must know of the violence in Mexico and must be able to understand the clear nexus between the drug trade and the violence visited upon decent citizens of Mexico .
Yet these people steadfastly refuse to support any effort aimed at stopping the flow of drugs and illegal aliens .
There is a clear nexus between trafficking in both commodities .
Often illegal aliens are forced to carry drugs on their person as they are taken across the border by the smugglers ( coyotes ) .
Such aliens are referred to as “ mules ” because to the smuggler , they are nothing more than beasts of burden .
They are used as mules would be to carry a load .
Those illegal aliens are indeed treated no differently from any other load of contraband and , when they finally arrive in the United States their treatment is demeaning and dehumanizing .
They do not come to share the “ American dream ” but rather to provide cheap and exploitable labor .
Now the violence is escalating exponentially .
Kidnappings and home invasions are nearly a daily occurrence in cities in the United States that are located near the Mexican border .
Phoenix , Arizona is one particularly hard - hit example of this trend .
Meanwhile , each and every day more and more members of the drug cartels and the various gangs enter the United States and have embedded themselves in communities clear across our country , not unlike a metastasizing malignant tumor .
The concern is that with the increasing numbers of cartel members and their enforcers along with members of gangs such as MS - 13 , the tactics of terror that have driven increasing numbers of Mexican citizens to run the border that is supposed to separate Mexico from the United States may well be applied in increasing numbers of cities across the United States .
It is now estimated that there are now more violent gang members in the United States than there are sworn police officers .
The Fox article describes how there are increasing numbers of citizen of Mexico who now see in the United States not only an opportunity to make more money than would be possible in Mexico , but a safe haven to get away from the extreme violence that includes beheadings of police and military officials .
Interestingly , the article concludes :
Immigration lawyers say they do n’t believe the U.S. will reach a point where it cannot afford to keep all of the asylum - seekers here , but they do agree that the immigration system will be heavily strained .
Already , asylum officers are working with insufficient resources to process the number of applicants .
According to a 2005 survey by the Immigration Policy Center , 93 percent of surveyed asylum officers said they routinely worked overtime , without pay , in order to avoid a backlog of cases .
Some also said that they did n’t have enough time to thoroughly address each case , leading to the fear that they may have made wrong decisions in granting asylum .
It is clear that the beleaguered employees at USCIS ( United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ) lack the ability to keep pace with their ever increasing workload .
I have often invoked the analogy of the episode of I Love Lucy wherein Lucy and her hapless cohort , Ethel , take jobs at a candy factory .
They are supposed to wrap pieces of candy that are delivered to them on a conveyor belt that keeps moving faster and faster until they are unable to keep pace with the candy that hurtles at them at warp speed .
They try eating the candy and stuffing the candy down their clothes to keep up , but to no avail .
In that analogy , I left an important factor out .
Imagine if a small but unknown percentage of the candy contained a deadly poison .
Imagine if Lucy and Ethel were told that in addition to wrapping the candy they needed to attempt to find the poisoned morsels .
That is the untenable situation that the adjudications officers at USCIS find themselves in each and every day .
Consider the case of Mir Amil Kansi , a citizen of Pakistan who applied for political asylum and then showed his appreciation by standing outside the CIA in January 1993 one morning with an AK - 47 .
He opened fire on the employees of our government ’s intelligence agency and when the smoke cleared , two officials were dead and three others were wounded .
In the ensuing investigation it was determined that he had lied on his application for political asylum .
He was ultimately tracked down and returned to the United States to stand trial for his murderous rampage .
Kansi is only one of many aliens who easily gamed the immigration system in order to embed themselves in our country in preparation for their nefarious activities .
The attack on the World Trade Center the month after Kansi attacked the CIA also involved aliens who easily gamed the immigration system .
The terrorists of the 9/11 attacks had also been able to manipulate the immigration system to their advantage .
In all , it was determined that of 94 terrorists who had been identified as operating in the United States in the decade leading up to the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , 59 had used immigration fraud to either enter the United States and / or embed themselves in the United States .
The issue of the utter lack of integrity to the immigration benefits program has yet to be addressed .
There are still politicians who talk about Comprehensive Immigration Reform ( CIR ) but precious few seem to give a damn that criminals and terrorists are easily able to game that bureaucracy that literally puts the keys to America ’s front door into the hands of those who would kill us – if and when they have the opportunity .
Additionally , each and every day our border still permits the entry of thousands of illegal aliens who enter surreptitiously .
Every single day , narcotics flow north and money – American money - flows south buying guns , vehicles , corruption and death .
The other day a reporter noted that the approval rating for Congress had soared .
She said that , if I recall correctly , the approval rating was an incredible 31 % .
That nearly took my breath away !
Could you imagine keeping your job if your employer told you that out of 100 % you had a 31 % approval rating ?
In less than two years each and every member of the House of Representatives is up for reelection .
In less than two years more than one third of the members of the United States Senate will have to face their constituents .
They need to be reminded that they work for us , We the People !
The large scale apathy demonstrated by citizens of this nation has emboldened elected representatives to all but ignore the needs of the average American citizen in a quest for massive campaign funds and the promises of votes to be ostensibly delivered by special interest groups .
There is much that we cannot do but there is one thing that We the People absolutely must do – we must stop sitting on the sidelines .

Subject : Dimension X , along with X Minus One ...
Dimension X and X Minus one , probably the two best science fiction shows to be on what we now consider old time radio , in part because they were were well written , well crafted , well performed , as well as being first .
Lesser shows could have reduced science fiction to a footnote in the history of old time radio .
Yes , there were occasional weak episodes , but that was more in the sense they were weak against the high standard they set for themselves , not weak against other science fiction series .
The writing for both series was n't as strong as , say , Frontier Gentleman or Gunsmoke , or possibly The Great Gildersleeve , Jack Benny or Barry Craig because those shows had a continuing cast which you could relate to .
And , there was an overlap of episodes .
But , for those with the adventure of mind and imagination that only science fiction can bring to mind , travel to space and the future , even as dated as some of the shows may be , they were almost as good ( and to many people , better ) than curling in a corner with the latest paperback or monthly magazine of featuring the same story .
The bad part of science fiction , of course , is that ever since 1969 , no one can ever write about what it will be like to land on the moon ...
Still , these stories and performances stand the test of time .

This series has always been one of my favorites as it did a most excellent job of capturing the awe and wonder of 1950 's science - fiction , in my opinion the golden age of science fiction .
Many of the day's top authors are here in one of the top dramatic series of all time .

Torture is not constitutional , it 's against US and international law .
You can be prosecuted for it in many countries .
What 's wrong with this picture then of Fox Network practically advocating for it ?
I 'm not altogether sure that this would not warrant some form of research into the laws involved in promoting illegal behavior .
During and after the wars in the Balkans a number of people looked at the crimes committed by members of the press who advocated for different sides in hostilities resulting in genocide .
--
If a member of the press fosters a climate where crimes are being cultivated ... is he breaking laws ?
Should he / she be prosecuted ?
Fox is definitely a propaganda machine for folks on the right in the Republican and Libertarian parties .
Just check out the story we just did on the Tax Day Tea Party ' movement ' that was made to appear ( badly ) like they were grass roots .
FOX promoted the events , so it 's clear they have a stake in them .
They can't pretend to be simply covering just another story , but that 's what they tried to get away with .
Media Matters sorted it all out on their web site , mediamatters.org .
FOX also must have a political stake in justifying torture , so they put one nut case after another on the air to do that .
Clifford May mentions how doctors and psychologists were standing by to ' make sure ' people are ' not tortured ' is of particular interest .
A group of scholars in the field of medicine and psychology stood up to their own membership organization , the American Psychological Association , to argue that by their very presence at these events such professionals in the medical field were violating their oaths and also committing crimes just as significant as the crimes of those carrying out the torture .
More than that though , the medical professionals helped write some of the plans for the torture , noting what types of things work best , mapping out a strategy for as May says , ' scaring ' people .
Actually some of their tactics were powerful enough to destroy a detainee 's personality altogether .
So it 's a form of actual murder since they wo n't ever be the same person again .

In response to DORI SMITH : Media Matter does n't sort anything out .
They pick out sentences from conservatives that they twist out of context and play ad nauseum through MSNBC , the Democratic Party , and every other media institution that it is going out of business .
But if you believe that America should not be allowed to protect itself , including by use of interrogation to obtain information , then that is your choice , and your are free to believe that .
And my belief is that if I were ever in a situation where I had to choose between saving your life and that of a cockroach , I 'd save the cockroach , because the cockroach gives more to society than you do .

Dori Smith , destroying someone 's personality through torture is a heinous crime , but " murder " is a clearly defined term with a specific meaning , and you cannot make it mean anything you please .
If their body is still alive , they were n't murdered .
Also , what makes you say that " FOX also must have a political stake in justifying torture " ?
FOX tends to be pro-war , " tough on crime , " and absurdly deferential to authority , especially loud and violent white male authority figures , and all that pushed them into being torture apologists as a group .
But arguably they took those positions just to pander to the views their chosen audience already holds , not out of any genuine corporate interest .
They 're also very Republican , and defending torture now means defending Republicans , but they were advocating torture back before anyone in either party was known to have done it .
And as much as I disagree with torture , I do n't want to start prosecuting journalists for their political opinions , which is a very slippery slope .
There 's a real risk of a chilling effect on all sorts of free speech there .
Jamie Q , you 've sidestepped the question at hand , which is whether the interrogations should include torture .
I also want you to know that if your life was at risk , or you were unjustly imprisoned , or you were in prison and at risk of being tortured , or someone was trying to silence your political or other opinions , including your opinion that torture is justified , I would fight for your rights as a human being to life , to liberty , to freedom from torture , and to free speech .
As for Shepard Smith , he'd get a lot more traction if he moderated his delivery a little , but frankly I think he 's right , his message is overdue , and his outrage is justified .

" But if you believe that America should not be allowed to protect itself , including by use of interrogation to obtain information , then that is your choice , and your are free to believe that . "
Except , we 're not talking " interrogation " , we 're talking torture .
If you can't be honest with yourself , then that cockroach you speak of surely is a better person than you , since cockroaches at least do n't have to lie to try and twist reality to fit their world view .
And it 's been shown over and over and over again that torture _does not work_ .
The CIA is trying to say " we got good intel from torture " , but over the past few years , people who did the torture and followup on intel have said nothing substantial has come from it , and in fact , they got a lot of false information .
The last 9 words of your main post seems to be pure projection ..
It 's people like you that make them want to attack us .
So , not only do cockroaches do more for society , at least they are n't directly contributing to the destruction of humanity by their willful ignorance .
-------
To the article 's point , I 'm pretty sure Smith is not trying to advocate torture , I got the impression from a quote ( not presented here in text ) from him ( " if we torture then I want out ! " , or something to that effect ) that he 's still believing the lies that we " did not torture " .. but if a commission finds that we ' did ' , he would be disgusted with the country ( more , it 's leadership supported by moron sheeple ) and want to " leave it " .
The only sad thing in all of this is , this poor sap does n't already know full well that " we tortured " .
The right - wing sure fucked everything up .
Orwell would be proud ( well , the leaders in his book " 1984 " would be ) .

Technically , the constitution does n't cover torture at all .
Sure , there 's the clause about cruel and unusual punishment , and certainly torture would be included in that ( although under bush one could consider torture ' usual ' ) .
However , the constitution 's jurisdiction only includes US citizens , possibly extending to people on US soil ( which is why Guantanamo was used , its technically not US soil although some legal arguments can be made that it 's close enough to being US soil that the same rules still apply ) .
Therefore if we 're torturing foreigners then its not unconstitutional ( it is still unethical , internationally illegal , and violates geneva conventions , etc ) .
If people died from the torture ( and they did in Afghanistan ) , then its murder which is illegal under every US state , except in states that allow the death penalty --- but those cases at least were seen through a public court .
If they tortured Padilla , then it 's unconstitutional .
Shep is about the only guy on Fox I can actually watch without throwing up in my mouth .
Of course he only bucks the trend about once every 2 - 3 years like he apparently did here .
Tell me though , honestly , would n't you love to have Rove strapped to a board with a few thousand buckets of water and a towel ?

" However , the constitution 's jurisdiction only includes US citizens , possibly extending to people on US soil " I disagree with this assessment .
The Constitution does not say " All Americans are created equal " , it says " All men are create equal " , which means we believe these rights Americans enjoy to belong to _all people_ .
Therefore , when any people are in our custody , we have an obligation to treat them as we claim " all men " should be treated .

The Declaration of Independence should be incorporated into the Constitution , for sure .
Plus , I think we should strip of their citizenship and deport all those who think the wealthy are entitled to more rights and benefits than the poor .
Let them find or form a country whose founding documents state otherwise , state it 's self - evident to them that oligarchy is the best government .
And , if we need to make it clearer to everyone that Constitutional protections extend to anyone in our custody or control , no matter where , then we should get on that right away .
I do n't think that should be necessary .
It 's clear enough that our country is not merely embodied in its borders , but also in its people .
You know , " We The People " and all that .
Somebody tell Holder that his job is not to do what Obama tells him to do .
His job is to prosecute criminals .
He 's breaking the law and his oath by not prosecuting everyone involved in torturing people .
Holder , so far , has not been a scrap better than any of the * administration 's AGs .
All of them were outrages to the rule of law .
And that 's just it , either he prosecutes per the law instead of per the president , or we are not a rule of law nation but a monarchy .
We do n't fucking torture , AND we fucking prosecute anyone who does .

Personally I agree with you , but the supreme court has a history of only applying the constitution to citizens , or sometimes to non-citizens on US soil .
The constitution says " all Treaties made , or which shall be made ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land ; " .
The Geneva Conventions is one of the treaties we made .
Therefore our breaking of the Geneva Conventions is unconstitutional .
I see your point , however torture itself is against the Genevea convention specifically , making torture an illegal activity because it breaks a law .
All that article of the constitution is saying is that treaties are ' laws ' .
If we were to withdraw from the Geneva conventions , then torture of non-US citizens on foreign soil would n't specifically be ' unconstitutional ' .
Anyway , its just a minor nit - pick I had from one of the early posts .
I 'm in clear agreement that torturing prisoners is one of the more f*cked up things our country has done , roughly on par with supporting ruthless dictators just because they take an ' anti- communist ' view .
Clearly , at a minimum DoJ personnel should be tried on that issue , as well as persons higher - up the chain ( Rumsfeld , Cheney , Bush , etc ) .
I somewhat think Obama does n't want to prosecute people in the CIA directly ( and noone more generally ) because think about what happened to Kennedy when he rocked the boat too much in too many areas ...

No Joe , you 're wrong .
A majority of Americans are against torture , and they are against it because it 's morally wrong , it 's against the law , and they have respect for the rule of law regardless of which party holds the White House .
Try to take off your partisan blinders for a sec .
Prior to George W. Bush , waterboarding was prosecuted as a war crime .
What changed ?
The U.S. prosecuted and convicted Japanese soldiers who waterboarded American soldiers in WWII , and Texas prosecuted law enforcement officers who waterboarded a suspect .
Those are just two cases off the top of my head --- if you bother to look , you will find plenty of case law , both national and international , that clearly shows waterboarding is legally defined as torture and has been prosecuted as such , even by the United States .
Just because you do n't know history does n't mean nobody else does .
Secondly , torture is always wrong , always .
No matter who does it --- regardless of whether it is perpetrated by terrorists holding hostages or whether it is done by Americans in the guise of fighting terrorists .
I 'll put it very simply :
If they do it , and then we do it , we are no better than they are .
And we 're supposed to better than they are , remember ?
Lastly , your last three sentences are just silly .
Surely you and your moral relativism can come up with something better than that .

Classic films like Reservoir Dogs , Top Gun and Wayne 's World employ slow - motion for emotional impact .
Now that Casio , Samsung , JVC , LG and Ricoh cameras and phones tout slow - mo , amateurs can wield this same mighty power :
Advertisement
First , How Slow Motion Actually Works
Understanding the basic principle of slow motion is helpful for both properly following and bending the format 's rules , so bear with me for just a second .
The film effect has its origins in overcranking — in the early days of film , camera operators literally cranked the film reel when shooting a scene .
By cranking the reel faster , they saw their films projected more slowly .
Why ?
That 's where we get to the basic premise of slow mo .
Slow motion captures a bunch of pictures very fast — at least 120 images per second , and often 300 or more .
Meanwhile , video typically plays back at an eyeball - friendly 24 - 30 frames a second .
Advertisement
So when you play back those 300 fast images at the speed your eye is happy with , you have a huge excess of images .
Your 300 images may have been filmed in one second of real shooting , but they will last for 10 seconds on screen — slow motion is born .
And while digital video has traditionally struggled in capturing the high frame rates necessary for true slow motion , many new cameras work just like overcranking , shooting hundreds of lower - resolution pictures per second .
The tips here concern cameras and camcorders capable of high speed frame rates — not just cameras from Casio , but camcorders from Samsung and JVC , a Japan - only camera from Ricoh and LG's Viewty cameraphone .
This is not about slowing down your regular - speed footage in some kind of video editor .
1. Use Lots of Light
When you shoot slow mo , you are taking pictures quickly .
And when you take pictures quickly , light has less time to create an image in your camera .
Shoot in plenty of light , or you will get dark and gloomy slow - mo .

In real terms , that means that super high - speed shooting might not work indoors .
On the Casio EX - F1 , for instance , you can shoot 300 fps indoors , and maybe 600 fps if you 're near a window , but you can't pull off its 1200 fps setting without adding bright light .
For the same reason , night shooting may very well be out of the question , depending on your particular rig and just what you expect from the image in terms of detail — artsy stuff may be fine , but do n't expect to film a hummingbird under the soft glow of the moon .

2. Mind Your FPS
As stated above , slow motion really does n't work very well on camera systems not designed for it in the first place .
So if your camera only shoots 24 or 30 frames per second of video , your slow motion will be merely faked by whatever editing software you use .
( It 'll suck . )
This is about capturing life you normally can't see :
The flitting of a bug 's wings , the popping of a water balloon , the fleeting microexpression of joy or pain on a person 's otherwise complacent face .
Choosing the right frame rate for your subject is of vital importance .
Here 's a chart with exemplary clips to get you started :
120 fps : Baseline slow motion , just a quarter the speed of real life ; it 's the go - to speed for sports replays
300 fps : Good for narrative slow motion like walk scenes , love scenes and displays of manliness ( see aforementioned Top Gun )
600 fps : The beginnings of slow - mo porn , human movement becomes less narrative , more anatomical

1000 - 1200 fps : Human subjects move too slowly for this rate , now you 're into explosion mode ; 1200 fps is the fastest Casio's EX - F1 can shoot
5,000 - 10,000 fps : Bullet - time explosions , shards of glass split and float in the air ... and you can see the intricate design of lightning .
Storebought cameras can't do this —yet
3. Think Outside Stabilization
You 're always better off shooting on a tripod for optimum clarity , but if there 's one time you can really stretch your imagination with shooting video , it 's slow motion .
Because you are shooting so many frames in such a limited space , you can take advantage of time stretching to make video appear more stable .

So not only can you shoot most slow - mo clips without a tripod , but you can even toss your camera in the air to try that crazy shot you wanted .
It might not come out , and you might want to insure your camera first , but why not push the limits ?
We 're talking 300 - 1200 frames per second .
That 's a lot of room to fudge things .
4. Compensate for Slow - Motion Side Effects
The downside to shooting in slow mo is that you almost always end up with more footage than you need .
Remember , six seconds of shooting produces one minute of video at 300 fps , two minutes at 600 fps .
Some cameras let you trim your clip right there on the spot , and you should take advantage of it , as it frees up wasted memory , too .
Advertisement
Another issue is aspect ratio .
As the frame rates go up on the Casio EX - F1 , they get longer , slimmer and lower in resolution .
At 1200 fps , you get strips of video 336x96 .
Our friend Robert Woodhead made up for this in his Mentos and Diet Coke video by stitching four vertically oriented videos together in Final Cut .
Advertisement
The final problem with slow mo is sound , as in , there is none .
That 's the reason you often hear music playing over clips .
It 's not necessary to add music , though clearly Tarantino enjoyed that part .
Still , the ultimate reality about slow - motion shooting is that it 's surprisingly simple with today 's equipment — not necessarily any more difficult than normal video if you are shooting with enough light .
Until this meme is done ( and in our book , it most certainly is not ) , go out there and shoot with confidence .
It 's an interesting artistic medium that 's just become democratized to the public , so let the whoring commence .

Criminal proceedings have begun in Spain against six senior officials in the Bush administration for the use of torture against detainees in Guantánamo Bay .
Baltasar Garzón , the counter - terrorism judge whose prosecution of General Augusto Pinochet led to his arrest in Britain in 1998 , has referred the case to the chief prosecutor before deciding whether to proceed .
The case is bound to threaten Spain 's relations with the new administration in Washington , but Gonzalo Boyé , one of the four lawyers who wrote the lawsuit , said the prosecutor would have little choice under Spanish law but to approve the prosecution .
" The only route of escape the prosecutor might have is to ask whether there is ongoing process in the US against these people , " Boyé told the Observer .
" This case will go ahead .
It will be against the law not to go ahead . "
The officials named in the case include the most senior legal minds in the Bush administration .
They are : Alberto Gonzales , a former White House counsel and attorney general ; David Addington , former vice - president Dick Cheney 's chief of staff ; Douglas Feith , who was under - secretary of defence ; William Haynes , formerly the Pentagon 's general counsel ; and John Yoo and Jay Bybee , who were both senior justice department legal advisers .
Court documents say that , without their legal advice in a series of internal administration memos , " it would have been impossible to structure a legal framework that supported what happened [ in Guantánamo ] " .
Boyé predicted that Garzón would issue subpoenas in the next two weeks , summoning the six former officials to present evidence : " If I were them , I would search for a good lawyer . "
If Garzón decided to go further and issued arrest warrants against the six , it would mean they would risk detention and extradition if they travelled outside the US .
It would also present President Barack Obama with a serious dilemma .
He would have either to open proceedings against the accused or tackle an extradition request from Spain .
Obama administration officials have confirmed that they believe torture was committed by American interrogators .
The president has not ruled out a criminal inquiry , but has signalled he is reluctant to do so for political reasons .
" Obviously we 're going to be looking at past practices , and I do n't believe that anybody is above the law , " Obama said in January .
" But my orientation 's going to be to move forward . "
Philippe Sands , whose book Torture Team first made the case against the Bush lawyers and which Boyé said was instrumental in formulating the Spanish case , said yesterday : " What this does is force the Obama administration to come to terms with the fact that torture has happened and to decide , sooner rather than later , whether it is going to criminally investigate .
If it decides not to investigate , then inevitably the Garzón investigation , and no doubt many others , will be given the green light . "
Germany 's federal prosecutor was asked in November 2006 to pursue a case against Donald Rumsfeld , the former defence secretary , Gonzales and other officials for abuses committed in Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
But the prosecutor declined on the grounds that the issue should be investigated in the US .
Legal observers say the Spanish lawsuit has a better chance of ending in charges .
The high court , on which Garzón sits , has more leeway than the German prosecutor to seek " universal jurisdiction " .
The lawsuit also points to a direct link with Spain , as six Spaniards were held at Guantánamo and are argued to have suffered directly from the Bush administration 's departure from international law .
Unlike the German lawsuit , the Spanish case is aimed at second - tier figures , advisers to Bush , Cheney and Rumsfeld , with the aim of being less politically explosive .
The lawsuit claimed the six former aides " participated actively and decisively in the creation , approval and execution of a judicial framework that allowed for the deprivation of fundamental rights of a large number of prisoners , the implementation of new interrogation techniques including torture , the legal cover for the treatment of those prisoners , the protection of the people who participated in illegal tortures and , above all , the establishment of impunity for all the government workers , military personnel , doctors and others who participated in the detention centre at Guantánamo " .
" All the accused are members of what they themselves called the ' war council ' , " court documents allege .
" This group met almost weekly either in Gonzales 's or Haynes 's offices . "
In a now notorious legal opinion signed in August 2002 , Yoo and Bybee argued that torture occurred only when pain was inflicted " equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function , or even death " .
Another key document cited in the Spanish case is a November 2002 " action memo " written by Haynes , in which he recommends that Rumsfeld give " blanket approval " to 15 forms of aggressive interrogation , including stress positions , isolation , hooding , 20 - hour interrogations and nudity .
Rumsfeld approved the document .
The 1984 UN Convention against Torture , signed and ratified by the US , requires states to investigate allegations of torture committed on their territory or by their nationals , or extradite them to stand trial elsewhere .
Last week , Britain 's attorney general , Lady Scotland , launched a criminal investigation into MI5 complicity in the torture of Binyam Mohamed , a British resident held in Guantánamo .
The Obama administration has so far avoided taking similar steps .
But the possibility of US prosecutions was brought closer by a report by the Senate armed services committee at the end of last year , which found : " The abuse of detainees in US custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of ' a few bad apples ' acting on their own .
The fact is that senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques , redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authorised their use against detainees . "
None of the six former officials could be reached for comment yesterday .
Meanwhile , Vijay Padmanabhan , a former state department lawyer , said the creation of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp was " one of the worst over - reactions of the Bush administration " .
What will happen next ?
Will Palestinian kids be duped to play music to Israeli pilots who exterminated Gaza children with White Phosphorus ?
By Khalid Amayreh in Occupied East Jerusalem
It is really hard to write on this subject without getting angry .
We all know the extent to which Israel can be evil and satanic .
After all , we Palestinians have been on the receiving end of Israeli savagery for decades .
In fact , being thoroughly tormented and killed by the children , grand - children and great grandchildren of the holocaust has always been and continues to be “ the ” Palestinians ’ way of life .
However , for some Palestinians to allow themselves to be duped to sing and play music to their oppressors and child - killers is simply beyond the pale of human dignity .
It is at least as insulting and humiliating as some Jews were forced or duped to play music to SS , Gestapo and Wehrmacht soldiers during the Second World War .
In both cases , the act was meant to humiliate the victims and rob them of the last visages of human dignity .
And now , Jews in Israel are doing the same thing to Palestinians , Nazism ’s vicarious victims .
Last week , a few innocent kids from the Jenin refugee camp were surreptiously taken to Tel Aviv to “ cheer up and take part in peace - promoting activities . ”
However , once there the kids were unceremoniously driven to a reception where they were made to play music and sing to “ holocaust survivors , ” some of them are former members of the Hagana and Irgun terrorist gangs who had taken part in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine and expulsion of Palestinians form their homeland .
God knows how much Palestinian blood did these so - called “ holocaust survivors ” shed in 1948 and subsequent years .
Certainly , Dir Yasin , Tantura , Dawaymeh , and the numerous other massacres were not committed by UFOs .
They were committed in cold blood by these very people our children
are now cheering up .
Shame on us a thousand times !
Some of the innocent kids were instructed to utter words that should never be uttered by the victims of Zionism .
But the kids apparently felt they had to say anything they were asked to say in order to show gratitude for the Jewish “ peace contractor ” who got them out of the ghetto , otherwise known as Jenin refugee camp , even for a six - our outing in Tel Aviv .
I am not against showing genuine sympathy with the victims of the holocaust .
However , a sympathy that is manipulated to justify , rationalize or even extenuate the crime against humanity that is Israel is worse than a crime if only because it serves to promote and perpetuate oppression .
As human beings , we Palestinians do sympathize with all victims of Nazism , Stalinism and imperialism , the wept , the over - wept , and especially the unwept who constitute the vast majority of victims .
Having said that , however , I strongly believe that no honest person under the sun has the slightest right to demand that we pay the price for what the Nazis did or may have done to European Jews nearly 70 years ago .
We did n’t send Jews to the ovens .
The German did .
We did n’t starve Jews to death as Jews are doing to us today in the Gaza Strip .
We did n’t incinerate Jews in Gas chambers as Jews have recently incinerated Palestinian children with White Phosphorus .
Hence , of all people in this world , Palestinians must never be made to feel guilty for what the Nazis and other Europeans did to Jews .
I say so because a feeling of guilt , even a modicum of guilt , on our part , would be construed or misconstrued as a vindication of Zionism , the Nazism of our time .
There are additional reasons that make the latest insensitive manipulation of Palestinian suffering especially ugly and dishonorable .
First , nearly all the young musicians who were taken to Tel Aviv came from the Jenin Refugee camp .
For those who have forgotten , this is the very same refugee camp that Israeli tanks pulverized in 2002 .
According to eyewitnesses , Israeli tanks and bulldozers destroyed homes right on top of innocent civilians , including the physically handicapped , while dozens of innocent civilians were systematically massacred , very much like Jews were at Ghetto Warsaw .
The massacre at the camp was so hideous that Israel refused to allow UN officials to access the camp to inspect what happened .
Well , again the Nazi analogy is inescapable .
Just imagine surviving Jewish children from Treblinka or Bergen Belsen made to sing to SS soldiers .!!
Second , the disgraceful concert in Tel Aviv comes on the heel of Israel ’s genocidal assault in Gaza where Israeli warplanes showered the children , women and men of coastal enclave with White Phosphorus and other missiles and bombs of death while Israeli Jews were gleefully celebrating the “ victory on Hamas ” and Israeli rabbis preoccupied with classifying gentiles into “ children of light ” and “ children of darkness . ”
In Gaza , the Zionist Jews exposed their shame to all the people of the world by acting like primitive barbarians and murderous savages .
Hence , the utter shamefulness of sending Palestinian children to Tel Aviv to help Israel ’s hasbara efforts whitewash Israel ’s pornographic barbarianism in Gaza .
Finally , it is obvious that the PA bears much of the blame for this disgraceful event .
The PA should never allow so called “ cultural exchanges ” and “ cultural normalization ” with the murderers of our children , the very state whose leaders and military commanders view us as “ scum , vermin and animals ” that ought to be exterminated .
Unfortunately , the PA itself encourages some demoralized Palestinians to endear themselves to Israel , even in the cheapest of manners .
The often cordial meetings and exchanging of kisses between Mahmoud Abbas and Ehud Olmert , the butcher of Gaza , leave one and only impression , not only on the children of the refugee camp in Jenin , but also on TV viewers around the world .
Perhaps the Israel artillery and war planes were showering Gaza with candy , not White Phosphorus .!!!
This is probably the main message the organizers of the Jenin - Tel Aviv tour wanted to communicate to these miserable kids who are obviously having a hard time recognizing their fathers ’ killers .

A couple of weeks ago , I did a review for the Nick Cage thriller Knowing .
You can find that HERE .
At that time , I wanted to provide a fairly spoiler - free take on the movie , but there were so many interesting elements of the film that I wanted to explore which would spoil the film for the uninitiated .
I decided to revisit the movie later ; the time has come .
I should make two things clear from the get go .
First off , this is NOT a review .
I am not discussing the artistic merits of the film but the nature of its themes and basic premise .
I will point out a few plot holes , but that ’s as far as we ’ll go with the criticism .
Second , this is a highly spoilerific article .
Reader beware .
All right , enough with the clarification .
Let ’s get to it .
The end of the world .
We ’ve been predicting it as a civilization since the dawn of man , it seems .
” The End is Nigh ” is always on someone ’s lips , and usually that person is pushing an agenda .
And when Hollywood caught wind of the inherent drama of the threat of Earth ’s destruction , movies got made about it .
Usually we blew ourselves up like in Planet of the Apes and The Time Machine .
Other times we came to the brink of destruction by an alien race but were saved , a la Independence Day or The Day the Earth Stood Still .
Watching Knowing , though , there was something different .
It affected me in a way that other “ end - of - the - world ” cinema did n’t .
And I attribute this to a few factors .
First , the movie posits that the end is not just nigh , it is inevitable .
Once the nature of our destruction is discovered , it becomes clear that there is no way to stop it .
We did n’t bring about our own demise ; it was planned by nature in an unchanging way before the first human ever stood upright .
Second , it focused on death and the characters ’ abilities to deal with death and the inevitable end .
Mass riots happened in the movie , as they would in real life , but the only real drama left once we know that the world is ending comes from the six inches between the characters ’ ears .
The decisions they make are chilling and telling .
And third –the thing that is most frightening about this film–its science , while stretched to the level of absurdity , falls eerily in line with a cosmic event in our near future .
An event predicted by the 2012 end of the Mayan calendar as well as Nasa scientists .
Let ’s take these one at a time …
First , inevitability .
In this film , we spend a large chunk of the movie on a very traditional and hackneyed thrill - ride toward discovering mysteries , presumably to stop the end of the world .
Once the revelation comes of how the world is to end , though , we realize that there is no stopping it .
There is no escaping it .
There is no surviving it .
Everyone on the face of the earth will die because of a cosmic event that cannot be controlled .
There is no digging into the space rock and blowing it up … this event is much bigger than us , and puts humanity ’s size and effect on the universe into perfect perspective .
There is a scene earlier in the movie that , while it was playing , I hated .
In it , Nick Cage talks about determinism and how every variable had to be in perfect alignment in order to put the earth at the perfect distance from the sun with the perfect elements in play in order to sustain life .
The first time I watched it , I thought it was just a silly and obvious “ does God have a plan ” scene , and it is that , but it ’s also more .
It is setting up how fragile our ecosystem is .
And not just to nukes or global warming , but to celestial events .
Sunspots really do interrupt satellite communication , and galaxies really do have a tendency to collide with one another .
If any one of a billion freak natural happenings occurs within our galaxy or solar system , the necessary ingredients for life are interrupted and it ’s goodbye humans .
This is n’t just a possibility .
It ’s an inevitability .
Barring all this happening , the universe will eventually lose all kinetic energy and return to a gaseous state before collapsing in on itself .
By then , mankind will be dead as will all other life .
It ’s going to happen .
At some point in human history , the events of this film will occur in one way or another .
So when the film explains this inevitability , all the silly thriller elements serve only to take us aback as an audience .
I thought he was supposed to figure out the code and save humanity ?!?!?
Not in this movie .
And because of that , the film takes on a chilling sense of realism .
Second , we focus on individuals ’ responses to this impending doom .
I still say that the last few minutes of the movie , with Nick driving down the empty road to rejoin his family and the ensuing destruction , are some of the most haunting things I ’ve seen in a movie in a long while .
Your death is going to happen , it will be meaningless , and nobody will be left to weep for you .
Seeing a group of characters make split - second decisions about what to do with that piece of information is telling .
In the end , Cage ’s character believes in God .
But I , as an audience member , have to ask the question :
Does he believe in God because it is true to him ?
Or because , at this late stage in the game , there is no reason to subscribe to the alternative ?
They call religion the opiate of the masses , and when the end comes I do n’t know that I ’d mind being doped out of my mind .
It instantaneously ( to me at least ) brings up very simple but deep questions of morality , spirituality , and religion .
Third , this movie is affecting because of the time it ’s coming out .
Roland Emmerich is making a movie about the ominous coincidences and “ prophecies ” surrounding the year 2012 , but I get the feeling that this movie hits the nail on the head more than the other film ever will .
Because this is all about unchangeable cosmic occurrences .
Here ’s a quick rundown of what happens on December 21 , 2012 .
First , it is the end of the Mayan calendar .
Many have disputed what this means .
It could be the end of one period and the beginning of another .
It could mean ( far - fetched though it seems ) the beginning of a new state of human consciousness .
It could mean the Mayans were smart and just happened to decide their calendar would end on a very celestially significant day .
Or it could be a prediction of the end of the world .
Forgetting the Mayans for a second , this is definitely an important cosmic day–at exactly 11:11 GMT , The Galactic alignment will occur–that is the alignment of the December solstice sun with the Galactic equator ( the center of the Milky Way Galaxy ) .
This happens only once every 26,000 years , and the Mayans predicted it .
Couple this with NASA ’s prediction that 2012 will be a height of solar activity ( sunspots ) and you get a very creepy Knowing vibe .
NASA even published a report ( do your own research HERE ) that predicted serious fallout from the coming solar storms .
” Many forecasters believe Solar Cycle 24 will be big and intense .
Peaking in 2011 or 2012 , the cycle to come could have significant impacts on telecommunications , air traffic , power grids and GPS systems . ”
Am I arguing that the world will end ?
Absolutely not .
I am admitting , though , that this information makes me a little uneasy .
And when I saw what Knowing was doing with it , I was affected .
It wo n’t be a massive “ super - flare ” burn out that kills us all , most likely , but there is a ( very loose ) basis in reality in the film that reminded me of these upcoming events .
All of these things come together to create a cinematic ending that one would have to call “ ballsy . ”
This movie aims to show you the end of the world , and it does it in a very fatalistic way that makes a viewer ( and the unstoppable Nick Cage himself ) feel helpless .
I had meant this article , at the start , to be a greater exploration of the themes of Knowing , but I feel like I ’m running long .
I will say a couple more things and then leave this movie be for a while .
The film ’s hope lies in the salvation of the children , arriving at the tree of life in the new garden of eden .
There is a feeling that inevitability and rebirth can also provide structure and comfort .
This is how life began , and how it will begin again–an endless cycle being controlled by a higher power , whether that be God , aliens , or some yet undiscovered entity .
These beings have predicted every event during the course of human existence .
Every disaster , no matter how big or small .
And the placement of perfectly polished rocks ( from the landing site at the end of the movie ) serves as more of a thematic element than a plausible plot thread .
What it says , then , is “ we knew all this would happen .
Every bit of it .
And there is no other way it could have happened .
Take comfort in that . ”
I could go into a philosophical discourse on the merits of determinism vs. free will , but we ’ll save that for another time .
Still , I am not arguing that this is at all a “ great ” movie .
The plot holes are wide ( why not just put all this information in a letter or recurring dream instead of creating a thriller - like mystery , Mr. aliens ? ) .
The plot is contrived , and the movie plays toward genre convention much more than it should .
I feel like the filmmakers are doing all this –making so much of the movie predictable and palatable–so that they can get away with the ending they have created .
Give the marketing department something to sell ; the last ten minutes belong to the filmmakers .
People will ( and have ) walk out of this movie hating it .
But I doubt too many people will leave the theater without something to chew on mentally or emotionally .
In the end , that ’s the kind of movie I most love .
It does n’t have to be complicated or overly cerebral , it just has to swing for the fences .

The boss says , " I hired a woman who laughs too much . "
Woman says , " Ha ha ha ha ha ! "
The boss says , " She 'll be in the cubicle next to yours . "
Woman says , " Wa - ha ha ha ha ! "
Dilbert says , " I no longer worry about life passing too quickly . "
My wife only even went through with it because I forced her to ; she gets really pissed and wants to tell them to fuck off , she 'll go home and die rather than pay 500 bucks for 10 minutes .
Of course , this is chump change .
We 're now scheduled for a nephrologist an hour away Monday .
My wife starts speaking up and saying we can't afford that and they say stupid things like " You ca n 't put this off . "
One NP even seriously said " Could you talk to your parents and see if they could help you out financially " to which my wife said that despite the fact that two years ago our parents were making 250 K and 120 K respectively ( both off of single incomes with stay at home moms as well ) , both of them are now out of their jobs .
But jesus christ , WHY the HELL is n't anyone in these damn hospitals saying whats so fucking obvious ?!
If they want to diagnose her with Chronic Kidney Disease , which they do , they should say : You have CKD .
You can either suffer or go into more debt that you will ever repay .
Welcome to fucking america .
Sheesh , too bad we did n't have the PRESCIENCE ( I 'm studying for the GRE ) to get health insurance .
We should have gone out and gotten some good old health insurance .
I mean , given my wife 's record of health , it would only cost us - wait , no , it would n't actually have a price tag .
She is 100 % fully uninsurable .
Of course , if we had n't been so lazy maybe we'd have one of those full time jobs with benefits that america is so famous for .
You know , like the benefits I got for working 54 hours per week for the past 2 years before moving 60 miles for school and applying to about 10 places between the two of us without success .
Oh Wait , I did n't have any fucking benefits at 54 hours per week .
As I Type this , RIGHT NOW , my wife is behind me talking about committing suicide because she does n't want to go into debt to deal with this and she 's just sick of the chronic pain .
" You can't get better in America , because even if you are getting treated , the debt you incur gives so much stress your body can't heal , " she just said .
Good point .
Fuck . this .
EDIT :
thanks for the support folks .
I'm a super optimist , and my wife is a super pessimist ( and also diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome and suffering from PTSD ) and together we tend to get things taken care of .
Practical advice is very helpful , and if you think you know what we are going through , you probably do , so do n't hesitate to give advice .
EDIT : If you could hear her playing Chopin 's first Ballade right now you'd be even more sympathetic .
Wait till she gets to the third .
Also , after tonight when she tells me I spend too much time on Dkos I 'll remind her how helpful and caring you all are .
Thanks a lot guys .
MAJOR EDIT :
Lots of you are very smart .
recognizing this I have a question .
My wife says her chart had these problems :
Potassium low
Chlorine High
Kreatenine ( or something ) was somehow messed up - and apparently this was like off the charts and significantly surprising .
and all the proteins they check for were abnormal or something .
Does this mean anything to any of you ?
If so , my wife was just curious if anyone knows if this points to ESRD or something else or whatever .
Also , I 'm very interested in your advice , and if I do n't respond it 's because I 'm responding somewhere else on the thread .
Edit : one last thought .
One huge symptom my wife has had - it came on before the passing out and throwing up — is extreme and sudden numbness in her extremities .
She says it feels like when your foot falls asleep and then is waking up , painful and confusing to the nerves .
It makes her drop stuff and fall down .
Do you think this is related ?
It happens a lot when she stands up .
Lastly , do n't hesitate to use GRE vocabulary words in your replies , because I 'm taking the test tuesday . (:
EDIT : Saturday , 1:05 PM .
I can't help bud add this .
My wife woke up late today , feeling really sick , and she expresses that she 's feeling depressed because she wants to get a job and she 's afraid that this will just make it harder for her to work .... lazy liberals .
Gordon Brothers Group , the liquidator that recently helped clear merchandise for Circuit City and several other bankrupt retailers , is expected to earn approval to buy G.I. Joe 's Holding Corp. during a bankruptcy hearing today , several sources said Wednesday .
John Mangan , a spokesman for the 57 - year - old sporting goods retailer , said he could not comment until after this morning 's hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware .
"
There was some hope that something could be salvaged , but it looks more and more like a pure liquidation route , " said Fred Bruning , whose CenterCal Properties owns the Nampa , Idaho , mall where Joe 's opened its newest store last spring .
" It 's hard , I 've been a loyal Joe 's shopper myself in Gresham . "
Bruning , a Joe 's creditor , confirmed Wednesday that he understood from court filings and others that the 31 - store chain probably would be liquidated by Boston - based Gordon Brothers after the bankruptcy judge signed off on the deal .
A series of staff meetings and internal e-mails alerted employees to the news Wednesday and representatives from WorkSource Clackamas were at the corporate headquarters in Wilsonville to help answer employees ' questions about unemployment , said John Blanton , rapid response coordinator for Clackamas Community College 's Workforce Development Services .
Blanton , who responds to major company closures and layoffs within 48 hours , said he understood that about 190 corporate and distribution center employees would lose jobs as part of a liquidation .
The Oregon retailing icon was purchased in 2007 by Gryphon Investors , a San Francisco private equity firm .
Soon after , " G.I. " was dropped from the name and the stores became Joe 's Sports , Outdoor & More .
Joe 's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early March .
In initial court filings , the retailer made it clear it aimed to quickly restructure or sell -- either to someone who'd continue operations or to a liquidator , which typically means the clearing of goods and a closure .
G.I. Joe's , from the beginning
1952 :
Edward Orkney buys a retail store -- actually , an Army - issue hospital tent -- on North Vancouver Avenue in Portland and calls it G.I. Joe's .
1976 :
Orkney opens his fifth and -- at 55,000 square feet -- largest store in Salem and buys land in Wilsonville for the company 's distribution center , which remains today .
Later that year , Orkney dies and his son , David , takes over as chief executive officer and board chairman .
1992 :
Norm Daniels , who had worked for the Orkney family since he was a teenager , takes over as chief executive .
1998 :
Daniels leads a management buyout and becomes chairman and majority owner .
January , 2007 :
Gryphon Investors of San Francisco buys a controlling interest in G.I.
Joe 's for a reported $ 50 million .
Stores become Joe 's Sports , Outdoor & More .
May 1 , 2008 :
Joe 's opens its 31st -- and apparently final -- location in Nampa , Idaho , trumpeting expectations that the chain 's annual sales would exceed $ 290 million .
March 4 , 2009 :
G.I. Joe 's Holding Corp. files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , listing debts ranging from $ 100 million to $ 500 million .
April 9 , 2009 :
A Delaware bankruptcy judge is expected to rule on a buyer for the chain .
Boston - based liquidator Gordon Brothers Group is expected to get the bid .
Joe 's could n't secure any other partners or financing to restructure .
Delaware - based attorneys who attended a hearing Tuesday and local creditors , including Columbia Sportswear , said the retailer only received bids from liquidators .
A bankrupt retailer can be more lucrative for a liquidator than another retailer , which would be buying all the liabilities and future operational costs .
This is particularly true , experts say , in an economy that 's left consumers wary of spending on perceived extras -- such as Joe 's inventory of sporting goods , fishing tackle and hunting equipment .
Ultimately , the court is looking to get Joe 's creditors the largest return to cover their unpaid invoices .
Joe 's bankruptcy filings list more than 1,000 creditors , with the top 30 owed $ 12.8 million .
Baja Inc. , Joe 's largest unsecured creditor , is owed $ 1.2 million , according to court records .
As word of the retailer 's fate circulated among its customers , many left sentimental messages at The Oregonian 's Web site , OregonLive.com :
" When I was in school , Joe 's was where I went for all my gear .
It really seems like unfortunate timing : with the economic downturn , I 'd imagine more people will be looking for cheap gear , not brand name .
Not everyone can afford REI , but still want a step up from Wal - Mart , " posted one reader .
Another : " What a sad day .
I grew up shopping at Joe's .
I remember my dad taking me there before big fishing trips ...
Joe 's will always have a piece of my heart . "
Others were harder on the company , which had garnered complaints recently from longtime customers for the name change , a perceived upscaling of merchandise and prices , and less experienced staff .
An online reader wrote , " ... they stopped selling G.I. gear , handguns , sturdy camping tents , and other gear that outdoorsmen look for outside of a K - mart .
The last time I went to Joe 's was when I was looking to buy some ammo , and they had a ... poor selection that was priced $ 1 to $ 5 a box higher than Fisherman 's Marine and Outdoor . "
Troubles with the longtime retailer emerged in mid-February , when Joe 's executives advised Oregon employment officials of potential layoffs in a required filing .
The report listed 190 positions that could be affected , from Joe 's chief executive , Hal Smith , to 68 warehouse workers in Wilsonville .
At the time , a company spokesman said there was " virtually no possibility " that everyone on the list would lose their jobs .
Some employees on Wednesday said they'd heard their last day could come as early as Friday , while others heard work could stretch on for a few months .

Bush Team Ignored Waterboard Cases George W. Bush ’s Justice Department said subjecting a person to the near - drowning of waterboarding was not a crime and did n’t even cause pain , but Ronald Reagan ’s Justice Department thought otherwise , prosecuting a Texas sheriff and three deputies for using the practice to get confessions .
Email
Printer friendly Federal prosecutors secured a 10 - year sentence against the sheriff and four years in prison for the deputies .
But that 1983 case – which would seem to be directly on point for a legal analysis on waterboarding two decades later – was never mentioned in the four Bush administration opinions released last week .
The failure to cite the earlier waterboarding case and a half - dozen other precedents that dealt with torture is reportedly one of the critical findings of a Justice Department watchdog report that legal sources say faults former Bush administration lawyers – Jay Bybee , John Yoo and Steven Bradbury – for violating “ professional standards . ”
Bybee , Yoo and Bradbury also shocked many who have read their memos in the last week by their use of clinical and legalistic jargon that sometimes took on an otherworldly or Orwellian quality .
Bybee ’s Aug. 1 , 2002 , legal memo – drafted by Yoo – argued that waterboarding could not be torture because it does not “ inflict physical pain . ”
During the procedure , a subject is strapped down to a bench with his head lower than his feet and his face covered by a cloth that is then saturated with water , cutting off his breathing and inducing the panic reflex that a person feels while drowning .
“ You have informed us that this procedure does not inflict actual physical harm , ” Bybee wrote .
“ Thus , although the subject may experience the fear or panic associated with the feeling of drowning , the waterboard does not inflict physical pain .
...
The waterboard is simply a controlled acute episode , lacking the connotation of a protracted period of time generally given to suffering . ”
Bush administration officials approved CIA waterboarding for three “ high - value ” detainees , including Abu Zubaydah ( believed to be an al - Qaeda logistics operative ) and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ( known as KSM , the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks ) .
Zubaydah was waterboarded at least 83 times and KSM at least 183 times , according to one Justice Department memo .
Bybee , whose memo gave legal cover for the initial use of waterboarding and nine other brutal interrogation methods , said his opinion – as assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel , which advises Presidents on the limits of their legal powers – represented “ our best reading of the law . ”
He cited scant history for the Convention Against Torture , which took effect in 1987 .
“ However , you should be aware that there are no cases construing this statute , just as there have been no prosecutions brought under it , ” Bybee wrote .
The Convention Against Torture makes it a crime for any “ person acting under the color of law ” to “ inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering ( other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions ) upon another person within his custody or physical control . ”
Texas Case
That law was not in existence when the Texas sheriff , James Parker , and his deputies were prosecuted and sentenced in the 1980s .
But Bybee , Bradbury and Yoo had a duty to their legal profession to cite the case as it would have changed the substance of their legal opinions , said Scott Horton , a human rights attorney and constitutional expert .
“ Any competent legal adviser would , among other things , have looked at the techniques themselves and checked to see how they have been treated in prior cases , ” Horton said in an e-mail .
“ Obviously the Anti-Torture Statute itself is a very recent invention and it has no enforcement history , so saying that and then suggesting on this basis that the situation is tabula rasa is highly disingenuous . ”
Horton suspects that Bybee , Yoo and Bradbury were well aware of the case law but simply chose to ignore it in order to give the Bush administration what it had asked for .
“ To take one example , there was a court - martial addressing the practice of waterboarding from 1903 , a state court case from the Twenties , a series of prosecutions at the [ post - World War II ] Tokyo Tribunal ( in many of which the death penalty was sought ) and another court - martial in 1968 , ” Horton said .
“ These precedents could have been revealed in just a few minutes of computerized research using the right search engines .
It 's hard to imagine that Yoo and Bybee did n't know them .
“ So why are none of these precedents mentioned ?
Obviously because each of them contradicts the memo 's conclusions and would have to be distinguished away .
Professional rules would have required that these precedents be cited , failing to do so reflects incompetent analysis . ”
In fact , the Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility investigated whether the three lawyers purposely twisted their legal advice to satisfy the White House and knowingly avoided citing existing case law in order to reach conclusions the White House wanted .
It ’s unknown what OPR has concluded about that point in its report , which is now being revised .
Beyond ignoring the case law on torture , Yoo , as a deputy assistant attorney general , pushed the theory that President Bush could not be bound by laws outlawing torture because of his constitutional authority to use military force at a time of war .
" As Commander in Chief , the President has the constitutional authority to order interrogations of enemy combatants to gain intelligence information concerning the military plans of the enemy , " said Yoo in another memo dated Aug. 1 , 2002 , and entitled “ Standards of Conduct for Interrogation . ”
In that opinion , Yoo failed to cite the key precedent relating to a President ’s war powers , Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , a 1952 Supreme Court case that addressed President Harry Truman ’s order to seize steel mills that had been shut down in a labor dispute during the Korean War .
Truman said the strike threatened national defense and thus justified his actions under his Article II powers in the Constitution .
But the Supreme Court overturned Truman ’s order , saying , “ the President 's power , if any , to issue the order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself . ”
Since Congress had n’t delegated such authority to Truman , the Supreme Court ruled that Truman ’s actions were unconstitutional , with an influential concurring opinion written by Justice Robert Jackson .
Yoo ’s Explanation
In his 2006 book , War by Other Means , Yoo offered up a defense of his failure to cite Youngstown .
“ We did n’t cite Jackson ’s individual views in Youngstown because earlier [ Office of Legal Counsel ] opinions , reaching across several administrations , had concluded that it had no application to the President ’s conduct of foreign affairs and national security . ”
Yoo added , “ Youngstown reached the outcome it did because the Constitution clearly gives Congress , not the President , the exclusive power to make law concerning labor disputes .
It does not address the scope of Commander - in - Chief power involving military strategy or intelligence tactics in war . …
“ Detention and interrogation policy are at the heart of the President ’s Commander - in - Chief power to wage war , and long constitutional history supports the President ’s leading role on such matters . ”
But Horton disagrees .
“ The Youngstown case is considered the lodestar precedent addressing the President 's invocation of Commander - in - Chief powers away from a battlefield , ” Horton told me via e-mail .
“ Justice Jackson 's opinion is the most persuasive of the opinions justifying the decision , ” Horton said .
“ If you examine any treatise on national security law , you 'll find them at the core .
Moreover , the Supreme Court itself in subsequent opinions has highlighted their importance .
“ It 's obvious that Yoo failed to cite them not because he believed they were off point ( as he rather lamely suggests ) , but because they strongly contradicted the premise he was articulating .
“ But a lawyer crafting an opinion has a duty of candor that requires that he identify and distinguish adverse precedent that a court might consider controlling .
In essence , Yoo was free to articulate whatever cockeyed theories he wanted .
He was not free to suppress the existence of Supreme Court authority that went in the opposite direction .
But that 's exactly what he did . ”
The four legal opinions released last week attempt to make the case that the “ enhanced interrogations ” of suspected terrorists needed to be done in order to save American lives and foil other plans to attack the United States .
In defending the Bush administration ’s torture program , Republicans have likened the “ high - value ” detainees to mass murderers who do n’t deserve to be treated humanely .
Texas Trial
At the trial of the Texas sheriff , Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Woodward said the prisoners who were subjected to waterboarding were not “ model citizens ” but they were still “ victims ” of torture .
“ We make no bones about it .
The victims of these crimes are criminals , ” Woodward said , according to a copy of the trial transcript .
One of the “ victims ” was Vernell Harkless , who was convicted of burglary in 1977 .
Gregg Magee , a deputy sheriff who testified against Sheriff Parker and three of the deputies said he witnessed Harkless being handcuffed to a chair by Parker and then getting “ the water treatment . ”
“ A towel was draped over his head , ” Magee said , according to court documents .
“ He was pulled back in the chair and water was poured over the towel . ”
Harkless said he thought he was “ going to be strangled to death , ” adding : “ I could n't breathe . ”
One of the defendants , Deputy Floyd Allen Baker , said during the trial that he thought torture to be an immoral act but he was unaware that it was illegal .
His attorneys cited the “ Nuremberg defense , ” that Baker was acting on orders from his superiors when he subjected prisoners to waterboarding .
That line of defense has come up in the current debate about whether CIA interrogators should be prosecuted for their roles in the torture of detainees .
President Obama , CIA Director Leon Panetta and Attorney General Eric Holder have ruled out prosecuting CIA interrogators who acted on Justice Department legal advice .
Some other legal analysts have suggested that the ambiguity of the Bush administration ’s decision process – in which CIA interrogators suggested the harsh tactics , national security officials , including Condoleezza Rice , concurred , and Justice Department lawyers gave their approval – would make getting 12 jurors to agree on a conviction difficult .
But the jury in the Baker ’s case did n’t buy the “ did n’t know it was illegal ” defense , convicting the deputy on three counts of civil rights and constitutional violations related to the waterboarding .
Bybee is now a federal judge on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
Yoo is a constitutional law professor at the University of California , Berkeley and a visiting professor at Chapman University in Orange , California .
Bradbury , who was acting head of the Office of Legal Counsel for most of Bush ’s second term , reportedly has been looking for a job since Bush left office on Jan. 20 , 2009 .

CIA Videos Predated Bush Legal Memo
The CIA began videotaping interrogations of two alleged “ high value ” terrorist detainees in April 2002 , four months before Bush administration attorneys issued a memo clearing the way for CIA interrogators to use “ enhanced interrogation techniques , ” the Justice Department disclosed in court documents .
Email
Printer friendly However ,
In a letter to a federal court judge Thursday , the Justice Department only agreed to provide details on the harshest interrogations of prisoner Abu Zubaydah that occurred in August 2002 – after the Bush administration 's lawyers had provided the legal cover for waterboarding and other brutal tactics .
That letter prompted ACLU lawyers to express concern over why the government offered no promises regarding the preceding months .
Amrit Singh , an ACLU staff attorney , said the government ’s “ motivations in confining its [ latest ] response to the month of August are highly suspect . ”
The ACLU is suing the CIA to release documents related to 92 interrogation videotapes that were destroyed by the CIA in 2005 as public attention began focusing on allegations that the Bush administration had subjected “ war on terror ” detainees to brutal interrogations that crossed the line into torture .
Lev Dassin , acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York , said the government intends to provide the civil liberties organization “ contemporaneous records that described the interrogations at issue … for the month of August 2002 ( approximately 65 documents ) . "
In a “ work plan ” laying out a timetable for processing documents for release , Dassin added that “ August 2002 was the month during which Abu Zubaydah was subjected to the most intensive interrogations . ”
Zubaydah , who is believed to have arranged travel for al - Qaeda operatives , was captured after a gun fight in Pakistan in March 2002 and was whisked away to a CIA “ black site ” prison on March 28 , 2002 .
In previous court filings , Dassin acknowledged that 12 videotapes showed Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , the alleged mastermind of the attack on the USS Cole in 2000 , being subjected to waterboarding and other harsh methods .
The 80 other videotapes purportedly show Zubaydah and al - Nashiri in their prison cells .
“ It seems like the letter provides no explanation for why records for other months should not be included in the government ’s work plan , ” the ACLU ’s Singh said in an interview .
“ We already know that an FBI agent who witnessed Abu Zubaydah ’s interrogation prior to August 2002 said he believed it to be ‘ borderline torture . ’”
FBI / CIA Dispute
Singh was referring to a Justice Department Inspector General report released last year about the FBI ’s role in harsh interrogations .
The report , prepared by Inspector General Glenn Fine , said two FBI agents , identified by the pseudonyms “ Thomas ” and “ Gibson , interviewed Zubaydah shortly after he was captured in March 2002 .
One of the agents even tended to Zubaydah ’s gunshot wounds .
The FBI claimed , according to Fine ’s report , that Zubaydah had provided valuable intelligence via “ rapport building ” interviews .
However , within a few days CIA interrogators intervened .
They claimed Zubaydah had been “ only providing ‘ throw - away information ’ ” and adopted more aggressive tactics .
When one of the FBI agents complained to the CIA interrogators about the brutal tactics , he was told the techniques were approved " at the highest levels " of government .
“ Thomas ” refused to participate and protested to senior FBI officials about the techniques the CIA used against Zubaydah .
According to Fine ’s report , “ Thomas ” did not see Zubaydah being waterboarded but witnessed other methods being used against him that he said were “ borderline torture . ”
Agent “ Thomas ’s ” complaints to the FBI eventually led Pasquale D'Amuro , the FBI ’s assistant director for counterterrorism , to remove the agents from the interrogations , according to Fine ’s report .
D’Amuro told Fine that he brought the agents ' complaints to FBI Director Robert Mueller and " stated that his exact words to Mueller were ' we do n't do that ' and that someday the FBI would be called to testify and he wanted to be able to say that the FBI did not participate in this type of activity . "
According to Fine ’s report , John Rizzo , the CIA ’s acting general counsel , refused to allow investigators from the Office of Inspector General to question Zubaydah in January 2007 .
Fine said Rizzo ’s refusal to allow investigators access to Zubaydah was “ unwarranted ” and “ hampered ” the probe .
Fine said Rizzo told the inspector general ’s office that he refused the request because Zubaydah " could make false allegations against CIA employees . ”
At the time of Fine ’s request , the International Committee of the Red Cross had obtained access to Zubaydah and 13 other “ high - value ” detainees and concluded that their treatment “ constituted torture . ”
The ICRC sent its report to Rizzo on Feb. 14 , 2007 .
However , neither the ICRC ’s report nor Fine ’s include specific dates about the “ enhanced ” techniques used against Zubaydah .
First Prisoner
Zubaydah told the ICRC that CIA interrogators said he was their first subject , " so no rules applied .
It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people . "
Zuhbaydah said he was repeatedly smashed against a wall , placed inside a black wooden box , and was waterboarded , a technique that creates the panicked reflex of drowning .
Rizzo also has been questioned about his role in the videotape destruction by John Durham , who was appointed special prosecutor last year by Attorney General Michael Mukasey to probe whether the destruction of the tapes constituted a crime .
Last week , Durham questioned the CIA ’s former number three official , Kyle “ Dusty ” Foggo , about the destruction of the tapes .
Foggo , who was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud for steering lucrative contracts to a friend , was due to report to federal prison last week but Durham asked for a delay so he could question him about the tape destruction .
Singh , the ACLU attorney , said Friday she could not speculate whether videotapes made prior to August 2002 might have depicted “ enhanced ” methods such as waterboarding .
Those techniques were cleared for use by an Aug.
1 , 2002 , legal opinion that narrowly defined torture , thus enabling the Bush administration to claim that its harsh tactics did n’t qualify as torture .
Last year , Dick Cheney admitted in several interviews that he “ signed off ” on the waterboarding of three “ high - value ” prisoners and personally approved the harsh interrogations of 33 other detainees .
Cheney identified the three waterboarded detainees as al - Qaeda figures Abu Zubaydah , al Nashiri and Khalid Sheik Mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks .
“ That 's it , those three guys , ” Cheney said in an interview with the right - wing Washington Times last December .
“ There are questions as to who was authorizing what for the CIA before August , ” Singh said .
“ Those facts need to be made public and that ’s why we need to have an investigation . ”

( CNN ) -- A U.S. warship arrived before dawn Thursday near a 28 - foot lifeboat holding four pirates and the kidnapped captain of a U.S. - flagged cargo ship , officials said .
The USS Bainbridge , a guided - missile destroyer , is heading to the area to assist .
Also nearby was the Maersk Alabama -- which had been seized early Wednesday off the Horn of Africa .
All 20 of its remaining crew members were in good physical shape , said Ken Quinn , second officer of the ship , in a satellite call placed by CNN .
" There 's four Somali pirates , and they 've got our captain , " Quinn said .
Maersk spokesman Kevin Speers said the guided - missile destroyer USS Bainbridge was near the Maersk Alabama and that its crew was talking to the Navy .
" When the Navy comes in , they 're in charge , " Speers told CNN .
The hijackers boarded the Maersk Alabama early Wednesday , when it was about 350 miles off the coast of Somalia , a haven for pirates attacking shipping through the Gulf of Aden .
Capt .
Richard Phillips was being held in the lifeboat after the pirates reneged on their agreement to exchange him for one of their own , who himself had been captured by the crew members , Quinn said .
" We returned him , but they did n't return the captain , " said Quinn , who added that the crew members were in radio contact with Phillips .
Quinn describes the hijacking to CNN »
By 8 p.m. , the Bainbridge , part of the allied fleet that patrols the waterway , had reached the Maersk Alabama to assist , a senior Defense Department official said .
A Navy plane had reached the area an hour before .
B.J. Talley , a spokesman for the Maersk line , said the ship was about 215 nautical miles off the Somali coast at 7 p.m. ET .
The 780 - foot ( 237 - meter ) Maersk Alabama is the first U.S. ship to be seized in the latest wave of piracy off largely lawless Somalia .
Joe Murphy , whose son
Shane is the ship 's first officer , called the hijacking " a wake - up call for America . "
" They 're making more money in piracy than the gross national product of Somalia , so it 's not going to go away any time soon until there 's international concern and international law enforcement , " said Murphy , an instructor at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy .
The Gulf of Aden , at the southern mouth of the Red Sea , is a key transit point for ships moving into or out of the Suez Canal .
In 2008 , Somalia - based pirates attacked more than 100 ships in the gulf or off the Horn of Africa , capturing about 40 of them .
The ships and their crews typically are held for ransom .
Since 2006 , the United States has had an agreement with Kenya to try captured pirates with American assistance .
Tom Fuentes , a former FBI official who worked with Kenyan authorities to prosecute pirates , said a 1988 treaty gives every nation the authority to pursue , capture and try pirates , regardless of the nationality of the victims -- but the United States can't tell shipping companies how to deal with hijackings , he said .
" Every shipping company so far has paid the ransom , and every victim has been released unharmed up until this point , " he said .
After a lull early this year , attacks surged again in March , with 15 attacks reported to the Malaysia - based International Maritime Bureau , which tracks piracy .
An international task force under U.S. command was set up in January to crack down on the problem , and the European Union , India , China and Russia have ships deployed to the area as well .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Wednesday for more international cooperation during an appearance with Moroccan Foreign Minister Taib Fassi-Fihri .
" I think Morocco was the very first country that recognized us , going back a long time , " Clinton said .
" We worked to end piracy off the coast of Morocco all those years ago , and we are going to work together to end that kind of criminal activity anywhere on the high seas . "
Watch Clinton comment on attack »
The Maersk Alabama was carrying food aid bound for the Kenyan port of Mombasa when it was seized about 7:30 a.m. ( 12:30 a.m. ET ) , the ship 's owner said .
There were 21 American crew members on board at the time .
Watch officer 's wife comment on the attack »
Quinn said the pirates were armed with AK - 47 assault rifles , while the freighter 's crew carried no weapons .
The crew -- apparently minus the captain -- locked themselves in the compartment that contains the ship 's steering gear , where they remained for about 12 hours with their captive , whom Quinn said they had tied up .
The three other pirates " got frustrated because they could n't find us , " he said .
The pirates had scuttled the small boat they used once they climbed aboard the freighter , Quinn said , so Phillips offered them the Alabama 's 28 - foot lifeboat and some money .
John Reinhart , CEO and president of Norfolk , Virginia - based Maersk Line Ltd. , said the crew can try to outrun the pirate boats or turn fire hoses on anyone trying to board the ship , " but we do not carry arms . "
The vessel was carrying relief supplies for USAID , the U.N. World Food Program and the Christian charities WorldVision and Catholic Relief Services .
The U.N. agency said its portion of the cargo included nearly 4,100 metric tons of corn-soya blend bound for Somalia and Uganda , and another 990 metric tons of vegetable oil for refugees in Kenya .
" There are starving people in Africa who need this food , " Reinhart said .
CNN 's Tom Watkins , Charley Keyes , Mike Mount , Rachel Streitfeld and Jason Carroll contributed to this report .

The goal , say biologists , is to perfect methods that could be used around the world to rescue reefs endangered by overfishing , pollution and global warming .
They say they are using the Sekisei Lagoon Reef , which is named after the broad , shallow lagoon that it created , as a test bed for new techniques that they hope will one day make transplanting coral in the sea as routine as raising tree saplings on land .
“ We have been replanting forests for 4,000 years , but we are only just now learning how to revive a coral reef , ” said Mineo Okamoto , a marine biologist at Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology , who has led development of the palm - size ceramic discs .
“ We finally have the technology . ”
Critics , however , say the project might be wasted effort .
They say transplanting is futile without addressing the problems that caused the reefs to deteriorate in the first place , like coastal redevelopment and chemical runoff from terrestrial agriculture .
There is also the bigger problem of rising ocean water temperatures , for which there may be no easy fix .
" All - natural " shampoo .
" Planet - friendly " glass cleaner .
" BPA - free " baby bottles .
The labels on 98 per cent of those good - for - the - earth - and - your - body items you fill your shopping basket with are lying , a new study shows .
Of the more than 2,000 self - described environmentally friendly products in North America examined by the environmental marketing firm TerraChoice , only 25 were found to be indisputably " sin free . "
The rest were greenwashing , a term environmentalists coined to refer to misleading environmental ads or claims .
" There are dramatically more green products this year than the last , " said Scott McDougall , president of TerraChoice , the private company contracted by Environment Canada to oversee its EcoLogo certification program .
" But greenwashing is unfortunately more rampant , and it's changing . "
A new trend involves companies suggesting they have obtained third - party certification , usually by marking a product with an official - looking stamp that includes language such as " eco-safe . "
Greenwashing is especially prevalent in the promotion of cleaning products , cosmetics and children 's toys and products , McDougall said .
Of particular concern to parents of young children will be this :
All products the group found claiming to be " bisphenol - A free " also appear to be greenwashing .
That 's because there is no international certification program verifying company claims that their plastic products do n't contain the chemical , which in the human body can act like the hormone estrogen and has been linked to cancer and infertility .
BPA has been found in hard plastic materials , including baby bottles .
The federal government introduced legislation to ban baby bottles containing it last year .
But , of the companies producing self - proclaimed " BPA - free " products found in 12 large Ottawa stores , TerraChoice could n't find any indication they had verified their claims with an independent lab , McDougall said .
" We do n't have information to know if it 's true .
It asks a lot of parents to simply trust their claim , " said McDougall .
The president of BornFree Canada , creators of the first " bisphenol - A " free bottle to hit Canadian shelves , said the company 's baby bottles have indeed been independently tested and proven to be free of the chemical .
But it has n't released the results publicly .
" It is not an industry standard for manufacturers to publicize these studies because they would be very difficult to interpret and understand , " said Tony Ferraro .
The Competition Bureau of Canada set out new guidelines for environmental claims last year , but gave industry a year to bring advertisements and labels in line .
The guidelines state that environmental claims " shall be accurate and not misleading " and " shall be substantiated and verified . "
But that verification does n't need to come from a third party , said Dominy McClellan , a senior investigator with the bureau .
" They need to provide adequate and proper testing under the act .
You can't assume third - party certification is more adequate or proper . "
McDougall 's firm condensed the guidelines into a " six sins of greenwashing " checklist for consumers .
A seventh , the " worshipping false labels " refers to the fact some marketers are mimicking third - party environmental certifications on their products to draw consumers .
In Canada , most transgressions fell into three categories : lack of proof , vague language or " hidden trade - offs " – the practice of emphasizing a product 's green aspects while concealing others that are environmentally damaging .

Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Mohammed Ajmal Amir alias Kasab , the lone surviving Mumbai attacker , was shifted to a bomb - proof prison cell in the highly secured Arthur Road jail in Mumbai Friday night in the wake of threats to his life , a senior Indian Home Ministry official said Saturday .
" Kasab was shifted to the isolated bomb - proof cell late yesterday night which was specially built for him .
He is currently being guarded for 24 hours by elite Indian commandos .
All these have been done after Indian intelligence agencies intercepted threats to his life from elements operating from Pakistani soil , " the official said on condition of anonymity .
He said that except for the over 11,000 - page charge sheet , Kasab has nothing in his cell .
" Kasab has asked for newspapers but the special court trying him is yet to decide on his request .
Once the court resumes the trial in a couple of days , the judge would take a decision on his request , " he said .
Besides a number of accused , Kasab has been charged for waging war against the state among other crimes for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attacks on Nov. 26 last year .
The Mumbai attacks claimed the lives of over 170 people , including foreign nationals , and injured hundreds from Nov. 26 to 29 last year .

He is an enigma from the world ’s most secretive state , a behind - the - scenes political operative known mostly as a trusted brother - in - law to North Korean strongman Kim Jong Il .
But Jang Song
Taek has recently emerged as a decisive player in the drama of who might succeed the ailing 67 - year - old Kim in a country that remains defiant in the face of international pressure to dismantle its nuclear arsenal .
Looking weak following a suspected stroke in August , Kim last week publicly anointed Jang as his second in charge , analysts say , naming him to the powerful National Defense Commission .
Pyongyang watchers are divided about the move ’s significance .
Some say Jang could assume power if Kim dies or is incapacitated , while others insist he would merely become the regime ’s caretaker , ensuring an orderly succession of power to one of Kim ’s three sons .
“ North Korea is a Confucian society wedded to clan and tribe .
Kim Jong
Il believes only blood clan can continue the dynasty -- and that means one of his three sons , ” said Jang Sung - min , author of the book “ War and Peace : Where Is North Korea Headed After Kim Jong-il ? ”
“ But if Kim is incapacitated and does not prepare carefully for his sons , Jang may try to take advantage and seize power . ”
Jang , 63 , has recently accompanied Kim on numerous military and facilities inspections , South Korean officials say .
He also reportedly made a secret trip to Europe in March , presumably to visit doctors who treated Kim ’s suspected stroke .
Analysts are now scrambling to update Jang ’s diplomatic dossier as a career North Korean technocrat who in 2004 was mysteriously purged from the party power structure , only to return to Pyongyang ’s political scene 18 months later .
“ Jang is a classic political operative , and something of a chameleon , able to switch loyalties on a dime , ” said Balbina Hwang , a security expert at National Defense University in Washington .
“ He may accrue a great deal of power by allying himself with whichever son eventually succeeds to the throne , but he will be behind the scenes . ”
Gaining intelligence -- including a Jang biography -- from inside reclusive North Korea has often been guesswork , analysts say .
“ There is very little credible information , no Pyongyang tabloids to ferret out the juicy details like stories about Princess Diana , ” said Andrei Lankov , a political scientist at Seoul ’s Kookmin University who specializes in North Korean history .
“ It ’s all a matter of rumors .
North Koreans are very careful about discussing issues of succession and political leadership .
Most information comes through intermediaries and the quality is often bad , in many cases pure invention just to sell newspapers . ”
Yet Lankov believes Jang is clearly on the rise .
“ They seem to be hedging their bets that Kim wo n’t survive much longer , ” he said .
“ He certainly looks unhealthy . ”
Analysts say that Jang ’s life and career within North Korea have been marked by luck , family connections and political acumen .
Born in 1946 , he reportedly studied abroad in Moscow and was educated at Pyongyang ’s elite Kim Il Sung University .
He began his career in the early 1970s as an economic specialist and has spent the last three decades as a top - level administrator holding various posts in the Workers ’ Party .
He has overseen the military and secret police and public labor and more recently has pushed to establish economic zones with China .
“ He has always been a pure bureaucrat , an economic management specialist , ” said Lankov .
“ Today he ’s running a railway and tomorrow he ’s torturing political dissenters . ”
Author Jang Sung - min said his research relied on his experiences as an aide to former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung .
In 2000 , Kim arranged a historic inter-Korean summit with Kim Jong Il , for which he later won the Nobel Peace Prize .
Jang Song Taek met Kim Jong
Il ’s younger sister , Kyong Hui , while both were students at Kim Il Sung University .
“ Jang was charming and handsome .
He played the accordion , harmonica and guitar .
She fell in love with him , ” the author said .
But the story brought a North Korean twist to the Romeo and Juliet tale .
Kim Il Sung disapproved of his daughter ’s relationship and had Jang moved to another university .
According to a story in the South Korean JoongAng Ilbo newspaper , the fiery Kyong Hui drove her Mercedes two hours to meet with Jang .
The two were later married .
Both were 26 .
Now part of the Kim clan , Jang wielded clout within the regime , especially after Kim Jong Il replaced his late father in 1998 .
Jang ’s influence lasted several years before he was suddenly placed under house arrest in 2004 .
Jang had allegedly become enemies with Kim Jong
Il ’s second wife , Ko Young Hee , who believed he was scheming for power behind her husband ’s back .
“ She had Kim ’s ear , ” author Jang Sung - min said .
“ She made sure that her rival was taken out of commission until after she died of cancer in 2004 . ”
He was released a year later .
Others say Kim was threatened by Jang and banished him to pacify political elites in Pyongyang , adding that Jang ’s wife played a decisive role in her husband ’s return to power .
Jang soon repaired his reputation within the party .
But the family endured tragedy when the couple ’s only daughter , Geum Song , committed suicide in Paris in 2006 .
Analysts say she had wanted to marry a foreigner against her parents ’ will .
The resilient Jang Song
Taek is poised to make his biggest political mark yet on his native North Korea , analysts say .
Jang has good relations with all of Kim ’s three sons and has overseen their educations , experts say .
He is believed to back the youngest , 26 - year - old Jong Un , as Kim ’s successor .
“ He may think it is the only way to sustain his power , ” said Cheong Seong - chang , director of the Inter - Korean Relations Studies Program at the Sejong Institute .
“ If he gives Kim Jong Un a boost as the successor , he would . . . play a role as a guardian . ”
Despite Jang ’s slim chances of running the nation , some experts wonder what kind of ruler he would make .
“ He is a smart man with rationality and reason , ” said Jang Sung - min .
“ Who knows , if he took over for Kim , he might take North Korea in a totally different direction . ”

Trivia
After the release of this film , Franchise Pictures was in deep trouble .
Their package of films -- this one , Get Carter , The Art of War , 3000 Miles to Graceland , Angel Eyes , Heist , City By The Sea and Spartan -- were box office failures .
The only films to have any success were The Whole Nine Yards and The Boondock Saints , whose real success came only after being released on home video .
There were major problems with Andrew Stevens and Elie Samaha in regards to the firm 's finances , along with the other investors involved ( the bank that had loaned Samaha the investment capital had given the firm $ 500 million as startup capital for the films ) .
Stevens was not a part of this but Samaha was deeply involved with the fraud committed by these investors , which led to a major lawsuit .
In 2004 Franchise was ordered by the US courts to pay $ 121 million in restitution , and Samaha was personally responsible for $ 77 million in damages for fraudulently overestimating the budget for all their film projects .

Suit : Shell complicit in execution of Nigerian rights activist Stephen C. Webster
Published : Wednesday April 8 , 2009
Print This Email
This A landmark human rights lawsuit , accusing Royal Dutch Shell of complicity in the execution of author and human rights activist Ken Saro - Wiwa some 14 years ago , will proceed to trial in a New York courtroom .
The Center for Constitutional Rights and Earth Rights International , along with Mr. Wiwa 's son , allege the International oil company " financed , armed , and otherwise colluded with the Nigerian military forces that used deadly force and conducted massive , brutal raids against the Ogoni people of the Niger Delta . "
They claim Shell was complicit in the 1995 military executions of nine activist leaders , including Ken Saro - Wiwa .
" Shell began oil production in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria in 1958 , " the groups say on a new Web site dedicated to promoting the suit .
" After more than 30 years of environmental devastation and exploitation by Shell , a popular nonviolent movement of the Ogoni people developed in the early 1990s in opposition to its presence in the region .
At the request of Shell , and with Shells assistance and financing , Nigerian soldiers used deadly force and massive , brutal raids against the Ogoni people throughout the early 1990s to repress the growing movement against the oil company . "
" Ken Saro - Wiwa , with eight other Ogoni rights activists , was executed by Nigeria 's military dictatorship in 1995 , " reported the Guardian .
" The men were a constant irritant to the generals , reminding the world that their lands in the Niger Delta were being wrecked and their health and livelihoods destroyed by gas flaring , oil spills and military attacks .
Imprisonment and beatings failed to shut them up .
So the government constructed false charges against these men , paid people to pose as witnesses and hanged them . "
" The suit says the company tried to bribe two men to testify against Saro - Wiwa at his trial before a special tribunal , " reported the Financial Times .
" ' Almost daily you get a reminder that your father was hanged for a crime he did n't commit , ' Mr Saro - Wiwa Jr told the Financial Times .
' We 've always maintained that Shell was complicit in the conspiracy to silence my father and thousands of other Ogonis . '
" Shell says the allegations contained in the case are false and that the company appealed for clemency for Saro - Wiwa .
' We in no way encouraged or advocated any acts of violence against Ken Saro - Wiwa or the other Ogonis , ' said Rainer Winzenried , a Shell spokesman .
' We believe that the evidence will show clearly that Shell was not responsible for these tragic events . ' "
" Shell accounts for more than 40 % of Nigeria 's total petroleum production of 899,000 barrels per day from more than eighty fields , " noted Persian network PressTV .
" Oil revenues account for 90 % of Nigerian export earnings and 80 % of the government 's total revenue .
Shell accounts for just over half of Nigeria 's total production . "
Chief Judge Kimba Wood of the Southern District of New York ordered the trial to go forward May 26 .
" Shell could be forced to pay millions of dollars in damages if found responsible in the case that was first filed in 1996 by the family of Saro - Wiwa , an environmentalist and author , " reported Reuters .

For long - term relationships , like often seeks like .
Pretty Woman fantasies aside , husbands and wives tend to have similar socioeconomic status , education level and intelligence , and religious background .
It turns out they also tend to look alike — or at least choose mates who resemble their opposite - sex parent .
As described in BLONDES , studies have found that women go for men who resemble their fathers ( unless they do n’t like their dads ) and men go for women with certain features of their moms .
Freud called this sexual imprinting .
Evolutionary psychologists call it assortative mating , meaning that people look for long - term mates with the ideal balance of genes that are like and unlike their own .
And the evidence is mounting .
Another study has confirmed that people do pick partners that look significantly like their opposite - sex parent ( but not the same - sex parent ) when compared to the general population .
Psychologist Tamas Bereczkei and his colleagues at the University of Pecs in Hungary measured fourteen facial proportions — the width , height , and length of eyes , noses , jaws , and other features — of more hundreds of couples , their partners , and parents . [*]
And here ’s the interesting part : men and women home in on particular parent - resembling features .
It ’s not necessarily the whole face that counts .
Men pay attention to the lower half of a woman ’s face .
That is , a guy ’s partner is likely to have his mom ’s proportions of lip fullness / width , mouth width / face width , jaw length / face length , and jaw width / face width .
They also go for an overall facial shape that is similar to their mother’s .
Women , meanwhile , zero in on the center of men ’s faces .
A gal ’s partner is likely to have her dad ’s proportions of mouth - brow distance / face height , distance between pupils / face width , eye width / face width , eye width / face width , distance between the inner eye corners / face width , nose length / face height , and nose width / face width .
Why is it that men go for Mom ’s jaw and mouth while women go for Dad ’s nose , eyes , and cheekbones ?
The researchers speculate that it has to do with how men and women process visual information differently .
Women pay attention to center of men ’s faces because those features are distinctive and stable over time .
Facial hair may come and go , but eyes , noses , and cheeks stay the same .
Men by default pay most attention to the lower half of the face because that region is most sensitive to sex hormones .
Lip fullness , jaw size , and overall facial shape are cues of estrogen and testosterone levels .
Of course , Dad ’s nose and Mom ’s lips might not be considered optimally attractive .
But for long - term relationships , lust is just one part of the equation .
Everything in proportion …
* A kind reader brought to my attention an article reporting that Bereckzei ’s study , published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B , was recently retracted .
Another scientist noticed discrepancies in the data that , for instance , found a correlation of 92.8 percent between the jaw width of a man ’s mother and his mate .
Bereckzei admitted that an error was made , but that the results are still very strong ( a 70 percent correlation in jaw width ) after he fixed the errors .
It will be interesting to see if the paper is republished after the data are re-crunched .
The Federal Government has unveiled the first all - electric car that has been certified to run on Australian roads .
The plug - in car made by Mitsubushi , called the iMiEV , can travel 160 kilometres on a seven - hour charge and has a top speed of 130 kilometres per hour .
The car runs on a bank of lithium ion batteries .
The engine uses no petrol and does not produce any greenhouse gas emissions .
The Transport Minister , Anthony Albanese took the car for a test drive in Melbourne today .
He says the car should start rolling off production lines soon .
" I understand that it 's Mitsubishi 's intention to be producing this vehicle on a large scale from June of this year , " he said .
" And I think for many Australians , this will have great appeal .
It 's particularly appropriate for use around city driving . "
Mr Albanese says the car has met Australia 's stringent design rules .
" We have 83 hoops that cars have to get over , because we want to ensure that the safety of motorists , passengers , and indeed pedestrians is paramount , " he said .
" With this vehicle , it satisfies all of those requirements . "
It is not clear whether the model will be sold in Australia and the company is not saying how much the car will cost .
Project engineer Ashley Saunders says the car is in the feasibility testing stage and the company is trying to gauge consumer interest .
" Technology 's expensive but it always is when you 're introducing new technology , " he said .
" We expect over time the price of the technology will come down as you get economies of scale in production phase . "
Mr Albanese says it is unlikely the government would provide incentives for the project .
" This is a commercial operation by Mitsubishi and certainly in terms of its position at the moment , the government does n't have plans to go along that route , " he said .
The first 2,000 are expected to roll off the assembly line towards the end of the year .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The outbreak of a flu virus that has led to a U.S. public health emergency highlights the need for a strong government commitment to scientific research , President Barack Obama said on Monday .
During remarks on science and technology that covered topics from climate change to the public - school curriculum , Obama set a goal of devoting 3 percent of gross domestic product to scientific research .
“ If there was ever a day that reminded us of our shared stake in science and research , it ’s today , ” Obama said in a speech to the National Academy of Sciences , a society of scientists and engineers who give advice to U.S. policymakers .
“ Our capacity to deal with a public health challenge of this sort rests heavily on the work of our scientific and medical community , ” Obama said .
“ And this is one more example of why we can not allow our nation to fall behind . ”
Obama said that U.S. cases of swine flu were “ not a cause for alarm ” but the administration was monitoring them closely .
The administration said its declaration of a public health emergency was precautionary .
The flu has killed 149 people in Mexico and spread to North America and Europe .
Though no one outside of Mexico has died , pandemic fears have been raised .
Obama invoked the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the 1950s and 1960s as an example of the importance of a major investment in research , and said science spending as a share of GDP has declined since that “ high water mark . ”

Through the goal of spending more than 3 percent of GDP on science , “ we will not just meet , but we will exceed the level achieved at the height of the space race , ” Obama said .
The goal refers to public and private spending .
The United States now spends 2.66 percent of gross domestic product on research and development , according to the White House .
Some of the increased spending is included in the $ 787 billion economic stimulus package that Obama signed in February .
In his proposed fiscal 2010 budget , Obama called for making permanent tax credits for business investment in research and development .
The science speech comes as the White House is trying to highlight Obama ’s accomplishments with the approach of the 100 - day mark for his presidency on Wednesday .
He also touted his proposals to tackle global climate change , which face a fight in the U.S. Congress , saying it was “ this generation ’s challenge to break our dependence on fossil fuels . ”
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The administration on Monday also opened a two - day meeting of major world economies on climate change .
Obama wants to cut U.S. emissions by roughly 15 percent by 2020 -- back to 1990 levels -- mostly through a cap - and - trade system that limits how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases big factories can emit .
That proposal is at the heart of a bill under consideration in Congress .
Republicans have criticized the cap - and - trade system as a backhanded energy tax .
Some moderate Democrats are also worried about the impact of the plan on jobs and the economy .
A couple of days ago , I recorded an interview with Dan Povenmire and Jeff " Swampy " Marsh , the creators of Phineas and Ferb .
We 'll be publishing that interview next week , but , as a ( sort of ) teaser , I wanted to share with you a video I came across while doing research for it .
Povenmire made it a few years ago on a whim , which is why I found it , even though it 's unrelated to the cartoon .
It 's only a minute long , and it 's very funny .
I should warn you , I suppose , that it does contain crude humor , but the crudity is of the sort that virtually every male between the ages of five and fifteen ( and many who are older ) finds hysterical .
You 'll get the idea from the video 's title : " Use the Fart . "
( I did ask Povenmire about the video in the interview , for anyone who wants to know more about it . )
Australian health authorities are bracing for an outbreak of the swine flu which has killed more than 80 people in Mexico and is currently spreading throughout the world .
The new strain of swine flu has spread to the United States and Canada after killling more than 80 people in Mexico and there are also suspected cases in New Zealand , Europe , the Middle East and Asia .
This morning two people who recently travelled to Mexico were cleared of having the virus in New South Wales , but an Australian virologist is warning that it is " almost inevitable " that the virus will reach Australia .
With no cases yet confirmed in Australia , federal health authorities say they are ready to implement containment procedures at international borders if needed .
What concerns experts about this latest virus is that it is a combination of human , avian and swine strains , and that it passes so easily between humans .
Virologist Alan Hampson is regarded as one of Australia 's top experts on influenza viruses .
" The virus is related to viruses that we 've had in the human population since 1977 , in terms of being the same sub - type of influenza A , so it 's an H1 virus , " he said .
" It 's not dramatically different in the same way as the avian H5 influenza virus is .
" But clearly it is sufficiently different to be able to readily infect people and probably overcome existing immunity to existing H1 viruses . "
Another virologist , Professor Ian Gust , says it is almost inevitable that the swine flu will reach Australia .
" I think it has the potential to spread throughout the world , that is to cause a pandemic .
It 's a novel strain that the majority of the population have no immunity to , and it clearly has the capacity to spread from person to person , " he said .
The virus now appears to have crossed at least two oceans , with suspected cases turning up in the UK , France and New Zealand .
In New Zealand , tests are expected to show that schoolchildren picked up the virus while on a trip to Mexico .
The Greens want screening procedures put in place for arrivals at international airports , but Dr Hampson says this is not as easy as it sounds .
" It 's very hard to screen for influenza coming into the country , because what we do know is that people can be infected and not show the signs of disease in the early stages , but can be spreading the disease now , " he said .
Dr Ian Barr , from the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) Influenza Centre in Melbourne , says it is not yet the time to panic but that the outbreak is worrying .
And Dr Barr says it is unlikely any existing vaccines will be effective against this new strain .
" That remains to be seen , " he said .
" Authorities will be looking at that and testing , people here , from people who 've been vaccinated with the current H1N strain , but it 's likely that there 'll be no or very little cross reaction , I suspect . "
" In the initial reports from the US from the CDC [ Centres for Disease and Prevention ] ... their seven strains of their swine influenza are all susceptible to the influenza drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza .
" They were n't susceptible to the older class of drugs , the adamantanes . "
Australian health authorities say they are ready to implement containment procedures at the nation 's borders to stop the spread of the virus .
Australia 's chief medical officer , Jim Bishop , has written to hospital emergency departments and general practitioners to warn them about the virus and what symptoms to look for in patients .
And Professor Bishop is also urging anybody who has just returned from the US or Mexico to see their doctor .
The president of the Australian Medical Association , Rosanna Capolingua , says the new virus poses a serious risk .
However , she says the health system is well prepared to deal with it .
" There 's certainly communication networks , " Dr Capolingua said .
" There is a store of Tamiflu , the anti-viral agent , that 's been kept in Australia as well .
" There 's been suggestions of fever tents , how to decamp patients from primary care into isolation areas , how the hospitals would cope .
" There 's been quite a lot of planning done in the past , and preparation for any of these sorts of circumstances . "
This scam starts with a " cars & trucks for sale " ad on Craigslist .
Scammers try hooking suckers with popular almost - new cars and desireable vintage models .
Unfortunately , I forgot to grab a screenshot of the original Craigslist ad , a 2007 Acura MDX selling for $ 4,750 .
Here , in its place is a different " too good to be true " ad , for a Mustang .
In addition to the super - low price , note that there is no phone number or license plates in the photographs .
Also , the email address is in the body of the ad and it is a free email address such as @live.com , @yahoo.com , or @gmail.com .
If you write in , you get a long explanation about how perfect the car is and that it is unavailable for viewing before the sale .
Also , eBay gets dragged into the scam , even though eBay and craigslist have nothing to do with one another .
eBay does not offer escrow services outside of sales on eBay , and everything that has ever been sold on eBay has an item number .
My favorite bit of these is how many different ways they try to assure you that everything is protected and guaranteed and paid for by the seller .
Really ? ,
You are just volunteering to ship it to me from Republic , Missouri for free ?
The Dependable Auto Shipper site says that such a move will cost a minimum of $ 801 .
I announce you that this is n't really eBay .
It is a mock - up of a few pages of eBay hosted on cgi3byme.com .
Here is the first page , complete with photos and Nicole 's phony ebay alias .
Many of the eBay links do n't work , but some do link to the real eBay .
Again , the page is chock - full of purchase - protection guarantees .
... and hilarious grammar .
Remember , you can buy whatever you want on Faux - eBay , so I bought this $ 4,750 SUV .
Clicking Commit to Buy brought me to this form with a rather impressive illustration .
The illustration and page described in detail how I was not going to get ripped off .
A moment later , I get a follow - up email from a second fake eBay ( buyer - protection - support.com ) .
A second email from buyer - protection - support.com stated that it was from eBay from a seller on Craigslist .
Just to mix it up , this email has an html attachment , which looks like an eBay invoice , assigning agent David Thayler to personally oversee the legitimate and lawful trade of cash for Acura .
To complete payment , you need to go with cash at the nearest Money Gram Agent location in your area and transfer the funds to our eBay Agent .
The process only takes several minutes , it 's easy to deal with and 100 % secure .
Money Gram Money
Transfer is the only service that has ultimate authentication of the identity of the receiver of funds .
Several IDs and utility bills are required before the funds are paid .
Therefore , no one else can pick up the money .
Now , you might think it is odd that this David Thaler character receives the payment in his own name and has his own home address on this eBay invoice .
Do n't worry .
He does n't really live there .
From this point , the story ends .
Sending money to someone through MoneyGram is a one - way , untraceable event .
MoneyGram is far from being " A service that has ultimate authentication of the identity of the receiver of funds " .
To pick up money from a MoneyGram location , the recipient needs only one photo ID , such as a driver 's license , a military ID or a passport , not " Several IDs and utility bills " .
A Social Security number is required when more than $ 3,000 is being picked up , but not an actual SS card .
Curiously , you can't send more than $ 499 to Arizona .
Tracking your Money Gram
You can register with MoneyGram Rewards to get an email alert indicating when they pick it up , but you wo n't know where they picked it up .
Not even which state they were in .
They can not pick it up in a country other than the one you specify .
From the real MoneyGram site :

Europe 's ' Special Interrogations ' New Evidence of Torture Prison in Poland
The current debate in the US on the " special interrogation methods " sanctioned by the Bush administration could soon reach Europe .
It has long been clear that the CIA used the Szymany military airbase in Poland for extraordinary renditions .
Now there is evidence of a secret prison nearby .

Nonprofits are seeing an alarming drop in funding and increased demand for help this year , setting the stage for a complete shakeup of the sector in 2010 .
Unlike recessions past , this one could permanently alter the nonprofit landscape , say nonprofit CEOs , forcing possible closures and mergers as the sector restructures to survive .
Hardest hit will be the Bay Area , home to one of the highest concentrations of nonprofits in the nation .
There are 25,000 nonprofits in the region ; 7,000 in San Francisco alone .
Among them are 10,000 charitable nonprofits with budgets above $ 25,000 .
Their combined budgets account for 14 percent of the Bay Area 's gross national product - twice the national average .
Many are teetering .
" A lot of nonprofits are living on this year 's operating budget , which is based on what they raised a year ago before the economic crisis really hit , " said Denise Gammal , co-author of a Stanford University report on Bay Area charities and vice president of strategy and organizational Learning for United Way of the Bay Area .
" Although nonprofits will be OK this year , the next two years will be difficult to weather .
That 's when the state cuts will have a significant impact , " she said .
A survey of nearly 300 Bay Area nonprofits conducted in October by United Way of the Bay Area found widespread worry .
While 70 percent reported increased demand for services , nearly half said they could n't meet it .
Revenue decreases were reported by 65 percent of nonprofits , forcing 23 percent to lay off staff .
When asked if they are optimistic about 2009 , only 59 percent of nonprofit CEOs said yes , compared with 92 percent in 2007 .
In her own unofficial survey , Laura Escobar , who disburses $ 3 million in federal housing grants to Bay Area charities for the United Way , discovered the requests for funds totaled a record $ 1 million above what she had available to pass out this year .
Nonprofits are resorting to drastic public pleas for help .
Christine Burroughs , who provides shelter to 24,000 homeless people in Silicon Valley as CEO of InnVision , put out a call to the community for $ 500,000 to keep her budget from going into the red .
" I feel we 'll get through the fiscal year that ends June 30 , but my big concern is what to do after that , " she said .
" We 're learning of hundreds of thousands in cuts in our funding . "
A huge shortfall
Half of InnVision 's funding comes from private donors , 37 percent from government , and the rest from program fees .
Burroughs already laid off a few workers , instituted salary cuts and reduced beds at her Menlo Park shelter from 100 to 60 to save money .
Still , her agency has a $ 500,000 shortfall in its $ 11 million operating budget for the 2009 fiscal year .
Burroughs worries she may have to shut down the Menlo Park shelter .
" It 's painful to watch this erode , but nonprofits are going to have to change their paradigm and figure out how to compete together for what little funding is left , " she said .
Funding is drying up on all fronts .
Individual donors , dealing with their own financial woes , are not giving .
Governments , socked by property tax losses , have eliminated funding .
Large philanthropic foundations have scaled back as the stock market has eroded an average 30 percent of their endowments .
The Chronicle of Philanthropy , the leading newspaper of the nonprofit world , surveyed 73 of the nation 's largest foundations in December about their 2009 grant making plans and found 39 percent expect to decrease the amount they contribute to charities this year .
Giving more
In hard times , sometimes funders do the opposite - give more .
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the largest in the world with assets estimated at $ 30 billion , plans to raise its giving from $ 3.3 billion in 2008 to $ 3.8 billion in 2009 to help charities survive .
The San Francisco Foundation plans to give the same amount to charities that it did last year , despite a shrinking endowment .
One of the nation 's largest community foundations , the San Francisco Foundation saw its assets decline by 21 percent in 2008 .
It 's valued today at $ 865 million .
It doled out $ 46.6 million in grants over the last six months of 2008 , an 11 percent drop from the same period in 2007 .
CEO Sandra Hernandez expects 2009 grants to match those of 2008 as individual donors increase giving to meet demand .
" I think any time you are in this kind of economic situation , individual philanthropists feel like they should do more for direct food and shelter type services , " she said .
The San Francisco Foundation is conducting a survey to find out what impact the recession is having on the Bay Area nonprofits it funds .
Nearly 100 community health nonprofits have responded .
Ninety percent said demand is up for their services , 60 percent said their revenues are declining and 25 percent have already had layoffs .
" Large organizations with diverse funding streams will have to do more with less , but it 's the tiny grassroots and arts groups that live on very narrow margins that may not make it if a major funder drops out , " Hernandez said .
That 's what almost happened to Woman 's Will , an all - female Shakespeare company in Oakland .
Waiting for the check
In October , when the city of Oakland cut Woman 's Will 's annual $ 15,000 grant - the troupe 's largest source of funding - founder Erin Merritt thought she'd have to cancel the 2009 season .
Merritt joined arts groups to persuade City Hall to reinstate the money , but the check has yet to arrive .
Without it , Merritt had to beg for money for the first time in the company 's 12 years .
She sent out a desperate e-mail , asking supporters to pitch in $ 25,000 to save the season .
In two weeks , she had $ 29,000 .
She 's OK for this season , but 2010 is up in the air .
" The dot - com bust was scary , but this one is so much worse , " Merritt said .
" We are getting squeezed in all directions . "
As jobless claims hit a historic high of 4.8 million nationwide , fundraising is getting exponentially harder for nonprofits .
" People often do n't think creatively how to help , " Merritt said .
" We 're happy to be the beneficiary of a garage sale . "
Ken Larsen , director of public policy for the California Association of Nonprofits , predicts organizations will also need to get more creative about asking for money .
They will need to partner with corporations to explore embedded giving , where a percent of a purchase goes to charity , he said , or get more savvy about starting Internet campaigns on sites such as Facebook or Twitter .
" Nonprofits might want to shift toward more virtual fundraising and less grant seeking , " Larsen said .
" Because the folks who have been hurt most by this recession are those who had resources already in the stock market and real estate , so nonprofits might recover faster if they find new ways to target younger people whose wealth is wage - based . "
Refining the mission
Experts , foundations , donors and charity leaders all agree that nonprofits are going to have to collaborate and look at the crisis as an opportunity .
" I think it 's imperative , " said Ellen Dumesnil , director of economic development for Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County .
" There is an opportunity in re-evaluating how we are structured and looking at whether we can partner in ways that make sense for our clients .
" Look at the car industry .
We did n't want the bottom to fall out , but maybe the fear of that is what it takes to create fuel - efficient cars . "
Changing Priority on Linux Processes
What is Priority and Why Should I Care ?
When talking about processes priority is all about managing processor time .
The Processor or CPU is like a human juggling multiple tasks at the same time .
Sometimes we can have enough room to take on multiple projects .
Sometimes we can only focus on one thing at a time .
Other times something important pops up and we want to devote all of our energy into solving that problem while putting less important tasks on the back burner .
In Linux we can set guidelines for the CPU to follow when it is looking at all the tasks it has to do .
These guidelines are called niceness or nice value .
The Linux niceness scale goes from - 20 to 19 .
The lower the number the more priority that task gets .
If the niceness value is high number like 19 the task will be set to the lowest priority and the CPU will process it whenever it gets a chance .
The default nice value is zero .
By using this scale we can allocate our CPU resources more appropriately .
Lower priority programs that are not important can be set to a higher nice value , while high priority programs like daemons and services can be set to receive more of the CPU ’s focus .
You can even give a specific user a lower nice value for all of his / her processes so you can limit their ability to slow down the computer ’s core services .
Checking the Priority of Running Processes
The easiest way to get a quick picture of what the current niceness priority on a process is to open up the top processes with :
top
Another way you can get the nice value is use ps :
ps -o pid , comm , nice -p 594
This will output the process ID , command , and nice value ( marked as NI ) .
Setting priority on new processes
At this point you are probably wondering how you can set your own priority levels on processes .
To change the priority when issuing a new command you do nice -n [ nice value ] [ command ] :
nice -n 10 apt - get upgrade
This will increment the default nice value by a positive 10 for the command , ‘ apt - get upgrade ’
This is often useful for times when you want to upgrade apps but do n’t want the extra process burden at the given time .
Remember a positive number is gives less priority for a process .
Setting Priority on Existing Processes
Obviously at some point you are going to want to alter the nice value of something that is already running .
Just the other day I was doing an upgrade to Ubuntu Jaunty and Firefox started to become unusably slow .
A quick renice command rescheduled the upgrade to a lower priority and I was back to surfing in no time .
To change the priority of an existing process just do renice [ nice value ] - p [ process id ] :
renice 10 -p 21827
This will increment the priority of the process with an id of 21827 to 10 .
Note :
Only root can apply negative nice values .
Setting Permanent Priority on all Processes for a Specific User
Sometimes it is helpful to give specific users lower priority than others to keep system resources allocated in the proper places like core services and other programs .
You can set the default nice value of a particular user or group in the /etc / security / limits .
conf file .
/etc/security/limits.conf
It uses this syntax : [ username ] [ hard |soft ] priority [ nice value ]

What ’s this ?
If you ’re considering adopting a dog anytime in the foreseeable future , you might consider helping to counteract a terrible trend at animal shelters : large dogs with black coats , when given up for adoption , are euthanized at a much higher rate than smaller or fairer - coated dogs , essentially because the public have an irrational fear of them .
“ ‘ Please do n’t overlook our black dogs , ’ rescue groups pleaded on their home pages above pictures of Rottweilers , Chows and Labs sporting bright bandannas .
One shelter ’s website just came right out with the grim truth : ‘ The general public is not aware of how doomed black dogs are when they are brought to a pound . ’…
“ Most black dogs have to rely on shelter staff and volunteers to steer potential adopters their way .
And indeed , many shelters take extra steps to make black dogs more adoptable , according to Kate Pullen , director of animal sheltering issues at the Humane Society of the United States in Washington , D.C.
Teaching the dogs tricks , putting placards on kennels highlighting the dog ’s personality ( ‘ I may just be a black dog , but I know how to balance a biscuit on my nose .’) , making sure multiple black dogs are n’t kenneled next to one other — anything to catch the eye and imagination of potential adopters .
“ ‘ I ’ve had to turn away many black dogs because I ca n’t fill the place up with them , ’ says Jill Wimmer , shelter manager at PAWS Atlanta , that city ’s oldest and largest no -kill shelter . ’
And every one I turned away had a great temperament . ”
Sorry , just a little bit of off - topic editorializing there .

Gay Iraqis fear for their lives
The Iraqi government must do more to protect homosexuals in the wake of a reported spate of killings of gay young men , Amnesty International has urged .
In the last few weeks , 25 boys and men are reported to have been killed in Baghdad because they were , or were perceived to be , gay , Amnesty said .
In a letter to Prime Minister Nouri Maliki , the rights organisation called for " urgent and concerted action " .
It also criticised the government 's failure to condemn the killings .
' Corpses found '
The recent killings are said to have been carried out by armed Shia militiamen as well as by members of the tribes and families of the victims , Amnesty said .
It cited reports that three corpses of gay men were found in the Shia area of Sadr City last week - two of which were reported to have had pieces of paper bearing the word " pervert " attached to them .
The letter also raised concerns that religious leaders may be inciting violence against members of Iraq 's gay community , and over reported statements by one senior police officer that appear to condone or even encourage the targeting of gay Iraqis .
Amnesty called on the government to bring those responsible for the killings to justice and to afford effective protection to the gay community in Iraq .

A record 4.2 % of consumer loans were delinquent at least 30 days
A record number of consumers are falling delinquent or into default on their loans , a problem that some economists say will only get worse this year .
A record 4.2 % of consumer loans were delinquent at least 30 days in the fourth quarter , the latest data available , according to the Federal Reserve .
Another 4 % of consumer loans were in default , meaning they ’d been written off by lenders .
Recent data from the American Bankers Association and Moody ’s rating agency show the same sobering trend :
More consumers are paying late – or not at all – on home , car and credit card loans .
Job losses are closely correlated to loan defaults , economists say .
And as more people become unemployed , they ’re increasingly giving up on loan payments .
“ The wheels have fallen off the economy , ” says James Chessen , chief economist for the American Bankers Association .
“ There have been significant job losses , and that translates into people having a hard time paying their bills . ”
Employers shed 663,000 jobs in March , pushing the nation ’s unemployment rate up to 8.5 % , the Labor Department reported Friday .
Since December 2007 – when the recession began – companies have cut a total of 5.1 million jobs , more than 2 million of them this year alone .
The worst is likely yet to come .
Chessen expects consumer loan charge - offs and delinquencies to continue rising through the end of this year .
In this economy , many families are juggling their bills , figuring out which ones to pay first , says Joel Naroff , founder of Naroff Economic Advisors .
Historically , consumers pay their mortgages before their credit cards and auto loans , because their home is often their most important asset .
But this trend no longer holds true for all borrowers , data from the nation ’s credit bureaus show .
Some financially squeezed borrowers have begun paying their credit card and car bills before their mortgages , according to Experian and Equifax credit bureaus .
That ’s because some consumers owe more on their home than it ’s worth , so they may be giving up on their mortgage and paying their credit card and car loan to get by , says Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com .
But more people may soon fall behind on those bills , too .
Zandi expects card charge - offs to peak at 10 % in the first quarter of 2010 , vs. 6.3 % now .
“ I do n’t think there ’s … any loan category that will avoid this storm , ” Zandi says .
Via USA Today
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Microsoft is testing a new version of its online search service internally under the name of Kumo.com , a spokesman for the software company said on Monday .
The service is not yet available outside the company , but may eventually form part of Microsoft 's attempt to catch up with Internet search leaders Google Inc and Yahoo Inc .
The new service was unveiled in an internal memo sent by the head of research at the company 's online services division on Monday .
It did not provide details about the new features .
" Kumo.com exists only inside the corporate network , and in order to get enough feedback we will be redirecting internal live.com traffic over to the test site in the coming days , " said the memo from Satya Nadella .
" Kumo is the codename we have chosen for the internal test . "
The memo was first made public on The Wall Street Journal 's All Things Digital blog .
Microsoft 's Nadella reckons the company can put together a better search engine than those currently available .
" We believe we can provide a better and more useful search experience that helps you not just search but accomplish tasks , " Nadella said in the memo .
" An explorer pane on the left side of results pages will give you access to tools that help you with your tasks . "
The Redmond , Washington - based company is struggling to catch up with runaway internet search leader Google , which is beginning to encroach on Microsoft 's core software business .
Last year , Microsoft made an unsuccessful attempt to buy Yahoo for $ 47.5 billion .
Executives at both companies have left open the possibility of a deal or partnership involving only Yahoo's search business .

Burr Tools
This ( set of ) program (s ) will help you solve a certain kind of puzzle .
Namely puzzles that are made out " glued " together basic units .
As basic units the program currently supports : square or dice shaped units , spheres , prisms with an equilateral triangle as base or 2 grids that use tetrahedra .
The problem of the puzzle must be to assemble them into a certain shape .
An additional constraint says that the pieces within the result shape must again aligned relative to the grid of the basic unit .
To whet your appetite here are some screenshots that show off all the important features of the program .
If you click the images a normal sized version of the window will be loaded .
This image shows the window in shape editing mode editing one of the pieces of the example puzzle " Broken Sticks " .
It uses the anaglyph mode for red -cyan / blue glasses
This image displays the window in problem editing mode .
It shows the Puzzle " Draculas Dental Desaster " designed by Ronald Kint Bruynseels which is included as an example
This image shows the window in solution mode .
It shows " More MazeN Cube " by Derek Bosch "
This image contains the image export window one of " Interlocking Puzzle " s truncated octahedrons , a puzzle using the tetra - octa grid .
This image shows the example puzzle with the triangle grid : " Bermuda " designed by Bill Cutler
And one example with the sphere grid : " Ball Room " by Stewart Coffin
Finally an example with the rhombic grid .
Again a puzzle designed by Stewart Coffin : " Permutated Third Stellation "
This shows the stl export window for a sphere piece .
You can see the rounded connections between spheres
And of course you can also export the shapes of all other space grids .
This is a piece of the example puzzle " Pieces of Eight " designed by Stewart Coffin
There are also 2 videos available that show how a puzzle is entered and solved using BurrTools .
The puzzle that is used can be found here .
The video is divided into 2 parts .
Part 1 contains the creation of the shapes and solves the puzzle the first time .
Part 2 adds colours to the shapes to make the puzzle complete and the solution unique .
The files are 2 and 1.5 MBytes big .
You can also find a tutorial made by Lee Krasnow that explains the Rhombic Grid .
So what are the features Does nearly all that PuzzleSolver 3D which is
You can enter all puzzles that are assembled out of dice shaped units Find assemblies for you puzzle Disassemble the found assemblies
Show everything in a 3 dimensional image Animate how the puzzle has to be assembled
Toggle the visibility of pieces in the solution to have a look at the inner workings of a puzzle .
This is especially helpful for box packing puzzles
Runs on Windows , OSX , Linux , FreeBSD and probably other Unix variants as well .
Has several different grids ( Cubes , Triangles , Spheres , Rhombics )
You can specify which cubes to fill and which can be empty or full .
PuzzleSolver 3D has only 2 modes .
Either all cubes may be left empty in the solution , or the cubes that have an empty neighbour must be filled .
BurrTools are more flexible here .
More than one problem in one file ( e.g. have several Soma Cube problems in the same file )
Constraints to piece placements ( like checkerboard )
Group pieces together to tell the disassembler that they do n't need to be taken apart .
This is necessary for puzzles like " Cube In Cage " where the cage can not be taken apart but has 3 movable pieces
No limits ( or at least very high limits ) to sizes and number of shapes .
As long as your computer has the memory and you the patience the program will do it for you , even if it takes aeons .
Create images that contain the pieces , or an instruction how to assemble the puzzle , or create vector images for further processing
that contain the pieces , or an instruction how to assemble the puzzle , or create vector images for further processing Create files suitable for STL aware hard and software ( e.g. 3D printer )
Free as in beer .
It does n't cost you anything
Free as in speech .
The source is available , so you can do your own programming or help me writing this software or even continue improving the program in case I have to stop working on it .
Save puzzles with solutions in compressed XML - files .
This allows you to create puzzles with other means ( like your own burrgrower , ... )
A library is provided that helps you to write your own software for puzzle design and analysis I 've been asked many times why I do n't sell the program .
For those that are interested here I put up a small text explaining it .
Documentation
To learn more about BurrTools you can read an online version of the user guide and the library documentation .
The user guide documentation is also available as a PDF below in the download section and as help inside the program .
The library documentation explains the library interface and can be generated from the source code of the library using doxygen .
This documentation is mainly for people wanting to use the library and only of limited use for those who only want to use the GUI part of BurrTools .
Both documents are always for the latest release and will be updated with each release .

News News 09.05.2013 BurrTools 0.6.3 has been released this is a bugfix release .
Two bugs have been fixed Fix a problem that made BurrTools find an unpredictable amount of solutions when you started a new puzzle and solved it .
When a saved puzzles was loaded the number of solutions was right
Fix a problem with the rotated solution removal when using a set of pieces including some mirror pairs and when not all pieces were used in all solutions 23.07.2011 BurrTools 0.6.2 has been released this is a bugfix release .
Two bugs have been fixed Fix a problem with the " expensive rotation check " .
The check returns the wrong number of results when piece ranges are used .
Fix a crash when removing pieces from problems that already contain solutions .
12.02.2011 BurrTools 0.6.1 has been released this is mainly a bugfix release fixing 2 nasty bugs : STL export was broken , it sometimes crashed the program
The error message handling was broken , all error messages from the library were displayed as meaningless texts with a lot of zeros in there 10.10.2010 I want to use this nice date to announce that version 0.6.0 has been released .
This version has the following new features : completely rewritten STL - export - and OpenGL - display - code , they do now share a common base .
With this come the following features : STL export for all grids , including hollow shapes for all grids STL export preview in the STL export window , you see exactly what the STL shape looks like for the programmers : it has become simpler to support new grids all polygon based grids now can create proper STL output and code for the 3D display much easier , grids like the spheres stay complicated , though bigger sensitive click spots for spheres , they also look better in the 3D view you can see the natural color and the color constraint color
improved STL export window ( tooltips , ...)
STL export displays the exact volume of the generated object
add a new way how objects are rotated in the 3 - D viewer
This version also fixes a few problems : fix a problem loading puzzle files with complex groups
deleting the last shape crashed the program
make compilabe with gcc - 4.4 and fltk - 1.3 I want to thank Derek Bosch for his help in this release .
Although we had to start over twice he managed in the end to come up with the bevel and offset code required for the STL export .
22.10.2009 Version 0.5.2 has been released .
This version is another bug - fix release .
But it also contains 2 small but nice new features : STL export of hollow spheres .
It is now possible to generate hollow sphere for the 3d printer , saving you a lot of volume and costs .
Thanks to George Bell for this feature .
Improvements to the movement browser : in the cube grid you can now push and pull pieces around by clicking onto their faces and holding the Shift or Ctrl key down .
Thanks to Barry Downes for this feature .
This version also fixes the following problems :
With some sphere puzzles BurrTools left in some rotations , leaving you with too many solutions .
Thanks to ISHINO to give me a simple problem to investigate this problem .
Also thanks to Joe Becker who thought that there was a problem but could not give me a simple example .
Fix a bug when importing sphere shapes from assemblies .
This but caused a crash nearly every time you tries to do that .
Fix a bug in STL export for cubes that caused the generation of faulty STL files with some cube arrangements .
Thanks to Derek Bosch for the fix .
29.4.2009 Version 0.5.1 has been released .
This version is a bug - fix release .
It fixes 4 problems , some of them rather important , so please update .
Fix a problem in the new expensive rotation check functionality that resulted in too few solutions
Fix a rounding bug that happened when transforming sphere shapes that resulted in too few solutions
Fix a crash when opening the status window with sphere puzzles
Deactivate movement browser when not available .
Opening it in those situations caused a crash
Fix a possible crash when minimizing shapes
Documentation updates 5.4.2009 Version 0.5.0 has been released .
This is a major new release with a ton of new features
But before we start with the features I want to mention an important bug - fix .
Joe Becker found this one .
When you use piece ranges and assigned different ranges to the 2 pieces of a mirror pair of pieces versions prior to this may loose solutions , so I really urge you to update .
But now finally let 's start with the features .
Again BurrTools learned a new grid .
The new grid is based on tetrahedra and octahedrons .
With this grid you can analyse the tetrahedra - puzzles form Interlocking Puzzles .
I want to thank Wayne Daniel who provided me with 2 example puzzles to test the new functionality .
Another great new feature is a disassembler for the triangle grid .
You can not analyse disassembly sequences for those puzzles .
Be aware though that coordinated motion moves are not supported by now .
Also the printable manual has returned and it is better than ever .
BurrTools still contains the on - line help but if you want a proper manual you can download that manual formatted for A4 or letter paper format .
The size of the manual has also reached more than 100 pages .
It covers all the features of BurrTools and contains a lot of hints and usage examples to make life easier .
BurrTools now contains some features that can be used for piece generation .
It has become very easy to create all shapes that fulfil a certain property .
It will probably not help in all situations but many tedious manual tasks can be simplified a lot .
For that tasks I also speed up the status window calculations by a huge amount .
While we are talking about speed up .
I replaced the sorting algorithm that sorted solutions by a usable method .
If you had more than a few solutions the old algorithm was way too slow .
I also replaced the whole save and load code .
The file format stayed the same but internally everything has changed .
The new code is much much faster .
It also requires much less memory .
This can be important for big puzzles .
The old code might fail to save an analysis because it ran out of memory .
This will no longer happen .
I also optimized the disassembler to require less memory .
It is now possible to analyse disassembly of puzzles with many more internal states .
I also removed that stupid 256 piece limitation for the disassembler , so you can now analyse puzzles with lots and lots of shapes .
Besides these bigger improvements there are a lot of smaller things add scrollwheel support for 3D view zoom
millability and notchability in status window
fix potential symmetry calculation problem with the rhombic grid
different config file format , the old one is thrown away )
fix a cursor drawing bug in the rhombic grid
converter from cube to rhombic grid and from cube to tetra -octa grid
add a simple movement browser to analyse the movements of pieces in an assembled puzzle One final remark .
I will no longer support the windows installer .
I can not test that part of BurrTools on my computer .
Lately I found out that there has been a bug in the installer that has been there for a very long time and no one cared to tell me .
As I do n't like to give out faulty software I will no longer support that feature .
You will have to live with the ZIP - archive .
I can look into the ZIP file and check everything is all right .

It has been the base for the GUI of BurrTools Donald E. Knuth .
His dancing link algorithm is one base part of the program .
Although it has now become modified by ideas from Wei-Hwa Huang Bill Cutler :
His texts helped implementing the 2nd part of the core algorithm .
And he also contributed other ideas .
Ronald Kint - Bruynseels :
He is always a big source of ideas , he is beta tester , documentation writer GUI designer and usability improver , icon painter and what not all else .
Without him BurrTools would not be what it is now .
Derek Bosch : mainly responsible for the OSX port .
But he also contributes the odd code snippet or even new feature here and there .
Sourceforge provides the discspace for this webpage .

One of the areas I feel lacks enough discussion is error handling in JavaScript .
While a lot of thought typically goes into error handling in server software , complete with error logs and monitoring systems , there ’s very little emphasis on the same for JavaScript .
I ’ve tried to raise awareness of this with my Ajax Experience talk , Enterprise JavaScript Error Handling , where I discussed error handling approaches as well as common error sources .
One of my suggestions in the talk was to provide a debug mode for your application .
The idea is that production mode hides JavaScript errors from the user and handles them appropriately while debug mode allows errors to bubble up to the browser level and be reported as usual .
The latter is important , of course , for debugging purposes .
When the error is popped up in the browser , you have the option to debug with all of the surrounding context information .
The pattern I suggested in my talk looks like this :
function doSomething ( value ) { try { process ( value ) ; } catch ( ex ) { if ( debugMode ) { throw ex ; } else { log ( 1 , " doSomething ( ) : " + ex.message ) ; } } }
The idea here is that the error is caught and , depending on the mode , does something appropriate .
As often happens in development , I ’ve now discovered that this is n’t the best approach and actually introduces a painful consequence .
If an error occurs in process ( ) , that error is trapped and thrown from doSomething ( ) , which disrupts the call stack .
The error is now too far away from the actual event to be useful for debugging .
All of the context information that could lead to a solution is lost once execution exits process ( ) .
Imagine having your debugger set to break on all errors : using this code , the break would occur on the line containing throw ex when you really want it to break inside of process ( ) because that ’s where the actual problem is .
I now consider this an error handling anti-pattern , a pattern that prevents useful debugging rather than enabling it .
The pattern I now recommend is to completely remove the try - catch statement when in debug mode .
This allows for normal code execution and will result in the correct call stack placement when an error occurs .
There are a couple of ways to accomplish this pattern , the first is a rather ugly - looking conditional statement :
function doSomething ( value ) { if ( debugMode ) { process ( value ) ; } else { try { process ( value ) ; } catch ( ex ) { log ( 1 , " doSomething ( ) : " + ex.message ) ; } } }
The second , arguably more elegant approach is to simply replace the entire function based on the execution mode :
var doSomething = debugMode ? function ( value ) { process ( value ) ; } : function ( value ) { try { process ( value ) ; } catch ( ex ) { log ( 1 , " doSomething ( ) : " + ex.message ) ; } } ;
This is my preferred approach because it eliminates checking debugMode each time the function is executed .
Also , this approach is easy to automate .
Suppose you have one or more objects and you want all of their methods to have a wrapper in production to trap errors .
The following code accomplishes this quite easily :
//by Nicholas C. Zakas ( MIT Licensed ) function productionize ( object ) { var name , method ; for ( name in object ) { method = object [ name ] ; if ( typeof method == " function " ) { object [ name ] = function ( name , method ) { return function ( ) { try { return method.apply ( this , arguments ) ; } catch ( ex ) { log ( 1 , name + " ( ) : " + ex.message ) ; } } ; }( name , method ) ; } } }
This code iterates over an object ’s properties and replaces each function with another function containing the appropriate error handling mechanism .
You can use the function like this :
var system = { fail : function ( ) { throw new Error ( " Oops ! " ) ; } } ; function log( severity , message ) { alert ( severity + " : " + message ) ; } if ( ! debugMode ) { productionize ( system ) ; } system.fail ( ) ; //error is trapped !
This pattern of error trapping will serve you well in complex environments where errors can be difficult to track down .
Making sure that the error is thrown from the right place is the first step in debugging the problem .

The strain in Mexico is reported as being the same in the U.S.
One of two things is true – either the Mexicans are lying about the severity of the crisis , or deaths in the U.S. are being covered up .
The fact that this is all unfolding right on the border with Texas is obviously of prime importance because we are based here .

I work as a resident doctor in one of the biggest hospitals in Mexico City and sadly , the situation is far from “ under control ” .
As a doctor , I realise that the media does not report the truth .
Authorities distributed vaccines among all the medical personnel with no results , because two of my partners who worked in this hospital ( interns ) were killed by this new virus in less than six days even though they were vaccinated as all of us were .
The official number of deaths is 20 , nevertheless , the true number of victims are more than 200 .
I understand that we must avoid to panic , but telling the truth it might be better now to prevent and avoid more deaths .

The situation in Mexico City is really not normal .
There is a sense of uncertainty that borders on paranoid behaviour in some cases .
At this very moment , Mexican TV is showing how military forces are giving masks to the people in the streets .
Moreover the news is sending alarming messages for the audience .
Really , the atmosphere in the city is unsettling , a good example : pubs and concerts are being closed or cancelled and people do n’t haven thorough information .
In this city ( and country ) there is an urgent need for assertive information , no paranoid messages from the government or the Mexican media .

Massive events have been cancelled at the National Auditorium – Mexico City ’s largest indoor venue with capacity of 10,000 – which has been closed .
Two soccer games have been cancelled at the Olympic Stadium .
A sold out game with 70,000 expected attendance will be played behind closed doors .
Another game at the famous Azteca Stadium that would draw an attendance of 50,000 will also be played behind closed doors .
Juan Carlos Leon Calderon , Mexico City
It ’s eerily quiet here in the capital .
Lots of people with masks , Facebook communities exchanging gallows humour , everybody waiting to see if schools and universities will stay closed for ten days ( as goes the rumour ) .
All masks have been used up , and we are waiting for new supplies .

Mic. drop !
Last 4 years hottest on record , UN confirms 331 Recs
Sometimes we travel to attend a big event , like a rock concert , festival or football game , and by the time the we get back to the hotel , we wonder what the fuss was all about .
Unfortunately , some events are more enjoyable on television , from the comfort of our own couch .
Take the Super Bowl for example .
Sold out every year of course but more hype surrounds the television advertisements than the actual game , which usually turns out to be a dud from a pure football vantage point .
Rather than fans of the game , the seats are full of corporate fatcats who seldom have any allegiance to either team .
Thankfully , there are some events well worth the price of admission .
Best of all , several require no payment at all .
You simply have to show up and applaud from the sidelines .
Without further ado , we present the Top 10 Races in the World
The Great Tibetan Marathon
Remote ?
Yes .
Good chance of high altitude sickness ?
Yes .
Unparalleled beauty amid a dense backdrop of spirituality ?
Indeed .
The Great Tibetan Marathon presents unique challenges to runners more familiar with the urban confines of London and New York City .
Smack in the middle of the Himalayas in the area famous as the “ Top of the World ” , the marathon takes participants through scenery heavy with natural splendor and spiritual import unlike anywhere around the globe .
The ancient Tibetan Buddhist monuments and monastic shrines that line the route within the Indus Valley lend a quality of mysticism to this annual race .
Runners must contend with incredible distractions here .
For one , the view .
On the one hand , the Himalayas loom large in the distance .
That alone is cause to lose focus .
The lack of oxygen however , reminds the athletes that the conditions can be deadly .
The Indus Valley on the other hand , is one of the most pristine in the world .
No wonder that the gurus of yore found enlightenment here and chose the location for their precious monuments .
Medoc Marathon
The region of Bordeaux in France evokes one image and one image only : wine .
In a quest to consummate a most unholy marriage , somebody in 1984 , perhaps after a blow to the head , thought it would be fun to combine the heritage of Bordeaux with a marathon .
Thus , the M?doc Marathon was born .
With a limit of 8,500 participants , the convivial race is a conventional marathon in every sense except one .
The route runs past some of the most famous Ch? teaux in France , with names that drip from the mouths of wine connoisseurs .
As such , participants who want to make the most of the event slake their thirst not with water , but much more importantly , with wine .
A lot of wine .
Hardcore veterans of the event measure success at M?doc with how drunk they are at the finish .
The revelry that surrounds the marathon is legendary , with elements of Mardi Gras and Halloween that together , make for one raucous weekend in Bordeaux .
Definitely one for both Dionysus and Pheidippides to enjoy .
The Dakar Rally
A rare event where the mantra “ only the strong survive ” is not hyperbole , the Dakar Rally is thrill ride of epic proportions .
The annual off - road race , whose organizers - the Amaury Sport Organisation - also put together the Tour de France , epitomizes the word endurance .
Participants race for pride , as Dakar is seen by enthusiasts as the most brutal rally test in the world .
For the teams that invest in Dakar , a win here is the ultimate ego boost .
The terrain is the problem .
Whether the race starts in Paris or Lisbon , it ends past the Sahara and in Dakar , Senegal .
As such , teams have to supply drivers with mechanical support the likes of which do not exist in conventional rally events .
Vehicles typically drive up to 900 km a day through treacherous sand dunes , camel grass and desert erg .
Death is almost inevitable for some , which makes the race even better from a bloodlust tourism standpoint .
Daytona 500
For fans of open wheel sports and rally , a dissertation on the mass appeal of NASCAR is problematic .
To outsiders , it looks like a pack of cars going around a large oval track .
Which in essence , sums up the sport .
But for some reason , NASCAR has become the most popular spectator sport in America , even more than the NFL .
Attendance for major events runs in the hundreds of thousands and the television audience now eclipses the NBA and baseball .
Baseball !
Imagine that .
NASCAR has beat out the national pastime .
The preeminent event on the NASCAR calendar is also the first of the season , which is weird .
But then again , this is a sport where drivers have names like Cole , Chip and Bo. Sure , the Deep South vibe of NASCAR is not quite as pure now that corporate America runs the show but still , the sport is redneck at heart .
The scene in Daytona for the 500 is pure entertainment and good times .
Kentucky Derby
Another great tradition of the South in America is the Kentucky Dery .
Of course , the origins of this race are far more genteel than NASCAR .
If you consider a horse race genteel that is .
The annual thoroughbred event at legendary Churchill Downs in Louisville , a great town by any measure , is a grandiose spectacle .
Although it culminates with a race that takes place on a 2 km track , the build up the week before is part of the attraction .
Since 1875 the Run for the Roses , as people call the Derby , has a number of traditions that go along with the pomp and circumstance of the event .
If you go and you happen to be female , lavish and elaborate dress is important .
A big hat is essential .
Spectators drink Mint Juleps , a popular beverage in the South , and eat burgoo , a thick , meat stew native to Kentucky .
Of course , strains of “ My Old Kentucky Home ” resonate everywhere you walk around Churchill Downs .
Royal Ascot , England
A mere six miles from Windsor Castle in Berkshire is the Ascot Racecourse , a fine segment of Crown Estate land .
If you want the very height of supercilious snobbery , Royal Ascot is the supreme race event of the year .
In fact , the event illustrates the very origin of the term “ The Sport of Kings ” .
Since 1711 , Ascot has been the major event on the royal social calendar in England .
The 16 races that comprise Royal Ascot week draw more than 300,000 spectators and lay in excess of ? 3,000,000 on the line in prize money .
Nobody cares much about who wins however .
The real event is in the stands and luxury suites , where the most garish and ostentatious attire known to man or woman is on display .
Subtle the clothes are not .
While organizers have made every effort in recent years to stem the tide of fashion gone awry , the very rules they enforce result in ensembles that would be cause for embarrassment in the real world .
But lest we forget , this is not the real world .
This is the realm of royalty and aristocracy , celebrity and old money .
The spectacle they put on is more than enough to make you forget that Royal Ascot is a horse race .
Indianapolis 500
The state of Indiana in America is famous for fierce loyalty to two sports : basketball , where at the high school and college level the interest borders on maniacal , and IndyCar .
Known as “ The Greatest Spectacle in Racing ” , the Indy 500 has been a Memorial Day weekend staple since 1911 .
Although squabbles between the two main open wheel associations in the U.S. have been harmful to the event in recent years , a new agreement promises to bolster the competition once again .
Nonetheless , the 500 has always been a thrill ride and draws the best drivers from around the world .
For them , participation at legendary Indianapolis Motor Speedway is a feather in their cap .
Legends have been born here and careers have come to a fiery end .
For spectators , the traditions that go along with the actual race are almost worth the price of admission .
The crowds alone for the pre-race practice sessions the week before the 500 dwarf those for other events held the rest of the year .
As the first row of cars approach the pole position and the Speedway announcer makes the famous call “ Gentleman , start your engines ! ” , you may just feel a shiver run down your spine .
A new law designed to make it easier for copyright holders to go after illicit file - sharers came into force in Sweden yesterday .
Interestingly , it looks like the IPRED legislation , which will also increase penalties and ultimately criminalize large scale infringement , has already resulted in a major drop in Internet traffic - for now .
The controversial Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ( IPRED ) has gathered opposition from various sides , most notably half of the Swedsih public .
In a response to the new law The Pirate Bay introduced their anonymity service IPREDATOR last week , which is scheduled to open up to the public soon .
Now , a day after IPRED came into force , data from the Netnod Internet Exchange shows a significant drop of 30 % in Swedish Internet traffic .
This impressive figure seems to suggest that the amount of traffic generated by filesharing has dropped even more .
The IPRED effect ?
“ Most experts ( including more neutral ones ) judge it as an initial scare effect that will wear off after a week or two , ” Swedish Pirate Party Chairman Rick Falkvinge told TorrentFreak , adding “ This is what disturbs me the most — that the industry thrives on scaring the common citizen . ”
Scaring the public is what they do indeed , with Lars Gustafsson , operating manager of IFPI Sweden estimating that there will be at least 100 cases in court this year .
Henrik Pontén from Antipiratbyrån – the Swedish anti-piracy office – sees the traffic drop as an indication that the new law is working .
“ The majority of all Internet traffic is file - sharing .
Because of that , there ’s no other explanation for the decrease in traffic than the IPRED law , ” he stated .
The traffic drop is indeed significant , but that does n’t mean people have stopped sharing .
In the past 24 hours 384,657 Swedes were connected to the Pirate Bay tracker alone .
That is close to 5 % of the Swedish population , and no less than before .
On top of that , many people are looking for ways to hide their identities online .
Thousands of new customers have visited new anonymizing service mullvad .
net .
“ It ’s beyond all expectations , ” said Fredrik Strömberg , one of the two owners .
We ’ve received e-mails from all kinds of people .
Mothers in families , young people , older people , all kinds .
And everyone is swearing at the copyright lobby .
It ’s not good PR for them . ”
In a few weeks more details on the filesharing habits of Swedes will surface , so then we ’ll know whether or not IPRED changed anything , apart from the annoyance levels of the public .
Some statistics , compiled by Helen Benedict , on females in the military :
30 % are raped .
71 % are sexually assaulted .
90 % are sexually harassed .
While I myself am a pro-peace advocate who cringes at giant amounts of money being poured into warfare , I realize that the military has been around since the birth of nations .
The two are , unfortunately , disastrously , murderously , combined .
But my rant on nationalism is a separate .
This is for the soldiers who volunteer to support an ideal .
Their image is a romantic one : they are banded together against an unpredictable array of car bombs and an invisible enemy .
Amid endless controversy , particularly over the occupation of Iraq , they live in service of an ideology in which they believe .
That they would die for .
And many have .
At the same time , let ’s be real .
Aside from all the political mash - ups that have fairly destroyed US foreign relations , the military has been catching a lot of flak recently regarding torture of prisoners .
What about torture of their own ?
Imagine being raped , being absolutely invaded , by someone on your side .
You report the vile incident to your superior officers .
They respond that if you make an official accusation , you could likewise be charged with leaving your weapon unattended in a combat zone .
The penalty for this could be discharge .
Are you sure you want to sacrifice your career for this altercation ?
Imagine being told that the only reason you , a female , were summoned to Iraq was because there are ” no prostitutes like in Vietnam ” .
You ’re there essentially to be a human body bag .
You are the “ bitch , ho , or dyke ” onto which your male counterparts can spew aggression , both verbally and physically .
What makes Helen Benedict ’s book scarier , is that it is compiled all from females from within our military .
This does not include any sexual assaults done towards the countless Iraqi civilians who have even less recourse besides , perhaps , the groups that might be labeled as “ extremist ” .
The war from within the military rages .
What must the soldiers think , as they are being held down and abused , as they are subjected to unwarranted searches into their sexual lives ?
They signed up to fight for an ideal .
Instead , these marginalized United States soldiers seem to be fighting for air .
Ms. Zhou and her husband , Mr. Su , the tea farmer , were still in mourning in October 2007 when they spotted a child at a Buddhist temple in their village , Dailai , a picturesque hamlet of 800 people nestled in the fold of steep mountains .
“ The boy was eating candy like he was hungry , ” Mr. Su recalled .
“ Everything he was wearing was too small for him . ”
A man with the boy claimed to be his father .
He said that he was from a nearby town and had three sons , but that he needed money to take his ill wife to the hospital .
“ I asked how much , ” said Mr. Su , an earnest man who works long hours in a clothing factory when he is not tending his tea plants .
After some quick bargaining , the price was dropped to $ 3,500 from $ 4,100 , and a few hours later , after borrowing money from friends and family members , they took the boy home .
They named him Jiabao , which means “ guarantor of the family . ”
Their love for their new son was boundless .
They bought him new clothing and had their daughter drop out of middle school to take care of him .
They did not think much of the fact that Jiabao did not understand the dialect spoken in that part of Fujian and seemed indifferent to the local cuisine .
Mr. Su insisted that he never imagined that the boy had been stolen .
Last August , Mr. Su learned the truth after the police in Sichuan Province arrested the man who had sold them the child .
The man , part of a ring of seven people who had abducted 11 children , had sold four of them to families in their township .
The man , according to the police , has since been given a 12 - year sentence .
By the time the couple got home from work the day they got the news , their son and the three other stolen children in their village had already been taken away by the police .
The couple was inconsolable .
“ We were lied to , we were swindled , ” Mr. Su said as his wife ’s eyes welled up .
There was , however , a small consolation .
A sympathetic policeman in Sichuan , the province where the boy was stolen , helped put them in touch with his birth parents .
The two couples have since been in frequent contact ; Mr. Su said the real parents held no grudge , acknowledging that the family had cared for their son well .
The father was so grateful , he told Mr. Su he would be on the lookout for local families who had two sons but were too poor to care for them .
“ He said that way I do n’t need to deal with child traffickers anymore , ” Mr. Su said .
Mr Rudd is facing criticism for softening Australia 's immigration policy Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has described people - smugglers as " scum " who should " rot in hell " .
His comments come a day after an explosion aboard a boat carrying Afghan asylum seekers killed at least three people and injured dozens more .
The cause of the blast remains unknown , but some MPs have suggested it may have been deliberate , to avoid deportation .
The incident has reignited debate about asylum policy .
The opposition believes Mr Rudd 's approach is too soft .
Liberal party leader Malcolm Turnbull said the government stance - less hardline than that of the previous administration - provided a greater incentive to smugglers , encouraging people to put their lives at risk by setting out to sea .
But the government has blamed the recent surge in asylum seekers on the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka , along with the global economic downturn .
Horrific burns
The asylum - seekers who survived the explosion have now been flown to hospitals in Australia .
The death toll is likely to rise , because two people are still missing at the explosion site and five others are on life support .
Some of the burns are so severe that doctors in Perth have compared them to those they treated in the aftermath of the Bali bombings .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement Speaking on Friday , Mr Rudd issued a withering verdict on those who traffic people across borders .
" People smugglers are the vilest form of human life because they trade on the tragedy of others , " he said .
" We 've seen this lowest form of human life at work in what we saw on the high seas yesterday . "
Asylum - seekers were held on Nauru under Mr Howard 's Pacific Solution Mr Rudd refused to speculate on the cause of Thursday 's explosion , citing ongoing investigations .
But the premier of Western Australia said the boat was doused with fuel before the blast , suggesting it could have been an attempt to prevent deportation .
When the explosion happened , the boat was being escorted to an offshore island by the Australian navy , so the asylum seekers ' claims could be processed .
Rise in claims
This is the sixth boat carrying asylum - seekers to enter Australian waters this year .
The number of people arriving in this way already totals more than 250 this year - a significant increase from the total of 179 refugees intercepted during the whole of 2008 .
Australia 's opposition has linked this upsurge with a relaxation of the country 's immigration policy since Kevin Rudd became prime minister in late 2007 .
The Rudd government scrapped the widely - criticised policy of his predecessor , John Howard , under which asylum - seekers and their children were detained for years in special centres in Nauru or Papua New Guinea , a plan labelled the " Pacific Solution " .
Asylum - seekers now arriving by boat are held on Christmas Island , but their claims must be expedited , with six - monthly case reviews by an ombudsman now government policy .
Mr Rudd defended his policy on Friday , saying : " We are dedicating more resources to combat people smuggling than any other government in Australian history . "

These are my first attempts but I think there can be no doubt where I got my inspiration .
Photos taken in my front yard .
For many years now I have been a staunch opponent of teaching Creationism ( AKA Intelligent Design ) in science classes , but I ’m beginning to question that stance , and I ’d like to hear some other opinions on the subject .
So have I given in to the “ teach the controversy ” crowd ?
Quite the opposite !
In the US today , with our majority Christian population and unconscionably high percentage of people who already do n’t believe in evolution , it is almost inevitable that children will be exposed to Creationism in some way .
Why let it be on the Creationists ’ terms ?
Instead I propose that we actually teach children about the Christian Creation Myth in schools , but tell the truth about it .
Do n’t tell them that there is a serious debate in science about whether life on Earth got to its present state by means of evolution or by creation in its current form .
Instead tell them that we know evolution happens , that even many Christians including Pope John Paul II agree that it does , and then show them exactly how literal Biblical Creationism falls flat on its face as science .
This would be a great educational experience in critical thinking , and a fantastic demonstration of how ancient unscientific ideas are eventually overtaken by good science based on observable facts .
We still see the layperson ’s side of this battle going on today since Creationists are much more tenacious than doctors who thought that “ bleeding ” people would cure them , but people should know that this debate is limited to laypeople and a few fringe scientists who have a lot of faith but little or no training in relevant scientific disciplines .
Instead of ignoring Creationism in school and letting kids be confused by hearing a basic version of the truth about the history of life on Earth in science class and then hearing confusing Creationist lies at home , on the street and in church , often without any arguments presented against it , the common Creationist claims should be debunked and it should be shown for the outdated , disproven , cynical lies that they are .
We know that the Creationists are presenting their case , weak though it may be , and bashing evolution and science in any way they can .
Why not fight back ?
As I have seen too often in children and adults who believe in the Biblical Creation Myth , this and other related religious beliefs can destroy their trust not only in evolution but in all of science , even in anything secular , and then all they are left with is their religion .
If we let people become so disconnected from reality and society as a whole , we risk losing them as members of our society along with anyone they manage to convert .
This is a real concern since many of these people are evangelical and believe it is their mission to convert people .
So let ’s cut this off at the knees .
We can give the Creationists part of what they want and put Creationism into the science curriculum , as Creationism and not the “ Intelligent Design ” pseudonym so no one is confused about what the real issue is .
Then we can teach people about the current controversy between fundamentalists and rational people in the laity , and let them know that the controversy in the scientific community between Evolution and Creation is long over and that the Creationists lost decisively .
" The United States participated actively and effectively in the negotiation of the Convention .
It marks a significant step in the development during this century of international measures against torture and other inhuman treatment or punishment .
Ratification of the Convention by the United States will clearly express United States opposition to torture , an abhorrent practice unfortunately still prevalent in the world today .
The core provisions of the Convention establish a regime for international cooperation in the criminal prosecution of torturers relying on so - called ' universal jurisdiction . '
Each State Party is required either to prosecute torturers who are found in its territory or to extradite them to other countries for prosecution . "
This collection by Miru Kim totally blows me away .
Taking naked self - portraits in places we would n't dare visit , Miru draws beauty from old and abandoned subway stations , tunnels , aqueducts , catacombs , factories , hospitals , and morgues .
It takes a lot of guts and willpower to visit these desolate places all alone .
Miru was born in Stoneham , Massachusetts in 1981 but was raised in Seoul , Korea .
She moved back to Massachusetts in 1995 to attend Phillips Academy in Andover and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend Columbia University .
In 2006 , she received an MFA in painting from Pratt Institute .
To get a better understanding of her work , I would highly recommend watching her TED presentation on the video below .

US house construction has bounced after a 50 - year low in January
The rate of construction of new homes in the US soared by almost a quarter in February compared with the previous month , official figures have shown .
The US Commerce Department said the construction of new homes and apartments rose to an annual rate of 583,000 in the month .
In January , the annual rate to fell to 477,000 homes , the fewest in 50 years .
The jump , driven by an increase in apartments , came as a surprise to analysts , who had expected a drop .
But even with February 's big jump in building activity , housing construction is still down by almost a half compared with the same month a year ago .
Sign of recovery ?
The January rate was the lowest since the US Commerce Department started keeping records in 1959 .
Some analysts were at a loss to explain the rise seen in February .
" We see no specific factor that might explain this jump , " said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics .
This is an encouraging sign for the US economy .
It is good signal of what is to come
Matt Esteve , Tempus Consulting " Multi - family starts are always noisy , but this is exceptional .
With new home sales still falling and the [ recent ] months ' supply at a record there is no reason for homebuilding to rise . "
Applications for building permits , which are seen as a reliable indicator of future building activity , were also up by 3 % to an annual rate of 547,000 .
Wider impact
The collapse of the US housing market was a key factor in the global economic downturn .
And some analysts believe these housing figures are a sign that the economy may be on its way to recovery .
" This is an encouraging sign for the US economy .
It is good signal of what is to come , " said Matt Esteve at Tempus Consulting .
" With the rally in equities , we hopefully have seen a bottom for the economy here . "
Others , however , were rather more circumspect .
" This is a temporary rebound , not a recovery , " said Mr Shepherdson .

Tonight for the Real World Haskell Book Club , Paul Barry and I decided to dig through the Programming Collective Intelligence book as some good hack projects as we dive deep into the language features .
As you may have noticed both here on my blog and on Twitter , I have been posting a lot of these samples in F# and refactoring along the way .
By taking the Python code and rewriting it in Haskell gave me better insight into the Haskell way , but also refactoring opportunities for my existing F# code .
The Haskell Top Matches
First , I decided that some of the type definitions were far too long , so I decided to type alias these so that it makes a bit more sense when I reference them :
import Data .Map (( ! ) , intersection , fromList , keys , Map (.. ) ) import Data.List ( sort ) type Preferences = Map String ( Map String Double ) type Similarity = Preferences -> String -> String ->
Double
Now that I have these type definitions , I can now create the critics map with a much cleaner type signature such as the following :
-- Old critics :: Map String ( Map String Double ) -- Better critics :: Preferences
Next , let ’s move onto our two similarity functions , the Euclidean Distance and Pearson Coefficient implementations .
First , let ’s look at the Euclidean Distance formula .
As before , in order to calculate between two people on the chart , take the difference in each axis , square them and add them together , and finally take the square root of the sum .
This function will always return values between 0 and 1 , with 1 being identical and 0 having nothing in common .
The code to do this might look like the following :
sim_distance :: Preferences -> String -> String ->
Double sim_distance prefs p1 p2 = let si = keys $ intersection ( prefs ! p1 ) ( prefs ! p2 ) in case si of [ ] -> 0 otherwise -> 1 / ( 1 + sqrt sum_of_squares ) where sum_of_squares = sum [ (( prefs ! p1 ! item ) - ( prefs ! p2 ! item ) ) ^ 2 | item <- si ]
Of course , I could have also used a fold in order to calculate the sum of squares in order to have one operation instead of two , the list comprehension and the sum of that list .
But , I find that the list comprehension is much more readable in many scenarios .
Now , we can run through this to calculate the differences between Lisa Rose and Gene Seymour :
* Main > sim_distance critics " Lisa Rose " " Gene Seymour " 0.29429805508554946
Moving onto the more sophisticated Pearson Coefficient , we find that implementing this is pretty straight forward as with before .
This finds the items rated by both individuals , then calculates the sum of squares of the ratings , then uses the Pearson score ( a not so intuitive formula ) to calculate our final score .
This might look like the following :
sim_pearson :: Preferences -> String -> String ->
Double sim_pearson prefs p1 p2 = let si = keys $ intersection ( prefs ! p1 ) ( prefs ! p2 ) n = fromIntegral $ length si in case n of 0 -> 0 otherwise -> let sum1 = sum [ prefs !
p1 ! item | item <- si ] sum2 = sum [ prefs !
p2 ! item | item <- si ] sum1Sq = sum [ prefs !
p1 ! item ^ 2 | item <- si ] sum2Sq = sum [ prefs !
p2 ! item ^ 2 | item <- si ]
pSum = sum [ ( prefs ! p1 ! item ) * ( prefs ! p2 ! item ) | item <- si ] num = pSum - ( sum1 * sum2 / n ) den = sqrt (( sum1Sq - sum1 ^ 2 / n ) * ( sum2Sq - sum2 ^ 2 / n ) ) in case den of 0 -> 0 otherwise -> num / den
Now we can calculate much as above the similarity between the two noted critics :
* Main > sim_pearson critics " Lisa Rose " " Gene Seymour 0.39605901719066977
Lastly , we can get the top matches for the person most similar to me .
Once again as with above , I will be using a list comprehension to compare one key to another .
topMatches :: Preferences -> String -> Int -> Similarity -> [ ( Double , String ) ] topMatches prefs person n similarity = take n $ reverse $ sort [ ( similarity prefs person other , other ) | other <- keys prefs , other /= person ]
Once again , we can check for the matches most similar to Lisa Rose :
* Main > topMatches critics " Lisa Rose " 3 sim_pearson [ ( 0.9912407071619299 , " Matt " ) , ( 0.7470178808339965 , " Jack Matthews " ) , ( 0.5940885257860044 , " Mick LaSalle " ) ]
This has been a great exercise in getting to know a language .
What better than to take code from another language and learn to express it in another paradigm , from imperative to functional ?
This has been a great opportunity to rid ourselves of such things as imperative loops , mutable data structures and so on .
With the extra enforcement that Haskell puts upon you , you find even more interesting and potentially better ways of solving the problem in a more functional style .
You can find the entire code here .
Refactoring the F# Code Base
Now that we had that brief Haskell lesson , let ’s get back to my F# codebase .
How can I learn from what I just did in Haskell ?
Well , I can clean up the code base like I did above by using type aliasing such as the following :
type Preferences = Map < string , Map < string , float >> type Similarity = Preferences -> string -> string -> float
Along with this , my helper functions could use some more oomph .
For example , it would be helpful to have an intersection function which would return only the items with keys from both maps .
Secondly , we could add others such as keys which gets us a key collection from a given map and so on :
[ < AutoOpen > ] module Operators = let ( ||> ) ( x , y ) f = f x y module Seq = open System .
Linq let rev : ' a seq -> ' a seq = Enumerable .
Reverse module Map = let keys ( m: Map < ' k , ' a > ) = m |> Seq.map ( fun kvp -> kvp.Key ) ///
Left leaning union let union m1 m2 = ( m1 , m2 ) ||> Map.fold_right Map.add ///
Left leaning intersection let intersect m1 m2 = ( m2 , Map.empty ) ||> Map.fold_right ( fun k _ acc -> match Map.tryfind k m1 with | None -> acc | Some x -> Map.add k x acc )
These are any number of these little functions that I use in my F# that I hope one day may be in the base libraries , but until then , these suit me well .
With the intersect now in place , I can rewrite my Euclidean Distance function to look something like this :
// Returns a distance - based similarity score for p1 and p2 let sim_distance ( prefs : Preferences ) p1 p2 = //
Get the list of shared items let si = Map.intersect prefs . [ p1 ] prefs . [ p2 ] |> Map.keys //
No ratings in common , return 0 match Seq.length si with | 0 -> 0 . | _ -> //
Add up the squares of all the differences let sum_of_squares = seq { for item in si -> pown ( prefs . [ p1 ] .[item ] - prefs .[ p2 ] .[item ] ) 2 } |> Seq.sum 1 . / ( 1 . + ( sqrt sum_of_squares ) )
Each of the formulas that we have can easily be rewritten to use this style as I have above .
By refactoring this behavior into common functions such as the Map.intersect , we ’re able to clean up our code significantly .
Turning our attention to our topMatches , we can clean this up as well , but changing the type signatures .
// Returns the best matches for person from the prefs dictionary let topMatches ( prefs : Preferences ) person n ( similarity : Similarity ) = seq { for other in Map. keys prefs do if person <> other then yield ( similarity prefs person other , other ) } |> Seq.sort_by fst |> Seq.rev |> Seq.take n
Much cleaner !
Many cases
I find that code I write six months ago that I could easily make a few changes here and there to clean it up in one fashion or another .
In this case , it ’s no more than just a couple of weeks !
Conclusion
As the Real World Haskell book club continues , we will be digging further into not only the book , but also other algorithms as well to see how we can accomplish some of these more interesting things such as item recommendation in a purely functional style .
I ’ve found that one of the best ways to learning the language is to take some imperative code samples and rewrite them in a pure functional style .
This not only teaches you the syntax of the language , but also what makes functional programming quite different than imperative .
In the next posts , I will be getting back to more Colllective Intelligence including item similarity and revisiting Slope One as well .

S even blasts rocked suburban trains in Mumbai on Tuesday evening , Police Commissioner A N Roy has said .
The police control room has reported that 174 passengers have been killed and more than 300 injured .
PTI reports that the blasts took place in a span of 30 minutes in first class compartments of suburban trains .
As the blasts ripped apart train compartments , mangled bodies of passengers were hurled out and survivors , many of them bleeding profusely , jostled to come out , leading to chaotic scenes .
The blasts occured between 6 pm and 6.30 pm at Matunga , Mahim ( central Mumbai ) , Bandra , Khar ( in north - west Mumbai ) , Borivili , Jogeshwari and Mira Road railway stations ( in north Mumbai ) .
Rediff.com 's Syed Firdaus Ashraf , who was at Mahim railway station soon after reports of the blast came in , said he could see one train compartment was completely blown up in the explosion , and people were carrying bodies away .
Commuters said an explosion went off in the men's first class compartment on a Western Railway local , which left Churgate station in South Mumbai at 1754 , as it was leaving Mahim station on track 3 at around 1820 hours .
The chronology of the seven bomb blasts that ripped through the seven suburban trains at various stations during the peak hour on Tuesday evening is as follows :
Khar -- 1824 hrs
Bandra -- 1824 hrs
Jogeshwari -- 1825 hrs
Mahim -- 1826 hrs
Mira Road -- 1829 hrs
Matunga -- 1830 hrs
Borivali -- 1835 hrs
A fire brigade official who came on the scene later said he believes that more than 25 injured were removed from the bombed out compartment .
Advocate Chandrakant Dalvi , who was travelling to his home in Dahisar by this compartment , was sitting on the tracks in a daze when rediff .
com 's reporters met him .
He said he could not hear anything in his left ear .
He had already got in touch with his relatives to say he was safe , but he had not told them that he was on the train .
The fire brigade personnel were sending him to the nearest hospital for a check - up .
He said he would take a cab and go home .
Around the tracks seat - cushioning material was lying around , among chappals and shoes and bags .
Luggage removed from the compartment was lying on the other side .
Outside the station the road had been cordoned off and two fire engines were posted .
But onlookers could view the wreckage from the footbridge and the road .
Two local trains were halted on either side of the bombed train and there was a rush of people leaving the station who were hitching rides home with lorries and tempos .
TV channel CNN - IBN was reporting that atleast 15 people were killed in the Matunga / Mahim blast .
The Western Railway has suspended its suburban services soon after the blasts .
Local telephone lines were jammed as panic - stricken commuters called their near and dear ones to alert them of the blasts .
Commuters said there was no sign of the police even 30 minutes after the blasts .
A PTI reporter at Santa Cruz station said a blast rocked a Borivali - bound local at 1824 hours , and seven to eight injured commuters jumped out of the speeding train in panic .
At least 10 bodies were brought to the KEM Hospital in central Mumbai , and another 20 seriously injured people were admitted to it .
A few more injured were reportedly taken to the government hospital at Sion in central Mumbai , Bhabha Hospital and V N Desai Hospital from the blast sites in western Mumbai suburbs , hospital sources said .
The police have cordoned off all railway stations on the Western line and strict frisking and checking was being carried out at the Central and Harbour sections of local train services .
Police suspect that it is a pre-planned subversive plot similar to the explosions that had rocked Mumbai in 1993 , 2002 and 2003 .
