Yoga originates from India and dates back some 5,000 years
High - security Ringerike jail near Oslo offered the classes to eight inmates on a trial basis earlier this year .
Prison warden Sigbjoern Hagen said some of the inmates became more irritable and agitated and had trouble sleeping .
He said the prison did not have the resources to treat emotions unleashed by the deep breathing exercises .
The yoga group expressed surprise at the prison 's findings .
It said the project had been tested successfully on some 100,000 prisoners in around 15 countries , the AFP news agency reported .
" The reactions we received from the prisoners who participated in the classes were very varied , ranging from completely positive to completely negative , " Mr Hagen reportedly wrote in a letter to the group .
On the negative side , the yoga had provoked " strong reactions : agitation , aggression , irritability , trouble sleeping and mental confusion " , he said .
The deep breathing exercises are an essential element of Yoga , which originated in India more than 5,000 years ago and aims to harmonise mind , body and spirit .
But such exercises could make inmates more dangerous by unblocking their psychological barriers , Mr Hagen was quoted as saying .

 How weird is too weird ?
How freaky too freaky ?
At what point does charm call out for ridicule ?
These are the questions that arise when considering the new " sport " of chessboxing .
It is Friday night , and doubtless there are better things to do than to pack into a refurbished theater of blue movies and focus the eyes on a couple of anonymous Europeans crouching over a chessboard .
They marshal tiny pieces against one another in a battle of quiet strategy .
Sound and movement are of the faintest quality .
It is as though you have barged into a stranger 's parlor .
There may yet be time to sneak away .
But then a bell rings and the hall fills with loud music .
There are hoots and yells from the darkened sections of seats , along with other signals of unshackled enthusiasm .
When the bell rings once more and the eyes refocus , you notice the chess players have begun to punch each other in the nose and in the ribs .
There is blood .
This is a fight , and it's not bad at that , the theater having transformed into an arena of genuine athletic pursuit .
This is no parlor game after all .
It is chess and it is boxing , and doubt has begun to fade into curiosity .
This may be strange , but it is strangely worth a look .
" Sport " inspired by a comic book
The rules of chessboxing are such :
Two competitors face each other in 11 alternating rounds , six of chess , five of boxing .
A bout begins with chess , which is played on a board placed directly in the middle of the ring .
Each round of chess lasts four minutes .
After each chess round , the bell sounds , and workmen remove the chessboard for a two - minute round of boxing , the gloves go back on , the punching recommences .
Participants win by way of knockout , checkmate , referee 's decision , or if his opponent exceeds the allotted total of 12 minutes for an entire match on the chessboard .
Those are the basics , but they do little to answer the overriding question :
Why ?
To begin to answer this , you must confront an unlikely figure , a Dutch artist who often goes by the name of the Joker .
Iepe Rubingh stands at this moment in a Cologne boxing gym .
It 's a few days before fight night , and Rubingh oversees a couple of chessboxers as they sweat out their final frustrations .
Zoran Mijatovic bends through the ring ropes and takes a seat at a nearby chessboard , where he battles Rubingh for a few minutes before stepping back into the ring for further sparring .
Mijatovic , 28 , a Croatian , spends his days welding ships along the Adriatic Sea .
He is dark - haired and burly , and he expounds freely on whatever comes to mind .
" No drinking , no women , " he gasps , reflecting on the difficulties of his monastic training as he takes a quick gulp of water .
" It 's very , very difficult .
When I finish , I will be very happy .
I need some beautiful experience . "
This certainly sounds like boxing .
And unfortunately for Mijatovic , it looks just like it , too , as the gym is packed at the moment with nothing very pretty .
There are mostly sweat - through kickboxers here , keeping to themselves in a far corner , near a poster of vintage - period Mike Tyson wearing a championship belt and a flesh - grinding scowl .
There are also abundant photos and magazine clippings of Muhammad Ali .
And there is a movie poster for " Das Comeback , " the German - dubbed version of " Cinderella Man , " a theme that may figure most prominently in this scenario .
Mijatovic has n't boxed seriously in a dozen years , and his trainer has been with him here in Cologne for a grand total of two days .
" He has a powerful punch , " says the trainer , a compact , muscled man named Et Arslan , who is doing his best to be supportive .
" And that 's it . "
By the shape of him , Mijatovic is not afraid of a beer .
Nor does he exhibit any panic when talk turns to his upcoming opponent , Frank Stoldt , a Berlin riot police commander .
" I am so strong in all of my punches , " Mijatovic says .
" I , myself , am scared of my right hand .
I am more afraid of the ring girls than Frank . "
The two will fight for the European championship of chessboxing .
It is a flimsy designation because the sport has only a few handfuls of genuine participants .
But you gotta start somewhere .
Iepe ( pronounced ee-pay ) Rubingh , chessboxing 's Don King , has big plans , and they stem from his belief in the duality of man  the cerebral and the physically courageous .
" Chessboxing makes you fit for life , " Rubingh says , running a hand over his red - tinted buzz cut .
" It polishes you . "
This is an odd piece of sincerity from Rubingh , 32 , who has concentrated his efforts over the years on toying with public perceptions as a painter , photographer and performance artist .
One of his outdoor art installations , called the Berlin Miracle , involves a tree that suddenly and unpredictably sprinkles rain .
Another of his stunts took place in Tokyo , where he and a dozen helpers ran crime scene tape across a busy evening intersection , clogging car and foot traffic until the police stepped in .
Rubingh wore a court jester 's outfit for the prank , and he continued to wear it for another week in a Japanese jail .
Just now , on his laptop , Rubingh shows a video of the incident , wherein several cops are escorting him into seclusion .
He bears the smirk of the insolent .
Soon enough , the chessboxing group leaves the gym and retires to Grunfeld , a chess - themed watering hole in Cologne 's central district .
Vaguely erotic charcoal sketches of rooks and queens hug the walls .
Here on the checked tables the chess training continues .
Rubingh 's chessboxers spar at the gym , while many of them also have chess coaches .
Rubingh cracks a copy of a hardcover Serbian comic book .
He runs a finger along a few panels picturing a man with a leg that has been shorn off at the knee , gushing blood .
This is where Rubingh got his idea for chessboxing .
The comic , " Alexander Nikopol Gesamtausgabe , " is part of a trilogy created by Enki Bilal , a Serbian comic book legend .
It tells the story of an apocalyptic society of escalated violence , set in the year 2034 .
In this world , hockey is played with steel , stick blades sharpened into knives .
And two men box one another on a chessboard floor , the match ending with one player braining the other with the queen .
Rubingh's version of chessboxing conforms , more or less , to the comic book representation .
There is no blinding of participants , but there is a fin de siecle feel to the whole affair , with Rubingh talking an awful lot about how the sport combines elements of the complete man , one who is prepared for any eventuality , not a pure brute , not a hopeless nerd .
Rubingh foresees a day when his sport will gain Olympic status and even go on to resolve implacable global conflicts .
" The future chessboxer will be a grandmaster and a professional boxer , " Rubingh says .
" Chessboxing could even solve the problem in the Middle East .
I want to hold a chessboxing match between an Israeli and a Palestinian , and the winner will get to decide what happens to Israel . "
Iepe Rubingh is not crazy ; he just sounds like it .
He 's as crazy as one need be to pull off something like this , prevailing upon people to take chessboxing seriously .
Rubingh is as much showman and promoter as he is anything else .
Testament to this is the fact that he was able to attract 800 people to the first World Championship of Chessboxing in November 2003 in Amsterdam .
Rubingh himself fought in that match  after nine months of training , transforming the Joker into a chessboxer  against a boxer called Luis the Lawyer .
Rubingh won the title , and then took his show on the road a year later , with a showcase in Tokyo , where he fought against a guy called Yoichiro the Wicked .
Last September , Rubingh held the first European chessboxing championship , between a German and a Bulgarian , in Berlin .
This match served to promote the opening , also in Berlin , of the first all - chessboxing gym , which now has 40 or so members , all of them sliding off the gloves at the end of each sparring round to wrap delicate fingers around tiny chess pieces .
The riot cop makes the scene
On the afternoon of fight night , the riot policeman arrives from Berlin .
Frank Stoldt , 36 and a cop for 16 long seasons , presents a sobering alternative to his Croatian opponent  lean where Mijatovic is beefy , laconic where Mijatovic loves to gab .
Stoldt hangs around a Cologne police precinct as a video crew shoots some raw footage of him in his element .
" Very straight , very sober , that 's my style , " he says .
" I am a policeman and I stand for right . "
Stoldt learned about chessboxing over the Internet ( where else ? ) , and as a former kickboxing champion and longtime chess player , he figured the sport presented an advantageous mix .
Plus , the man was looking for something outside the day job  leading a platoon of 30 riot police into Berlin 's toughest situations .
" I believe in a divine plan and divine order , " Stoldt says .
" I plan on winning this fight , and I will let the cosmic order take care of the rest . "
This is Rubingh 's greatest mark of success , the fact that he can attract a cop and a longshoreman to his " art project , " without them considering it art in the least .
This round of Rubingh 's performance art has gone beyond tongue - in - cheek and into the realm of sincere endeavor .
It has crossed over , jumped off the pages of a futuristic comic book , zipped through the imagination of a professional provocateur , and been made manifest and masculine through the participation of some genuinely tough customers .
As with all performance art , there are moments when you 're not sure if you 're supposed to take chessboxing seriously .
( The PR material for Rubingh 's World Chess Boxing Organisation [ WCBO ] does n't much help : " Within a very short period of time , chessboxing has expanded the realms of the performing arts . "
Is this the ballet ? )
But then you are confronted with Stoldt 's riot police demeanor , and you realize that this is no joke .
Fight night dispels all doubts ...
Well , some
Still , the initial reaction is always one of befuddlement .
At the Cologne hotel , they have never heard of chessboxing .
" Sounds like Japanese TV show , " says the manager .
He turns to a bellhop , gauging him for knowledge .
" Strange stuff , ja ? "
" Ja , strange stuff , " agrees the bellhop .
" Strange sports , ja ? "
" Ja , strange sports . "
Fight night has arrived , and all doubts will be dispelled .
A long line leads to the entrance of Gloria , the theater that 's hosting the matches .
The place exists in a soft glow of indirect lighting and a low , dinner theater hum of conversation .
A disco ball spins red over the bar and the crushed velvet of the wall serves as backdrop to the large , rolling cursive " Gloria , " which lends a touch of class to the affair .
Projected onto the screen behind the ring is the WCBO 's insignia : a boxing glove grasping a rook .
Down in the bowels of the theater , the two chessboxers on the undercard  they will fight for the Cologne championship  go through their prefight routines .
Jan Mielke jumps rope like a pro , skipping , hopping , crossing the rope in the air .
Stefan Dittrich wraps his hands before slipping on his gloves to check the fit .
Dittrich , 28 , a student at the Cologne Sports University , read about the sport in the local paper .
" My family thinks I 'm stupid for chessboxing , " he says , while acknowledging that he does n't much care , having delved into the difficulties of the sport for long enough to know that this is for real .
" Chess is harder , " he says , " because you can train to become a good boxer .
But you need to know chess for a long time . "
Mielke , 32 , gained 17 pounds in the two weeks leading up to the fight .
At 155 , he is still a slim 6 - footer , which makes his prediction for the fight unsurprising : " I 'm gonna beat him by checkmate . "
Once the two meet in the ring , two things become abundantly clear : Mielke can't handle Dittrich 's big left hook , and Dittrich plays an impatient , unnecessarily risky game of chess .
In the first round of chess , the two men fly through their prearranged opening salvos , which end with Dittrich losing his knight .
This means that in order to recover in the overall match , he must box well , which he does , battering the shorter , lighter Mielke around the ring .
But when they return to the chessboard , their hearts racing , blood feeding their muscles and starving their brains , Mielke quickly puts Dittrich into check .
With the gloves back on , Dittrich continues hounding Mielke into forgetting the fine jump rope and shadowbox form he displayed in the dressing room .
After another round of chess , during which Dittrich stalls for time with his queen in danger , he pounds Mielke with an energetic flurry of punches , realizing that he has n't much chance left in the chess portion of the match .
The desperation is obvious .
When the bell rings at the end of the third boxing round , Mielke has survived the onslaught , and a red mouth guard shows through his wide smile .
In the fourth chess round , Dittrich comes up against his 12 - minute time limit , having stalled through the last few rounds .
Mielke chases his opponent 's queen around the board , until finally Dittrich 's minutes elapse and the match ends with a very loud whimper .
The lights come up in the Gloria , and the crowd of several hundred roars its approval as Mielke raises the city championship trophy over his head .
Down below in the locker rooms , there is not so much enthusiasm .
With Stoldt and Mijatovic locked away and meditating on what 's to come in the main event , there is no joking .
Stoldt enters the ring to Frankie Goes to Hollywood , which can't possibly be a good sign .
As the first chess round opens , it 's clear that this fight will be different from the last , as each player moves with intense deliberation .
A Berlin actor friend of Rubingh 's calls the chess action blow - by - blow over the P.A. system , Stoldt and Mijatovic wearing headphones to screen out all distractions and block possible coaching .
They trade a few pieces and end up dead even as the bell sounds and they slip on the gloves .
The nature of the first boxing round resembles the recent chess play , as each assumes a classic stance , feeling out his opponent , risking little .
Then it 's back to the chess , where they begin to carve the board in two , diagonally with their pawns .
Mijatovic begins an attack at Stoldt 's knight , but is thwarted .
Draped in white towels , the two men stare daggers into the chessboard , as a single bright spotlight washes the table in a godly glow .
The boxing opens up in the second round .
Mijatovic drops his left , because Stoldt refuses to lead with his right .
But this looks like a ploy , because when Mijatovic tries to use that left to the body , he pays for it , as Stoldt pounds him , punishing him with a long , stiff reach .
When the two return to the board for their third round of chess , Stoldt is markedly more composed than the Croatian .
Having gained the upper hand in boxing , he quickly does the same on the board , putting Mijatovic only a handful of moves away from checkmate .
With the chess well in hand , Stoldt risks nothing in the next boxing round .
Mijatovic , meanwhile , has begun to tire of Stoldt 's defense and superior size and stamina .
When the two settle down to the fourth round of chess , Mijatovic 's face scrunches into obvious and overwhelming perplexity , and three moves away from checkmate , he knocks over his king , conceding the match .
The two fighters gather in the lobby of the Gloria a few minutes later for interviews .
" One mistake in chess , and it 's over , " says Stoldt , his serious demeanor magnified by the hard - earned sweat that rolls down his face .
Mijatovic , meanwhile , fields questions about why he surrendered instead of soldiering on , stalling for time on the chessboard so he could face Stoldt at least one more time with the gloves on .
" You really think I could have won in the boxing ? " Mijatovic asks .
" Me , no . "
And here is revealed a flaw .
One must summon a lot of heart to box ; the chess portion of the match gave Mijatovic an easy out , while bilking the paying crowd of a few more rounds of what was a pretty good go at chessboxing .
But it 's still early in the life of the sport , and the spectacle of it works well , all considered .
Interest also has spread to the United States , where Rubingh has established contact with several boxing gyms in New York , Los Angeles and Boston .
He is planning the first chessboxing match for early 2007 in either L.A. or New York , with about 15 fighters already having applied to take part .
Hovering about the scene just now is Rubingh , who has won the right to take it easy after several weeks of playing what he calls " chessboxing 's Don King . "
He orders one of Cologne 's famous short beers up at the bar , and he reflects on the nature of his art project - cum - sports league .
" I do n't like having borders between things , " he says .
" People are too focused on classifying sport in only one way .
Life is much broader than that . "
As he drains his glass and orders another , the Joker could n't be more sincere .
How weird ?
Just weird enough .

Elephant 2000 : A Programming Language Based on Speech Acts
John McCarthy , Stanford University
I meant what I said , and I said what I meant .
An elephant 's faithful , one hundred percent !
moreover ,
An elephant never forgets !
Abstract :
Elephant 2000 is a proposed programming language good for writing and verifying programs that interact with people ( e.g. transaction processing ) or interact with programs belonging to other organizations ( e.g. electronic data interchange )
Communication inputs and outputs are in an I - O language whose sentences are meaningful speech acts identified in the language as questions , answers , offers , acceptances , declinations , requests , permissions and promises .
The correctness of programs is partly defined in terms of proper performance of the speech acts .
Answers should be truthful and responsive , and promises should be kept .
Sentences of logic expressing these forms of correctness can be generated automatically from the form of the program .
Elephant source programs may not need data structures , because they can refer directly to the past .
Thus a program can say that an airline passenger has a reservation if he has made one and has n't cancelled it .
Elephant programs themselves can be represented as sentences of logic .
Their extensional properties follow from this representation without an intervening theory of programming or anything like Hoare axioms .
Elephant programs that interact non-trivially with the outside world can have both input - output specifications , relating the programs inputs and outputs , and accomplishment specifications concerning what the program accomplishes in the world .
These concepts are respectively generalizations of the philosophers ' illocutionary and perlocutionary speech acts .
Programs that engage in commercial transactions assume obligations on behalf of their owners in exchange for obligations assumed by other entities .
It may be part of the specifications of an Elephant 2000 programs that these obligations are exchanged as intended , and this too can be expressed by a logical sentence .
Human speech acts involve intelligence .
Elephant 2000 is on the borderline of AI , but the article emphasizes the Elephant usages that do not require AI .

Lieberman Hires Republican Pollster
James Joyner · · 10 comments
Joe Lieberman ’s transformation into the quasi-Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate is nearly complete , now that he ’s hired the top Republican polling firm .
Sen .
Joe Lieberman continued retooling his campaign staff Friday , hiring a nationally known pollster and media consultant to assist in his independent re-election bid .
Lieberman hired Democratic consultant Josh Isay , who has worked for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , and Republican pollster Neil Newhouse , who lists popular Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell among his clients .
“ They are not just among the best in their respective businesses , but they bring a deep knowledge of Connecticut from across the political spectrum , which will be essential to our effort to build a broad coalition of Democrats , Republicans , and independents , ” Lieberman said in a release .
Those of you who have followed my full disclosure notices are aware that my wife is a VP at POS ; those who have n’t are now .
The move is generating a little buzz .
TNR ’s Jason Zengerle links to POS ’ very long political client list and observes , “ You wo n’t find any Democrats . ”
Hotline ’s Chuck Todd adds ,
The more curious hiring , of course , is Newhouse , a partner in one of the most prestigious Republican polling firms in the country , Public Opinion Strategies .
On the merits , Newhouse is a great hire as he and his firm have one of the best reputations in the business , both with their clients and with the media , including us .
But what makes the hiring curious is that Newhouse is a Republican and has a slew of clients who will likely raise the ire of Democrats , particularly activist Democrats .
This cycle , Newhouse ’s most notable client is PA Sen.
Rick Santorum .
( Subscribers , click here of The Hotline ’s consultant scorecard . )
The Lieberman release , of course , makes no mention of Santorum , but does note Newhouse ’s client relationship with the very popular GOP CT Gov. Jodi Rell .
Newhouse is also the chief pollster for one of the Democrats ’ top House targets , CT 02 GOP Rep.
Rob Simmons .
In ’04 , the firm worked for the biggest Dem killer of the cycle , John Thune , who knocked off Tom Daschle .
And in ’ 02 , the firm ’s biggest name client ?
None other than a Bush , Jeb Bush , that is , in FL .
It ’s a surprising move , to be sure .
POS has a varied public policy clientele but , as far as I know , has been exclusively Republican in its political clients through its fifteen year history .
Then again , President Bush and RNC Chair Ken Mellman have all but endorsed Lieberman ’s candidacy .
Presumably , they ’ve made the calculation that they ’re not going to lose clients over this one .
With this and Santorum , they ’ve easily got the two most high profile races this season .
It ’ll make for an interesting three months .
UPDATE : Looking through my old posts to see what I ’ve written about Lieberman in the past ( 160 - odd posts mention him , probably putting him behind only 2004 nominee John Kerry among active Senators )
I came across this from December 2003 :
I feel sorry for Lieberman and think he ’s probably the Democrat currently in the race who is both most suited to govern and who would be the most appealing in the general election . *
But he sold his soul to be Al Gore ’s running mate , sacrificing much of his main selling point–integrity –in doing so .
And he got nothing in return .
The Democrat faithful still do n’t like him all that much and even Gore is n’t grateful .
Indeed , for a man who got elected to the Senate in part because of the active endorsement of National Review and the support of conservatives tired of Lowell Wiecker , it is somewhat ironic that he ’s come full circle : the only people who support him now are Republicans .
That seems more true now than then .
For example , SSP ’s James L. is positively apoplectic in a post entitled “ CT - Sen : Lieberman Hires Democrat Slayer ” ( Note to self : See if Neil already has this t- shirt . ) :
The most troubling bit about the news may rest in the fact that Newhouse ’s other Connecticut client is Rep. Rob Simmons , who is a top target of the DCCC and Joe Courtney .
Lieberman is now essentially using Republican tools , Republican capital , and Republican consultants to mobilize the same Republican voters that Courtney and the other Democratic challengers need to de-energize in order to win .
The pure gall of this move is disgusting , and it paints a sharp picture that Lieberman is for himself and himself only .
He does n’t care about electing three new Democrats to the House–he ’s more than willing to toss them overboard if it means he can work the Republican field and win .
I wonder how Lieberman ’s Senate Democratic colleagues feel now that they know that Lieberman is paying the same guy who ended the political careers of Tom Daschle and Max Cleland .
I wonder if they feel as good about letting Lieberman keep his seniority and committee assignments .
Or , maybe the Democrats should have re-nominated the 2000 VP candidate who helped make Florida a toss - up and who votes with the caucus 90 % of the time ?
UPDATE : Some discussion over at Crosstabs , although nothing yet from POS ’ Rob Autry .
Former POS ’er Bob Moran is laughing hysterically–or as much as one can in text form , anyway .

入力部品と対応するラベルを明確にする
余裕があるのなら入力部品は縦並びのほうがいいです。横並びにするときは、入力部品と対応するラベルが明確になるよう、項目間に空白をもうけるなどしましょう。 また、明示的にLABEL要素で示すのも良い方法です。特に、チェックボックスやラジオボタンで有効です。入力部品だけでなく、ラベルをクリックしても、入力部品が反応します。アクセシビリティ上も良いことです。
LABEL要素で明示する場合にはLABEL要素のfor属性と入力部品のid属性が同じ値になるようにして下さい。例とHTMLソースを出します。 はい
いいえ
< input type =" radio " name = " yesor " id =" yes " checked >
< label for =" yes " >はい</label ><br>
< input type =" radio " name = " yesor " id = " no " >
< label for =" no " >いいえ</ label >< br> < input type =" submit " value= " 送信 " >
必須項目は必須と明示する
入力が必須な項目については、入力の前に必須であることを漢字で示して下さい。記号や色だけで必須項目であるのを示すのはアクセシビリティ上よくありません。
入力方法を明示す る
電話番号、郵便番号、クレジットカード番号など、ハイフンを入れるのか入れないのかわからない場合があります。入力前に入力例を示しましょう。もしくは、-で区切って入力部分を区切りましょう。
デフォルトとする値には配慮する
アンケートの場合は、中立性を保つようにして下さい。紙面で行うアンケートとは異なり、ラジオボタンで選択する場合はデフォルト値が入っていることが多いですが、（というより、(X)HTMLではラジオボタン群には１つのデフォルト値を選択しておかなければなりません。）誘導的な回答をさせるようなデフォルト値にしないで下さい。
また、会員登録や資料請求などでも、メールマガジンの購読などを強要するような選択肢は慎むべきです。
リセットボタンは不 要
入力フォームで入力することを止める場合は、ブラウザを閉じてしまうのが大半です。わざわざ、<input type=" reset " >のタグを挿入する必要はありません。すなわち、リセットボタンは不要です。
また、入力項目を訂正するために「戻る」などのボタンを付けるときは、「戻る」を先につけて下さい。これはアクセシビリティ上の配慮のためです。
ボタンのラベルと動作は一致させる
ボタンのラベルに書いてあることと、ボタンを押したときの動作は一致させるようにして下さい。「次へ」でいきなり入力完了やメール送信されても困ります。
エラーはまとめて返しましょう
入力エラーとなった場合は、エラーになった部分をまとめて返すようにして下さい。１つ１つ値をチェックしてエラーを返していると、怒られた気分が増していきます。
エラーメッセージは肯定的、かつ丁寧に示す
メッセージは否定形ではなく、肯定形で示すようにして下さい。
たとえば、半角英数字のみとなっている場合に他の文字種が入っていた場合には、「半角英数字で入力されていません。」ではなく、「半角英数字で入力して下さい。」と示すようにしましょう。
また、メッセージの言葉遣いも丁寧にして下さい。ただでさえ、エラーを犯してしまってしょぼくれているところに追い打ちをかけるような真似はダメです。
エラーになった場合には正常な入力値を保持する
エラーになった後で入力画面に戻ると、入力した項目が全部消えるなんていうのは、最悪です。訪問者によっては、「もうええわ！」と拒絶反応を示すことでしょう。
パスワードなどを一部消すのも止めて下さい。新たなエラーの原因になります。私はよくこれで引っかかります。
個人情報 はPOSTで送る
FORM要素を使う場合 にPOSTメソッドで送るメリットは、URLに送った値が出ないことです。一方、GETで送るとURLに送った値が出てしまいます。URLから個人情報が漏れるようなことがないようにして下さい。
送信ができたら完了メッセージを出そう
フォームの送信ができた場合は、入力してくれた旨を感謝する完了メッセージを出しましょう。無事に送信された旨が訪問者に伝われば安心します。

Tamiflu - resistant bird flu kills 2 in Vietnam / Experts assess how findings may affect use of antiviral drug
Two teenagers who died of avian influenza in Vietnam earlier this year developed drug - resistant strains of the virus during treatment with Tamiflu , raising questions about the world 's reliance on the pills as the first line of defense against a potential flu pandemic .
A report published in today 's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine tells of the resistant strains and also describes how four other Vietnamese patients treated with Tamiflu , or oseltamivir , recovered after the drug appeared to have knocked down the H5N1 bird flu virus in their bloodstreams .
The report offers the most detailed clinical findings to date of Tamiflu treatment against bird flu , and it highlights both the promise and drawbacks of the drug that many nations are now stockpiling in case the H5N1 virus mutates into a form that transmits readily among people .
" This is valuable information , " said University of Virginia flu researcher Dr. Frederick Hayden , a leading expert in antiviral flu treatments .
" It 's an important scientific contribution that points out the limits of our current therapy , but also gives hope . "
The Bush administration announced plans last month for federal and state purchases of 75 million doses of Tamiflu to have on hand by 2007 -- at a $ 1.4 billion estimated cost .
Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said the development of Tamiflu - resistant strains of H5N1 was " completely predictable , " and he sees no reason to back away from stockpiling the drug .
" At this point in time , it 's the best drug we have , " he said .
In a commentary accompanying the study , Dr. Anne Moscona of Cornell University warned that the emergence of drug - resistant strains of avian influenza was " a matter of immediate concern . "
" It is becoming clear that more medication than the currently recommended doses may be required for adequate treatment , " she wrote .
But , with Tamiflu in short supply worldwide , each increase in the 10 - pill , five - day regimen means that even less of the drug will be available from global stockpiles if more pills are required for each successful treatment .
The Vietnamese study was led by Dr. Jeremy Farrar of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit , at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City , where seven of the eight patients in the study were treated .
Much of the article focused on the case of a 13 - year - old girl whose mother had just died of avian influenza .
Because bird flu was suspected , the girl was treated with Tamiflu one day after she developed a fever and cough .
Although the drug has been used frequently in bird flu cases , it has seldom been prescribed until it is too late to be of much help .
Animal studies suggest that the drug needs to be taken within 48 hours of the start of a flu bout to be most effective , but patients in Southeast Asia seldom reach a hospital until they 've been sick for a week .
Four days into the girl 's Tamiflu treatment , her health began to decline , and three days later she died .
Genetic fingerprints of virus taken from her four days after treatment began showed a single mutation that makes it resistant to Tamiflu .
An 18 - year - old girl also treated with the drug in January 2005 died 20 days into her illness , and she too tested positive for the resistant strain .
Two other patients in the study also died despite Tamiflu treatment , but showed no signs of resistant virus .
Tamiflu resistance has been documented in one previous study -- that of a Vietnamese girl who had taken the drug while healthy in a failed bid to prevent infection with the same virus that had afflicted her family .
She was sickened by a resistant strain , but fully recovered .
Four patients treated with Tamiflu in the latest study also recovered , and tests showed their improved health coincided with " rapid declines to undetectable levels " of their viral infections .
Terry Hurley , a spokesman for Tamiflu maker Roche , said viral resistance remains rare and might be controlled by adjustments in the treatments .
Another antiviral drug , Relenza , has also been shown in animal studies to suppress avian influenza -- and researchers say it has a chemical structure that makes it less prone to generate resistant strains .
The federal government has ordered 84,000 doses for the stockpile .
However , Relenza is costlier to produce , and must be inhaled -- a process that is known to cause problems for patients prone to respiratory problems .

Some of the people alleged to have been killed by lethal injection were in the Lakeside acute care patients ’ unit at Memorial , Mr. Foti said .
Test results on the bodies of the victims found morphine and midazolam hydrochloride , according to the affidavit .
Midazolam , commonly known by its brand name Versed , is sometimes used in patients in intensive care units to cause unconsciousness before and during surgery .
An exchange of dialogue quoted in the affidavit between Dr. Pou and an unidentified nurse executive said Dr. Pou told her : “ decisions had been made to administer lethal doses ” to patients remaining on the seventh floor of the unit who would not survive .
One patient reportedly said “ that burns ” when injected .
A statement from the Tenet Healthcare Corporation called the accusations that the three might have administered pain medication to hasten the deaths of certain patients “ disturbing . ”
“ If the allegations are proven true , the doctor and nurses named by the attorney general made these decisions without the knowledge , approval or acquiescence of the hospital or their key physician leaders , ” the Tenet statement said .
A lawyer for Dr. Pou , Rick Simmons , said that the authorities went to her house in Baton Rouge and arrested her in her scrubs .
She went through the booking process and was later released , he said .
Mr. Simmons said that the arrest warrants were issued on four counts for each of the women but that there were no formal charges yet .

The removal of two men from a holiday flight on the grounds that fellow passengers feared they were terrorists was condemned yesterday .
The pair , thought to be in their 20s and of Middle Eastern or Asian appearance , were removed from a flight to Manchester from Malaga , Spain , after passengers became suspicious of their behaviour .
In the early hours of Wednesday a number of passengers on Monarch Airlines flight ZB613 left the plane , refusing to fly unless the two men were removed , causing a three - hour delay .
Passengers are reported to have become suspicious after the men were overheard apparently speaking Arabic and seen repeatedly checking their watches , although this has not been confirmed by the airline .
Muslim MP Khalid Mahmood described the incident as " hugely irrational " .
" People need to get their senses back into order .
You can't just accuse anybody who's of Asian appearance and treat them like a terrorist , " said the Labour MP for Birmingham .
" If somebody is threatening anybody it 's understandable , but when they are just travelling for their own needs it 's not .
People just need to calm down . "
These sentiments were echoed by Ghayasuddin Siddiqui , of the Muslim Parliament of Britain , who described the incident as " sad and shocking " .
" We have got to find a better way where somebody 's look is not the basis for this kind of action - it has to be more intelligence - led , " he said .
And , warning that the incident was an example of what the Metropolitan police chief superintendent Ali Dizaei called a new offence of " travelling while Asian " , he said : " The greatest danger is that the extremists have succeeded in convincing Muslims and Arabs that the war on terror is n't a war on terror but a war on Islam and Muslims . "
The Islamic Human Rights Commission said " ever- increasing Islamophobia " related to the " war on terror " was to blame for the removal of the men , who were questioned by police and forced to fly back to Manchester later in the week .
A Monarch Airlines spokesman said the men attracted attention because " they were apparently acting suspiciously " , although he would not say what they had done .
" The flight attendants were sufficiently concerned to alert the crew , who in turn informed the security authorities at Malaga airport , " he said .
It is the latest in a number of scares since an alleged plot to bomb transatlantic flights was foiled .
Last week a flight from London to Washington was diverted to Boston because a female passenger was carrying a screwdriver , matches and hand cream , which are banned .
On Thursday morning , US authorities evacuated an airport in West Virginia after explosive residue was found on two containers in a passenger 's hand luggage .
Initial reports that the liquid inside the bottles had tested positive were later withdrawn .
Meanwhile , the transport secretary , Douglas Alexander , has revealed that airport security restrictions are to be made more " manageable " within days .
He plans to meet representatives of airports operator BAA to resolve outstanding issues .
Holidaymakers could face further disruption over the bank holiday weekend if present measures remain in place .
Almost two million people are expected to travel at what is usually one of the busiest times of the year .
There was a slow return to normal services last week , after the government reduced the threat level from " critical " to " severe " .
Although restrictions on hand luggage were relaxed , airport staff are still required to search half of all passengers .
People travelling through Stansted airport over the bank holiday weekend may find their plans disrupted by a two - day strike rather than security checks .
About 500 baggage and check - in staff employed by airport services group Swissport have voted to take industrial action over a pay dispute .
There were talks with the reconciliation service Acas yesterday to try to avert action .
The GMB union predicts that Stansted flights are likely to be " severely disrupted " if the strike goes ahead .
Review " This is a truly historical meeting of the established and new media , " said Les Moonves , the head of CBS , about his network 's new video partnership with Google .
Um , no , Les .
So far , it 's just a really crap web site .
If , like us , you expected the new and improved Google Video service to rival something like Apple 's iTunes store , then do yourself a favor and do n't visit the Google shop for a few months .
Google has done nothing to celebrate its unique access to shows such as CSI , Survivor and Star Trek .
Instead , the company has buried CBS 's shows beneath a dismal interface wrapped in a shambles of a delivery mechanism .
Think we 're being too harsh ?
Have a a look for yourself .
Most of Google 's exclusive , premium content from the likes of CBS , the NBA and the Charlie Rose show is trapped in a primitive pulldown menu .
That might not be so bad were it not for the thin , hopeless pulldowns .
Take CSI , for example .
If you highlight it , only one show appears at the time of writing - an episode called " Werewolves . "
Even MacGyver gets five episodes .
There 's a whopping two pages of basketball games and just two more pages of Brady Bunch episodes - not that the latter is a huge loss .
The Charlie Rose collection is the most impressive and at 99 cents a pop , it 's looking pretty good .
The only problem is that all 176 episodes are described as " Charlie Rose " and provide no information in the initial search about who is interviewed .
If you have a Charlie Rose fetish , that 's probably not so bad , but the rest of us are n't impressed .
Incidentally , if you do an episode search for " God , " the last entry is an interview with WSJ hack Walt Mossberg .
So , it 's pretty clear that the Google Video search has been infected by the same blog noise as the regular Google search engine .
" Each of us needs each other to take the next leap forward , " Moonves also said at last week 's CES conference in Las Vegas when the new Google Video was announced .
We wonder though if CBS is n't regretting its decision .
Did it buy into the same Google hype as everyone else ?
ABC must be laughing all the way to the bank as it rides iTunes to millions of sales .
Google has done some nice things such as providing fairly lengthy preview clips at the start of each video .
And , of course , this is n't a big media only thing .
Anyone can load their video onto the Google store and charge almost anything they want .
They can infect their files with the mysterious Google DRM or not .
Google , however , seems to have made the same mistake as companies such as Dell when competing with an Apple or a Sony .
It 's not enough to throw out some cheap MP3 player or web site and expect the standard rules of business to apply to consumers .
The Average Joe is willing to pay a bit more for quality in the consumer world rather than mess with some basic , hard - to - use product or service .
Google Video will no doubt improve over time .
Coming out with such a poor initial service though is a huge mistake .
Google would have done better to refine its product and release something that comes close to being Apple 's red - headed stepchild .
We 're not even sure what life form Google Video is .
It 's certainly not human . ®

Ah , it 's been a while .
I managed to get even better performance by precreating all the bitmaps for the cells .
Obvious really , but it 's now running pretty well .
Since the whole point of this exercise is for me to experiment with lisp features I 've been experimenting with storing an update and render closure in each cell .
This has worked out really nicely , allowing me to have a more efficient board update when opening up empty cells and also the ability to do neat effects like control the speed that the board opens up .
So the function below creates an update function that 'll expose surrounding cells on the next update :
It 's also possible to create animation effects by using an update function and a render function sharing the same closure :
So this one makes the invisible cell bitmap shrink to nothingness leaving the new one behind .
I can create higher - level update functions as well .
One useful one is delay , that just waits a certain number of frames before switching the given function in .
However , this leaves open the possibility of setting an update function over the top of another one that might be doing useful work .
We can deal with this nicely with a combine update function :
This runs both the update functions , eventually removing itself when one of the sub ones finishes .
As a debugging aid I can print out the current function on each cell , and it should be possible to set it up to inspect a particulary cell by clicking on it .
Very cool potential there .
The great thing about this is that means I can store arbitrary data on a cell and do processing on it without having to make room for it in my main cell datastrucure .
So by doing this I 've decoupled the update logic and animation data from my simple board representation .
Of course this sort of thing is n't limited to lisp , but it 's an interesting way to think about it that falls into place quite naturally .
My latest distraction is trying to get SLIME and CLISP to work better with macro argument lists .
I 've been doing some hacking replacing lisp 's standard defmacro with my own version that stores away some extra data , but I think the proper solution is going to be modifying CLISP itself .
Lockheed Martin ’s Skunk Works , famed for the U - 2 and Blackbird spy planes that flew higher than anything else in the world in their day , is trying for a different altitude record : an airplane that starts and ends its mission 150 feet underwater .
The Cormorant , a stealthy , jet - powered , autonomous aircraft that could be outfitted with either short - range weapons or surveillance equipment , is designed to launch out of the Trident missile tubes in some of the U.S. Navy ’s gigantic Cold War–era Ohio - class submarines .
These formerly nuke - toting subs have become less useful in a military climate evolved to favor surgical strikes over nuclear stalemates , but the Cormorant could use their now - vacant tubes to provide another unmanned option for spying on or destroying targets near the coast .
This is no easy task .
The tubes are as long as a semi trailer but about seven feet wide — not exactly airplane - shaped .
The Cormorant has to be strong enough to withstand the pressure 150 feet underwater — enough to cave in hatches on a normal aircraft — but light enough to fly .
Another challenge : Subs survive by stealth , and an airplane flying back to the boat could give its position away .
The Skunk Works ’s answer is a four - ton airplane with gull wings that hinge around its body to fit inside the missile tube .
The craft is made of titanium to resist corrosion , and any empty spaces are filled with plastic foam to resist crushing .
The rest of the body is pressurized with inert gas .
Inflatable seals keep the weapon - bay doors , engine inlet and exhaust covers watertight .
The Cormorant does not shoot out of its tube like a missile .
Instead an arm - like docking “ saddle ” guides the craft out , sending it floating to the surface while the sub slips away .
As the drone pops out of the water , the rocket boosters fire and the Cormorant takes off .
After completing its mission , the plane flies to the rendezvous coordinates it receives from the sub and lands in the sea .
The sub then launches a robotic underwater vehicle to fetch the floating drone .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Darpa ) is funding tests of some of the Cormorant ’s unique systems , including a splashdown model and an underwater - recovery vehicle .
The tests should be completed by September , after which Darpa will decide whether it will fund a flying prototype .

It ’s not like Victoria is a stranger to the world of modelling .
Last year she walked strutted her stuff on the catwalk sporting a Roberto Cavalli creation and modelled for Damon Dash ’s clothes range Roccawear .
Hmm ….
VB a style icon for Burberry .
And to put on weight ?
British tabloids are a classic .

Lifelong AA member David Barker , 58 , of Low Edges , Sheffield , died as he drove to a football match on 28 December .
When relatives went to move his car they found the battery was flat and called the AA , but were told they would have to take out a new policy .
The AA admitted it failed to show " the compassion and sensitivity " expected .
Mr Barker 's brother - in - law , Leonard Douglas , said when he called the AA he was told he would have to renew Mr Barker 's policy at a higher premium .
The AA was wrong to refuse service and did not show the compassion and sensitivity we expect in what was clearly an emotional situation
AA Road Operations Director , Steve Dewey
" We were in a situation where my brother - in - law had just died , " he said .
" They wanted to up his premium and I said why do you want to up his premium , he 's dead .
" We were devastated , he 'd always been in the AA .
I really do n't think it was right for them to treat us that way . "
AA Road Operations Director Steve Dewey said : " Our procedures allow for discretion to be used in sensitive situations such as this .
" Unfortunately , when dealing with thousands of calls each day human error occasionally happens , for which we apologise .
We have addressed this matter with the member of staff concerned .
" We apologise unreservedly for the distress caused to Mr Barker 's family at what was already an extremely difficult time .
" The AA was wrong to refuse service and did not show the compassion and sensitivity we expect in what was clearly an emotional situation . "
He said the AA had contacted the family and apologised for the mistake and the distress it had caused .
Is virtualization THE killer app for Linux ?
Will it become the application ( like Lotus 123 and WordPerfect were for the PC and MS - DOS back in the day ) that puts Linux into every office ?
If you follow computer news at all , you have no doubt been inundated recently with story after story about virtualization and how it will soon impact your server room .
But if you look a little deeper into what virtualization is offering , I think it has the POTENTIAL to be the next big thing ; for both servers and desktops .
While I think it is fair to say that the jury is still out on whether the Linux / OSS community or Microsoft ( as the standard - bearer for traditional , proprietary , closed - source software ) offers the best model for a " secure " operating system , I think everyone has to admit that Linux is ; a ) in the game , and b ) orders of magnitude more configurable than Windows is or will be in the immediate future .
For these reasons , here is what I foresee as a POSSIBLE outcome of " virtualization mania " ; the desktops ( in addition to the servers ) in a typical MS Windows shop will run Linux on the bare metal and Windows in some sort of virtual machine .
The benefits to virtualizing servers are fairly obvious and have been discussed at length for some time , but why would ( should ) you virtualize a desktop computer that only needs to run one instance of Windows ?
Here are my ideas :
1. Convenience -
The average office sets up a handful of preconfigured desktop images ( accounting , admin , engineering , sales , etc. ) that can be loaded and copied as needed .
2. Security -
In light of the ever increasing threat of malware , you can run a lean , stripped - down , locked - down version of Linux on the bare metal , minimizing outside access to your machine .
3. Recoverability - According to Microsoft (
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1945782,00.asp
) , security issues are serious enough to require an established worst - case - scenario recovery plan .
See # 1 above .
I know MS has its own virtualization hypervisor , and that they are giving it away a la early Internet Explorer , but in the long run I think the sheer size and complexity of MS code will preclude it from becoming a successful virtualization - host OS .
I am sure MS will control a significant portion of the virtualized servers running instances of Windows Server , but for the type of desktop virtualization I am thinking about , you will want the host OS to be as small ( disk and memory footprint ) and fast as possible .
I just think that Linux has too much to offer as a configurable OS for it not to fill this niche .
I think that running user applications within a virtualized OS environment , separated from the physical machine , is the wave of the future for all business computers ( servers and desktops ) , and I think this move toward virtualization will drive Linux onto the vast majority of these machines .
" I assume it will continue for several more weeks , and in a number of weeks we will be able to [ declare ] a victory , " Major General Udi Adam , the head of Israel 's northern command , said at a news conference .
Earlier , the United Nations general secretary , Kofi Annan , accused the Israeli military of carrying out a sustained bombing of the UN base on the Lebanon - Israel border that culminated in the killing of four unarmed monitors .
Mr Annan said he had suggested to the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , that they carry out a joint investigation into the events that led to the shelling of the " well - established and well marked " Unifil ( UN interim force in Lebanon ) post in the town of Khiyam .
" I spoke to Mr Olmert and he definitely believes it was a mistake and has expressed his deep sorrow , " Mr Annan told a press conference in Rome .
" But the shelling started in the morning and went on until after 7 pm .
You cannot imagine the anguish of the unarmed men and women peacekeepers who were there . "
The four monitors came from Austria , Canada , China and Finland .
Tonight , European Union and Chinese officials condemned the attack as " unacceptable " and the Irish government filed an official complaint to Israel after its senior UN peacekeeper made half a dozen warning calls over the bombings .
Jane Lute , the assistant secretary general for peacekeeping , told the UN security council that the base came under close Israeli fire 21 times - including 12 hits within 100 metres and four direct hits - from 1.20 pm until contact was lost with the four peacekeepers inside at 7.17 pm .
Ms Lute said the peacekeeping force had protested to the Israeli army after each firing incident .
The UN 's deputy secretary general , Mark Malloch Brown , and Ms Lute herself also made several calls to Israel 's mission to the UN " reiterating these protests and calling for an abatement of the shelling " , she said .
After contact with the base was lost , Unifil then won safe passage for two armoured personnel carriers to evacuate the position , she said .
They arrived at 9.30 pm " and found the shelter collapsed and major damage to the rest of the position " .
Despite negotiating safe passage , the APCs also came under Israeli attack , Ms Lute said .
The 2,000 - strong Unifil force , which sits on the Israel - Lebanon border , has suffered dozens of attacks and direct hits in the two - week conflict .
The deaths of the monitors cast a shadow over today 's meeting in Rome , where foreign ministers gathered to discuss the Israeli - Lebanese crisis .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , and the British foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , were among ministers attending the talks in Rome , which ended with no clear indication of when a ceasefire would be achieved .
Tonight , the Italian prime minister , Romano Prodi , said he would be willing to contribute his country 's troops to any UN multinational peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon .
Meanwhile , the Israeli military said eight soldiers had been killed and another 22 injured during intense fighting in the southern Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil .
Elsewhere , Israeli forces killed 19 Palestinians in fighting across the Gaza Strip , including at least nine militants , three children and a disabled man , medics and witnesses said .
Israel has stepped up air strikes and launched raids into Gaza to stop rocket attacks and recover a soldier captured by militants on June 25 .
The army has killed 140 Palestinians since it began its assault .
Elsewhere , the Israeli air force renewed its bombing of Tyre this evening , flattening an apartment block in one attack .
The strike appeared to have targeted the seven - storey building housing the headquarters of Sheik Nabil Kaouk , Hizbullah 's south Lebanon commander .
The building was empty but 12 people nearby were injured .
Israeli forces encircled Bint Jbeil yesterday , with one commander describing it as the " capital of Hizbullah " .
The army said then that it had killed up to 30 militants as it aimed to dismantle Hizbullah command posts there and destroy rocket launchers .
Mr Olmert was today facing mounting pressure to endorse calls for an immediate ceasefire amid claims that his position and that of the Bush administration were putting civilian lives at risk .
In Britain , aid agencies , religious groups and the public sector union , Unison , wrote an open letter to Tony Blair condemning his refusal to back the UN 's demands for a ceasefire .
The letter - signed by 14 organisations including Amnesty International , Christian Aid and the Muslim Council of Britain - warned that the UK government was diluting calls for peace .
" By failing to back the UN and call for an immediate ceasefire , the UK government has reduced the impact of international calls for an immediate halt to the violence , " the letter said .
A spokesman for Mr Blair said the prime minister was engaged " almost on an hourly basis " in trying to secure support for a stabilisation force and was ready to take " heat " from critics .
The government hoped to secure " broad agreement in principle " in Rome to the idea of a stabilisation force , the spokesman told reporters .
Israeli warplanes bombed 100 targets in southern Lebanon yesterday and one family of seven civilians was killed .
More than 400 Lebanese have been killed in total .
Hizbullah yesterday fired some 70 rockets into northern Israel , killing a 15 - year - old girl .
More than 40 Israelis have died in the violence , including 18 who have been killed by rockets .
26 Jun 2002 @ 01:50 , by Martin Oliver
On July 5th 1932 , in the middle of the Great Depression , the Austrian town of Wörgl made economic history by introducing a remarkable complimentary currency .
Wörgl was in trouble , and was prepared to try anything .
Of its population of 4,500 , a total of 1,500 people were without a job , and 200 families were penniless .
The mayor , Michael Unterguggenberger , had a long list of projects he wanted to accomplish , but there was hardly any money with which to carry them out .
These included repaving the roads , streetlighting , extending water distribution across the whole town , and planting trees along the streets .
Rather than spending the 40,000 Austrian schillings in the town ’s coffers to start these projects off , he deposited them in a local savings bank as a guarantee to back the issue of a type of complimentary currency known as ' stamp scrip ' .
This requires a monthly stamp to be stuck on all the circulating notes for them to remain valid , and in Wörgl , the stamp amounted 1 % of the each note ’s value .
The money raised was used to run a soup kitchen that fed 220 families .
Because nobody wanted to pay what was effectively a hoarding fee , everyone receiving the notes would spend them as fast as possible .
The 40,000 schilling deposit allowed anyone to exchange scrip for 98 per cent of its value in schillings .
This offer was rarely taken up though .
Of all the business in town , only the railway station and the post office refused to accept the local money .
When people ran out of spending ideas , they would pay their taxes early using scrip , resulting in a huge increase in town revenues .
Over the 13 - month period the project ran , the council not only carried out all the intended works projects , but also built new houses , a reservoir , a ski jump , and a bridge .
The people also used scrip to replant forests , in anticipation of the future cashflow they would receive from the trees .
The key to its success was the fast circulation of scrip within the local economy , 14 times higher than the schilling .
This in turn increased trade , creating extra employment .
At the time of the project , Wörgl was the only Austrian town to achieve full employment .
Six neighbouring villages copied the system successfully .
The French Prime Minister , Eduoard Dalladier , made a special visit to see the ' miracle of Wörgl ' .
In January 1933 , the project was replicated in the neighbouring city of Kirchbuhl , and in June 1933 , Unterguggenburger addressed a meeting with representatives from 170 different towns and villages .
Two hundred Austrian townships were interested in adopting the idea .
At this point , the central bank panicked , and decided to assert its monopoly rights by banning complimentary currencies .
The people unsuccessfully sued the bank , and later lost in the Austrian Supreme Court .
It then became a criminal offence to issue ' emergency currency ' .
Unterguggenberger was opposed to both communism and fascism , championing instead what he referred to as ' economic freedom ' .
Therefore , it was deeply ironic that the Wörgl experiment was first branded ' craziness ' by the monetary authorities , then a Communist idea , and some years later as a fascist one .
The town went back to 30 % unemployment .
In 1934 , social unrest exploded across Austria .
In 1938 , when Hitler annexed Austria , he was welcomed by many people as their economic and political saviour .
The 1920's had already seen a scrip currency called the ' wara ' in the German town of Schwanenkirchen .
This saved the town 's economy and kept a coal mine operating .
It started circulating more widely , and became part of a movement called ' Freiwirtschaft ' ( Free Economy ) , based on the ideas of the economist Silvio Gesell .
Central to Gesell 's ideas was the use of a hoarding fee of the kind used in Wörgl ( technically known as ' demurrage ' ) .
The soundness of such an idea was affirmed by John Maynard Keynes in his 1936 work ' General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money ' .
Perhaps the most groundbreaking feature of demurrage is that it is intrinsically anti-inflationary .
Whereas conventional currencies are progressively devalued by interest , anti-inflationary money steadily increases in value .
As each monthly stamp is added , the value of the note effectively increases by the stamp amount .
This is technically equivalent to a negative interest rate .
The present short - term focus of investments , and the consequent lack of long - term vision are exacerbated by interest - driven currency devaluation that , from a profit perspective , reduces the appeal of longer - timescale projects .
The use of a demurrage currency gives an edge to those working for sustainability , because a rate of return is achieved SIMPLY BY LENDING OUT MONEY .
When money is repaid ( remember these are non-interest currencies ) , it will have increased in value owing to the money saved by having avoided paying the monthly demurrage fees .
This has the potential to enable investment in highly benefical but economically marginal activities such as earth repair .
A recommended book that covers scrip currencies and more fully explains this ' negative interest ' principle is Bernard Lietaer 's ' The Future of Money ' ( see Resources ) .
The following three sites also cover demurrage :

In case the ending of the Wörgl story was disempowering , I 'd like to add that the number of complimentary currencies around the world is undergoing an exponential growth .
As of 2000 , there were more than 2,500 in operation , and I expect that the number is still fast - growing .
Local stamp scrip currencies can only work in a country firmly committed to decentralising power .
The cult of the NDA
To all those entrepreneurs with innovative , unique business ideas who want to capitalize on them before someone else does , I have one piece of advice :
Get over it .
Riding the tech boom of the late 1990's , there were an immense number of tech companies founded with thousands of innovative , smart new ideas .
As a research analyst at an investment bank during that time , I personally visited with hundreds of these young companies , and even invested personally in a handful , either directly or through my firm 's venture fund .
Every one of these companies believed they had a unique idea , either a piece of technology , a business model , or a way of building a product .
Non-disclosure agreements ( NDA 's ) were the order of the day .
One startup even printed its NDA on the back of visitor 's badges , just like a software " shrink wrap " agreement : " By accepting this visitor 's badge , you agree to the terms of this Non-Disclosure Agreement . "
At one point , there was even a venture capital conference called NDA , sponsored by the now - defunct ( but apparently rising from the grave ) Red Herring magazine .
Unfortunately , none of these ideas were unique .
Certainly not unique enough to bother signing a formal contract of confidentiality .
In some cases , I visited a half - dozen companies with essentially identical concepts , each blissfully unaware of the others .
Do the math .
If you had an idea , odds are that a sizable fraction of the people with the required expertise and who worry about similar problems have had the same idea at some point .
For the vast majority , it will just be a passing thought , but a few will take the time to do their homework , and maybe even put together a business plan .
If your idea involves , say , high - frequency analog circuit design , then the number of people with the required expertise is small , and your idea might be unique ( on the other hand , if your expertise is in high - frequency analog circuit design , your skills are probably in pretty high demand anyway and you 're less likely to be thinking about starting your own company ) .
On the other hand , if your idea involves improving customer service , or a better way to do mass marketing .... well , there 's tens of millions of people worrying about that same problem , and your idea is probably not unique at all .
Good venture capitalists understand this , and many will refuse to sign an NDA before looking at a business plan .
Few entrepreneurs understand it , and many get wrapped up in " protecting their idea " so someone else does n't steal it .
Why the cult of the NDA ?
In our culture , we 've elevated the creative new idea to be the core factor in determining whether a startup succeeds or fails .
Unfortunately , nothing could be further from the truth , but there 's a chain of logic which leads inextricably to the NDA :
1 ) A unique new product or idea is essential to a startup 's success .
2 ) The first company to capitalize on a new product or idea has a unique and sustainable advantage .
3 ) I have a unique idea for a new product or service .
4 ) If others find out about my unique idea , they could bring it to market first , and steal the advantage from me .
5 ) Therefore , by disclosing my idea only under the strictest confidentiality , I preserve an advantage for myself .
Each of these five points is wrong in most cases , though they are a comforting fiction for a young company faced with long odds against success .
1 ) A unique new product or idea is essential to a startup 's success
This is often not the case , since most products and services can easily be replicated by other companies .
The cases where a unique idea is key to success are the cases where a new product or service is dependent upon a very particular skill or invention .
Skills are difficult to replicate , and can be protected through trade secrets ; and inventions can be protected through patents .
Sadly , those cases where the trade secrets and / or patents are both protectable and essential are rare .
The flip side of this is that if the product or idea is truly unique , then the startup is in the position of essentially creating its market from scratch .
This is much more difficult than going to an existing market and winning market share from existing companies .
2 ) The first company to capitalize on a new product or idea has a unique and sustainable advantage .
Many of the most successful technology companies were not the first in their markets , but successful followers which learned from the mistakes of earlier trailblazers .
To take the most obvious example , Microsoft was not the first software company , the first OS vendor , or the first productivity software vendor .
IBM was not the first computer company .
Cisco did n't invent the router , the switch , VoIP , or the firewall .
Google was not the first search engine .
The first two letters of " Yahoo " originally stood for " Yet Another . "
You get the idea .
More often , the long - term winners are the companies with the willingness to adopt good ideas from other places , and the flexibility to learn from the mistakes of the pioneers .
Making mistakes can be very expensive , and being able to avoid certain mistakes can be a competitive advantage .
3 ) I have a unique idea for a new product or service
Probably not .
My own experience is that very few ideas are unique , and in many cases , there are several startups working on the same idea at the same time .
Anyway , in order to market your product or service , you will have to explain it to the industry in great detail .
As soon as you start marketing , your idea is Out There , for others to consider , copy , and perhaps even improve upon .
4 ) If others find out about my unique idea , they could bring it to market first , and steal the advantage from me .
Even supposing that there was an advantage to steal ....
Surprise , surprise , but the rest of the world is not watching your every move waiting to pounce on anything you do .
Unless you 're Bill Gates , but if you 're Bill Gates , you 're not trying to launch a longshot new company on a shoestring budget .
In fact , large incumbents generally do n't take much notice of the startups until after a startup begins to have some success in the marketplace .
Sure , they 'll keep track of developments in the industry , and evaluate new ideas , and maybe even try to build the more promising technology .
Considering that probably 90 % of all venture funded startups never have much impact on an industry , it would be a waste of time to try to stamp out every little company which might someday pose a threat .
They wo n't shift into Killer - Borg - Be-Assimilated - Or-Be-Destroyed mode until after a startup begins causing real pain ; and by that point , the startup should have enough momentum of its own to stand a fighting chance .
5 ) Therefore , by disclosing my idea only under the strictest confidentiality , I preserve an advantage for myself .
Except in very rare cases , this simply is n't true .
There 's is n't any real advantage to be preserved .
More importantly , think of what the entrepreneur is giving up by insisting on excessive secrecy : feedback from others in the industry , including prospective customers , and others who may have tried ( and failed at ) similar ideas .
The opportunity to " debug " a business model or idea at an earlier stage before mistakes are too expensive .
A productive exchange of ideas with other industry experts who may be sympathetic , but can't join you for one reason or another .
What should be confidential ?
The NDA evolved because of the conflict between the desire to keep a business idea secret , and the need to tell others in the industry what a startup is doing .
My philosophy is that if you must disclose something to someone who has no formal relationship to the company , then it is not confidential .
Information which is appropriately confidential includes :
* Trade secrets , unique methods and algorithms , and processes .
* Customer lists and prospect lists .
* Data generated on behalf of a client .
* Information which a third party has asked be kept confidential .
Information which has no business being confidential includes :
* What a company does or plans to do , and what the business model is .
* Industry statistics and forecasts , particularly those prepared by third parties ( I can't even count the number of times I 've gotten published Forrester or Gartner statistics , printed on a page marked " XYZ Confidential " ) .
* Feature lists or product roadmaps .
What really does make a startup successful ?
If it is n't a great new idea , or being first to market , then what really does make a startup a success ?
The vast majority of startups fail , and the real success factors are n't things a company can control , or they 're much harder than just having a great idea .
1 ) The most important success factor is dumb luck .
Being in the right market at the right moment with the right product ( which nobody could have known would be right when you started developing it five years before ) .
The giant order which arrives two days before you run out of money .
Knowing somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody who is a decision maker at a huge customer .
That sort of thing .
2 ) Next most important is execution .
That means paying attention to the details .
Keeping expenses down ( do n't ever forget you 're a starving startup ) .
Hustling to please each and every customer .
Underpromising and overdelivering .
Often it is the failure of incumbents to do these things which creates opportunities for startups .
3 ) Finally , stay focused .
Remember that the objective is to win business and become profitable .
Do n't let internal bickering and politics get in the way , and do n't let setbacks get morale down .
Have you ever watched a baby learn to walk ?
They take two steps and land flat on their butts .
A brief , bewildered expression , then they 're hoisting themselves back up to try again .
It takes strong leadership to keep everyone in a company focused on success when things look bleak , but you need to be that baby .

" The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he does n't exist . " -- Baudelaire ( albeit embarrassingly via The Usual Suspects )
James Robertson asks :
So let me get this straight : DRM irritates paying customers , and prevents them from moving their music around as they want to .
Bad actors can move music around at will .
So ....
From a marketing perspective , exactly whose needs are met by DRM ?
The customer ?
No .
The seller ?
No .
Who then ?
RIAA members too stupid to read , perhaps ?
In many ways , the recording industry is the biggest dupe in the DRM wars .
They have repeatedly been sold , and have repeatedly bought heavily into copy - prevention schemes that do n't work , can't work , and only give more power to the DRM vendor .
Why does the record industry always cave in to Steve Jobs ' iTunes pricing model ?
Because the industry accepts it as a point of faith that they can't sell music online without DRM , and Steve controls the only DRM recognised by 80 % of portable digital music players .
You even hear this in the public rhetoric .
I 've lost count of the number of news articles criticising the iPod because it will " only play music purchased from the iTunes store " , ignoring completely the possibility of legally distributed , un-encumbered mp3 or AAC files , or of music ripped from the owner 's own CD collection .
Meanwhile , once you 've started buying music on iTunes , unless you start illegally breaking the DRM locks , your next DAP is going to have to be an iPod , and the one after , and the one after .
Remember when the iTunes Music Store was launched , and Apple 's public line on FairPlay was : " Yes , it 's DRM , but we fought so hard with the recording industry to make sure we can let you burn CDs and play music on multiple devices ! "
The greatest trick Apple pulled was to build a market where lock - in is mandated , but convince the world that this was something they did reluctantly , at the behest of the villainous recording industry .
Minutes after the jurors and the judge had cleared out of the courtroom today , Mr. Lay 's family members huddled around him .
Elizabeth Vittor , Mr. Lay 's daughter and a lawyer who had worked on his defense team , sobbed uncontrollably .
Two local ministers also leaned in and hugged Mr. Lay , whose family members soon formed a circle in the courtroom , with arms over shoulders , and cried together .
" I know , I know , " Mr. Lay said in a soothing voice to several of them , as they clutched at his suit coat .
Mr. Lay was forced to remain in the courthouse for more than three hours after the verdict was announced for a hearing on securing a $ 5 million bond , which will come from a mix of financial pledges from his children , and to surrender his passport .
Judge Lake will have broad discretion in determining the former executives ' sentences .
He is not known for his leniency .
Two years ago he sentenced Jamie Olis , a former midlevel executive at Dynegy , to 24 years for his role in a scheme to disguise the company 's finances .
An appeals court last year ordered the judge to revise the sentence .
A hearing is set for June 9 .
The guilty verdicts could have limited impact on a spate of civil cases .
" They are not the ones who are going to pay the billions of dollars in additional recoveries that we hope to obtain on top of the $ 7.2 billion we already have from banks in our previous settlements , " said William S. Lerach , the lead lawyer in the largest civil case , set to go to trial in October .

From the beginning , the Enron leaders ' trial was not what many people expected after revelations of secret off - the - books schemes that earned a small fortune for Andrew S. Fastow , Enron 's former chief financial officer , and his cadre of co-conspirators .
Those transactions were used to artificially prop up the company 's profits , but prosecutors never seriously attempted to prove that Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling were responsible for them .
Rather than delve into whether those intricate accounting structures were legitimate , prosecutors focused almost exclusively on what they cited as the false statements Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay made to employees and outside investors .
The " lies and choices " theme transformed the case into a test of credibility between the former chief executives and the more than half a dozen witnesses from inside Enron who testified for the government .
TEL AVIV - THE day before Iran 's ninth presidential elections last June , President Bush sent a discouraging message to potential voters .
Iran 's electoral process " ignores the basic requirements of democracy , " Mr. Bush declared , and these elections would be " sadly consistent " with the country 's " oppressive record . "
For Iranians , there was no mistaking the American president 's point : he was tacitly sanctioning the call that some Iranian exiles and activists had issued for an election boycott , based on exactly this logic .
An American administration that had called on other Middle Eastern populaces to vote in flawed elections greeted the Iranian electoral process with nothing but open disdain .
It is worth revisiting this odd judgment call at a time when Hamas 's victory in the Palestinian elections has raised even more questions about Washington 's confused strategy of democracy promotion .
In Iran last June , the call for a boycott resonated with frustrated and apathetic voters .
Many , if not most , moderates and reform advocates stayed home from the polls .
And we all know what followed : the philosophy - loving moderate , Mohammad Khatami , was replaced as president by a radical militant , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- a former military commander who presides over one of the most extreme governments post - revolutionary Iran has yet had .
That 's right : with what appeared to be the endorsement of President Bush and dozens of American - backed satellite television channels that broadcast in Farsi , the disillusioned young people of Iran effectively took one of the world 's most closely watched nuclear programs out of the hands of a reformer and placed it into the hands of a hard - line reactionary .

One of the more annoying things we 've found when discussing how the entertainment industry needs to adapt and change and embrace new technologies in place of their old business model , is the repeated claim that it ' sto make money if the content is given away for free .
Impossible is a pretty absolute statement -- and all you need is one example to disprove it .
However , as we 've shown , there are many , many examples of entertainers who have learned how to make more money out of giving away their content -- which seems to disprove the whole " impossible " bit .
However , the industry folks do n't seem to know how to respond to that , so they just keep saying it 's impossible .
Witness this bizarre exchange between John Perry Barlow and the MPAA 's Dan Glickman debating the future of the entertainment industry .
Barlow notes that he made an awful lot of money as a songwriter for the Grateful Dead , which encouraged its fans to make tapes of its shows for free .
Glickman immediately responds by saying :
The problem , as always , is that Glickman has incorrectly defined his market -- which is a scary thought if he 's supposed to be the leading spokesperson for that industry .
He thinks they 're in the business of selling .
That 's not so .
It 's too narrowly defined .
The entertainment business is in the business of -- and that can include many things that still involve giving content away for free for promotional value .
We 've discussed plenty of examples in the recording industry -- and Barlow 's success helps prove that .
In Glickman 's own movie industry the examples are even more obvious .
They should be selling the experience of seeing a movie , not just the content .
However , when Glickman says things like the idea that giving away things for free is against " the laws of human nature , " we wonder if this means he 's never received anything for free in his life .
Does he turn down the free soda offered with the slice of pizza in the corner shop ?
Free dessert with dinner ?
Why that 's just crazy talk !
Those restaurants must be run by anti-capitalist extremists .
Their actions in giving away free food are against the laws of nature , and they must be on their way out of business .
Rund um die Uhr wach Andrea Naica - Loebell
Mit Hilfe von Pillen kann durchgearbeitet werden
Es ist der Traum jedes gestressten Menschen , für den der Tag stets zu kurz und der Schlaf im Grunde schlicht verschwendete Zeit ist : Länger wach bleiben und mehr erledigt kriegen .
Neue Medikamente machen es möglich .
Zugelassen sind sie eigentlich , um Patienten , die an Narkolepsie leiden , zu behandeln .
Aber zunehmend helfen sie auch Workaholics mit nur vier Stunden Schlaf auszukommen .
Der Wirkstoff Modafinil macht es möglich .
Der heutige Mensch leidet häufig unter Stress .
Er hat viel zu viel zu tun und viel zu wenig Zeit .
Hektik bestimmt den Alltag .
Erfolgreiche Managertypen brüsten sich gerne damit , mit nur einigen Stunden Schlaf auszukommen – wer mehr braucht , ist in ihren Augen ein Verlierer .
Statistisch betrachtet , schläft ein Erwachsener hierzulande jede Nacht etwas mehr als sechs Stunden .
Experten gehen dagegen davon aus , dass man sieben bis acht Stunden pro Nacht schlafen sollte , der echte Wohlfühlschlaf dauert ihrer Meinung nach neun , bei manchen sogar zehn Stunden .
Oft wird beklagt , dass wir eine unausgeschlafene Gesellschaft seien ( Wir schlafen zu wenig ) .
Schlafmangel bringt den Stoffwechsel aus dem Gleichgewicht ( Zuwenig Schlaf macht alt und krank ) , aber auch zu viele verschlafene Stunden sind ein gesundheitliches Risiko und verkürzen das Leben ( Schlafen gefährdet die Gesundheit ) .
Eine ausgewogene Schlafdauer ist wichtig für das Wohlbefinden und die Leistungsfähigkeit .

Schlafen ist gesund und lebenswichtig .
Ausreichend in Morpheus Armen zu schlummern spielt eine wichtige Rolle für das Lernen und Erinnern ( Wie war das noch mal im Mittelteil ? ) , aber auch für Denkfähigkeit und Kreativität ( Ratzen wie Einstein ) .
Dennoch gelten in unserer Gesellschaft Langschläfer oft als Faulpelze .
Zudem leiden viele Menschen unter Schlafstörungen .
Allein in Deutschland können Millionen allnächtlich nicht einschlafen , sie wälzen sich während ihrer Träume unruhig im Bett herum , schnarchen heftig oder leiden unter Atemaussetzern ( Wenn die Nächte nicht enden wollen… ) .
Carpe noctem
Das Magazin New Scientist widmete die Titelstory der letzten Ausgabe den neuen Muntermacher - und Schlafmitteln .
Carpe noctem – nutze die Nacht – könnte das Motto der heutigen Großstädter lauten .
Werbeslogans versprechen , dass die City nie schläft und wer will schon etwas verpassen ?
Wozu ein Drittel oder auch nur ein Viertel des Lebens verschlafen , wo man in dieser Zeit doch prima liegen Gebliebenes abarbeiten , neue Filme anschauen oder schlicht die ganze Nacht durchtanzen könnte ?
Sich mit Kaffee , Tee oder Energy - Drinks einen kleinen , munterhaltenden Kick zu verschaffen , ist gesellschaftlich akzeptiert .
Gefährlicher ist der Griff zu den in den 90er Jahren immer beliebter gewordenen Amphetaminen , die in den meisten Formen schlicht verboten sind – einige Ausnahmen wie Ritalin unterliegen dem Betäubungsmittelgesetz , jede Verschreibung ist meldepflichtig .
Seit einigen Jahren gibt es aber die neuen Lifestyle - Drogen , über die viel diskutiert wird ( 11 steps to a better brain und Neue Pillen für den neuen Menschen ) .
Sie versprechen durch das Schlucken von Tabletten wie auf Knopfdruck mehr Leistungsfähigkeit , bessere Reaktionen , mehr Erfolg durch bessere Stimmung und den Abbau von Ängsten ( Die Pille für das Vergessen ) .
Selbstverständlich gibt es für die meisten dieser Wirkstoffe auch medizinische Indikationen – zum Missbrauch wird es , wenn Leute bei Ärzten diverse Symptome simulieren , um an diese Medikamente zu kommen .
Das gilt auch für Modafinil , die Wachmacher - Pillen , die in den USA seit 1998 unter dem Markennamen Provigil und in Deutschland als Vigil auf dem Markt sind .
Hergestellt wird die Arznei gegen exzessive Tageschläfrigkeit von der Firma Cephalon , die über ihr Produkt berichtet :
Modafinil wirkt gezielt auf die Schlaf -/ Wachzentren des Gehirns und fördert so spezifisch die Wachheit , ohne jedoch den gewollten Schlaf zu beeinflussen .
Es unterscheidet sich in seinem pharmakologischen Profil grundlegend von herkömmlichen Stimulanzien wie den Amphetaminen und weist kein Suchtpotenzial auf .
Krankheiten und Doping
Wie genau die neuen Hallowach - Pillen wirken , ist noch unbekannt , bislang hält die Pharmafirma ihre Erkenntnisse unter Verschluss .
In Deutschland fällt die Substanz unter das Betäubungsmittelgesetz , verschrieben wird sie nur auf den entsprechenden Spezialrezepten .
Modafinil wird eingesetzt , um Patienten zu helfen , die tagsüber die Augen nicht offen halten können , weil sie an Schlaf - Wach - Störungen wie der Narkolepsie , oder jenen , die an nächtlichen Atemstörungen wie dem obstruktiven Schlafapnoe - Syndrom leiden .
Seit vergangenem
Jahr ist es auch für die Therapie des chronischen Schichtarbeiter - Syndroms zugelassen ( Arznei reduziert Müdigkeit bei Schichtarbeit ) .
Erforscht wird gerade , ob auch Patienten mit Multipler Sklerose von dem Aufputschmittel profitieren können ( Modafinil in Multiple Sclerosis ) .
Unerwünschte Nebenwirkungen der Psychostimulanz sind in seltenen Fällen u.a.
Kopfschmerzen , Übelkeit , Nervosität , Angstzustände und Verdauungsstörungen .
Aber nicht nur Kranke nehmen Modafinil , um ihre Leistungen zu steigern .
Seit 2003 wurde es nachweislich von Sportlern als Dopingmittel eingenommen ( Doping - Skandal erschüttert die WM ) .
Was für Leichtathleten gut ist , kann für Otto Normalverbraucher nicht schlecht sein , sagte sich das US - Militär und führte einmal mehr Medikamententests mit Soldaten durch .
Ein tagelang durchkämpfender Leatherneck ist der Traum jeder Armeeführung ( Maintaining alertness and performance during sleep deprivation : modafinil versus caffeine und Air Force testing new fatigue - combating drug )
Selbstversuch und Abhängigkeitspotenzial
Noch bevor die Doping - Polizei der Sport - Verbände auf Modafinil stieß , war es unter Workaholics bereits eine bekannte Stimulanz , um aufkommende Müdigkeit abzublocken .
Schon vor drei Jahren startete der Journalist David Plotz einen Selbstversuch mit den Wachmachern ( Wake Up , Little Susie Can we sleep less ? ) .
Er war erstaunt , wie konzentriert , munter und wunderbar er sich fühlte – obwohl er normalerweise aufgrund von Schlafmangel als Vater eines Kleinkinds spätestens am Spätnachmittag ständig kurz davor war , mit dem Kopf auf der Tastatur des Computers einzunicken .
Ganz anders nach der Einnahme von Modafinil : Hellwach und voller enthusiastischer Arbeitswut stürzte er sich auf Recherchen und Texte .
Er arbeitet zwar lang wie ein Besessener , brach den Versuch dann aber ab , als er sich dabei ertappte , dass er darüber nachdachte , wo er nach der angesetzten Erprobungswoche den Nachschub bekommen würde , um sich weiter so topfit zu fühlen wie in diesen Tagen .
Bisher haben Studien noch keine Anhaltspunkte dafür erbracht , dass Modafinil abhängig macht oder auf Dauer andere schwerwiegende Folgen hat .
Langzeiterfahrungen fehlen noch , weil das Präparat erst seit einigen Jahren erhältlich ist .
Nach Auskunft des Herstellers Cephalon kann man mit Modafinil bis zu 48 Stunden wach bleiben , ohne dass man hinterher – wie sonst immer – den Schlaf aufholen muss .
Für die Firma hat sich die Pille zur Minderung des Schlafbedürfnisses als Goldesel erwiesen .
Im vergangenen Jahr gingen weltweit Packungen für 575 Millionen Dollar über die Apothekertresen .
Von einem Missbrauch will Cephalon nichts wissen , die Firmensprecher stellen sich auf den Standpunkt , es handle sich um ein Medikament zur Behandlung von Narkolepsie und es sei verschreibungspflichtig – damit könne es gar keine Personen geben , die ohne einen Arztbesuch Zugang zu dem Wirkstoff bekämen .
In Zeiten von Internetapotheken eine Illusion – schließlich gibt es immer eine Quelle irgendwo im Ausland .
Aber das Risiko , dass ein solches Päckchen vom Zoll abgefangen wird , muss man gar nicht eingehen .
Im New Scientist berichtet ein 31 jähriger Programmierer aus Seattle , dass er nicht mehr viel Schlaf braucht , denn zuerst erhielt er Modafinil regelmäßig von einem Freund und inzwischen ist er selbst Inhaber von Rezepten : Diagnose Narkolepsie .
„ Ich würde nicht sagen , dass ich mich aufmerksamer oder weniger schläfrig fühle .
Es ist nur so , dass kein Gedanke an Müdigkeit aufkommt “ , berichtete er , „ Ich kann mit Modafinil in der Arbeit enorm produktiv sein .
Ich bin organisierter und motivierter .
Und es bedeutet , dass ich Freitagnacht ausgehen und Party machen kann und trotzdem am Samstagmorgen früh zum Skifahren . “
Schlafforscher sind kritisch , wenn sie solche Berichte hören .
Sie sind überzeugt , dass längerer , erholsamer Schlaf nötig ist , um gesund zu bleiben ( vgl. Nicht erholsamer Schlaf ) .
Nicht auszuschlafen kann eine Fülle von Krankheiten nach sich ziehen .
Die meisten Experten sind überzeugt , dass eine pharmazeutische Unterdrückung des Schlafbedürfnisses auf Dauer den Körper schädigt .
Langfristige Folgen könnten Schäden des Hormonhaushaltes oder des Immunsystems sein .

Osama bin Laden AP
Report : CIA closes bin Laden search unit
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The CIA says efforts to hunt down Osama bin Laden are as strong as ever , despite a report that the agency has shut down a unit that hunted for the al - Qaeda leader and his top lieutenants .
The New York Times reports two dozen analysts in the unit were re-assigned to other counter - terrorism duties late last year .
Officials tell the newspaper the move came amid growing concern in the agency about al - Qaeda - inspired groups carrying out attacks independent of bin Laden .
But officials stress that finding the elusive terror leader remains a high priority .
The recent book Ghost Wars says some in the CIA were uncomfortable with the unit , saying its zeal for capturing bin Laden took on a cult - like atmosphere .
A former senior CIA official who once headed the unit tells the Times that the move reflects the view that bin Laden is no longer the threat he once was .
But he says that view is mistaken .

I received an email from a close friend asking me to help educate the city manager in Tuttle , OK about Linux .
I told him I prefer finishing a " hack " on securing SSH .
Here 's why I 'm through orchestrating efforts for Linux in Government .
For a couple of years , I wrote exclusively for Linux Journal on Linux in Government .
I found many government units deploying Linux and other GNU software in critical infrastructure around the world .
Spurred by community members I specialized in the government arena .
I had no idea of the depth and breathe of Microsoft 's operations in Government .
As some might characterize their operations , they hide under the cover of darkness .
They operate where no one can see them .
Do n't buck them , they employ people who can take your life .
My first glimpse of the dangers inherent in tackling government adoption occurred when a state senator asked me as a specialist to look at ways to cut budget dollars in a deep hole called the Department of Information Services .
That senator filed a bill that specified the state consider the total cost of ownership including life - cycle maintenance costs , the costs associated with risk issues , including security and privacy of data , and the costs of ensuring security of the IT system itself .
Essentially , we wanted to stop budget cuts in social services and shift the revenues from dead IT projects currently drawing budget money to the general fund .
In my opinion , all hell broke loose .
I have never seen so many alter - egos , shills and groups invented by Microsoft to stop free software adoption in government .
I have also never seen as many dumb and dumber people occupying important positions in government .
I started three open source efforts .
They included governmentforge.org , the Open Government Interoperability Project and a LAMP project called Leopard .
The players in the government arena essentially took those ideas and put them in their own projects one of which is Core.gov and the other called Government Open Code Collaborative .
I would characterize the people involved in these type of organizations as nasty bureaucrats .
I have never met one of them who cared about the people they serve .
The ones I have met only care about their careers .
They would cut the heart out of the person in the next office in a minute .
I saw this as an intern at the Library of Congress , as an auditor in a DoD Management and Operations contractor , as a Oracle Financials documentation specialist at a DoE facility where I found misappropriations that ran about 50 % and how they kept them off the books .
Here 's how they did it .
The DOE used something called a WBS or work breakdown structure .
When a cost accounting manager of a segment in the current year went over budget , he would find another cost accounting manager to transfer his overages into a future year .
When they reached that future year , they would be out of money and would then make a request for additional funds .
That 's how projects have cost overruns and end up costing multiples of the original appropriation .
It gets worse though .
These crooks do it off the books and outside the computerized system .
They have a person they trust keep manual records of these cost accounting transactions and they often pay that person .
Did I give up .
You bet I did .
One of the champions of Linux and free software in a major state agency chose to purchase Windows XP desktops for everyone in the agency .
I 've heard that man speaking at National Conventions for Government CIOs exalting the benefits of free software .
I have read the serenity prayer several times in my life .
It goes like this : God , grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change , courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference .
I decided to use the wisdom I gained in a lifetime of experience to accept the things I can't change .
I also think that anyone in America who believes our government cares about us lives in a dream world .
I do n't care if you 're a Republican , Democrat , Libertarian or whatever .
The people running for office are politicians .
They do n't listen and they do n't care .
Does that mean I wo n't muckrake , write and investigate ?
No , it does n't mean that .
I just wo n't work with politicians who claim they want to save our citizens money , keep jobs in the US and help all people in the US survive above the poverty level .
Genesis of the project
The Reactable was the first big project developed by this team , which at this time was integrated by Sergi Jordà , Günter Geiger , Martin Kaltenbrunner and Marcos Alonso .
The project started in February 2003 , with the ambitious goal of developing the best computer - based musical instrument we could imagine , without being necessarily constrained by any predefined technology .
In that sense , the Reactable really started from a concept , and not from a technology .
First we decided what to do , and later we discovered how to do it .
The completion of all the technologies needed for the correct conclusion of the project ( such as the tracking system reacTIVision ) , came luckily all along the Reactable 's development process ( the starting ideas for the project are described in this kick - off internal document from February 2003 ) .
Since 2009 , the commercialization and further development of the Reactable music instrument in all its forms ( tabletop , mobile apps , etc. ) is being carried by the spin - off company Reactable Systems .
Reese Witherspoon has quashed rumours her marriage to Ryan Phillippe is on the rocks .
The Oscar - winning actress , who scooped the Best Actress accolade at this year 's ceremony , insists she and her actor husband are blissfully happy despite reports claiming otherwise .
Reese is furious comments she made earlier this year that she and her spouse had attended marriage counselling were " taken out of context " and used to cast doubts on the pair 's happiness .
The blonde star - who has two children , Ava , 6 , and two - year - old Deacon , with Ryan - said : " It 's sad to see that when you are honest and talk about the normal ups and downs it gets taken out of context .
Ryan and I have a great marriage , I see him not only as my husband but also as my best friend .
"
It is not the first time Reese has hit out at claims her marriage is in trouble .
Last month , the ' Legally Blonde ' star revealed she does n't read her own press because she 's sick of speculation about her private life .
She said : " I know what 's true and I do n't live my life like a famous fancy person .
I do n't read any of it - it just does n't matter to me .
I feel like people read it one day and the dog pees on it the next .
I really just do n't care . "

bet365 Betting Markets
Ice Hockey
bet365 has gone out of their way to create one of the most comprehensive betting markets offers I ’ve seen in the industry .
All major sports and leagues across the globe have found their way onto bet365 ’s platform and are available for betting .
This offered unprecedented choice when I was making bets , unlike many other sportsbooks I ’ve reviewed in the past .
Coupled with bet365 Bonus Code offer , you will be hitting the betting markets in no time .
Most of the Canadian punters like myself love betting on ice hockey , and here you are in for a treat .
What I found at bet365 ice hockey betting markets was one of the most streamlined betting experiences coupled with the top - notch betting market offer and advanced betting tools .
Ice hockey is one of the most well - represented sports to bet on at bet365 with all major ice hockey leagues around the globe covered , as well as a number of minor leagues .
Among ice hockey leagues that are offered at bet365 , I found NHL and AHL , as well as major European hockey leagues such as KHL , Swedish Hockey League , Czech Extraliga , Danish Metal Ligaen , Finnish SM Liga , German Eishockey Liga , Russian VHL etc .
Bet types offered include Money Line , Line , Over / Under Goals , Goalscorer , Double Chance and Correct Score bets among many others .
Other Sports
If you are trying to find some action on European soccer leagues such as Premier League , Bundesliga , La Liga or UEFA Champion ’s League , the offer that bet365 has is unmatched in Canada , in my personal opinion .
All major professional sports in the USA are covered as well .
If the NFL , NBA or MLB are your primary choice for action , you will find plenty of it .
bet365 is offering a variety of betting markets for these leagues , including future bets such as division , conference and overall winners .
We found especially helpful the presence of player performance betting markets , where you can bet on the individual performance of the major players in each team competing .
Less popular sports are offered as well .
We did find the Winter Sports offer to be lacking , especially in offering a variety of bet types .
Outside of Outright , Futures and Match Ups , there are very little things you can bet on when these sports are in question .
What really makes bet365 stand out is their awesome Cash - Out feature .
At any point during my active bet , bet365 offered to cash me out on the spot .
The amount offered will vary depending on the current results of the active bet / bets you have on your betting slip .
It is a great way for punters to minimize risks and increase the value of their betting .

A great way to stay on top of the action while on the go or multitasking .
I think that the live streaming offer at bet365 is one of the best in the industry , but it does come with some conditions .
Live streaming is only available to customers who are logged into their account and either have funds on their account or they have placed a bet within the last 24 hours .
It can be a bit tiresome to remember to always leave some funds in the account , but the live streaming service is more than worth it .

This is extremely convenient for live betting , as you can follow the action closely and make timely decisions on what types of bets you want to place .
Having everything in one place makes it intuitive and easy to use .
Overall , bet365 has been at the forefront of live betting and live streaming in the industry for a while now .
I think the experience is rich and engaging while remaining easy to use .
Live streaming requirements can be a bit of a chore to use initially , but after a while , I got used to it .
The value offered by live betting and streaming at bet365 more than made up for it .
bet365 Mobile App
bet365 has gone out of their way to make their mobile app accessible across all mobile devices and currently has Apple ( iOS ) , Android and Windows Mobile versions available for download .
So pretty much , any device you might have , you are covered .
I did find a bit of an issue with the Android app since it was not offered in the Play Store .
In order to get the app on my Android phone , I had to visit bet365 ’s mobile website and download it from there and manually install it .
This is a bit of a hassle , so I wanted to point it out .
Once installed , the app works like a charm , but the experience getting it on the phone left something to be desired .

Originally published at the Sixth International Erlang / OTP User Conference on October 3 , 2000 in Stockholm , Sweden .
Abstract
Our software engineering team needed to create a system that moves data from a set of legacy applications with diverse properties to data repositories scattered around the network .
This system had to be highly concurrent , straightforward to extend , have high performance , and be coded rapidly by a small development staff .
Because of these requirements , the authors embarked upon an experiment to write this application in Erlang .
This paper describes what we did , why we did it , and what we learned over the course of our development effort .
It is our hope that this chronicle may be useful to others thinking about coding in Erlang for the first time and to the incumbent Erlang community to hear an outsider 's perspective on this fine language .
Introduction
In the fall of 1999 , a development team from Sendmail , Inc. began developing a program that would act as an I/ O request broker connecting a set of legacy applications to a set of distributed data repositories .
Some of these legacy applications might operate under a UNIX inetd - like forking model , some might be multithreaded using one thread per connection , and some might be multithreaded using thread pools and event - driven programming techniques .
The data passing through this program , which was creatively named the " Client Daemon " , is multiplexed over several separate connections to remote data repositories .
In essence , the Client Daemon acts as a " traffic cop " --- marshaling , massaging , and redirecting data and data requests from a varied set of legacy applications to a set of distributed servers .
( In fact , they may never complete .
The Client Daemon must handle network timeouts in a context - sensitive manner . )
There were a significant number of additional constraints placed on this project :
Rapid Development .
This technology introduced some fairly radical notions of data movement and storage .
The system needed to be demonstrated to work or to fail as soon as possible , to allow time for a redesign .

Avoid proprietary , non-portable hardware and software .
Platforms such as VAXcluster [ KrLeSt86 ] or products from IBM , HP , and other vendors could achieve many of these goals using off - the - shelf proprietary solutions .
However , this system must be straightforward to port to a variety of UNIX operating systems and perhaps even to Windows NT .

However , this system must be straightforward to port to a variety of UNIX operating systems and perhaps even to Windows NT .
High performance .
A distributed architecture will have higher overhead than a well - tuned architecture based on a single machine .
Given that fundamental limitation , we want to make the overall system and each component as fast as possible .
The Client Daemon initiates few data requests itself .
The bulk of its work is taking data from one side ( from the network or another application ) , massaging it , and passing it through to the other side .
This means that its network interface and its IPC must be highly efficient .

Concurrency .
The Client Daemon will need to handle and track many simultaneous requests and responses from disparate sources .
Each of these request / response pairs will take an unknown amount of time to complete .
In order to accommodate the various legacy applications , the Client Daemon will need to handle both synchronous and asynchronous communication modes , a notoriously difficult task in most programming languages .

Therefore , we need some mechanism to tie all these systems together for monitoring and administration .
Figure 1 represents the overall architecture .
The legacy applications are linked with a glue layer called the " Client Library " .
The Client Library uses IPC to move the data from these applications to the Client Daemon , and the Client Daemon moves the data over the network to remote Data Servers .
This paper describes the justification for and the procedures we went through to build the Client Daemon using Erlang .
We chronicle our experiences , including what went well and what did n't .
We provide some advice for other groups not terribly familiar with programming in Erlang and some suggestions for the Erlang community on how Erlang might be made more appealing to software development groups like ours .
Background
Since we and the company had developed many applications in C already , we had an intrinsic bias toward this language .
Early on , we built a rudimentary prototype in C using the Libero [ Libero ] and SMT [ SMT ] tools by iMatix and using the familiar rpcgen and libc 's ONC RPC library to handle the data transport over the network to the remote Data Servers .
The Libero / SMT finite - state machine approach seemed a viable way to manage the Client Daemon 's growth if we decided we liked SMT , and we would n't lose much time if we did n't like it .
C Prototype
We confirmed our suspicions that the ONC RPC stub generator , rpcgen , generates some really ugly code .
Furthermore , it assumes that all RPC calls are fully synchronous .
Even modern rpcgen implementations capable of generating thread - safe stubs assume the calls are synchronous .
As a result , we had to write our own RPC call mux / demux code , ignoring most of what rpcgen had created and bypassing much of the ONC RPC library 's infrastructure .
After just over a month of coding , the Libero / SMT version of the Client Daemon was capable of interacting with both the applications and the Data Servers , although it was by no means ready for production use .
At this point , we had learned a lot about RPC client stubs , RPC server stubs , XDR encoding , RPC fragment reassembly , and other RPC arcana , but the Client Daemon still had at least one obscure memory leak , its performance seemed slower than estimates predicted , and there were a great many core features that still needed to be implemented .
Erlang Discovered
Before starting the first prototype , we had conducted an exhaustive literature search to learn what lessons we could from the work of others .
During this time , we came across references to the HTTP load balancer Eddie [ Da ++98 ] which is written in Erlang .
Erlang 's built - in concurrency model was seductive : all the threading add - ons to C and C++ looked ugly by comparison .
The " standard " Erlang libraries and OTP helped keep us from typing too much .
Tony Rogvall gave us the source code to a full - featured ONC RPC library , allowing us to avoid a lot of XDR - and RPC - related drudge work .
( We have contributed our enhanced version of his package to the Erlang community .
It should be available at the erlang.org web site by the time of the conference . )
Also , around this time we had the opportunity to talk with a number of the software engineers at Bluetail A.B. who have written most of an email proxying system , called the Mail Robustifier [ Bluetail ] , in Erlang .
The fact that these folks had done significant work on an email - related project in Erlang increased our confidence in Erlang 's viability .
Their kindness to answer some general questions about coding such a project in Erlang helped us tremendously .
Two potential benefits of using Erlang were most appealing : higher programmer productivity and easier - to - maintain code .
It was difficult to tell how many of the success stories from Ericsson and other companies using Erlang were worthwhile praise and how many were hype .
Since our group was already familiar with a wide variety of arcane languages , we were quickly able to understand the reasons that these claims might be more than just smoke .
We felt that if Erlang could live up to its promises , many of the goals of the project could be met much more easily with Erlang than with C , especially given our time - to - market concerns .
Implementation in Erlang
It 's no surprise that software development managers are uncomfortable adopting new programming languages or techniques .
Trying new and radical techniques with the industry 's current time - to - market demands is usually a recipe for disaster .
Sendmail , Inc.'s management was as skeptical as one would expect .
Our dabbling with developing a second Client Daemon prototype in Erlang was greeted cautiously .
Outside of our team , nobody in our company had even heard of the language , much less knew anything about developing software in it .
The Second Prototype
The beginning of the learning curve was steep .
The simple matter of writing a non-trivial program in a functional language is a radical change for people used to working with procedural languages such as C or Perl .
We used parts of the OTP as best we understood them .
The result was not pretty , but it worked .
Once we got over the startup costs of coming to terms with the new language , the Erlang prototype fell together quickly .
After a month and a half , the Erlang Client Daemon had surpassed the Libero / SMT prototype in stability and feature set with comparable performance .
We did n't discover any project - killing issues , so we recommended to our management that we complete our development of the Client Daemon in Erlang .
Convincing Management To Let Us Continue
Our team had the advantage of being small and closely - knit .
The design and prototype development had been done in a " skunkworks " - like atmosphere : most of the company was preoccupied with other projects .
Given the size of our team , the promise of writing a complex application using a relatively small number of lines of code , and our time - to - market constraints , our team agreed that the potential benefits were worth risking our project on Erlang .
Our management was skeptical about using Erlang for production code .
First , they felt the discomfort normally associated with radical ideas .
Second , no other developers knew it , which makes it more difficult to solicit advice or conduct code reviews in - house .
Third , management felt that it might be hard to hire programmers for the team , since they would have to know both C and Erlang .
On the first and second points , we were still not entirely comfortable with the language ourselves , but both we and our management team were willing to set aside discomfort if the reasons for doing something new were compelling enough .
On the issue of hiring , we pointed out that we had come up to speed fairly quickly .
We felt that any programmer with an adventurous spirit could learn Erlang as quickly as we had ( especially with our mentoring ) and that our projections about time - to - market made this a worthwhile trade - off .
Further , they were persuaded by our estimates about how quickly we could code and debug this application in Erlang as opposed to C .
In the end , the rapid development schedule was able to compensate for the risk , since " If you 're going to fail , fail early [ Brooks95 ] . "
Further Development and Performance Tuning
We spent the next several months tightening up the code , improving Tony 's RPC library , filling out features in the Client Daemon , improving the Client Library , and fixing bugs .
While the core of the system was coming together , we had two outstanding concerns .
The first was that we found the overall structure of the code to be vaguely unsettling , and the Client Daemon still did n't perform as well as we'd like .
Prior to starting work on this project , we had established performance goals .
One of our really big concerns going into this project was that the Client Daemon would be doing a lot of data copying .
There would be significant performance penalties if it could not do so efficiently .
The default drivers in the Erlang emulator implement I / O via disk , pipes to spawned sub- processes , and TCP or UDP network connections .
The only way to have direct communication with an unrelated UNIX process is through TCP or UDP sockets , which are not as efficient as other IPC mechanisms .
We created some crude programs that simulated how the Client Daemon might perform if it could interact with the outside world using UNIX domain sockets , through an mmap ( ) - style DMA mechanism , and via other mechanisms .
We saw some potential for improvement there , but we still did n't know what was consuming all of our systems ' resources .
We used the Erlang profiler , eprof , to determine which processes were taking most of the CPU time .
Unfortunately , it was difficult to measure CPU time ( versus wall - clock time ) consumed or a global context for the answer .
We also had no insight as to how much time was spent in the runtime system for things like scheduling , memory management , linked - in drivers , and message - passing .
To answer these questions , we compiled the virtual machine with gprof support .
This gave us a global context for the performance data , but did n't give us any correlation with the Erlang code , only with the C code .
For instance , we knew how much of the resources were taken up by garbage collection , but we did not know which processes or modules were producing the most garbage .
Outside Assistance
At this point , we felt that we could accelerate our progress with some outside help .
Friends in the Erlang community recommended Lennart Öhman ( one of the authors of this paper ) , an experienced Erlang developer and trainer .
After being briefed on what we were doing and why , Lennart first set out to explain current best practice regarding process hierarchy , including supervisor structure principles and process linking techniques .
( " Imagine your application running for ten years .
How many uncontrolled processes are you willing to tolerate ? "
This was a perspective we desperately needed . )
Since the Client Daemon was not written using a strict top - down approach , but grew via more " organic " methods , we never looked at the entire process structure as a whole , and thus had a process hierarchy that was structured poorly .
In hindsight , much of his advice seemed like common sense , and we probably would have figured it out eventually , but we never stumbled across it in our perusal of the current documentation and our inspection of other Erlang applications .
Lennart 's presentation was much more efficient than discovering the principles ourselves by trial and error .
We also received a great deal of training on parts of the OTP that we had n't yet used .
We learned quite a number of best practices for Erlang coding that we had n't found documented anywhere or found only after we knew what to look for .
Overall , this contributed a great deal to the organization of our code , making it more flexible , structured , and readable , and generally enabled us to think more clearly about its architecture .
The performance issues proved to be more difficult .
We discussed several ideas on how to speed things up .
One idea was to run the legacy applications as an Erlang I/O port under the Client Daemon , allowing communication with that process using a pipe rather than an IP socket .
However , that technique wo n't work with those legacy applications that fork .
We considered adding an Erlang driver that would allow zero - copy I/ O of bulk data in and out of the virtual machine ( in most cases ) , but the time to implement such a modification to the system ran against our time - to - market constraints and has been shelved for future consideration .
It was brought to our attention that there have n't been many Erlang projects that are both I/O intensive and have had externally - driven performance goals .
Our application 's workload seems atypical in today 's Erlang usage , excepting Eddie and Bluetail 's products .
While it has been disappointing not to reach our a priori performance goals , detailed study suggests that our performance shortfall is probably related more to the UNIX process architecture and less to our language choice .
After performing code cleanup based on Lennart 's suggestions , we prepared for an initial test release of the system during the summer of 2000 .
That release has been put on hold while we perform integration work with another complex legacy application and improve our monitoring system .
Lessons Learned
Working with Erlang over the past year has been educational .
We 've learned a number of lessons that we think are worth sharing with the rest of the community .
Erlang is Quickly Learned
Even in isolation , a decent programmer can quickly come up to speed on the basics of Erlang , with greater ease than with many other more popular languages .
With mentoring , we expect that a new person could be able to understand enough of our existing code to begin making non-trivial contributions in less than a month .
OTP Is n't So Quickly Learned
Proficiency with the OTP , however , is another matter .
In our estimation , there simply is n't sufficient documentation to expect isolated programmers to make decent use of OTP on their own .
We often found ourselves making up too many things as we went along .
We 'd make informal bets that such - and - such a problem had already been solved but we did n't know how .
The erlang - questions mailing list [ Erl- list ] was invaluable --- as long as we had a coherent question to ask --- but it was hard to know what we might be missing .
If we 'd been learning Erlang at Ericsson the same way we learned C , rubbing shoulders with much more experienced programmers and tackling small , self - contained projects , we would have had a much easier experience .
Unfortunately , we had to immediately create the architecture for a major application .
Without a mentor , the best place for education is by reading existing code of well - written applications .
However , without commentary , we would expect the novice Erlang programmer to miss many subtle issues involved in employing it correctly .
We certainly did .
If mentoring is n't an option , we think a training course in the use of the OTP after the developers have some familiarity with the language is probably wise .
Erlang Is Good For Both Rapid Prototype and Production Code
Now that we 're more proficient with Erlang , prototyping new ideas is a rapid process .
Once the prototype is done , it can often be folded into production code with only small modifications .
The language , together with the standard and OTP libraries , provides an extremely useful framework .
We 're free to consider important operational issues from the beginning , knowing that many mundane details are already taken care of .
The process linking concept , together with process supervision trees , is the most valuable , in our experience .
The tools for event logging are a close runner - up .
And the inter - node message - passing infrastructure is so easy to use it's hard to explain to programmers not familiar with the language .
Erlang Performs Well
Our first experiences with bulk I/O with Erlang were bad , since the original version of the RPC code moved all data as lists of bytes rather than binaries .
Once we modified our code to be binary - friendly , we saw its performance increase by more than an order of magnitude .
Without binary data types , though , the language 's performance would have been abysmal for our application .
For a single application reading or writing a large file over the network , data throughput measures of the Erlang and C Client Daemons are identical : the performance of both is limited by network latency .
When performing multiple concurrent bulk reads or writes through the same Client Daemon , the C prototype is faster , but only by a couple of percentage points .
We were pleasantly surprised to find the difference so small .
We have found that our performance shortfall , relative to C , is due to a small penalty per byte of bulk data in each RPC transaction , and a large penalty per transaction .
We hope that the former can be addressed by a more advanced network driver or other IPC mechanisms , and that the latter can be addressed by further tuning our code .
We Would Use Erlang Again
Many advanced programming languages are useful for research but have severe deficiencies for production work .
Erlang does n't fit that pattern .
Our increased productivity with Erlang more than offset the difficulties of learning the language .
Aside from wanting access to UNIX domain sockets and shared memory , the language provided most of the tools we needed to develop the prototype and then expand it into a production - quality system .
Indeed , we had difficulties with the packaging and distribution tools largely because they provided more functionality than those in the traditional C/ UNIX environment .
We worried that the virtual machine might be too slow for our purposes .
Instead , performance has not been a big issue : Erlang 's performance is on par with our C prototype .
The next big performance increase will come from changing the communication channel between the Client Daemon and its applications , probably using shared memory .
If we were to use that scheme in both languages , we expect we would see comparable performance , and we expect the Erlang version would be finished sooner .
If we had to do this all over again , we 'd still use Erlang .
What Erlang Needs
We 've got a long wish list of things we'd like to see in future Erlang / OTP releases : enhancements to the virtual machine , new built - in functions , expanded libraries , more supported platforms , and better documentation .
Fortunately , under the Erlang Public License [ EPL ] , the source code is available for us to modify to suit our needs .
Many of these things are n't tremendously difficult to do ( As an example , we 've already experimented with having the TCP and UDP drivers allocate their buffers from a shared memory pool . ) , and we may yet implement some of them , but code is almost always nicer if someone else writes and maintains it .
We realize many of these wishes may be fulfilled by the R7 release of Erlang / OTP .
However , since we do not have that release at the time this document is being written , these wishes are based on the R6B release .
Better Documentation of Best Coding Practices
The Erlang book is the best reference we 've found for learning the language .
However , documentation on the Open Telecom Platform is confined to the reference material in the online documentation [ Erlang ] .
In fairness to the current OTP documentation , it is a good reference resource , but it 's not a tutorial .
You simply need to know where to look and to know if it's the right hammer to pound any particular nail .
Programmers coming from a C / UNIX background are accustomed to an edit - compile - debug work cycle inherited from batch - processing origins .
Interactive editors and integrated development environments have accelerated the cycle but have not changed its fundamental character .
The interactive interpreter was therefore a little puzzling --- how should it be used in daily work ?
Being unable to learn at the knees of local experienced Erlang programmers , we experimented on our own .
Having a detailed " user story " in the documentation , a low - level chronicle of a typical day programming Erlang , would have accelerated this process .
More , Better , and Faster IPC Mechanisms
Understanding that our desires are biased toward the applications we typically work on , we 'd like to see UNIX domain sockets formally supported .
We 'd also love to dabble with shared memory , though it can be problematic in a system where memory management is hidden from the programmer .
We 'd love to see a more efficient TCP and UDP driver , one that makes use of the outputv ( ) driver interface to allow use of vectored I/O primitives and other efficiency mechanisms .
We understand the portability concerns raised by supporting these admittedly platform - specific features .
It can make " write once , run anywhere " code more difficult to write and maintain .
( The Client Daemon runs quite well on Erlang / OTP for Windows NT , despite intentionally ignoring NT during development . )
Such feature creep presents a slippery slope : what new features are platform - independent enough , or is customer demand great enough ?
In our opinion , the need for fast IPC warrants their use in the standard Erlang distribution .
As discussed in the section titled We Would Use Erlang Again , Erlang is a surprisingly useful , practical language .
Support for additional IPC mechanisms can only encourage other adventurous programmers to develop other Erlang applications that break yet more new ground .
Better Debugger
The debugger in Erlang / OTP R6 is useful , but it needs enhancements .
We would love to see a binding watchpoint feature added .
A more streamlined " compile , debug , edit , compile , debug newly - edited code in the same debugger environment " cycle , one that requires fewer mouse clicks , would be nice .
Also , it would be handy to save breakpoint settings in a context - sensitive manner , attempting to maintain breakpoint locations despite adding or deleting lines of code prior to the breakpoint .
Better Profiling Tools
We 've spent a good deal of effort trying to understand the performance characteristics of the BEAM VM in general and of our application running within it .
The Erlang / OTP R6 profiling tool , eprof , is okay at best and utterly inaccurate at worst .
We ended up working on a better tool , ( We were desperate enough to modify eprof for greater accuracy and to try to measure both wall - clock and CPU time .
See http://www.erlang.org/ml-archive/erlang-questions/200005/msg00052.html.) but the effort has been limited by the VM 's process trace output itself : it can fail to mention execution of some short functions , which throws off function call counts and can lead to misattribution of execution time .
The fundamental problem is the lack of a global context for the profiling results .
If eprof profiling reveals a function to be the tall tent pole within a given process , it may still be insignificant if the profiled process is only a small fraction of the overall runtime .
The user - contributed top tool [ Top ] is useful for getting a system - wide view of VM reductions , but it cannot account for reductions made by short - lived processes .
Furthermore , there is no accurate correlation between VM reductions and either CPU or wall - clock time .
To give a global context for our performance , we used gprof to measure the BEAM VM as a C program .
This did n't allow us to directly measure the execution of our program code , but we were able to see the relative weights of bytecode execution , message - passing , garbage collection , and linked - in drivers .
Within the Erlang code , we see the need for both process - oriented and function - oriented profiling .
We also need the ability to create a gprof - style call graph .
Lastly , we need both wall - clock and CPU - clock timing statistics .
Better String Handling
Being avid Perl hackers , it may be unfair to criticize Erlang for weak string handling features , but we 'll do it anyway .
The functions found in the standard string module are a good base .
But Erlang 's treatment of strings as lists of bytes is as elegant as it is impractical .
The factor - of - eight storage expansion of text , as well as the copying that occurs during message - passing , cripples Erlang for all but the most performance - insensitive text - processing applications .
Erlang 's treatment of binaries , by contrast , has so far proven to be a showcase for the language 's features without a significant cost in performance .
We 'd much rather see a string library , parser - generator , etc. , based on binaries , or on some new binary - like string representation , rather than the current list representation .
Multiprocessing Support and Memory Usage
Again , on this topic Erlang is caught between a rock and a hard place .
On multiprocessing machines , we 'd really like to see the virtual machine take advantage of as many CPUs as are available , especially since moving data between Erlang instantiations via IPC currently requires several data copies and is therefore expensive .
We see no reason why SMP support would require any change to the language or its libraries .
It would require a massive redesign of the virtual machine and possibly large sections of platform - specific code to get the best performance .
However , if Erlang wants to be considered for applications like ours on high - end hardware , SMP support is necessity .
We understand that with R7 we 'll see the VM able to use up to 4 GBytes of RAM , but , again , for high end applications this is n't enough .
We need to be able to run our system on 12 + processor machines with 12 + GBytes of RAM .
For the foreseeable future , this means running multiple virtual machines per physical server , which is something we 'd prefer not to do .
More Support For Writing Network Servers
Many important Internet applications , such as the Apache web server and the BIND naming daemon , are moving toward a multithreaded programming model .
We shudder to think of using C/ pthreads to achieve this .
With the imminent release of the bit syntax , we see a great opportunity for Erlang to be the premiere language for serious Internet server development .
We 'd like to see more support for writing servers providing TCP - and UDP - based protocols .
While there are a few sample applications to learn from , more could be done to assist programmers communicating via an IP network to non-Erlang - based clients .
Items on this wish list include :
More documentation and examples of non-trivial clients and servers of popular protocols .
Allow a listening TCP socket to operate in an " active " mode , i.e. by allowing gen_tcp : accept ( ) to send a message to the listening process rather than as a blocking function call .
( Some thought should be given to a rate - limiting mechanism for these automatic accepts , although much existing connection accepting code has no such mechanism , either . )
This would allow a gen_server to directly accept new connections without blocking .
to send a message to the listening process rather than as a blocking function call .
( Some thought should be given to a rate - limiting mechanism for these automatic accepts , although much existing connection accepting code has no such mechanism , either . )
This would allow a to directly accept new connections without blocking .
Streamline / simplify the process for passing ownership of a newly - accepted socket descriptor process to another process .
The most natural way to write a per-session process 's start ( ) entry point is to have the TCP connection socket as an argument and to give the new process 's PID as a return value .
However , there is a race between the new process using the socket ( e.g. printing a prompt or greeting ) and the listener process changing the socket ownership .
This race can be resolved with some message - passing for synchronization , but it has occurred often enough in our code to be annoying .

This race can be resolved with some message - passing for synchronization , but it has occurred often enough in our code to be annoying .
Avoid needless data copies across the driver boundary .
The binary syntax will help immensely with network byte - order conversions and ( un ) packing encoded data structures .
With a few clean - ups and an eye towards attracting a wider audience , we feel that Erlang can make significant strides as a network application language .
Conclusion
We were surprised at the extent to which Erlang fulfilled its promises .
It took some effort , but it was straightforward for developers to come up to speed on the language , and its use significantly reduced the time it took to produce working code .
While we still believe that Erlang has some deficiencies , it has demonstrated itself as a first class prototyping language , and we have no qualms about shipping a production application based upon it .
A number of Erlang 's features are novel and compelling .
As we look at other projects written in C , we often find ourselves thinking about solving their problems with Erlang .
While there are a great number of places in which the language and its environment could be significantly improved , Erlang is already a fascinating language that deserves a wider audience than it currently has .
Acknowledgments
The authors of this paper would like to thank our management for allowing us to get ourselves into this mess .
Thank you as well to those fine folks at Ericsson who came up with Erlang in the first place .
Also , a special thanks to the folks at Bluetail A.B. for their early encouragement .
We especially appreciate the work of Tony Rogvall and his ONC RPC library : it saved us a great deal of work .
Finally , we want to especially thank everyone on the erlang - questions mailing list for helping a bunch of neophytes come up to speed with their nice language .
You 've helped us more than you 'll probably ever know .

「 ニセ科学 」 入 門
大阪大学サイバーメディアセンター
菊池誠
この論文は大阪大学大学院文学研究科文化形態論専攻広域文化形態論講座文化基礎学専門分野共同研究「科学と社会」(代表者 : 溝 口宏平 ) 報告書(平成16年2月発行)に掲載されたものです。基本的には大阪大学の全学共通教育科目として毎年開講しているオムニバス講義「科学と人間」の中で私が担当している「科学とニセ科学の間」の回のレジュメを拡大したものです。
マイナスイオンの項に追記しました。でも、まだよくわからない(2006/2/23 )
はじめに
論文にしてはケッタイなタイトルなの で、面食らっておられるかたも多かろう。現代市民社会の特に日常生活と科学とのか
かわりを考えるとき、私個人は「ニセ科学」の問題は極めて重要であると考えるのだ
が、恐らくはこの問題に注目していない研究者（自然科学者・科学論者・社会科学者
を問わず）がほとんどだろうし、それどころか問題の存在にすら気づいていないかた
がたも多いと思うので、それでなくてもケッタイな「ニセ科学」という言葉に敢えて
「入門」という言葉をつけさせていただいた。
１．ニセ科学とは
世間には奇怪な情報が飛び交っている。年末のテレビで「アポロは月に
行かなかった」という説をキッシンジャー等ニクソン政権時の政治家へのインタビュ
ーを通して実証するという外国の番組が紹介された。実はエイプリルフール用に作ら
れた冗談番組だったというのがオチなのだが、オチの部分を聞かずに信じてしまった
視聴者も少なからずいたらしい。「アポロは月に行かなかった」というのは陰謀論と
してポピュラーなもので、反証はいくつでも挙げられる。オチを聞かなくても冗談だ
とわかりそうなものだが、信じたいことだけを信じる人間は常識から目をそむけてし
まうものらしい。これはいわゆる” 陰謀論 ” である。広い意味では 「 ニセ科学」かも しれないが、本稿では対象としない。
一方、 「 ニセ科学 」という言葉で超 能力やオカルト、心霊現象、あるいは星占いのたぐいを思い起こす向きもあろう。こ
の中で超能力（テレパシーや予知、念力など）については「 超心理学」という学問分 野まで存在するので 「ニセ科学」と呼べるだろうが、オカルト・心霊などはそもそも
「科学的」な外観を持たないので、ニセ科学とは呼ばない。オカルト信者自身、オカ ルトを「科学」とは考えていないだろう。
つまり、ここでは 「 ニセ科学 」 という言葉 を ” 見かけは科学のようでも、実は科学ではないもの” に限定して使うこ とにする 。
「見かけ」という以上、誰から見てのものかが重要だが、ここでは科学の
専門家ではない人たちを念頭に置いている。普通程度の科学的知識を持つ「一般市
民」（こういう言葉がいいのか悪いのかはわからないが）には科学と区別がつかない
が、専門家から見れば荒唐無稽なものという程度の意味である。
そんなも のを論じる価値があるのか。それが大ありなのだ。端的にはルイセンコ事件を思い出 せばよい。そこには、ニセ科学が一国の社会・経済・政治を揺るがす大事件になった 例を見ることができる。イデオロギー的に都合がよいかどうかで学説の正否を決めて しまうなら、それはまさ に
「ニセ科学」である。残念ながらルイセンコ事件の教訓が
世間に行き渡っているとはいいがたく、日本でもルイセンコ事件の縮小再生産のよう
な事件は幾度となく起きている。市民運動の側でそれが起きた身近な例が『買っては
いけない』であろう（まだ終わっていないが）。
なお、同様の文脈ではむ しろ 「疑似科学」という言葉のほうが広く使われている。敢えてその言葉を避けて
「ニセ科学」と呼ぶのは、文脈によっては「疑似科学」という言葉が褒め言葉になる からである。具体的にはSF小説やファンタジー小説の批評などで” よくできた疑似科 学的説明 ” などという表現が使われる。「疑似」という言葉には価値判断が含まれな
いということであろう。「ニセ」という言葉は否定的な意味合いを強く含むので、こ
ちらを採用する。私自身、「疑似科学」と呼んでいた時期もあるのだが、上述の理由
で違和感がつきまとうため、最近は「ニセ」で統一している。この用法はマイクル・
シャーマーの著書の邦題に倣ったものである。「似非」「エセ」のほうをお好みのか たはそれでもかまわないだろう。「トンデモ」という言葉を使う例も見かけるが、特
にカタカナで書かれた「トンデモ」という言葉には「ニセ科学」とは少々違ったニュ
アンスがこめられており、ニュアンスを理解したうえでなければ使用をお勧めしな い。
本稿では最近の事例をいくつか取り上げて「ニセ科学」とはどういう
ものであるかを考えてゆく。具体的にはフリーエネルギー、マイナスイオン、波動、
ドーマン法などであるが、その前に練習問題として血液型性格判断を議論しておこう
２．練習問題：血液型性格判断
世界中で日本人ほど他人の血液型 を気にする国民はいないらしい。飲み屋で血液型と性格の関連を話題にするのは日本
人くらいだろう。血液型性格判断のニセ科学性については語り尽くされているといっ
ていいのだが、わかりやすい例なので、簡単にまとめておく。
血液型性格 判断の歴史は古く、１９２７年に古川竹二が出した学説まで遡る。もっとも古川学説
は現在の血液型隆盛とは基本的に関係ない。現在の血液型性格判断に直接つながるの
は１９７１年に出版された能見正比古の著書である。能見は学者ではなく、血液型に
関する学術論文を書いたわけでもなさそうだ。その代わり、能見と息子の俊賢は血液
型に関する多くの一般書を出版している。
さて、現在の位置づけを簡単に 述べよう。心理学の問題としては解決済みで、「血液型と性格が関連するという積極
的な証拠はない」ということでよいだろう。つまり、能見説にせよ古川説にせよ、間
違っていたわけである。では、古川学説は「ニセ科学」だったのか。いや、学説が出
された段階では「ニセ科学」ではなかったはずである。それどころか、「性格が遺伝
するなら、同様に遺伝する血液型と関係するのではないか」という推測は、むしろ目
のつけどころとしてはよかったといってもいいだろう。
問題は能見説以 降、特に心理学の問題としては 「 関係があるとは言えない 」という結論が出てしまっ
たあとの ” 民間信仰 ” 的ブームである。能見は独自にデータを収集した上で結論を出
しているので、科学的に研究しようとしたのだとは思う。しかし、実際には「科学 」
として通用するものではなかった。”血液型と性格は関連があるはずだ” という前提 で議論を続けるのはニセ科学である。
では、なぜ血液型性格判断は広く信 じられているのだろうか。以下に二つの要因を挙げておく。いずれも仮説である。
( 1)４分類という思い切った割り切り：２分類では恐らく誰も信じないし、１０分類
では多すぎておぼえる気になれない。おぼえやすいことは重要で、血液型性格判断が
学校から飲み屋まであらゆる状況で話題にされるのは、手許に参考文献がなくても議
論できるからである。４という数は適当にもっともらしく、しかも使いやすいものな のだろう。 ( 2)血液型は遺伝現象の典型と認識されており、メンデル型の遺伝法則に
従うことが一般常識として広く知れ渡っている。また、性格のかなりの部分が遺伝的
に決まっていると信じている人は多そうである。いかにも遺伝しそうな「性格」が、
もっともよく知られた遺伝現象である「血液型」と関連すると主張されれば、多くの
人がなるほどそれは「科学的」でもっともらしいと納得するのも不思議ではない。こ
の場合、信じる側はあくまでも「科学」として信じるわけである。
さて、 血液型性格判断も単なる遊びのうちはたいした問題ではないが、これが実害をもたら す可能性がある。たとえば、ある企業がインターネット上に公開している就職活動の ためのエントリーシートには、氏名・住所・電話番号・電子メール・性別に続いて
「 血液型」の記入が求められている。ほかの項目は出身大学や帰省先、職種の希望な
ど常識的なものばかりであるから、血液型の項目は目を引く。もちろん、なぜそれが
必要とされているのかはわからないが、採用上なんらかの参考にしているのではとい
う疑念はわく。また、以前、電機メーカーがAB型の社員だけを集めて新製品開発プロ
ジェクトチームを作ったという実例がある。特に成果は出なかったようだが。要する
に、血液型が就職や配属面で考慮されていると思われる事例があるのだ。これは無 論、差別である。
ところで、血液型に関して 「 心理学の調査では性格との 関連が見つからなくても、実は微かな関係がある可能性は否定できないのではない か」という質問をされることがある。それはもちろんその通りで、よくよく研究して みると弱い関係があるということになるかもしれない。研究する価値もあるだろう。 しかし、一般に言われる血液型性格判断はそのような微妙な関係ではなく、「あなた
は A型でしょう 」 とコンパの席で指摘できるほどにはっきりした関係を主張している
ことに注意するべきである。したがって、上の質問は血液型性格判断とはなんの関係 もない。
３．フリーエネルギー
フリーエネルギー装置とは無から エネルギーを生み出す装置、すなわち第１種永久機関（エネルギー保存則を破る機
関）である。もちろん、永久機関については昔から多くの提案があったのだが、ここ
では今現在も開発が続けられているNマシンやエーテル・エンジンといった装置を問
題にする。ちなみに、日本では第１種・第２種を問わず、永久機関に対して特許はお
りない。自然法則、具体的には熱力学法則に反するからである。
しかし、 フリーエネルギー開発者はエネルギー保存則を承知の上で、それを回避できる論理を 構築しようとしている。つまり、ここでもフリーエネルギーは反科学でもオカルトで もなく、あくまで も
「科学」らしい体裁をもったものとして提案されているのである （ただし、「ニューサイエンス」との接点もあり、「科学らしさ」の意味も微妙では
あるが）。ここではふたつの論法を紹介しよう。
( 1 ) 「エネルギー保存則は証明され ていないので、反してもよい」この言説の前半はある意味で正しい。たしかにエネル
ギー保存則は「数学的」に証明されたものではない。しかし、物理法則とはそもそも
そういうものである。エネルギー保存則は経験の集積であって、膨大な傍証に裏付け
られている。仮にこの法則が破れるなら、その影響は科学のあらゆる分野におよぶ。
( 2) 「未知のエネルギー源があるのであって、それも含めてエネルギー保存則は成立
している」これは巧妙な論理で、実際、まじめな研究としても新しいエネルギ源ーが
話題になることがある。ただし、それが「エネルギー」であるためには、かなり厳し
い条件を満足しなくてはならない。その条件がクリアできることが示されれば、物理
学者も新エネルギーを認めるはずである。残念ながら、フリーエネルギー装置がそれ
をクリアしたことはない。
問題はなぜフリー・エネルギーを研究するのか
である。どうやら、フリー・エネルギー研究者の多くは、装置ができればエネルギー
問題が解決すると思い込んでいる善意の研究者のようだ。しかし、「フリー・エネル
ギーがあれば、どんどんエネルギーを使っても大丈夫」と考えるのは基本的に誤って
いる。エネルギー問題と環境問題は分かちがたく結びついており、エネルギー消費が
増えればそれだけ環境負荷は増す。もっとも、この問題は他の原子力発電や核融合な
どでも同じことだが。そういう意味では、エネルギーさえ作ればエネルギー問題は解
決するという考え方自体が「ニセ科学」の要素を持っていることは頭にいれておくべ きである。
もちろんフリー・エネルギー研究者がいるというだけであれ
ば、笑って済ませてもかまわない。ところが、これを政権与党である公明党の国会議
員団が視察に行った（公明党の広報資料に出ている）とか、市民派を謳う雑誌である
『週刊金曜日』の連載小説で肯定的に取り上げられているなどという事例を前にする
と、必ずしも笑って済ませているわけにはいかないのかもしれないという気がしてく る。
４．マイナスイオンの教訓
マイナスイオンはニセ科学である にもかかわらず、どういうわけか大手家電メーカーがこぞって参入して一大ブームと
なった。現在は終息に向かいつつあるようだが、ニセ科学に参入した家電メーカー は ” 大手” なりの責任をきちんととる気があるのだろうか。
なぜニセ科学 なのかからはじめよう。マイナスイオン発生装置と呼ばれるものは大きく三種類にわ けられる 。( 1) 水を細かく粉砕して噴霧するもの( 2) 放電によるもの( 3 ) トルマリンを 用いたもの。方法が違えば生成されるものも違う。実際、「 マイナスイオン」と称さ れるものは(1) では帯電した細かな水滴(2)では空気中の何かが帯電したもの( 3)は何
も出ない、ということになる。これらをまとめて「
マイナスイオン」と称してもしょ
うがないことは明らかだし、もちろん、それらすべてが身体にいいなどということは
ありえない。実際、(2)の方式では身体に悪いオゾンも発生するはずである。おそら
く元々のアイデアは(1)であり、これには少なくとも加湿効果くらいはあるだろう。
マイナスイオンが身体にいいとされる根拠は『医学領域 空気イオンの理 論と実際』（木村・谷口）という文献に求められる。ところが、これがなんと第二次
大戦前の本、もちろん現在では省みられることのない学説である。多くの通販カタロ
グなどでこの文献が引用されているが、発表年を表示していないところを見ると、後
ろめたいところがあるのに違いない。
さて、マイナスイオンブームは堀口 昇・山野井昇・菅原明子という三人の ” 権威者 ” によって牽引されてきた。この三人 が揃いも揃って普通の意味での研究者ではなかったこともこのブームの面白いところ である。たとえば、テレビなどで東京大学医学研究科所属・工学博士と紹介される一 人は、たしかに東大所属だが東大の研究者総覧には記載されていない。テレビ局は本 当の身分を知った上でやっているはずなので、マスコミも共犯という事例である。
結局、マイナスイオンはニセ科学の中でも悪質な部類に属する確信犯的な
ものだったわけである。まきこまれた大手家電メーカー（特に掃除機の吸い込み口に
トルマリンを練りこんだ某メーカーなど）の開発者には同情を禁じえない。
しかし、ここでは ” なぜ一般に受け入れられたか ” に注目したい。もちろ ん、マスコミが大きくとりあげたことは大きいが、それだけではなさそうだ。ひとつ にはイオンという 言葉から受ける 「科学っぽい」印象である。おそらく、マイナスイ
オン商品を買った人のほとんどは、身体にいいことが”科学的に証明されているか
ら” 買ったのだろう。オカルトも超能力も信じない人でもマイナスイオンには引っか
かるということである。
もうひとつは、マイナスはよくてプラスは悪いと いう「二分法」の圧倒的なわかりやすさである。血液型と違い、二分法が有効にはた
らいた例と言えそうである。
追 記( 2006/2/23 ) : マイナスイオンの歴史については未だによくわからないのだが、欧米(米のみ?)ではかつてコロナ放電式のイオン発生器が流行ったらしい。コロナ放電で発生するのは大気イオン(空気イオン)で、コロナ放電に限れば、日本でいうマイナスイオンは negative air ion に相当する。negative air ionが動物の行動に影響するという論文は、それなりの数見つけることができるのだが、マイナスイオン商品を正当化できるほどのものは見あたらない。しかし、上に書いた「現代では省みられることのない」は言い過ぎで、ときどき省みられてはいるようだ。文献リストに挙げてある『ハインズ博士「超科学」をきる』に取り上げられているイオン製造器もコロナ放電と思われる。ハインズ博士の見解をまとめると、空気イオンはたしかに人間の行動に影響するようだが、その効果は微妙で、イオン製造器を買うだけの価値はないということ。この状況はマイナスイオンブームを経た今でもたいして変わらないと思われる。堀口昇が書いた「マイナスイオンの医療応用」という解説文献があるのだが、引用文献中で生理作用に関する英語文献はひとつだけしかないようだ。なお、天羽さんの「水商売ウォッチング」に文献がいろいろ掲載されている。では、これは「ニセ科学」ではなく「未科学」なのかということになるのだが、残念ながらそうはいかない。効果がはっきりしないものをあたかも効果についての科学的な証明があるかのようにいうのはやはり「ニセ科学」である。「よく調べれば、マイナスイオンの効果が明らかになるのではないか」という反論を受けることがあるのだが、それは本末転倒で、「よく調べてマイナスイオンの効果が明らかになったから、商品化する」でなくてはならないことは誰が考えても当然の話。ところで、水破砕式のルーツはやっぱりわからない
５．波動
ニセ科学の世界に 「 波動 」 という言葉が現れて久しい。「波動」と聞くといかにも物理学の専門用語のように思
えるが、実はここでいう「波動」は物理学的な概念ではない。では、「波動」とはな
にか。おそらくもっとも正確な答は”波動測定器で測られるもの”である。
波動測定器は、一見非常に複雑で精巧な装置らしい外観を持っている。こ
れで何をどのように測るのか。まず測定したい対象（健康器具のようなものや食品で あることが多い）を用意し、測定したい項目を入力する。項目は主として身体に関す るもので、たとえば腎臓や肝臓などの臓器名やさまざまな病名、あるいは” 免疫 ” な どである。すると波動測定器は 「 この食品の波動は腎臓について+21」などと結果を
一個の数値として出力する。数値の流儀はいろいろあるが、代表的な装置では数値は
-21から+21までの整数で、-21が最低、+21が最高というものである。つまり、上に挙
げた例では問題の食品は腎臓に対して最高の効果を持つと判定されたことになる。
波動測定器の仕組みはほぼ解明されていて、どうやら測定者自身の電気抵
抗を測っているらしい。要するに、嘘発見器である。実際、熟練した測定者でないと
正しい数値が出ないと言われており、測定対象の性質を客観的に表わすものでないこ とは明らかである。
この 「波動測定器」というアイデアの秀逸さは特筆に
値する。たとえば、普通の検査機関に食品の成分分析を依頼したとしよう。結果は、
1g中に何が何mg、何が何mgというデータが延々と並んだものになるだろう。それでは
わかりにくいので、”結局、身体にいいのか悪いのか”と質問したとしても、明らか
に毒性の物質が含まれるのでもない限りは、曖昧な答しか返ってこないだろう。”身
体にいいか悪いか ” はひと言で答えられるようなものではないからだ。
と ころが、波動測定器は違う。+21なら最高、-21なら最低なのである。+10程度なら
「 そこそこにいいのだな」と判断されるのだろう。自前の検査機関を持たない中小企
業にとっては福音と言ってよい。「波動測定器の数値が+21だったので、この食品は
＊＊によいことが示されました」などと言えるからである。実際、波動測定器の測定
結果を添付した商品を数多く見かける。
どうやら、数値があることによっ て、見る者に科学的で客観的という印象を与えているようである。波動という言葉の
「科学っぽさ」もさることながら、数値で表わすというアイデアによって、科学らし
さがより強調され、一般の人にも受け入れやすくなったのだろう。もちろん、科学者
の目から見れば、複雑な問題に対して単位のない数値を一個だけ出力する測定器など
奇怪な代物としか言えないのだが。
こ の「波動」ブームを牽引する江本勝 もまた科学者ではない。実は波動には「サトルエネルギー学会」という専門学会が存
在する。しかし、これは波動が存在することを前提とした学会なので、波動そのもの
に対する批判能力はまったく期待できない。ニセ科学学会というわけだ。
しかし、笑ってばかりもいられない。江本の著書「水からの伝言」に端を発したある
ブームが深刻な問題を引き起こしているからである。「水からの伝言」は江本らが独
自の手法で作った水の結晶の写真を集めたもので、本を開くと美しい結晶の写真が次
々と目にはいってくる。ところが、美しいだけならいいのだが、ここには驚くべき話
が書かれている。たとえば、水に「ありがとう」という言葉を見せたのち（水をいれ
たビンに文字を印刷した紙を貼って、文字通り” 見せる ” ）、その水で結晶を作ると 水はきれいな結晶を作り、一方、
「死ね」などの言葉を見せた水はきれいな結晶を作
らないというのである。もちろん「平和」は美しい結晶を作り、「戦争」は作らない など、言葉と結晶のあいだには一定の（実にわかりやすい）関係がある。
この話などはもはや科学を装ってすらいないと思うし、ちょっとでも常識があれば笑
い飛ばす程度の話だったはずである。その意味では、これまでに述べてきた「ニセ科
学」よりもオカルトに近い。ところが、これが” 実験結果” として本に掲載されてい るというだけで科学的事実と思い込む人たちもいるのである。しかも、仰天すること に、これを小学校の道徳の教材として使っている先生たちが少なからずいる。「言葉 は水の性質を変える。人間の身体は多くの水分を含むのだから、言葉は人間の身体に も影響する。美しい言葉を使いましょう」というわけだ。
この授業 がＴＯ ＳＳ（教育技術法則化運動）と呼ばれる運動に参加する小学校の先生のあいだで広ま
っている。事実、私の友人の娘さんは授業参観の機会にこの授業を受けたらしい。
これは憂慮すべき事態である。問題点は大きくふたつ挙げられる。まず、
明白に非科学的であるものを「事実」であるかのように教えていること。小学校も高
学年ともなれば、中には批判力のある子どももいるはずで、生徒が「そんなことはあ
りえない」と発言したらどうするつもりなのだろうか。また、水の結晶と道徳の関連
性がまったく示されないまま、アドホックに”きれいな結晶ができるのはよいこと ”
として教えてしまうというのは思考停止であろう。特に” 道徳” としては問題が大き い。
ニセ科学がこのような形で 「 理科」ではなく「 道徳 」 や「 総合的学 習 の時間」に侵入しつつあることは我々もよく認識しておくべきである。
６．ド ーマン法と 「 奇跡の詩人 」
最後の実例として 、NHK テレビで放映されて 大論争になった 「奇跡の詩人」問題をとりあげよう。新生児期に脳障害となり、事実
上ひとりでは動くこともコミュニケーションを取ることもできなかった日木流奈君 が、ドーマン法というリハビリ法の訓練を受け、母親に介助されながら文字盤を使っ
て文章を組み立てるファシリテイテッド・コミュニケーションという技法を身に付け
ることにによって、会話ができるようになっただけではなく、本まで出版してしまっ たという話である。
ドーマン法はアメリカで始められたリハビリ法で、特
に先天的な知的障害者に対するリハビリで知られている。ドーマン法の背景となる ” 理論 ” をまとめると以下のようになる。脳は発達し続けるものであり、知的障害は発
達が停止あるいは遅滞することによって起きる。これは、加速させることが可能であ
るしたがって、知的障害のリハビリには、適切な刺激を与え続けることによって、脳
の発達を加速させればよい。
そのための具体的な手法としては、 ” 正常 な ” 動作を無理やり行なわせることによって正しい” パターン” を学習させる「パタ
ーニング」、自分の呼気を吸わせる「呼吸訓練」、そして上述のFascilitated communicationがある。特にパターニングでは何人もの大人が手足を持って、子ども
を無理やりに動作させるということが行なわれる。
理論があると書いた が、むろんこの理論は学問的には全く認められていない。それどころか、アメリカで はいくつかの学会が否定的声明を出している。また、当然のことだがFascilitated communication では介助者の意図が反映することが明らかになっている。さらにパタ ーニングのやりかたから推測できるように、ドーマン法は親だけではできず、何人も のボランティアを必要とする。事実、インターネットで検索すると、ドーマン法のた めにボランティアを募集しているという記述をいくつも見つけることができる。
少なくとも知的障害のリハビリ法としては明らかにニセ科学である。ドー
マン法はいわば ” 藁をも掴む ” 親の気持ちにつけこんだもので、実際、この指導を受
けるにはかなりの金額が必要とされる。しかし、親の負担もさることながら、これが
意思疎通能力を欠く子どもに対する虐待以外のなにものでもないという点がより重要 である。
７．間違った科学とニセ科学
ニセ科学を敢えて分類する と、大きく(1)最初からニセ科学だったもの(2)初めは科学だったがニセ科学に変質し
たもの、の二つになるだろう。これまでに見てきた最近の事例はほとんどが( 1 )に属
するものだった。血液型の古川説あたりが辛うじて(2)だろう。どうも日常生活に近
いところで見られるニセ科学には(1)が多そうである。(2)も含めて議論するために、
ここでニセ科学と「間違った科学」の違いを考えてみよう。
科学の発展は 仮説と実証の積み重ねであるから、もちろん中には「 間違った仮説」もあれば「正し
くなかった実験」も膨大にあったし、現在も膨大に生産されている。しかし、それら は決して「ニセ科学」ではない。単に間違っただけである。
常温核融合は 少々微妙だが、それでも最初に発表した２グループのうち、ジョーンズのグループの
ものは普通の意味での「科学」だった。実際、常温核融合騒動が終わったのちも、ジ
ョーンズは特に批判されていない。常温核融合は一時多くの科学者の興味をひいた
し、実際に追試を試みた学者も多かった。問題は、そういった追試がことごとく失敗
したあとの対応である。常温核融合が否定されてからも、「あるはずだ」という思い
込みで研究を続行したひと握りの学者はやはりニセ科学にはまったと言うべきだろ
う。普通の科学がニセ科学に変質したのである。
ただし、常温核融合関連 の研究を続けていれば即ニセ科学だというわけでもない。科学であるかないかは結局
は科学者側の態度や姿勢によるのであって、同じテーマが科学にもニセ科学にもなり うるからである。
歴史的に有名な 「 間違った科学」の例としてはポリウォ
ーターが挙げられる。この時には、関係した科学者たちが最終的にポリウォーター仮
説が誤りであることに合意して終結した。つまり、常温核融合とは違い、研究者たち
は科学から足を踏み外すことなかった。間違いでは合ったが、科学として正しく終わ ったわけである。
当然、科学とニセ科学のあいだには広大なグレイゾーン
があり、科学ともニセ科学ともつかないケースはいくつでも見つけることができる。
それはそれでしょうがない。グレーゾーンがあるからといって科学とニセ科学は区別
できないとなどと考えるのは短絡思考である。世の中にはグレーゾーンから遠くはな
れて、誰がどう見てもニセ科学だというものがあふれている。つまり、ニセ科学はニ セ科学である。
８．ニセ科学はなぜ受け入れられる
いくつかの実 例を議論した中で 、 「 ニセ科学 」 は” 科学に見え る ” ということを強調した。いや、 それどころか、実は本物の科学よりも科学らしく見えてしまい、だからこそ受け入れ られているのではないだろうか。つまり、ニセ科学の信奉者は決して科学が嫌いなわ けではなく、本物の科学よりもニセ科学のほうを 「 より科学的」と感じているのでは ないだろうか 。
その理由となるのが、科学の実像とパブリックイメージと
のギャップである。推測だが、科学に対しては「さまざまな問題に対して、曖昧さな
く白黒はっきりつけるもの」というイメージを抱いている人が多そうである。もちろ
ん、現実にはそうではない。科学は本来曖昧なものである。科学者に質問したとして
も、いろいろな留保条件をつけたりいくつもの言い訳をした上で、しかも往々にして
歯切れ悪く曖昧な結論しか出せない。科学者の態度としてはこれが普通なのだが、パ
ブリックイメージからすればこれはあまり科学らしくない。
一方、ニセ科 学はどうか。プラスは悪く、マイナスはよいだとか、A型は几帳面だとか、+21は腎臓 に最高だとか、とにかく小気味よくものごとに白黒をつけてくれる。この思い切りの
よさは、決して本当の科学には期待できないものであるが、しかしそれこそが科学に
期待されるものなのに違いない。 「 科学らしさ」に加えて、ニセ科学が受け入れら
れるもうひとつの理由として、「願望充足」を挙げておく。ニセ科学は、信じたいと
願っていることを提示してくれる。一部の人にとっては「信じたい」と「信じる」が
ほぼイコールなのだろう。それは一種のニューエイジ思想だが、そこから市民運動と
ニセ科学の結びつきが生じる。市民運動家には、原発の悪い点、大企業の悪い点、大
規模開発の悪い点、そういうものを提示してくれる説は信じて、そうでない説は信じ
ないという傾向がどうしても見られるのだが、イデオロギーに合う説だけを受け入れ
るなら冒頭にも書いたようにルイセンコ事件の縮小再生産版みたいなものである。
９．科学者の役割
ニセ科学は決して 「 科学離れ 」 や「 反科学 」 の 結果として信じられているのではなく、むしろ「科学的」だからこそ信じられている
のではないかというのが、本稿全体を通じての仮説だった。ニセ科学のほうが科学よ
りも科学らしく見えるとしたら問題である。いくつかの実例で述べたように、ある種
のニセ科学は笑って済ませられない問題を抱えている。それに対しては科学者からの
批判が重要である。しかし、ニセ科学を批判しても「業績」にならないという現状が
あり、発言する科学者はあまり多くない。業績にならないとしても、長い目で見ると
ニセ科学を放置することは自分の首を絞めることにつながるはずである。科学者はも
っと「ニセ科学」について勉強するべきだろう。

All Things Pythonic
Stricter Whitespace Enforcement
by Guido van van Rossum
April 1 , 2005
Summary
The Python Style Guide ( PEP 8 ) lists a number of guidelines for the use of whitespace .
Since there are still a lot of folks ignoring these rules , here 's a proposal for enforcing them .
Advertisement
Python currently gives you a lot of freedom on how to format your code .
For example , instead of this :
def fool ( one , four ) : year = 2005 while year < 10000000 : year *= 10 return year + four * 100 + one
you could just as well have written this :
def fool ( one , four ) : year=2005 while ( year < 10000000 ) : year *= 10 return ( year + four * 100+ one )
This is a clear violation of TOOWTDI and enables poorly written code .
Therefore , I propose that as soon as practical , Python should enforce the following rules for horizontal whitespace :
All code indented with four spaces .
This will also get rid of the tabs problem !
No redundant parentheses allowed ( e.g. no " return ( 1 ) " where " return 1 " would do ) .
No whitespace immediately following a left parentheses or immediately before a right parenthesis .
No whitespace before a left parenthesis that starts an argument list , or before a left square bracket that starts an index expression ( e.g. " x [y ] " ) .
No whitespace before a comma or semicolon .
Exactly one space required after a comma or semicolon ( except when at the end of a line ) .
No semicolon at the end of a line ( it 's redundant ) .
More than one consecutive space within an expression is never allowed .
Asignment and comparison operators must be surrounded by spaces .
The amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary operator should be the same .
If variable amounts of whitespace are used within an expression , this should correspond to the relative priorities of the operators used .
For example : " 1* 2 + 3 * 4 " is okay but " 1* 2 + 3 * 4 " is not .
However , " 1* 2+3 * 4 " is still encouraged .
No space allowed before a colon .
In a dictionary display , exactly one space required after a colon .
In a slice , none .
The short form of a block ( " if x : y " ) is abandoned ; you must use the newline - plus - indentation form .
A limited form of vertical whitespace fascism may also be introduced , although this may encounter more resistance , so it may be put off until Python 3.0 :
At least one blank line should separate function or method definitions .
At least two blank lines should separate classes .
In order to give users sufficient time to adapt their coding style , the new syntax will be optional in Python 2.5 , and required in Python 2.6 .
In Python 2.5 , you can enable the strict whitespace checking for a particular module with a future statement :
from __future__ import whitespace
I have hacked up a quick and dirty implementation , which is available at the following SourceForge URL ( new , now updated ! ) :
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1175070&group_id=5470&atid=305470

He moved from the Netherlands to the USA in 1995 , where he met his wife .
Until July 2003 they lived in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington , DC with their son Orlijn , who was born in 2001 .
They then moved to Silicon Valley where Guido now works for Google ( spending 50 % of his time on Python ! ) .

The Life
I suspect that many Mac users — as well as some aspiring developers — have only a half - conceived notion of the economics involved with becoming a successful indie Mac developer .
The basic idea is that a developer comes up with an idea for an app , implements it , ships it , and starts selling software licenses for , typically , around $ 20 - 40 a pop .
If he can sell 1,000 licenses in a year , that ’s a nice hobby .
Sell 2,000 , and he ’s getting close ; at around 3,000 licenses per year , revenue is probably in the ballpark range of a full - time salary .
( Keep in mind , however , that , say , $ 80,000 in software license revenue results in much less personal income than a job with an $ 80,000 salary ; salaried jobs tend to come with things like health insurance . )
At that point , I think , many people assume the developer has achieved The Life .
Economically freed from the need for a day job , he gets to hack all day on the software instead of being forced to squeeze development time out of nights and weekends .
I.e. that once a developer gets to the point where revenue from license sales is high enough to be considered a good full - time salary , he ’s done , and now he just has to keep it going .
But then what ?
What does it mean to keep it going ?
The full story is that like most forms of popularity , software sales tend to follow a power - law distribution .
Most apps languish in obscurity , but popular apps tend to become super - popular .
The hardest part about selling software is just getting noticed ; if your app is only known by the sort of people who check VersionTracker and MacUpdate a few times a day , or even just the sort of people who know what VersionTracker and MacUpdate are , it ’s unlikely that you ’ll sell enough software to earn a living .
But once you get over that initial hump , subsequent sales become much easier .
You start getting media coverage , and most importantly , assuming most of your users are happy , word - of - mouth advertising really starts to bloom .
But selling software is n’t like selling books .
When a book takes off and climbs the best - seller charts , that ’s just money in the author ’s pocket .
Each software sale , on the other hand , comes with incremental support costs .
Users need help .
They need help when they encounter bugs .
They need help sometimes when the software is working as intended .
With thousands of users , even if your software has few bugs and an easy - to - figure - out UI , you ’re going to field dozens of support issues every day .
And once it breaks out of the early - adopter crowd , new users are going to be even more likely to be the sort of people who need help with seemingly ridiculous issues , such as what to do with a disk image .
So the conundrum is this : once a developer gets enough paying users to consider quitting his day job so he can devote full - time effort to writing code , he ’s quite possibly got so many paying users that he ’ll spend much of his time helping customers in ways other than writing code .
That ’s why so few developers pull this trick off .
Two that come to mind are Michael “ C - Command ” Tsai and Gus “ Flying Meat ” Mueller .
I ’m sure there are others , but the list of one - man - show indie Mac developers is short .
Gone Gator
Which brings us to Brent Simmons , and last week ’s announcement that NewsGator has purchased the rights to Ranchero Software , including NetNewsWire , and hired Simmons as a “ product architect ” , which means , more or less , that he ’s been hired to keep working on NetNewsWire .
I get the impression that many NetNewsWire users were surprised by this .
Not that NewsGator would want to buy NetNewsWire — people had been speculating about this ever since NewsGator bought Nick Bradbury ’s Windows - only FeedDemon back in May 1 — but that Simmons would want to sell .
By the “ make some cool software and sell enough copies to make a nice salary for yourself ” theory , Simmons was , obviously , doing quite well .
On a typical weekday , Daring Fireball ’s main RSS feed is accessed by NetNewsWire from about 8,000 unique IP addresses ; in the month of October to date , 21,274 unique IPs hit the main DF feed using NetNewsWire .
And those are only the numbers for the paid version of NetNewsWire , not the free NetNewsWire Lite — add in another 15,468 unique IP addresses if you want to count NetNewsWire Lite , too .
Unique IP addresses do not correspond , one - to - one , to unique users , of course .
One kid with an iBook wandering around a Wi-Fi- saturated college campus could be hitting it from half a dozen different IP addresses in a day .
But it ’s a good ballpark estimate , and so it ’s hard to look at these server stats and come to any conclusion other than that Ranchero has sold many thousands of NetNewsWire licenses .
RSS usage is still nascent ; there are still more people out there who do n’t use an RSS aggregator but who will , soon , than there are people already using one .
And NetNewsWire ’s position in the market is stronger than ever , even in the face of new and free competitors .
Daring Fireball ’s feed traffic certainly is n’t representative of the RSS market as a whole , but NetNewsWire ’s presence is simply remarkable nonetheless .
Here ’s a breakdown by percentage of aggregators accessing Daring Fireball ’s main feed , from 1 September – 10 October 2005 :
Aggregator Share NetNewsWire ( total ) 64.1 NetNewsWire 1.0.x 1.2 NetNewsWire 2.0.x 34.0 NetNewsWire Lite 1.0.x 4.0 NetNewsWire Lite 2.0.x 26.1 Safari 14.8 News
Fire 3.7 PulpFiction ( total ) 1.4 PulpFiction Lite 0.8 PulpFiction 0.6 FeedDemon 0.7 Shrook 0.5 OmniWeb 0.2 Other 18.6
( The 18.6 percent “ Other ” is mostly a long tail of many different user agents , although a few percent of them are apparently using Firefox ’s “ Live Bookmarks ” , but I did n’t feel like re-running the script to count them separately . )
Arguably , looking at my main feed is statistically unfair given that it ’s included in the default subscription list for NetNewsWire .
There are quite possibly many people who are subscribed to DF ’s feed not because they ’re regular readers , but simply because they never bothered to unsubscribe from the default feeds in NetNewsWire .
More fair would be to look at the stats for the special RSS feed for my Tiger Details Report back in April .
The top four user agents accessing that feed :
Aggregator Share NetNewsWire ( total ) 51.4 NetNewsWire 2.0.x 36.1 NetNewsWire Lite 2.0.x 14.0 Safari 38.0 News
Fire 3.3 NetNewsWire 1.0.8 1.3 Mozilla /5.0 ( Sage ) 0.9
Even here , with a brand new feed that is not listed in the default subscriptions for any aggregator , NetNewsWire ’s share is significantly higher than Safari’s , and no one else is really even in the same ballpark .
And the numbers from Daring Fireball members who subscribe to the members - only RSS feeds ( full - content for regular articles , and the Linked List feed ) are just sick :
Aggregator Share NetNewsWire ( total ) 74.2 NetNewsWire 1.0.x 0.1 NetNewsWire 2.0.x 62.2 NetNewsWire Lite 1.0.x 0.9 NetNewsWire Lite 2.0.x 12.5 Safari 9.6 Bloglines 9.5 News
Fire 8.5 PulpFiction 1.7 OmniWeb 1.4 Shrook 1.3 FeedDemon 0.4 Other 16.5
NetNewsWire ’s market share among Daring Fireball members is simply titanic .
These numbers are interesting in a few other ways , as well :
The number of DF members using the paid version is almost five times higher than the number using the free Lite version ; for the Tiger Details Report feed it was only about two times higher , and for the default ( free ) DF feed , the numbers are close to even .
Safari ’s market share here is curiously low , I suspect because it does n’t make much sense to use Safari ’s RSS feature to read the full - content Daring Fireball feed ; Safari ’s RSS - reading UI is clearly optimized for excerpts and blurb - length posts , and if that ’s what you want , you might as well use the regular excerpts - only DF feed even if you are a paid member with access to the full - content feed .
I do n’t track Bloglines in my free feeds , because I do n’t think there ’s any good way of accurately gauging how many people are actually using it .
Bloglines reports that over 3,000 Bloglines users are subscribed to my default feed , but that counts everyone who has ever used Bloglines to read my feed , even people who tried Bloglines out for a day and decided they did n’t like it .
Whereas with the members - only feeds , it ’s possible to get an accurate count because each member uses their own username and password to access the feeds .
News
Fire is way more popular with Daring Fireball members than with non-members .
Same goes for OmniWeb , PulpFiction , and Shrook for that matter .
I think this is simply common sense : people who are willing to pay money to support Daring Fireball are more likely than average to be willing to pay money to purchase software .
Sold Out
And so the thinking of those who were surprised by this deal goes something like , I thought Brent was doing great on his own , why would he sell the app to a larger company and take a job working for them , when he was already living The Life , working only for himself ?
The thing is , Ranchero was doing great , sales - wise .
The problem is that they were doing so great that Simmons was n’t living The Life .
One thing worth noting is that Brent was not alone at Ranchero ; he was helped , tremendously , by the full - time help of his wife and partner Sheila .
Sheila managed a bunch of the unglamorous aspects of running the business , most especially serving as the first responder for customer support .
The fact that Brent had Sheila ’s full - time help is probably the only reason he was able to fly solo for as long as he did .
In fact , it ’s not even fair to say that Brent was in the same one - man - show category that Michael Tsai and Gus Mueller are in .
Sheila was the secret ingredient that kept Ranchero rolling as the NetNewsWire user base grew into the thousands .
But NewsWire ’s continuing boom pushed things to the point where even with Sheila ’s full - time help , Brent was n’t getting to spend nearly as much time as he wanted writing code .
Instead , he was spending time helping customers make use of the code he ’d already written .
Novelists are n’t expected to help people read their books ; musicians do n’t help fans play their CDs ; but programmers are expected to help you with their software .
When a solo developer reaches the point where an app becomes so popular he needs help , there are only several options .
One is to hire help , to build a company around the products .
Two long - standing examples are Bare Bones Software and Panic ; Rogue Amoeba is an example of a newcomer .
But there ’s nothing easy about this .
For one thing , even if you hire just one person , you ’ve greatly increased the amount of revenue you need to generate .
And it needs to be steadier revenue — if you ’re only supporting yourself , you do n’t have to write paychecks every two weeks .
Running a company with even a single employee involves a ton of overhead ; the whole point of The Life is the idea that you can just sit around all day hacking on code and watch the money roll in through Kagi or eSellerate .
That ’s not what it ’s like if you own a software company with employees .
Another option is just not to worry about keeping up with the flow of support issues .
Tempting , for sure , but certainly not a good way to build up a reserve of goodwill from your users .
There ’s a lot of overlap in the Venn diagram of the intersection between successful indie Mac developers and indie Mac developers with a reputation for being responsive to customers .
From what I know of Brent Simmons , this was never an option for him — his personality is such that he ’s incapable of being unresponsive to his users .
And then there ’s the buyout solution .
Instead of building a new company around the product , sell the product to an existing company .
A decade ago , this was a common pattern for indie Mac developers — build a product , get some revenue , and then sell to a larger company .
NetNewsWire users are worried about this NewsGator deal .
For one thing , NewsGator is largely unknown , or , rather , is largely unknown in the Mac world .
Another basis for concern is the memory of other acquisitions that have gone sour in the past .
( The old joke about Symantec is that their slogan should have been : “ Where good software goes to die ” . )
But mostly I think NetNewsWire users are worried because they ’re confused , because they do n’t understand why Brent would sell Ranchero if he was already doing well financially on his own .
And so I suspect there ’s some lingering concern that Brent has simply cashed out and will be walking away from NetNewsWire .
Not that there ’d be anything wrong with cashing out , if that ’s what Brent wanted to do , but I ’m extremely bullish on the future of NetNewsWire , and reason is that I do n’t think the motivating factor for Brent was the money , but rather the time .
I got to talk to Brent about this extensively last week at the Web 2.0 Conference .
I do n’t know and did n’t ask the financial terms of the acquisition , but I think it ’s safe to assume Brent did well by the deal .
And but I do know and did ask what Brent ’s role is going to be moving forward : he ’ll be devoting nearly all of his time to improving NetNewsWire , which he was no longer able to do at Ranchero .
It ought to work out well for everyone .
Brent and Sheila get rewarded financially for their success and work over the past two years , and Brent gets to devote his time and energy to programming .
By selling his company and working on NetNewsWire as a NewsGator employee , Brent has actually gotten closer to The Life than he was as an indie .
NetNewsWire users get a generous transition deal : two years of subscription service to NewsGator online , including synching storage , access to other NewsGator software , and all updates to NetNewsWire released in that time .
Considering that NetNewsWire 2.0 was a free update , this makes NetNewsWire 1.0 look like one of the best deals in Mac history — if you bought NetNewsWire 1.0 in February 2003 , you not only still have n’t paid a dime in upgrade fees , but you wo n’t for another two years , either .
And not only will the free NetNewsWire Lite remain , but they plan to add synching features to it .
As for NewsGator , in the course of one week they ’ve gone from having almost no presence in the Mac RSS market to being the most important third - party RSS developer on the platform .
They now publish the best desktop news reader for the Mac as well as what ’s generally regarded as the best news reader for Windows , FeedDemon .
And they ’re doing it right — they ’ve kept the original developers on board , and they have no plans to merge the two into a Frankensteinian “ FeedWire ” or “ NetNewsDemon ” .
This is a story involving a lot of money , a lot of users , an ambitious company , and a popular new technology that ’s heading into the mainstream .
But what it really boils down to is a crackerjack programmer carving out a space where he can continue focusing on one of the best apps the Mac has ever seen .
MENLO PARK , Calif . - GEOFF GOODFELLOW is a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who came up with an idea that resulted in a $ 612.5 million payday .
But he will never see a penny of it .
He remains little known even in Silicon Valley and , perhaps most surprising , he does n't really mind .
And herein lies one of the stranger tales about innovation and money in the world of technology .
A high - school dropout , Mr. Goodfellow had his light - bulb moment in 1982 , when he came up with the idea of sending electronic mail messages wirelessly to a portable device -- like a BlackBerry .
Only back then , there was no BlackBerry ; his vision centered on pagers .
He eventually did get financial backing to start a wireless e-mail service in the early 1990's , but it failed .
So , in 1998 , he moved to Prague and bought a bar .
While he was there , the BlackBerry did come along .
Tending bar , he believed that everyone had forgotten that he had initially come up with the idea of wireless e-mail .
Almost everyone had , that is , except for James H. Wallace Jr. , a Washington lawyer for one of the companies involved in a patent dispute over Mr. Goodfellow 's invention .

An Updated Introduction : Seven Years Later ( February 9 , 2004 )
I wrote this document a long time ago to capture the conclusions I had reached from working on application performance for a few years .
At the time that I wrote it , the way in which Microsoft dealt with performance in its products was starting to undergo a large - scale transformation .
Performance analysis up to that time had largely been an ad - hoc effort and was hampered by a lack of well - known “ best practices ” and , in some cases , the tools necessary to get the job done .
As the transition started from the 16 - bit world to the 32 - bit world , this kind of approach was clearly insufficient to deal with the increasing popularity of our products and the increasing demands that were being placed on them .
The past seven years have seen major changes in the way that performance is integrated into the development process at Microsoft , and many of the “ rules ” that I outline below have become internalized into the daily processes of most major groups in the company .
Even though a lot of what follows is no longer fresh thinking , I still get requests for the document internally which leads me to believe that there ’s still value in saying things that many people already know .
So I ’ve decided to provide in publicly here , for your edification and in the hope that someone might find it useful .
( Historical note : The “ major Microsoft application “ that I refer to below was not VB . )
A Short Introduction ( May 28 , 1997 )
In the fall of 1995 , I was part of a team working on an upgrade to a major Microsoft application when we noticed that we had a little problem — we were slower than the previous version .
Not just a little slower , but shockingly slower .
This fact had largely been ignored by the development team ( including myself ) , since we assumed it would improve once we were finished coding up our new features .
However , after a while the management team started to get a little worried .
E-mails were sent around asking whether the developers could spend some time focusing on performance .
Thinking “ How hard could this be ? ” I replied , saying that I ’d be happy to own performance .
This should be easy , I thought naively , just tweak a few loops , rewrite some brain - dead code , eliminate some unnecessary work and we ’ll be back in the black .
A full two years ( and a lot of man - years worth of work on many people ’s part ) later , we finally achieved the performance improvements that I was sure would only take me alone a few months to achieve .
Unsurprisingly , I had approached the problem of performance with a lot of assumptions about what I would find and what I would need to do .
Most of those assumptions turned out to be dead wrong or , at best , wildly inaccurate .
It took many painful months of work to learn how to “ really ” approach the problem of performance , and that was just the beginning — once I figured out what to do , I discovered that there was a huge amount of work ahead !
From that painful experience , I have come up with a set of “ Ten Rules of Performance , ” intended to help others avoid the errors that I made .
So , without further ado …
The Rules :
Rule # 1 : Do n’t assume you know anything .
In the immortal words of Pogo , “ We have met the enemy , and he is us . ”
Your biggest enemy in dealing with performance is by far all the little assumptions about your application you carry around inside your head .
Because you designed the code , because you ’ve worked on the operating system for years , because you did well in your college CS classes , you ’re tempted to believe that you understand how your application works .
Well , you do n’t .
You understand how it ’s supposed to work .
Unfortunately , performance work deals with how things actually work , which in many cases is completely different .
Bugs , design shortcuts and unforeseen cases can all cause computer systems to behave ( and execute code ) in unexpected , surprising ways .
If you want to get anywhere with performance , you must continuously test and re-test all assumptions you have : about the system , about your components , about your code .
If you ’re content to assume you know what ’s going on and never bother to prove you know what ’s going on , start getting used to saying the following phrase : “ I do n’t know what ’s wrong …
It ’s supposed to be fast ! ”
Rule # 2 : Never take your eyes off the ball
For most developers , performance exists as an abstract problem at the very beginning of the development cycle and a concrete problem at the very end of the cycle .
In between , they ’ve got better things to be doing .
As a result , typically developers write code in a way that they assume will be fast ( breaking rule # 1 ) and then end up scrambling like crazy when the beta feedback comes back that the product is too slow .
Of course , by the time the product is in beta there ’s no real time to go back and redesign things without slipping , so the best that can be done is usually some simple band - aiding of the problem and praying that everyone is buying faster machines this Christmas .
If you ’re serious about performance , you must start thinking about it when you begin designing your code and can only stop thinking about it when the final golden bits have been sent to manufacturing .
In between , you must never , ever stop testing , analyzing and working on the performance of your code .
Slowness is insidious — it will sneak into your product while you ’re not looking .
The price of speed is eternal vigilance .
Rule # 3 : Be afraid of the dark
Part of the reason why development teams find it so easy to ignore performance problems in favor of working on new features ( or on bugs ) is that rarely , if ever , is there anything to make them sit up and pay attention .
Developers notice when the schedule shows them falling behind , and they start to panic when their bug list begins to grow too long .
But most teams never have any kind of performance benchmark that can show developers how slow ( or fast ) things actually are .
Instead , most teams thrash around in the dark , randomly addressing performance in an extremely ad hoc way and failing to motivate their developers to do anything about the problems that exist .
One of the most critical elements of a successful performance strategy is a set of reproducible real - world benchmarks run over a long period of time .
If the benchmarks are not reproducible or real - world , they are liable to be dismissed by everyone as insignificant .
And they must be run over a long period of time ( and against previous versions ) to give a real level of comparison .
Most importantly , they must be run on a typical user ’s machine .
Usually , coming up with such numbers will be an eye opening experience for you and others on your team .
“ What do you mean that my feature has slowed down 146 % since the previous version ?!? ”
It ’s a great motivator and will tell you what you really need to be working on .
Rule # 4 : Assume things will always get worse
The typical state of affairs in a development team is that the developers are always behind the eight ball .
There ’s another milestone coming up that you have to get those twenty features done for , and then once that milestone is done there ’s another one right around the corner .
What gets lost in this rush is the incentive for you to take some time as you go along to make sure that non-critical performance problems are fixed .
At the end of milestone 1 , your benchmarks may say that your feature is 15 % slower but you ’ve got a lot of work to do and , hey , it ’s only milestone 1 !
At the end of milestone 2 , the benchmarks now tell you your feature is 30 % slower , but you ’re pushing for an alpha release and you just do n’t have time to worry about it .
At the end of milestone 3 , you ’re code complete , pushing for beta and the benchmarks say that your feature is now 90 % slower and program management is beginning to freak out .
Under pressure , you finally profile the feature and discover the design problems that you started out with back in milestone 1 .
Only now with beta just weeks away and then a push to RTM , there ’s no way you can go back and redesign things from the ground up !
Avoid this mistake — always assume that however bad things are now , they ’re only going to get worse in the future , so you ’d better deal with them now .
The longer you wait , the worse it ’s going to be for you .
It ’s true more often than you think .
Rule # 5 : Problems have to be seen to be believed ( or : profile , profile , profile )
Here ’s the typical project ’s approach to performance : Performance problems are identified .
Development goes off , thinks about their design and says “ We ’ve got it !
The problem must be X .
If we just do Y , everything will be fixed ! ”
Development goes off and does Y . Surprisingly , the performance problems persist .
Development goes off , thinks about their design and says “ We ’ve got it !
The problem must be A .
If we just do B , everything will be fixed ! ”
Development goes off and does B. Surprisingly , the performance problems persist .
Development goes off … well , you get the idea .
It ’s amazing how many iterations of this some development groups will go through before they actually admit that they do n’t know exactly what ’s going on and bother to profile their code to find out .
If you ca n’t point to a profile that shows what ’s going on , you ca n’t say you know what ’s wrong .
Every developer needs a good profiler .
Even if you do n’t deal with performance regularly , I say : Learn it , love it , live it .
It ’s an invaluable tool in a developer ’s toolbox , right up there with a good compiler and debugger .
Even if your code is running with acceptable speed , regularly profiling your code can reveal surprising information about it ’s actual behavior .
Rule # 6 : 90 % of performance problems are designed in , not coded in
This is a hard rule to swallow because a lot of developers assume that performance problems have more to do with code issues ( badly designed loops , etc ) than with the overall application design .
The sad fact of the matter is that in all but the luckiest groups , most of the big performance problems you ’re going to confront are not the nice and tidy kind of issues where someone is doing something really dumb .
Instead , it ’s going to be extremely difficult to pinpoint situations where several pieces of code are interacting in ways that end up being slow .
To solve the problems usually requires a redesign of the way large chunks of your code are structured ( very bad ) or a redesign of the way several components interact ( even worse ) .
And given that most pieces of an application are interrelated these days , a small change in the design of one piece of code may cascade into changes in several other pieces of code .
Either way it ’s not going to be simple or easy .
That ’s why you need to diagnose problems as soon as you can and get at them before you ’ve piled a lot of code on top of your designs .
Also , do n’t fall in love with your code .
Most programmers take a justifiable pride in the code that they write and even more pride in the overall design of the code .
However , this means that many times when you point out to them that their intellectually beautiful design causes horrendous performance problems and that several changes are going to be needed , they tend not to take it very well .
“ How can we mar the elegance and undeniable usability of this design ? ” they ask , horrified , adding that perhaps you should look elsewhere for your performance gains .
Do n’t fall into this trap .
A design that is beautiful but slow is like a Ferrari with the engine of a Yugo — sure , it looks great , but you certainly can’t take it very far .
Truly elegant designs are beautiful and fast .
Rule # 7 : Performance is an iterative process
At this point , you ’re probably starting to come to the realization that the rules outlined so far tend to contradict one another .
You ca n’t gauge the performance of a design until you ’ve coded it and can profile it .
However , if you ’ve got a problem , it ’s most likely going to be your design , not your code .
So , basically , there ’s no way to tell how good a design is going to be until it ’s too late to do anything about !
Not exactly , though .
If you take the standard linear model of development ( design , code , test , ship ) , you ’re right : it ’s impossible to heed all the rules .
However , if you look at the development process as being iterative ( design , code , test , re-design , re-code , re-test , re-design , re-code , re-test , … , ship ) , then it becomes possible .
You will probably have to go through and test several designs before you reach the “ right ” one .
Look at one of the most performance obsessed companies in the software business :
Id Software ( producers of the games Doom and Quake ) .
In the development of their 3D display engines ( which are super performance critical ) they often will go through several entirely different designs per week , rewriting their engine as often as necessary to achieve the result they want .
Fortunately , we ’re not all that performance sensitive , but if you expect to design your code once and get it right the first time , expect to be more wrong than right .
Rule # 8 : You ’re either part of the solution or part of the problem
This is a simple rule : do n’t be lazy .
Because we all tend to be very busy people , the reflexive way we deal with difficult problems is to push them off to someone else .
If your application is slow , you blame one of your external components and say “ it ’s their problem . ”
If you ’re one of the external components , you blame the application for using you in a way you did n’t expect and say “ it ’s their problem . ”
Or you blame the operating system and say “ it ’s their problem . ”
Or you blame the user for doing something stupid and say “ it ’s their problem . ”
The problem with this way of dealing with these things is that soon the performance issue ( which must be solved ) is bouncing around like a pinball until it ’s lucky enough to land on someone who ’s going to say “ I do n’t care whose problems this is , we ’ve got to solve it ” and then does .
In the end , it does n’t matter whose fault it is , just that the problem gets fixed .
You may be entirely correct that some boneheaded developer on another team caused your performance regression , but if it ’s your feature it ’s up to you to find a solution .
If you think this is unfair , get over it .
Our customers do n’t blame a particular developer for a performance problem , they blame Microsoft .
Also , do n’t live with a mystery .
At one point in working on the boot performance of my application , I had done all the right things ( profiled , re-designed , re-profiled , etc ) but I started getting strange results .
My profiles showed that I ’d sped boot up by 30 % , but the benchmarks we were running showed it had slowed down by 30 % .
My first instinct was to dismiss the benchmarks as being wrong , but they had been so reliable in the past ( see rule # 3 ) that I could n’t do that .
So I was left with a mystery .
My second instinct was to ignore this mystery , report that I ’d sped the feature up 30 % and move on .
Fortunately , program management was also reading the benchmark results , so I could n’t slime out of it that easily .
So I was forced to spend a few weeks beating my head against a wall trying to figure out what was going on .
In the process , I discovered rule # 9 below which explained the mystery .
Case closed .
I ’ve seen many , many developers ( including myself on plenty of other occasions ) fall into the trap of leaving mysteries unsolved .
If you ’ve got a mystery , some nagging detail that is n’t quite right , some performance slowdown that you can’t quite explain , do n’t be lazy and do n’t stop until you ’ve solved the mystery .
Otherwise you may miss the key to your entire performance puzzle .
Rule # 9 : It ’s the memory , stupid .
As I mentioned above , I reached a point in working on speeding up application boot where my profiles showed that I was 30 % faster , but the benchmarks indicated I was 30 % slower .
After much hair - pulling , I discovered that the profiling method that I had chosen effectively filtered out the time the system spent doing things like faulting memory pages in and flushing dirty pages out to disk .
Given that : 1 ) We faulted a lot of code in from disk to boot , and 2 ) We allocated a lot of dynamic memory on boot , I was effectively filtering out a huge percentage of the boot time out of the profiles !
A flip of a switch and suddenly my profiles were in line with the benchmarks , indicating I had a lot of work to do .
This taught me a key to understanding performance , namely that memory pages used are generally much more important than CPU cycles used .
Intellectually , this makes sense : while CPU performance has been rapidly increasing every year , the amount of time it takes to access memory chips has n’t been keeping up .
And even worse , the amount of time it takes to access the disk lags even further behind .
So if you have really tight boot code that nonetheless causes 1 megabyte of code to be faulted in from the disk , you ’re going to be almost entirely gated by the speed of the disk controller , not the CPU .
And if you end up using so much memory that the operating system is forced to start paging memory out ( and then later forced to start paging it back in ) , you ’re in real trouble .
Rule # 10 : Do n’t do anything unless you absolutely have to
This final rule addresses the most common design error that developers make : doing work that they do n’t absolutely have to .
Often , developers will initialize structures or allocate resources up front because it simplifies the overall design of the code .
And , to a certain degree , this is a good idea if it would be painful to do initialization ( or other work ) further down the line .
But often times this practice leads to doing a huge amount of initialization so that the code is ready to handle all kinds of situations that may or may not occur .
If you ’re not 100 % absolutely sure that a piece of code is going to need to be executed , then do n’t execute it !
Conversely , when delaying initialization code , be aware of where that work is going to be going .
If you move an expensive initialization routine out of one critical feature and into another one , you may not have bought yourself much .
It ’s a bit of shell game , so be aware of what you ’re doing .
Also , keep in mind that memory is as important as code speed , so do n’t accumulate state unless you absolutely have to .
One of the big reasons why memory is such a problem is the mindset of programmers that CPU cycles should be preserved at all costs .
If you calculate a result at one point in your program and you might need it later on elsewhere , programmers automatically stash that result away “ in case I need it later . ”
And in some expensive cases , this is a good idea .
However , often times the result is that ten different developers think , “ All I need is x bytes to store this value .
That ’s much cheaper than the cycles it took me to calculate it . ”
And then soon your application has slowed to a crawl as the memory swaps in and out like crazy .
Now not only are you wasting tons of cycles going out to the disk to fetch a page that now would have been ( now ) much cheaper to calculate , you ’re also spending more of your time managing all the state you ’ve accumulated .
It sounds counterintuitive , but it ’s true : recalculate everything on the fly ; save only the really expensive , important stuff .

No one is more bewildered and , frankly , bummed by all of the attention suddenly being paid to Noam Chomsky than Andrew Bacevich .
" I 've written a few books critical of US foreign policy , too , " said Bacevich , a professor of history and international relations at Boston University .
" Why could n't Hugo Chavez hold up one of my books ? "
Why , indeed .
Thanks to the Venezuelan president 's surprise endorsement of " Hegemony or Survival : America 's Quest for Global Dominance  during a vitriolic address at the United Nations , the paperback edition of Chomsky 's 2003 book has catapulted to No.1 on Amazon.com 's list of best - sellers , ahead of such eternally popular authors as John Grisham and Lemony Snicket .
Suddenly , the left - wing linguist who taught for years at MIT is a celebrity .
" All the media hoopla -- I do n't know what else to call it -- is not entirely pleasant , " said Chomsky 's wife , Carol , who picked up the phone at the couple 's Lexington home after just one ring today .
" Noam is flooded , absolutely flooded . "
The problem , she said , and the likely reason her husband of 56 years would not return our call , is the nature of the questions Chomsky is being asked .
They 're not serious enough , she said .
" Everyone wants to know what his reaction is , " Carol Chomsky said .
" And that 's on the level of gossip and of no consequence at all . "
Speaking to The New York Times yesterday , Noam Chomsky told the paper " I continue to work and write , " correcting Chavez , who mistakenly said while speaking at the UN that Chomsky was dead .
The retired professor also added he was " quite interested " in Hugo Chavez 's policies .
" Personally , I think many of them are quite constructive , " Chomsky said .
" I would be happy to meet with him . "

File this under : ” Strange Lego Creations ” A Lego builder decided to create this fully functional “ semi-automatic pump- action Lego crossbow that took four blocks in the handle and one in the chamber ” — along with 300 hours of work put in .
It ’s capable of firing a standard Lego brick 20 yards .
One potential negative , the crossbow is n’t very accurate .
Lots more pics after the jump .
One day I was making a simple little elastic gun to shoot Lego blocks and I thought to myself , ‘ it would be cooler if it had some kind of trigger . ’
The next thing I knew , I was involved in a competition with my own self
The Briton , who has not been named , was working for a foreign company building a road from the southern city of Kandahar to the western city of Herat .
At least three policemen were killed when the convoy the two were travelling in was attacked yesterday in western Afghanistan .
Major Andrew Elmes , a spokesman for a Nato - led peacekeeping force in the region , confirmed that a Briton had been abducted and said : " We are now standing by ready to give any assistance . "
He said Nato troops had set up checkpoints in the area and were searching for signs of the abducted pair .
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said : " We are aware an incident has taken place in Afghanistan as a result of which a UK national is missing and we are urgently seeking further details from the Afghan authorities . "
The local police chief , Allah Uddin Noorzi , said a Filipino employee of the same company who escaped the attack had been found hiding under a bridge .
The police chief blamed the Taliban for the man 's disappearance but an interior ministry spokesman , Latfullah Mashal , said it was the work of a criminal gang .
He said no contact had been made with the kidnappers and that a delegation from Kabul was hurrying to the area .
The kidnappings come just weeks after a Lebanese engineer building another road in southern Afghanistan was abducted .
He was released unhurt days later .
Militants have stepped up attacks ahead of elections on September 18 and more than 1,100 people have been killed in the past six months .
Receipt Check
I 'm generally adverse to the whole shopping experience and tend to operate in the power shopping , " hit and run " mode .
So four shopping days before Christmas 1999 I decide that my remaining gifts will be digital satellite systems , and I proceed to the back of the Lakewood , California Best Buy and end up at the mixed personal communications and odd - things - to - attach - to - your - TV counter .
Surveying my options , I feel vaguely less manly as I eschew the top - of - the - line , surround - sound - laden , multiple - receiver - ready models in favor of a pair of beginners packs inclusive of the dish , appropriate electronics , and every possible wire , nut or bolt their future owners would need to get each going .
Having made my decision , I 'm now ready to be done .
I begin to understand that this would not be my fate today , though , as the " helpful " salesperson politely ignores my query for more stock than the one box I find and proceeds to tell me about the great features of the higher end systems , including the dishes that allow the use of two receivers simultaneously so I wo n't need to buy more than one complete system .
After being convinced that I 'm not going to budge from my decision and trekking off to what must 've been the end of the earth to retrieve my box , I 'm told that these items must be checked out at the counter I 'm standing in front of .
Before he will even take my credit card , though , I have to fill out my name , address , etc on three different forms which then get laboriously typed into the register .
By the time we 're through the repeated sales pitch on the extended warranty and the inspection of the contents of my purchases , I 'm in what might be considered a hurry to leave .
So when I 'm faced with the prospect of standing in a long line at the exit to have yet another person rifle through my property , I dodge the line and head for an unused automatic door , countering an insistent " Sir , can I see your receipt ? " with a polite " No , thank you . "
I 've gotten so used to this trick at Fry 's Electronics that I do n't really think twice about it .
You see , Fry 's does n't trust their underpaid staff manning the cash registers to actually do their jobs right , so they post a door guard to ask people walking away from the registers carrying plastic bags to let them verify that all of the items in the bag were rung up on the receipt .
But this verification step is purely voluntary .
Merchants basically have two rights covering people entering and exiting their stores .
They can refuse to let you enter the premises and / or to sell you anything , and they can place you under citizens arrest for attempting to leave the premises with any property that you have n't paid for .
But the second you hand over the appropriate amount of cash , they lose all rights to the items .
They can't legally impair you from leaving the store with your property .
Apparently the employees of my local Best Buy are n't very familiar with annoying pedantic individuals who will choose principals over convenience when walking out with a shopping cart full of expensive home entertainment gear .
I manage to get about 5 steps out the door before the door guard catches up to me and grabs my cart , with the " sir " in his " I need to see your receipt , sir " somehow not very complimentary .
This is apparently a stalling tactic , as shortly a few more blue - shirted employees make a move to block me from making any more progress toward my car .
I ask , still calm , if I am being detained for shoplifting .
This suggestion apparently shocks my captor into regaining some of his senses , and he lets go of my cart .
I explain that unless he wishes to do so , he has no right to stop me .
This is clearly baffling to the poor fellow .
He suggests again that my receipt simply needs to be checked , struggling to grasp why it is that I wo n't just be a nice little customer and submit to the store policy .
I spend a few moments trying to explain myself , but clearly have too much adrenaline flowing at this point to be particularly erudite .
I give up and proceed in the direction of my car .
Shortly a yellow - shirted fellow , who I take to be a managerial - type , again tries to plead a case for the receipt - checking .
I ask again if I 'm being detained for shoplifting .
He says no , but shortly thereafter mentions that he 'll need to call the police shortly if I do n't offer a receipt .
I tell him to please do so , while loading my packages into the car .
I suggest that before doing so he take a moment to talk to either the helpful salesperson who rung me up or to compare their inventory against sales receipts , as to avoid looking like an ass to the cops .
As I get in my car to leave , two Best Buy lackeys in a pickup truck decide its a good time to park behind me , blocking my path again .
By this time , I 've had just enough of this crap and not very politely or discreetly ask them to get out of the way .
With only a little hesitation , the yellow - shirt nods in their direction and I 'm soon free to leave .
Its been a few hours , but I 'm still half expecting a man with a badge and a gun to show up at my door to check my receipt .
-- Aaron Hopkins
Epilogue : Read Best Buy 's response to my story
When dot com v1.0 when pop , remember how all those consumer plays that were floating on bloated bubble economics all suddenly re-invented and re-packaged themselves for the business market .
Visto was a personal favourite of mine .
Here ’s the Visto product information , courtesy of the Way Back Machine , circa Jan 25 , 1999 .
What ’s Visto Briefcase™ ?
It ’s your private , secure space on the Web .
Your most important information anywhere , on any browser — and it ’s free !
Free email , right ?
This is just fancy email is n’t it ?
Hold on there !
Free email is only a small part of what you get .
What would you call an online package with : high - powered email
full - featured address book
daily , weekly , monthly personal calendar
portable browser bookmarks
storage space for your files
new sharing feature to easily share your files and calendar We call it your Visto Briefcase — and it ’s free .
And then you have Visto today ..

Visto ’s solutions are widely available on a global basis through industry leading mobile operators .
Visto ’s solutions give control , flexibility , and choice back to wireless operators and mobile professionals .
I love how Visto 1999 mentions the word free , four times in its product description , yet I ca n’t seem to find the same word anywhere in its latest marketing gumpf .
Funny how , when the bubble pops companies suddenly need to develop a revenue model , which for Visto was primarily selling through wireless carriers .
Oh , and of course , of late , it ’s worked out an even better revenue model – suing companies like Microsoft and RIM .
So with this in mind , I started to get nostalgia flashbacks when I found out that one of my favourite , but most frustrating Web 2.0 companies , Trumba , announced that it has decided to re-model itself around selling to businesses ; ie people that are actually likely to pay .
You might remember I was non -too kind to the Trumba folk in my post When Good Ideas Go Bad .
I suggested that rather than going after the ordinary consumer they would have been much better off trying to provide the calendar engine to developers , publishers , app builders , etc .
Just about every portal , just about every intranet , every piece of CRM software has calendar functionality that they ’ve had to pay their developers or external developers to build .
Trumba should have set itself with being the calendar inside every online application in the planet .
It should have been built from the ground up as a white label application , easily deployed and integrated into whatever you were building .
Trumba ’s Ted Johnson left a comment on Squash last week saying :
We agree .
Chasing the consumer with a pay - for service was n’t a winning strategy .
Yesterday we announced a refocus on businesses and organizations that need to communicate event information .
See the press release or the updated web site .
Among the messages on the new Trumba website are : “ We focus on calendar communications so you do n’t have to ” .
And it lists its technical benefits as :
Trumba calendar tools allow you to upgrade your website calendar almost instantly .
Reduce development time
Enable direct content updates by the content owners
Increase calendar reliability , security , and performance
Get updates and feature upgrades automatically
I wonder how much of their $ 8 million in VC funding Trumba burnt chasing the consumer holy grail ?
And Trumba actually did start down that path with a business model ( admittedly not a very good one ) .
A lot of these Web 2.0 start - ups will have been going for about a year now .
A lot will be feeling the pinch .
Most people can bootstrap a start - up for 12 months but it starts to get really tough , if you want to do it for any longer than that .
I very much expect to see a rash of Writely - style acquisitions over the next 12 months .
Start - ups facing up to the reality that they ’re not making any money and therefore finally coming to the realisation that they ’re never going to crack the mega pay - day .
So they ’ll sell to one of the big boys for a handy exit sum and a good job in the process .
Sure beats bootstrapping , hey ?
But it ’s a far cry from the Web 2.0 hype that has built up this expectation of dot com daze revisted …
The good news is that companies like Trumba are already taking corrective action before they ’ve got one foot in the grave .
Companies like Writely are taking reasonable exits rather than holding out for the motza .
So these is a semblance of sense starting to infiltrate the Web 2.0 economy .
For those reasons , I do n’t think we ’re in a bubble .
As a company like News comes into play talking up big acquisitions and inflating the environment , simultaneously there seems to be a slow - release valve leaking the pressure out of it because enough of us learnt enough lessons from the first time around .
Web 2.0 is already fizzing .
But it ’s a good thing .
Methane bubbles can be trapped in ice during the autumn freeze
Scientists from Russia and the US measured methane bubbling from a number of thawing lakes .
Writing in the journal Nature , they suggest the methane release is hastened by warmer temperatures , positively feeding back into global warming .
Methane 's contribution to present - day global warming is second only to CO2 .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) estimates that atmospheric concentrations are about two and a half times those seen in pre-industrial times .
Methane flux from thaw lakes in our study region may be five times greater than previously estimated
Katey Walker and colleagues
" We show that methane flux from thaw lakes in our study region may be five times greater than previously estimated . "
The lakes are produced in summers when land which is usually permanently frozen - permafrost - melts .
Bubble traps
The study depended on the systematic deployment of bubble traps on two lakes in the Cherskii region of Siberia , supplemented by ground - based and aerial observations of a further 95 lakes .
Katey Walker from the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and her colleagues calculate that across the region , thaw lakes lakes emit 3.8 teragrams ( Tg , million million grams ) per year .
Click here to see how much Arctic permafrost is projected to disappear in the coming decades
More details
More than half of this total comes from human activities , notably farming .
The importance of the Siberian release may lie in the relationship between warming and methane production .
If a high release rate of a greenhouse gas is being triggered by rising temperatures , that will in turn stimulate still higher temperatures - a positive feedback mechanism .
Extra context comes from the age of the emerging gas .
Using radiocarbon techniques , the researchers showed that some of the escaping methane molecules had been formed more than 40,000 years ago .
The area of the planet covered by permafrost is projected to shrink as the surface warms .
Boreholes in permafrost in Svalbard , Norway , indicate that ground temperatures rose 0.4C over the past decade , four times faster than they did in the previous century .
Of all the myths that have grown up around open source software , perhaps the most pervasive is Eric Raymond 's aphorism that " Many eyes make bugs shallow " , suggesting that if lots of people can view a program 's source code , they will find and fix its errors more quickly than commercial products whose code is jealously guarded .
The only problem with this is that it 's not true - certainly not in one of the flagship projects of open source , OpenOffice .
This project is most often quoted as the threat to Microsoft 's cash - generating Office suite .
The free suite comprises a word processor , spreadsheet and presentation program ; and graphics , equation editor and database programs if you want .
OpenOffice is the only free and open source product competitive with Office , able to read and write Microsoft format documents almost flawlessly .
For GNU / Linux desktop users , it is the only way to communicate in the universe of business .
But it also vividly demonstrates the limitations of open source as a way of producing software , and its futility as an ideology .
I like OpenOffice .
I used it long before it was usable , out of a mixture of perversity , stinginess , and vague anti-Microsoft sentiment .
When I started writing books , I had Microsoft Word 97 , which could not print a 60,000 - word manuscript without crashing .
I have written numerous macros ( which automate less obvious , or screamingly obvious , tasks ) , including the word count for version 1 .
I have done quality assurance work , submitting reports on bugs and testing those reported by others .
So I know something about the open source " community " and the enormous gap between myth and reality .
Improbable assumptions
The reality is that any computer user probably depends on open source programs every time they look up anything on the net .
But they do n't know that , and they do n't have to .
The myth of open source rests on two improbable assumptions .
The first is that a significant proportion of users can fix bugs .
That is true at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where the concept of free software was first formalised in the 1980s by Richard Stallman and others , and it is true in some of the geekier corners of the internet .
But on programs intended for use by the non-programming public , it 's a very different story .
This is important because of the second crucial false assumption : that even if not all users can fix a bug , they can help find them .
They can't .
Most users just think : " The computer is n't doing what I want . "
Big commercial software companies know this well .
When developing products for the public , they spend a lot of money on usability testing to find out what users expect from software , and how to meet those expectations .
Companies lose from user dissatisfaction in a way open source software does n't , and so have an incentive to avoid errors in the first place : the number of calls to a support desk grows exponentially with the number of bugs and users .
Where 's the support desk for OpenOffice ?
Despite the open source rhetoric , OpenOffice actually started as a commercial product - StarOffice , from Germany 's StarDivision - before being bought in October 1999 by Sun Microsystems .
Almost all the work on it is now done by about 100 full - time Sun programmers .
That is a tiny fraction of the armies Microsoft or Google can deploy to solve a problem .
But what about the innumerable volunteers who can download the code and fix what they like ?
They take one look at the effort involved and run .
OpenOffice is an extremely complex mountain of source code .
As far as I know , in the five years it has been available as open source , not one contribution to the program has come from amateurs .
The outsiders who have provided input have been full - time professionals employed by Linux companies to help make the software credible .
There has been a lot of volunteer effort , but it has gone into support .
Without the efforts of French and Italian volunteers , it would be more or less impossible for anyone to write macros .
Some volunteer energy goes into localisation efforts : the suite is available in practically every language , and four or five people put in a real effort to help puzzled users on the internet , but the overwhelming energy seems to go into filling the blogosphere with remarks about the merits of open source software and getting outraged about inconvenient facts .
Kindergarten noise
For example , just before version 2 was released , a Ziff - Davis blog ( blogs.zdnet.com /Ou/?p=120 ) pointed out that OpenOffice is bigger , less efficient , and much slower than MS Office ( tinyurl.com / 4evmt ) .
Large spreadsheets take more than 100 times as long to load .
Some of this is a result of inefficient code , and some the result of an inefficient storage system ; the figures are undeniable and not disputed by Sun developers , but the shrieks of outrage in the comments would be alarming even in a kindergarten .
So why is OpenOffice so dire ?
The project claims more than 50 m downloads of the software , so let 's assume that 50 m people have tried it at least once .
More than 50,000 bugs have been reported .
And how many have been fixed by open source 's uniquely efficient processes ?
According to the ( public ) bugs database , at last count , there were more than 6,000 unfixed bugs , and more than 5,000 feature requests .
While the number of bugs discovered seems to rise with the number of users , the number of fixes does n't , and the number of fixers certainly does n't .
Only about 500 people have signed the legalese that would enable them to submit code to the project ; since you need to do this even to make changes to the website , that will translate to far fewer than 500 volunteers submitting real code .
A reasonable guess would be 50 , or even five .
Meanwhile , there are some simple , hugely irritating bugs that are four years old .
Two obvious ones : notes ( or comments , as Word users call them ) do n't have word wrap ; and spaces typed at the end of a line wo n't show .
It 's not many eyes making bugs shallow ; more like many eyes making bugs invisible .
Most software has similar irritations .
But complex open source projects seem uniquely badly placed to fix them .
They rely on a very small group of programmers relative to the user base , and who have no direct incentive to work on the bugs that are important to users .
Perhaps like Microsoft Windows , which took many goes to hit its stride , OpenOffice 3.1 will be a world beater .
But if it is , it will have nothing to do with the fact that any user can , in theory , fix things they do n't like .
It will be because large companies such as Sun , Google , and IBM have decided that open source is the cheapest way to gang up on Microsoft , because it means they need spend nothing on support .
But , for what it 's worth , I still think OpenOffice may be better for books than Microsoft Word .

Reuters reports that KinderStart has sued Google for their drop in search engine relevancy in the Google index :
KinderStart charges that Google without warning in March 2005 penalized the site in its search rankings , sparking a “ cataclysmic ” 70 percent fall in its audience — and a resulting 80 percent decline in revenue .
At its height , KinderStart counted 10 million page views per month , the lawsuit said .
Web site page views are a basic way of measuring audience and are used to set advertising rates .
“ Google does not generally inform Web sites that they have been penalized nor does it explain in detail why the Web site was penalized , ” the lawsuit said .
The lawsuit goes on to claim that KinderStart ’s constitutional right to free speech has been violated because they ’ve lost relevancy and / or were removed from Google ’s search index .
I may be taking an overly simple look at this lawsuit , but in my mind , it ’s Google ’s index and they can do with it what they want – including dropping you completely if they choose to do so .
I look at our own Blog Network List the same way – today we generally cover all sorts of blog networks , but in the future we may categorize those networks or drop some types all together .
Are we to be held up in court from running our business as we see fit ?

This article mentions the Wikimedia Foundation , one of its projects , or people related to it .
Wikinews is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation .
Edits by Massachusetts congressman Marty Meehan 's staff on his Wikipedia article spurred a Lowell Sun story and a subsequent Wikipedia investigation of all Internet addresses assigned to the Congress of the United States .
This audio file was created from the text revision dated 2006 - 01 - 29 and may not reflect subsequent text edits to this report .
( audio help Audio Wikinews
While edits from the Capitol are not generally news , the biographical article for Mr. Meehan was carefully edited , removing negative comments while expanding with content from the congressman 's political flyer .
The IP address which made these edits has an extensive editing history on Wikipedia , and has been repeatedly blocked in past months for article vandalism and violation of Wikipedia policies ( Wikipedia 's log of 143.231.249.141 being blocked from editing ) .
Wikipedia administrators , alerted to the Marty Meehan article edits , realized that many edits to politically - sensitive articles had been made from IP addresses assigned to the US Capitol building , and have begun an investigation into all edits from such addresses .
Editing history
Editing from U.S. House computers
At the center of the investigation are edits by the IP address 143.231.249.141 , which is the proxy through which most of the U.S. House Internet traffic passes .
Jon Brandt , spokesman for the Committee on House Administration confirmed House ownership of the IP [ 1 ] .
An aide for Rep. Meehan made two edits to the article on Meehan 's biography .
The first was on July 18 , 2005 and replaced the article with his official biography , which was biased towards Meehan .
A later edit on December 27 , 2005 removed text referring to Mr. Meehan 's pledge to only run four terms , or 8 years .
Marty Meehan
The text that was removed said " He also ran on a platform of term limits .
However , after serving four terms as US Congressman , the number of terms he pledged that he and no other congressman should serve out , he has since gone back on his word and now is adamently [ sic ] against the idea of term limits for Congressmen . "
The text was replaced with : " His fiscally responsible voting record since then has earned him praise from citizen watchdog groups . "
Congressman Meehan has served seven terms as Representative of his home state of Massachusetts .
Most of the edits from Capitol Hill IPs have not been harmful edits .
Many edits have been made which were neutral , correcting factual , spelling , grammar , and punctuation errors .
A sampling of both positive and harmful edits to politically - related articles are included here .
The communications director for Rep. Joe Wilson took a different approach to editing Rep. Wilson 's article .
She contacted Wikipedia founder Jimbo Wales , who advised that she supply a biography on the Wikipedia article 's discussion page , rather than edit the article directly , for other Wikipedia editors to check and to incorporate into the article itself .
After she added the official bio to Wilson 's discussion page , Wikipedia editors used it and several other sources to expand the article substantially .
Further investigation
Following the reports of the edits from the House IP address , a so - called checkuser ( a check of confidential information to determine the accounts used by staffers coming from that IP ) was performed to determine what users logged - in with an account edited from the House IP address , and the edits made by all of those users were checked as well .
They all showed little bias and no vandalism . [ 2 ]
Editing from Senate computers
Unlike the U.S. House , computers from the U.S. Senate are assigned individual IP addresses .
To identify possible vandals , the edit history for all senators was checked , and a list of 25 addresses was extracted .
While some had good faith edits , others showed unacceptable behaviour .
The entire 156.33.x.x netblock is for Senate use only [ 3 ]
Senator pages edited
The following is a partial list of U.S. Senator biographies on the English - language Wikipedia edited by Senate employees .
Edits categorized by IP
While the identity of these IPs are not known , a small sample of edits from Capitol IPs shows both helpful and harmful edits .
A complete list of all the Senatorial IPs that contributed to political articles can be found here .
Wikimedia Foundation and Wikipedia response
The attention of Wikipedia administrators was drawn to the pattern of edits to Wikipedia articles by Congressional staffers at 18:47 on January 29 .
In response , Wikipedia administrators began a systematic examination of all edits to articles made from IP addresses that have been assigned for use by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives .
Administrators found several places where edits from U.S. Senate IP addresses had been to articles on Senators .
Following online discussions using IRC , Wikipedia administrator FireFox blocked the U.S. House of Representatives ' Wikipedia editing privileges for one week while the issue is discussed .
The block was lifted shortly thereafter by a dissenting admin . [ 19 ]
While the Wikimedia Foundation has not yet issued a statement regarding this , Jimmy Wales was quoted by the AP discouraging the removal of facts .
" You do n't delete it , " Wales said .
" If they wanted to put in their side of things , that would seem ethically relevant , rather than just omitting it . "

The anti-gun campaign lost supporters in the last few weeks
Sixty - four percent of those who voted rejected the proposed ban , which was backed by the government , the Catholic Church and the United Nations .
The gun ownership lobby successfully argued that guns were needed for personal security .
Guns kill one person in Brazil every 15 minutes , giving it the world 's highest death toll from firearms .
Last year , there were 36,000 shooting deaths .
The UN says guns are the biggest cause of death among young people in Brazil .
The immediate consequence of the referendum is that gun shops will remain open .
Individual rights
The BBC's Steve Kingstone in Sao Paulo says that the result may surprise outsiders , given the horrific scale of gun violence in Brazil .
The defeated " Yes " campaign had enjoyed an early lead in the opinion polls , but it was quickly outmanoeuvred .
The " No " campaign convinced voters that the proposed ban would have no effect on criminals , on the grounds that criminals do not buy guns legally in shops .
AGAINST THE BAN
If I had the money , I would have a weapon to try to protect myself and my family ...
The police are never going to arrive in time

Shantytown resident
Gun crime blights Rio slums
Beni Barbosa , the " No " campaign spokesman , said : " We managed to get our message across that Brazilians have individual rights which the state cannot take away . "
" Here , people were not choosing whether to have a gun or not .
They were voting for their rights to choose . "
Anti-gun campaigners said the swing away from a " Yes " vote was the result of people 's desire to protest against the government 's security policy .
" We did n't lose because Brazilians like guns .
We lost because people do n't have confidence in the government or the police , " said Denis Mizne , of anti-violence group Sou da Paz .
" The ' No ' campaign was much more effective .
They are talking about a right to have a gun - it is a totally American debate . "
Anti-gun campaigners also accused gun makers and lobby groups such as the US National Rifle Association ( NRA ) of manipulating people 's fears .
Millions of guns
The referendum has been watched closely by other countries where gun-ownership is under debate .
In Washington , an NRA spokesman called the result " a victory for freedom " .
Some opposition came from favelas , often the scene of turf wars
The referendum rounded off a series of campaigns run by the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to cut down on gun crime .
Penalties for unlawfully carrying a gun have been increased , and money has been offered to people who surrender their weapons in amnesties .
The proposal to ban firearms initially had strong public support .
But opinion polls in recent days showed this backing had weakened dramatically as campaigns against the ban got off the ground .
Some opposition to the ban also came from shanty towns , or favelas , the scene of vicious turf wars between drug gangs .
Maria , a shantytown resident whose sister was gunned down by an ex-boyfriend , said disarmament would make little difference .
" If I had the money , I would have a weapon to try to protect myself and my family , " she told the BBC .
" The police are never going to arrive in time and if they do , they may kill you . "
There are estimated to be more than 17 million guns in Brazil , nine million of which are not registered , according to a survey by non-governmental groups .

LOS ANGELES ( AP ) --
The astronomers who claim to have discovered the 10th planet in the solar system have another intriguing announcement :
It has a moon .
While observing the new , so - called planet from Hawaii last month , a team of astronomers led by Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology spotted a faint object trailing next to it .
Because it was moving , astronomers ruled it was a moon and not a background star , which is stationary .
The moon discovery is important because it can help scientists determine the new planet 's mass .
In July , Brown announced the discovery of an icy , rocky object larger than Pluto in the Kuiper Belt , a disc of icy bodies beyond Neptune .
Brown labeled the object a planet and nicknamed it Xena after the lead character in the former TV series '' Xena : Warrior Princess . ''
The moon was nicknamed Gabrielle , after Xena 's faithful traveling sidekick .
By determining the moon 's distance and orbit around Xena , scientists can calculate how heavy Xena is .
For example , the faster a moon goes around a planet , the more massive a planet is .
But the discovery of the moon is not likely to quell debate about what exactly makes a planet .
The problem is there is no official definition for a planet and setting standards like size limits potentially invites other objects to take the ' ' planet ' ' label .
Possessing a moon is not a criteria of planethood since Mercury and Venus are moonless planets .
Brown said he expected to find a moon orbiting Xena because many Kuiper Belt objects are paired with moons .
The newly discovered moon is about 155 miles wide and 60 times fainter than Xena , the farthest - known object in the solar system .
It is currently 9 billion miles away from the sun , or about three times Pluto 's current distance from the sun .
Scientists believe Xena 's moon was formed when Kuiper Belt objects collided with one another .
The Earth 's moon formed in a similar way when Earth crashed into an object the size of Mars .
The moon was first spotted by a 10 - meter telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii on Sept. 10 .
Scientists expect to learn more about the moon 's composition during further observations with the Hubble Space Telescope in November .
Brown planned to submit a paper describing the moon discovery to the Astrophysical Journal next week .
The International Astronomical Union , a group of scientists responsible for naming planets , is deciding on formal names for Xena and Gabrielle .

Great Programmers
I 've seen a lot of discussion of great programmers , usually centering on how to find them , but usually what people really want to know is how to become one .
Since I 'm widely considered to be a great programmer , I 'll give some advice .
First of all there 's raw coding ability .
For this , practice makes perfect .
Implementing lots of algorithms from , say
There are only two coding skills which mostly people who are completely self - taught as a programmer miss out on : proper encapsulation , and unit tests .
For proper encapsulation , you should organize your code so that changes which require modifying code in more than one module are as rare as possible , and for unit tests you should write them to be pass / fail so that all unit tests can be run as a comprehensive suite .
And now you know everything you need to about those two things .
Anyone who is taught the above guidelines , and decides they really want to learn those skills , will with sufficient practice become good at them .
Coding skill is all well and good , and you can't become a great programmer without it , but it 's far from everything .
I 'm decent at raw coding , but I know many people who are better , and some of them are abysmal programmers .
I in particular can't deal with being tasked with fixing up spaghetti code .
My brain simply locks down and refuses to make any modifications which it is n't convinced will work , which is of course impossible when the source material is an incurably bug - ridden mess .
What truly separates the great programmers from the journeyman programmers is architecture .
What 's puzzling is that architecture appears to be one of the simplest parts of the whole process , requiring in most cases little more than some pencil and paper calculations and a willingness to change .
The simplest architectural problems to solve are the ones which for lack of a better theory most people ascribe to emotional or psychological problems .
These are decisions for which there 's no rational justification whatsoever .
For example , writing a non-speed - critical program ( which is most of them ) in C or C ++.
A few years ago you could justify that because the other languages did n't have such extensive libraries , but today it 's ludicrous .
Another one is building one 's protocol as a layer on top of webdav .
And another one is building a transactional system for retrieving any subsection of any point in the history of an arbitrarily large file in constant time when that is n't part of project requirements .
Yes , I 'm making fun of subversion here .
It 's a great example of a project permanently crippled by dumb architectural decisions .
Half of these ' emotional ' architectural decisions are dogmatically using a past practice in situations where it 's inapplicable .
The other half are working on interesting problems which have little or no utility in the finished product .
Once decisions like these have been made , questioning them can become a political impossibility .
If someone new comes in to a project with many man-years on it , and in their first week learns that there 's a networking call which includes a parameter as to whether it should be blocking or non-blocking , and immediately declares that the entire codebase is a mess and difficult if not impossible to maintain , they 'll almost certainly be correct and justified , but their opinion will likely be disregarded as as brash and ill - informed .
After all , they have n't spent the kind of time on the codebase than everybody else .
I 've actually had this happen to me , and while others have claimed that there are more political ways of approaching such problems , my experience has been that once the truth becomes unthinkable a couple people need to get fired before any improvement can be made .
My advice about technically unjustifiable architectural decisions is to not do them .
If you find yourself doing them , you probably need to get laid or see a shrink or have a beer .
But what if you 're emotionally well - adjusted , and want to get better at software architecture ?
Logging more hours at work will get you nowhere .
When I wrote BitTorrent multiple other people were working on the exact same problem , most of them with a big head start and a lot more resources , and yet I still won easily .
The problem was that most of them simply could not have come up with BitTorrent 's architecture .
Not with 20 code monkeys working under them .
Not with a decade to work on it .
Not after reading every available book on networking protocols .
Not ever .
Clearly this is n't because BitTorrent 's architecture is terribly difficult to understand .
The entire approach can be understood without any really hard thinking in about an hour , with the possible exception of the state machine for the wire protocol , and even that is extremely simple as state machines go .
The realy difficulty in coming up with something like BitTorrent is that it involves fundamentally rethinking all of your basic approaches .
This is very difficult for humans to do .
We attack any new problem we encounter with techniques we already know , and try small modifications if difficulties turn up .
My suggestion for learning software architecture is to practice .
Obviously you can't practice it by doing hundreds of projects , because each one of them takes too long , but you can easily design a hundred architectures for problems which only exist on paper , and where you strive to just get the solution to work on paper .
Start by modifying the requirements of a problem you 're working on .
What if the amount of bandwidth or CPU was a hundredth what it currently is ?
What if it were a thousand times ?
A million ?
What if you had a thousand times as much data ?
A million ?
A billion ?
What if the users were untrusted and you had to either prevent them from damaging the system or have a means of fixing things when they did ?
It does n't matter if these scenarios are totally unrealistic , what matters is that they 're different and that when you try to find architectures for handling them you take the inputs just as seriously as if you were about to start writing a system with those requirements for work .
Try to find as many different approaches as you can , and come up with scenarios in which the stranger ones would be better .
Learning these skills takes time , but is definitely worth it .
I could n't have come up with Codeville 's architecture without first having spent a lot of time working on voting algorithms .
Not that voting algorithms have anything to do with version control , but the process of coming up with example scenarios and defining the behavior which should happen in each of them carries over very well .

That depends what sort of programmer you wish to become .
If you want to dabble in computers because computers seem important to you , I suggest learning Python .
If you want to learn computers because you 're fascinated by their inner workings , I suggest learning C ( not C++ , that has a lot of extraneous cruft ) .
Most people fall into the first category .
BitTorrent took two years of full time work to get to the not sucking stage , and another year to become reasonably mature .

( Anonymous ) : Codeville architecture
So how about a post about Codeville architecture , then , eh ? ;-)
Your competito ^Wcolleagues are curious !
( I guess the answer might be " then go to CodeCon " , but while Graydon and I talked about it some , he 's busy then and I was busy now ( and do n't really have $ 80 to throw at it anyway ) , so no Monotone submission .
Maybe some other time . )

bramcohen Codeville 's documentation , especially its architectural documentation , has lagged far behind its implementation , mostly because implementation is a higher priority that documentation , especially when we have n't even hit 1.0 yet , and there 's still the occasional significant change .
What I 'd really like to see is a paper comparing the architectures of Darcs , Monotone , and Codeville , although I 'm not sure that there 's a single person who 's grokked two out of those three systems .
Are you local to the San Francisco area ?

darkcode I can't help wondering - I 'm 16 , and in high school in San Diego , CA .
I 've been programming for perhaps 2 years , and have gotten fairly good at it for a kid , but nothing compared to most of the programmers I meet and talk to .
After studying code in college , for example , does writing applications ( especially with GUIs ) get easier ?
Or should I give up for " not having the gift " ?
I know you 're not a counselor , but answering this question would mean quite a lot to me .

( Anonymous ) : Re : Age and development I learned how to program GUIs while I was still in high school .
In fact , I had only known C++ for 5 months at the time .
I think the key is the API you choose .
I learned the BeOS API which was ( is ? ) quite easy to wrap one 's head around .
I would recommend Qt nowadays .
As for the college question , nothing I learned in college really applies to GUI programming .
College exposed me to many other languages and programming paradigms .
While those are good experience , they are n't quite the same as learning an API .
So really , what I 'm trying to say is that you are as ready to learn GUI programming now as you ever will be .
Studying programming in in college is just 4 years of practice with fundamental theory thrown in for good measure .

Subversion also has a non-webdav server " svnserve " which uses the TCP based svnserve protocol .
It 's much faster .
Many open source project repositories use plain svnserve .
Not sure what you meant with your comments on transactions .

Well , they 've now gone halfway to admitting that using webdav has been a failure .
The other half would be to stop supporting the webdav version .
Unfortunately for them , the webdav view of the world was the basis for how files are handled , as a result of which subversion does n't support file renames , and never will .
Do n't believe the feature list .
Subversion does ' renames ' as a copy and a delete of the old version , as a result of which if one person moves a file and another one modifies it the change will be dropped , which is even worse behavior than cvs has .
The whole transactional file store thing is covered in Tom Lord 's post Well , they 've now gone halfway to admitting that using webdav has been a failure .

One thing not covered in that post is that the way that data structure is built on top of berkeleydb is also comically stupid , even if you assume that it's a worthwile thing to build , which it is n't .

People regularly ask for the ability to run a repository on a remote - mounted filesystem ( or worse , they try , using BDB , and get bizarre failures ) .
Baldly asserting that it 's not an important feature does n't make it so .
Anyway , go ahead and finish writing Codeville .
I think you 'll find that a version control system that scales beyond basement projects is a lot tougher than you think , and that the vast majority of the user base does n't have the same priorities as you do .
If you 're right and I 'm wrong , I 'm sure you 'll be able to revisit this thread in a few years and be proud .

da_x Finally
I 'm glad to see that someone of your caliber is sharing my opinions about software development .
It 's basically comes down to choosing the right approach ( from practice and experience ) and the suitable environment ( e.g. the proper programming language for the job ) .
I also think that ' evolutionary ' development with rapid prototyping is sometimes most likely to brings you closer to the solution instead of a full - fledged top - bottom design .

Hello there ,
I try to grasp the meaning of your statement about " emotional or psychological problems " and being " emotionally well - adjusted " when doing architectural decisions .
Could you please elaborate on what you mean with that .
How do emotions lead to technically unjustifiable architectural decisions ?

There are only two coding skills which mostly people who are completely self - taught as a programmer miss out on : proper encapsulation , and unit tests .
While this is true , I believe that the top two skill that self - taught programmers are missing are documentation and naming , and decomposition .
Good naming and good documentation can only be learned from working with others .
Just yesterday I was reviewing someone 's class for our new team ( call it team Foo ) .
He called it FooEngine .
I pointed out that we 're already in a " Foo " directory -- and this is general code not specific to our team -- so he changed it to Engine .
If you were a stranger and you saw a class called Engine , would you have the faintest idea what it was doing ?
It actually exports individual lines of a CSV file , with retries ... if we were n't going to break it up into three classes ( see below ) then I 'd call it ExportCsvLinesWithRetry .
Decomposition is another thing you rarely learn on your own .
If only one person is working on the code at a time , you have to pay a moderate cost for decomposing your design into disconnected parts , and you do n't see the benefit .
But a key to cooperation with others and to maintainable software in general is to decompose the design into the smallest reasonable pieces .
In the case above , when you split up the Engine into three parts , it turned out that there were good solutions to each of the three parts already in the codebase .
So in fact nothing might need to be written , but more likely , we 'll add some useful new functionality into a couple of places where other people can use it .

The Army ’s top officer withheld a required 2008 budget plan from Pentagon leaders last month after protesting to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld that the service could not maintain its current level of activity in Iraq plus its other global commitments without billions in additional funding .
The decision by Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker , the Army ’s chief of staff , is believed to be unprecedented and signals a widespread belief within the Army that in the absence of significant troop withdrawals from Iraq , funding assumptions must be completely reworked , say current and former Pentagon officials .
“ This is unusual , but hell , we ’re in unusual times , ” said a senior Pentagon official involved in the budget discussions .
Schoomaker failed to submit the budget plan by an Aug. 15 deadline .
The protest followed a series of cuts in the service ’s funding requests by both the White House and Congress over the last four months .

According to a senior Army official involved in budget talks , Schoomaker is now seeking $ 138.8 billion in 2008 , nearly $ 25 billion above budget limits originally set by Rumsfeld .
The Army ’s budget this year is $ 98.2 billion , making Schoomaker ’s request a 41 % increase over current levels .
“ It ’s incredibly huge , ” said the Army official , who , like others , spoke on condition of anonymity when commenting on internal deliberations .
“ These are just incredible numbers . ”
Most funding for the fighting in Iraq has come from annual emergency spending bills , with the regular defense budget going to normal personnel , procurement and operational expenses , such as salaries and new weapons systems .
About $ 400 billion has been appropriated for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars through emergency funding measures since Sept. 11 , 2001 , with the money divided among military branches and government agencies .

But in recent budget negotiations , Army officials argued that the service ’s expanding global role in the U.S. - declared war on terrorism -- outlined in strategic plans issued this year -- as well as fast - growing personnel and equipment costs tied to the Iraq war , have put intense pressure on its normal budget .
“ It ’s kind of like the old rancher saying : ‘ I ’m going to size the herd to the amount of hay that I have , ’ ” said Lt. Gen. Jerry L. Sinn , the Army ’s top budget official .
" [ Schoomaker ] ca n’t size the herd to the size of the amount of hay that he has because he ’s got to maintain the herd to meet the current operating environment . ”
The Army , with an active - duty force of 504,000 , has been stretched by the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
About 400,000 have done at least one tour of combat duty , and more than a third of those have been deployed twice .
Commanders have increasingly complained of the strain , saying last week that sustaining current levels will require more help from the National Guard and Reserve or an increase in the active - duty force .
Schoomaker first raised alarms with Marine Gen. Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , in June after he received new Army budget outlines from Rumsfeld ’s office .
Those outlines called for an Army budget of about $ 114 billion , a $ 2 - billion cut from previous guidelines .
The cuts would grow to $ 7 billion a year after six years , the senior Army official said .

After Schoomaker confronted Rumsfeld with the Army ’s own estimates for maintaining the current size and commitments -- and the steps that would have to be taken to meet the lower figure , which included cutting four combat brigades and an entire division headquarters unit -- Rumsfeld agreed to set up a task force to investigate Army funding .
Although no formal notification is required , Army Secretary Francis J. Harvey , who has backed Schoomaker in his push for additional funding , wrote to Rumsfeld early last month to inform him that the Army would miss the Aug. 15 deadline for its budget plan .
Harvey said the delay in submitting the plan , formally called a Program Objective Memorandum , was the result of the extended review by the task force .
The study group -- which included three - star officers from the Army and Rumsfeld ’s office -- has since agreed with the Army ’s initial assessment .
Officials say negotiations have moved to higher levels of the Bush administration , involving top aides to Rumsfeld and White House Budget Director Rob Portman .
“ Now the discussion is : Where are we going to go ?
Do we lower our strategy or do we raise our resources ? ” said the senior Pentagon official .
“ That ’s where we ’re at . ”

Pressure on the Army budget has been growing since late May , when the House and Senate appropriations committees proposed defense spending for 2007 of $ 4 billion to $ 9 billion below the White House ’s original request .
Funding was further complicated this summer , when rising sectarian violence in Baghdad forced the Pentagon to shelve plans to gradually reduce troops in Iraq .
Because of those pressures , the Army in July announced it was freezing civilian hiring and new weapons contract awards and was scaling back on personnel travel restrictions , among other cost cuts .
Schoomaker has been vocal in recent months about a need to expand war funding legislation to pay for repair of hundreds of tanks and armored fighting vehicles after heavy use in Iraq .
Advertisement
He has told congressional appropriators that he will need $ 17.1 billion next year for repairs , nearly double this year ’s appropriation -- and more than quadruple the cost two years ago .
According to an Army budget document obtained by The Times , Army officials are planning repair requests of $ 13 billion in 2008 and $ 13.5 billion in 2009 .
In recent weeks , however , Schoomaker has become more publicly emphatic about budget shortfalls , saying funding is not enough to pay for Army commitments to the Iraq war and the global strategy outlined by the Pentagon .
“ There ’s no sense in us submitting a budget that we ca n’t execute , a broken budget , ” Schoomaker said in a recent Washington address .
Military budget expert Steven M. Kosiak of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , an independent Washington think tank , said that despite widespread recognition that the Army should be getting more resources because of war - related costs , its share of the Defense Department budget has been largely unchanged since the 2003 invasion .

However , a good portion of the new money the Army seeks is not directly tied to the war , Kosiak cautioned , but rather to new weapons it wants -- particularly the $ 200 - billion Future Combat System , a family of armored vehicles that is eventually to replace nearly every tank and transporter the Army has .
“ This is n’t a problem one can totally pass off on current military operations , ” Kosiak said .
“ The FCS program is very ambitious -- some would say overly ambitious . ”
Even with Rumsfeld ’s backing , any request for an increase could force a conflict with the White House Office of Management and Budget , which has repeatedly pushed the Pentagon to restrain its annual budget submission .
“ Year after year there were attempts to raise the ceiling , but year after year OMB has refused , ” said a former Pentagon official familiar with the debate .
“ The difference this year is the Army has said that if a raise in the ceiling is n’t going to be considered , they wo n’t even play the game . ”

Added the senior Army official : “ If you ’re Rob Portman advising the president of the United States and duking it out with the [ secretary of Defense ] , it ’s a pretty sporting little event . ”
Army officials said that Schoomaker ’s failure to file his 2008 Program Objective Memorandum was not intended as a rebuke to Rumsfeld , and that the Defense secretary had backed Schoomaker since the chief of staff raised the issue with him directly .
Still , some Army officials said Schoomaker expressed concern about recent White House budget moves , such as the decision in May to use $ 1.9 billion out of the most recent emergency spending bill for border security , including deployment of 6,000 National Guard troops at the Mexican border .
Army officials said $ 1.2 billion of that money came out of funds originally intended for Army war expenses .

“ The president has got to take care of his border mission ; he needs to find a source of funds so he can play a zero - sum game -- he takes it out of defense , ” the senior Army official said .
“ But when he takes it out of defense , the lion ’s share is coming out of the outfit that ’s really in extremis in the current operating environment in the war . ”
Rumsfeld has not set a new deadline for the Army to submit its budget plan .
The Army official said staffers thought they could submit a revised plan by November , in time for President Bush to unveil his 2008 budget early next year .

When I was in high school , I taught myself to use Corel Draw by copying logos such as Crest Toothpaste and Frito Lay Corn Chips .
I printed out phony corporate letterhead , and dreamed up interesting ways to use it .
Fast forward to 2003 .
On a trip to TGI Fridays with Ken and May , I noticed that the TGI Fridays menu pages were paper , protected from spills behind a sheet of plastic .
The menu was already chock full of zany menu descriptions , but I would n't let that get in my way .
I decided to make a new menu page .
Like many project ideas , this one got put onto the Cockerham back burner for several months .
Eventually , my interest was rekindled .
It was the TGI Friday 's new Atkins - friendly low - carb menu that got my attention .
This baby was aching to be ridiculed .
The first thing to do was to recruit some friends for help .
I created a secret project introduction page at www.cockeyed.com/spirit, asking readers of cockeyed .com to help with the plan .
The next task was to create the new menu page .
After obtaining a high - quality scan of the one - page Atkins menu , I began planning changes .
I determined the appropriate font , and began writing new item descriptions .
I wanted to replace one of the meal photos with one of my own creation , the Bacon Churner which is simply two sticks of butter with bacon .
I flexed my food - photography skills and prepared this low - carb masterpiece for the camera .
Raw bacon wrapped the butter really well , but the raw bacon did n't have the color I was looking for .
I decided to use cooked slices .
These looked better , but I could n't wrap them around the sticks of butter very well .
I had to settle for a blanket of bacon with crumbled bits of bacon on top .
I made eight modifications to the menu :
" Atkins " became " Atkinz " .
This made the menu look like an unlicensed knock - off of the Atkins plan .
Buffalo
Wings stayed on the menu , but I changed the description to read , " Buffalo wings with bleu cheese dressing and celery sticks .
So delicious , you 'll want to throw up and eat it again . "
The description for Sizzling NY Strip with Bleu Cheese became : " Notice how we call it a strip instead of a steak ?
After one bite , you 'll be shoving five dollar bills into its G - String .
And licking your fingers .
Blair confronts ' evil ideology '
SPECIAL REPORT QUICKVOTE
Do you agree with UK PM Tony Blair that the London bombings were driven by " evil ideology " rather than opposition to any policy ?
Yes No or View Results YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS London Acts of terror or or Create Your Own LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair met Muslim leaders on Tuesday to discuss ways of tackling homegrown Islamic extremism in the wake of the July 7 terrorist attacks in London .
Blair said that those present -- clerics , lawmakers and business leaders -- shared a " strong desire " to " confront this evil ideology , take it on and defeat it by the force of reason . "
The meeting comes as a new poll published by the Guardian newspaper revealed that two - thirds of Britons believed the London bombings were linked to the UK 's role in the war in Iraq .
Some 33 percent said Blair bore " a lot of responsibility " for the attacks which killed 56 people , including the four suspected bombers , and injured more than 700 .
A further 31 percent said he bore " a little " responsibility .
Three - quarters of those polled also believed further suicide attacks were likely .
Speaking after Tuesday 's meeting , Blair rejected speculation that British foreign policy had influenced the London bombers .
" When people talk about the links between Iraq , Afghanistan or Palestine and what has happened , yes it is true these people will use these things as an excuse , " said Blair .
" My view is that they will use whatever is going on in foreign policy to justify what they do ... or just generally the fact that Britain is an ally of America .
" It is not that their means are wrong but their ends are right .
Everything about their ideology and what they stand for is wrong . "
Blair 's comments followed Foreign Secretary Jack Straw dismissal of a report by two leading think tanks which claimed that Britain 's close alliance with the U.S. over Iraq had put the country at particular risk of terrorist attack .
( Full Story ) Meanwhile wire services reported that Pakistani security forces had detained 25 people as part of an investigation into possible links between Islamic militants and the London attacks .
On Monday Pakistani intelligence and immigration officials told CNN that two of the suspected bombers , Mohammad Sidique Khan , 30 , and Shahzad Tanweer , 22 , had traveled to Karachi in November 2004 .
( Full Story ) Tuesday 's meeting with Muslim representatives at Downing Street was also attended by Conservative and Liberal Democrat opposition leaders Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy .
Blair , who also met Afghan president Hamid Karzai on Tuesday , described the talks as " heartening . "
" The meeting revolved around a very strong desire of people from right across the Muslim community in our country to be united , not just in a condemnation of the terrible terrorist attacks here in London but also to confront and deal head - on with the extremism that is based on a perversion of the true faith of Islam , " Blair told a press conference .
Lawmaker Shahid Malik , parliamentary representative for Dewsbury where one of the bomb suspects lived , said that Muslims faced a " profound challenge . "
" We recognize we 've got to work better at confronting those evil voices -- as minute as they are -- inside our communities , " he said .
Muslim representatives have expressed shock that the four men suspected of carrying out the bombings were all born in the UK .
On Monday British imams issued a fatwa condemning violence that will be read at mosques during prayers later this week .
The religious edict ruled that suicide bombings were " vehemently prohibited . "
Conservative party leader Howard said the Muslim community had a responsibility " for reaching out to those who have been the targets of the merchants of evil and hatred . "
CNN 's European Political Editor Robin Oakley said the government wanted better regulations controlling the admittance of imams and holy leaders into the UK and " stricter standards applied to those who influence impressionable young people . "
Iqbal Sacranie , secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain , the country 's largest Islamic group , told Reuters that any initiatives should be based on a partnership between government , police and faith organizations .
" The Muslim community should not be treated as a problematic community , but treated as a community that is willing to play its role in the mainstream , " said Sacranie .
But Anjem Choudary , UK leader of the militant Islamist group al - Muhajiroun , told BBC radio that Muslim leaders should not meet Blair for talks .
Choudary said that no division between moderates and extremists existed in Islam and refused to condemn the London attacks .
" I do n't think one should legitimately sit down and negotiate .
I think the time for talking , quite honestly , is over .
Now is the time for action .
You can't sit down and negotiate while you are murdering Muslims in Iraq , " said Choudary .
On Monday evening British Home Secretary Charles Clarke announced plans to introduce new antiterror legislation before the end of the year that would ban militant preachers from inciting terrorism .
The measures , which include a new offence of " indirect incitement to terrorism , " will be put before lawmakers in October .
The bill would forbid activities such as accessing terrorist Web sites and acquiring bomb - making materials and make it an offence to undergo terrorist training .
It would also ban preachers who praise terrorist attacks .
" We believe that is the right way to go and we believe it will enable us to address the threat which we face with the unity and determination which is critical , " Clarke said after talks with his Conservative and Liberal Democrat counterparts .
The British government faced fresh criticism on Tuesday over revelations that security services failed to detain one of the bombers after linking him to an alleged plot to explode a truck bomb in London .
UK newspapers reported that Mohammad Sidique Khan had visited a man allegedly involved in the plot , which led to eight arrests in March 2004 .
The eight suspects are due to face trial later this year .
Charles Shoebridge , a security analyst and former counterterrorism intelligence officer , told The Associated Press that if the report was true it would be " evidence of an enormous failure . "
The New York Times on Monday claimed that British intelligence officials had concluded less than a month before the bombings that there was no group intent on or capable of launching an imminent attack , prompting the government to lower its formal threat assessment from " severe defined " to " substantial . "
The newspaper , citing a confidential intelligence report , said the assessment was particularly surprising because it stated that terror - related activity in the UK was a direct result of the country 's role in the war in Iraq .
( Full Story ) " Events in Iraq are continuing to act as motivation and a focus of a range of terrorist related activity in the U.K. , " the report said .

Chandler , an open - source personal information manager ( PIM ) , has reached its first public release milestone , version 0.6 , and is now available for download .
Chandler is the brainchild of Andy Hertzfeld , the first programmer hired by Steve Jobs to work in the Macintosh System Group .
Hertzfeld was responsible for writing much of the user interface and system code for what would become Mac System 1.0 in 1984 , and although he left Apple shortly afterwards , he went on to write the code for the Switcher , the Mac 's first task - switching utility , on contract .
After his Apple experience , he co-founded three companies : Radius , which made monitors and peripherals for the Mac market ; General Magic , which made handheld digital assistants ; and Eazel , which wrote open - source software and developed the Nautilus file manager that is still used in the GNOME desktop environment today .
Eazel made a big splash in the heady days of the dotcom boom , but it failed to secure its second round of investment funding and the company went bankrupt in May 2001 .
Not willing to give up on the idea of open - source application development , Andy joined the Open Source Applications Foundation ( OSAF ) as a volunteer and one of its earliest contributors .
The OSAF was founded by Mitch Kapor , the creator of Lotus , in the summer of 2001 .
It received financial contributions from Kapor himself ( US$ 5 million ) , the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation ( US $ 1.5 million ) and the Common Solutions Group ( US $ 1.25 million )
All this money has allowed the Chandler project , the prototype of which was written by Hertzfeld , to grow into a large project with as many as 23 full - time programmers working on it .
Chandler , which used to be called Vista when it was still a prototype but has grown much larger in scope , aims to do for PIMs and calendaring applications what Firefox did for web browsers .
Available for Windows ( tested only with XP ) , OSX and Linux , the application binary is a 60 MB download ( the Linux binary comes bundled as an RPM and is only 23 MB ) .
The user interface bears more than a slight resemblance to Apple 's own iCal product , with each task on the calendar highlighted with a rounded , colorful overlay .
As to be expected , there are significant gaps in functionality in the 0.6 product , and a few rough edges with the user interface .
It was easy to create new events in the calendar by dragging and dropping , but it was not immediately obvious how to create new categories of event that are represented by different colors , which is a simple process in iCal .
However , the external resemblance to iCal belies the internal flexibility of the program .
It is designed as a collaboration tool , where users in a workgroup can share their calendars and appointments on a central server .
The development goal is to have a product that can duplicate much of the calendaring functionality of Microsoft Exchange in small workgroups , academic collaboration and even corporate environments .
Already , it seems slightly more featured than Sunbird , the standalone open - source calendaring application that is part of the Mozilla suite .
However , there are still many missing pieces to the puzzle .
There is a mail function included in Chandler , but so far it is extremely rudimentary and only works for people in the Chandler workgroup , although the design goals are to be a fully - fledged IMAP and SMTP email client .
Will this program develop into a legitimate Exchange competitor ?
At present it seems unlikely , but so was the formation of Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 and the Macintosh when those projects first started .
The threat was alleged to have come from Richard Armitage
General Musharraf said the warning was delivered by former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage to Pakistan 's intelligence director .
" I think it was a very rude remark , " Gen Musharraf told CBS television .
Pakistan agreed to side with the US , but Gen Musharraf said it did so based on his country 's national interest .
" One has to think and take actions in the interest of the nation , and that 's what I did , " he said .
' Ludicrous ' requests
The extracts from the CBS show 60 Minutes , which will run on Sunday , were released on the same day that the White House praised Pakistan for its co-operation in America 's " war on terror " .
HAVE YOUR SAY Iraq and Afghanistan prove that US does whatever it can to protect its interests in the world .

Send us your comments
The BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington says that Gen Musharraf was deliberately distancing himself from the White House in the face of intense pressure within Pakistan over his close ties to Washington .
He is also due to launch his autobiography next week and some analysts say the timing of the revelation may be an attempt to generate interest in the book .
The White House and US State Department declined to comment on the 60 Minutes interview .
The US allegedly ordered Pakistan to crush dissent
" The intelligence director told me that Mr Armitage said , ' Be prepared to be bombed .
Be prepared to go back to the Stone Age ' , " he said .
The US envoy also insisted that Pakistan suppress domestic expression of support for attacks on the United States , he said .
" If somebody 's expressing views , we cannot curb the expression of views , " Gen Musharraf said .
Mr Armitage also allegedly demanded that Pakistan allow the US to use its border posts as staging points for the war on Afghanistan .
Gen Musharraf did agree to open up Pakistani airspace to the US , as well as to share intelligence after 11 September .
American troops are not officially allowed to operate on Pakistani soil although they have launched air strikes from bases in Afghanistan .
In January , 18 local people were killed in a US raid targeting Al Qaeda number two Ayman Al - Zawahiri in a village in Bajaur Agency on the border with Afghanistan .
Five foreigners were also killed in the raid , Gen Musharraf said at the time , amid anger about the attack .
Pakistan 's support was considered crucial in the defeat of Afghanistan 's Taleban government , which Pakistan had helped to bring to power .
President Musharraf has proved a loyal ally though many now will question the means used to extract the co-operation , says the BBC's Jonathan Beale .
There are some cycles in oil price fluctuations .
For instance , the seasonal fluctuations in oil demand or even the change of oil contract at the end of each month .
On top of that , there is the usual chaos of geopolitical events , Hurricanes , etc. .
The objective is to see if we can apply the Periodicity Transform in order to capture eventual cycles and get an idea of future oil market volatility .
The amplitude of the big slide in oil prices from $ 75 to $ 61 was a little bit a surprise for everybody .
I 'm trying to answer the following question : is this big drop significant or simply a consequence of a very volatile market ?
I consider the prices from 2002 to end of July 2006 ( the data is from the EIA ) .
We fit a straight line in the log domain ( Fig. 1 ) .
The fit is quite nice with a correlation coefficient equals to 0.97 , the slope is 0.2615 / year which represents a 30 % per year increase in prices .
Fig 1 .- Linear fit in the log domain .

The residuals are Gaussian distributed with a standard deviation equals to 0.095 :
Fig 2 . - Residuals of the fit shown on Fig. 1 and corresponding pdf ( the red line is the Gaussian model ) .
Click to enlarge .
If we apply an exponential transform to go back to the normal price domain , we get a nice exponential trend ( Fig. 3 ) .
The dotted lines are the 95 % confidence interval derived from the above gaussian model for the residuals .
Note that even if the residuals can be modeled as a gaussian additive noise , once the exponential transform is applied the noise becomes multiplicative and non gaussian ( that 's why the confidence interval becomes wider with time ) .
Fig 3 . - Exponential trend and 95 % confidence interval .
The red points are the recent drop from Aug 1 to Sept 19 .

The Periodicity Transform is quite a new tool proposed by William A. Sethares and Tom Staley in 1999 :
Periodicity Transforms decompose a data sequence into a sum of simple periodic sequences by projecting onto a set of periodic subspaces , leaving residuals whose periodicities have been removed .
As the name suggests , this decomposition is accomplished directly in terms of periodic sequences and not in terms of frequency or scale , as do the Fourier and Wavelet Transforms .
In consequence , the representation is linear - in - period , rather than linear - in - frequency or linear - in - scale .
Unlike most transforms , the set of basis vectors is not specified a priori , rather , the Periodicity Transform finds its own " best " set of basis elements .
Technically , the collection of all periodic subspaces forms a frame , a more - than - complete spanning set .
The Periodicity Transforms specify ways of sensibly handling the redundancy by exploiting some of the general properties of the periodic subspaces .
Applied on the residuals , we get 29 basis elements .
I show the four most important periodic basis elements in terms of energy contribution :
Fig 4 .
The 4 top basis elements out of 29 .

We can reuse the periodicity basis in order to estimate future fluctuations of the residuals :
Fig 5 .- Modelisation of the residuals by the Periodcity Transform .

Back in the price domain , we get the following prediction :
Fig 6 .- Periodicity Transform Extrapolation .
Click to enlarge .
Fig 7 .- Zoom in on Fig. 6 .
The recent drop in oil prices is still within the confidence interval of the exponential trend observed since 2002 .
There is about a 2 % probability that prices could drop below $ 61 .
It seems that $ 60 is the actual lower support line for the oil prices right now .
The periodicity transform gives us a rough idea of what future volatility could look like .
The PT basis elements are hard to interpret in terms of known price cycles .
The predictive power of the Periodicity Transform is probably limited because of the chaotic nature of price fluctuations .
The PT seems to have predicted the recent big drop in prices and is predicting a big rise at the end of the year .
Of course , this is a very simple approach that is assuming that the exponential trend observed since 2002 will stay a valid model for the coming years .
A few comments :
Why is this the case ?
It ’s not that the developers deliberately modified the design .
It ’s not that they necessarily consider alignment and whitespace to be unimportant .
It ’s just that these elements in the user interface are often invisible to them .
For a designer , … whitespace is often just as important as the content .
Development teams are responsible for putting interactive features and content into a product .
Empty space is neither feature nor content .
Therefore , it is not a requirement .
For a designer , however , whitespace is often just as important as the content .
As a designer , I spend a lot of time adjusting whitespace to enable effective scanning of content .
I also spend a lot of time refining alignment and padding to establish the right prioritization between user interface elements .
I utilize both of these design elements to guide users through the interactions on a page .
I use them to communicate what ’s most important , what ’s related , and what needs attention .
For designers , these are key requirements of effective communication .
And yes , there ’s a lot of evidence that shows what ’s invisible does make a difference .
A shared understanding of what ’s being built — whether visible or invisible — goes a long way toward making products that our users can understand .
Now before you decide I am a whiny designer just getting on the case of user interface engineers for not building exactly what I designed , let me say that I know what the engineering team does in bridging the gap between a product design and an actual product is invaluable .
But just like designers should know what is possible with HTML and CSS — or whatever happens to be their medium — and how to make their designs bulletproof , development teams should recognize that the space between and around user interface elements and the alignment of those elements may be just as important as the elements themselves .
I ’d love to see more developers bring the skills and craft they apply to the construction of the visible to the construction of the invisible : padding and alignment .
Once they learn to look for these things in a design specification or mockup , they ’ll have a better sense of the designer ’s intent .
A shared understanding of what ’s being built — whether visible or invisible — goes a long way toward making products that our users can understand .

Google Inc. is switching its servers to run on Advanced Micro Devices Inc. chips instead of those made by Intel Corp. , according to a Morgan Stanley report .
Google , which has more than 200,000 servers , has started to buy Advanced Micro ’s Opteron processors with almost all new purchases , Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Edelstone said .
He raised his earnings estimates for Sunnyvale , Calif . - based Advanced Micro .
“ Most of Google ’s near - term server purchases will use AMD ’s Opteron for the first time , ” Edelstone said .
Google “ will help AMD to enjoy a significant sequential increase in their server business in the first quarter . ”
Winning Google as a customer may help Advanced Micro beat analysts ’ estimates this quarter , San Francisco - based Edelstone wrote .

The switch may also come as a blow to Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini , who sits on Google ’s board .
Advanced Micro , the No. 2 maker of computer processors behind Intel , last quarter took more than 20 % of the market for the first time in more than four years .
Edelstone raised his estimate for Advanced Micro ’s first - quarter profit to 33 cents a share from 31 cents .
He raised his 2006 estimate by 10 cents to $ 1.70 a share .
Shares of Advanced Micro rose $ 1.40 to $ 40.07 .
Google spokeswoman Sonya Boralv said she was n’t able to comment on the Morgan Stanley report .

Buba is confined to her concrete sleeping quarters
Buba the bear is not well .
She has been locked inside for most of the past nine days and the effects are beginning to show .
" She has developed an abscess on her leg and I am worried about her , " said Dr Etty Ararat , the director of Haifa Zoo .
Like all the mammals at the zoo , Buba , an eight - year - old Brown Syrian bear , has been confined to her concrete sleeping quarters for her own safety as the city is bombarded by missiles from Lebanon .
" The bears are not stressed by the air raid sirens but they do n't understand why they have to be inside all the time , " said Dr Ararat .
The staff at the zoo cannot take any chances .
Sirens sound repeatedly throughout the day and where rockets have landed the effects have been devastating .
The animals are let out under supervision for short periods , but when the alarms sound they are hurriedly ushered back in .

Of the zoo 's regular 40 - strong staff , Dr Ararat is one of only four who remain at the eight - acre site to take care of 1,000 animals , despite the danger .
The zoo's plight is made worse by the fact that the conflict has forced it to close to the public at what should be its busiest time of the year .
I hope it will end soon - it's no good , for people or animals
Dr Etty Ararat
" In July and August we get about 3,000 people a day but now we are losing money every day , which will have an impact on everything , " Dr Ararat said .
" Also , our suppliers are closed , so trying to find food for the animals is a mission these days , when usually it 's not , and we need help . "
As she makes her rounds , Dr Ararat stops at the big cats enclosure , a spacious , sculpted compound where the lions , tigers and leopards normally roam free .
But here , too , the animals are languishing indoors , with just enough space to pace or lie on the floor .
The conditions are taking their toll on Barbara , an elderly 32 - year - old Bengal tiger , who first arrived at the zoo , starving , some 20 years ago after being abandoned by a travelling circus .
" Barbara is depressed , " said Dr Ararat .
" She likes to play outside but since she has been in here she has stopped playing .
She usually comes to me , but now she does n't pay any attention . "
Anxious baboons
Next door , three African lions - Simba , Jungle and Gov - sit in their small indoor compound , watching with suspicion as I enter .
They barely stir but begin to growl as I move closer , making me wonder if the warring has left their nerves on edge .
The big cats are being kept indoors to prevent them escaping
" Actually , the sirens do n't have any effect on them , " Dr Ararat said .
" All big cats are lazy and they do n't seem to mind being in here , so long as we bring them food .
But of course , it 's not good for them . "
The carnivores are also kept inside for another reason .
The bars of the lions ' enclosure were recently replaced with glass , which could be shattered by an exploding missile .
" If the glass breaks and they get free , it would be dangerous for all the people in the town , " said Dr Ararat .
Of all the animals in the zoo , the worst affected by the sirens and intermittent booms are the 17 baboons .
" We can see the change in their behaviour , " said Dr Arafat .
" They are very anxious to get out and they are starting to knock on the doors .
" Today we gave the baboons a treat of popcorn , which they love .
At the moment they 're still eating and if we see any signs of stress then of course we will act accordingly . "
Dr Ararat says the longer the war continues , the worse it will get for the zoo .
" I hope it will end soon - it's no good , for people or animals .
But I am a born optimist and one way or another , the zoo will survive . "
Get right with Google
How smart entrepreneurs are dealing with the online Goliath that can make a small business -- or break it .
MOUNTAIN VIEW , CALIF .
( FSB Magazine ) -- Allan Keiter awoke one recent morning to the scary news that his Atlanta company 's website was nearly impossible to find on a Google search .
MyRatePlan.com helps consumers compare cellular calling plans .
Until that morning , the site had often ranked in the top - ten nonpaid results for search terms such as " free cell phones " and " family plans . "
And like thousands of other businesses , Keiter 's company relied on free Google searches to drive customers its way .
Keiter had fallen victim to what 's known as the dreaded Google dance : sudden , seismic shifts in search results that occur whenever Google 's engineers decide , without warning or explanation , to tweak the software algorithms that determine how the mighty search engine processes keywords .
It 's like owning a shop on a busy street corner where all the pedestrians suddenly and mysteriously vanish .
In the months after he fell prey to the Google dance , Keiter saw his revenues plunge some 20 % .
When he contacted Google for an explanation he was simply told that the algorithm was secret sauce .
" There was nothing I could do , " he says .
" They make changes in their ivory tower , and it ripples through to the little guy . "
When FSB asked Google spokesperson Barry Schnitt to comment on Keiter 's experience , he responded with a written statement : " Just as the web changes constantly , Google continues to modify and refine our algorithms to improve the quality of our objective search results . "
In the lives of small - business owners , Google ( Charts ) looms as the new Wal - Mart ( Charts ) .
Many entrepreneurs fear and despise the retailing giant for mistreating vendors and vaporizing small competitors and entire business districts .
Yet Wal - Mart also is lauded for delivering a vast range of consumer goods at rock - bottom prices .
Supplier contracts with Wal - Mart represent a boon to thousands of entrepreneurs and a dream to many more .
Whatever one 's attitude , the wise small - business owner learns as much as he can about Wal - Mart and its ways - and weaknesses .
He adapts or dies .
Smart entrepreneurs are taking a similar approach to Google , which can decimate their sales through a whim of search - engine coding , or deliver a flood of new customers and ad revenue .
How Google affects your company depends on how quickly you accept its power and how cleverly you accommodate it .
As moving targets go , Google is a blur , perpetually ranging into new territories , from free software to classified ads to telephony .
And while most large companies are tight - lipped , stealth is the very cornerstone of Google 's corporate culture .
" Google is virtually impenetrable , " says Dave Taylor , an Internet consultant in Boulder .
" It 's ironic , because the company is all about transparency and openness on the web . "
Still , FSB set out to take a snapshot of this protean company in full flight .
Our goal was to gauge how Google is affecting small - business owners in America today , and what entrepreneurs can expect from future versions of Google .
We reached two main conclusions .
First off , Internet search is going through a transitional period .
Small online businesses in particular are starting to chafe at the rising cost of search - term advertising .
Some of them may soon seek alternatives to a marketing strategy based solely or primarily on search .
Also clear in our snapshot :
To many small businesses , Google is both friend and foe .
Thousands of entrepreneurs now find most of their customers via search - based marketing .
Other businesses - niche software and book publishers , for example - risk imminent extinction thanks to Google 's free software releases and ( shall we say ) innovative approach to copyright law .
Hanging in the lobby of building 43 , an airy , modern structure on Google 's sprawling Mountain View campus , is a giant screen that displays a dynamic map of the world .
Every single Google search undertaken by anyone anywhere registers on this map in real time .
Map of the world
Silk - thin lines emanate from places such as the Marshall Islands , where it's the middle of the night and only a few Internet surfers - maybe even just one - are currently using Google .
Meanwhile , fat , colored pipelines rise from high - traffic areas such as China ( teal ) , Germany ( green ) , and the East Coast of the U.S. ( red ) .
There are still large blank spots across sub-Saharan Africa and other regions that remain terra incognita on the Google globe .
For many entrepreneurs here in the U.S. , Google has helped make the Internet a viable place to do business .
Roughly 500,000 U.S. small businesses rely on unpaid or " natural " search for the bulk of their revenues , according to John Battelle , author of The Search : How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture .
Another half - million firms participate in Google 's paid - search advertising program .
Two - thirds of those are small businesses that collectively contributed $ 2 billion to Google 's total revenues of $ 6 billion last year .
Thanks to Google , many startups have reached profitable niche markets at little cost .
Take Shark Diver , a San Francisco adventure - travel company that Patric Douglas founded in 2000 .
Shark Diver ( sharkdiver.com ) arranges tours to tropical locales worldwide where shark fans can frolic underwater with their favorite predators .
Douglas , 38 , estimates that at most , 100,000 people in the U.S. possess the requisites for this pursuit : diving experience and a crazy streak .
By bidding on search terms such as " cage diving " in Google auctions , he has been able to zero in on his target market .
Shark Diver is now a profitable business with 20 employees and about $ 1 million in annual revenues , according to Douglas .
His thoughts on Google ?
" They 're gods .
Back in the day , there 's no way I could have drilled down to a niche this small . "
More established businesses have been able to slash their marketing budgets by switching to search - term advertising .
Ray Allen , 64 , quit the cutthroat New York City advertising industry to start American Meadows ( americanmeadows.com ) , a wildflower - seed company based in Williston , Vt .
Ten years ago Allen was spending $ 300,000 a year on magazine ads and print catalogs to generate about $ 1 million in annual revenues .
Today he spends just $ 120,000 a year ( mostly with Google , but also with Yahoo's ( Charts ) competing pay - per- click ad service ) to generate more than $ 2 million in revenues .
" This is a total revolution , " crows Allen .
Yet Google 's stated goal of organizing all the world 's information is almost guaranteed to give its advertisers headaches .
If Google has its way , every word ever written and every image ever created will one day be cataloged on its servers .
From a business - PR perspective , that means good press will show up in search results .
So will corporate scandal coverage , leaked proprietary information , bad product reviews , blogger rants - you name it .
As the volume of searchable information swells , advertisers will increasingly find themselves in a bind .
As night follows day , embarrassing content will pop up next to their ads .
Google may yet devise software that will allow companies to choose what sort of search results they wish their ads to be associated with .
Meanwhile , do n't be surprised to see advertisers squirming under Google 's digital hoof .
One likely trigger is rising search - term rates .
Today hot terms such as " medical malpractice lawyer " and " debt consolidation " routinely auction for $ 10 a click or more .
According to Jupiter Research , the average cost for a paid - search keyword rose from 39 cents in 2004 to 44 cents in 2005 and is expected to hit 58 cents by 2010 .
( These are industry averages ; Jupiter does not break out Google from Yahoo and other search competitors . )
Google generates nearly all its revenues by selling ads .
But businesses may soon balk at seeing Google leech away an ever - increasing share of their revenues .
Yes , paying Google only if someone actually clicks on an ad is more efficient than a traditional TV or magazine ad , where you pay for eyeballs .
Studies show that 1 % or 2 % of clicks generate paying customers .
While more than double the typical conversion rates for print and TV ads , that 's still a low percentage game .
" I predict a rebellion , " says Jakob Nielsen , principal with Nielsen Norman Group ( nngroup.com ) , an Internet - user research firm in Fremont , Calif .
" People are going to tire of spending so much for web traffic . "
Expect many businesses to seek other , cheaper marketing techniques .
" Search - based advertising has been all the rage , but that does n't mean there are n't other options , " says Guy Creese , an analyst with Burton Group ( burtongroup.com ) in Midvale , Utah .
As the blogosphere expands and matures , more entrepreneurs could discover that blogging is an efficient way to attract customers .
Other small businesses may find that it pays to purchase ads directly from website owners rather than through Google .
Say you run a home - building company .
Placing an ad on a popular real estate industry site might be cheaper than paid search - and might prove a more direct route to your target audience .
Competing with the Goliath
Travel agencies .
Newspapers .
Realtors .
Advertising firms .
Software makers .
What do these industries have in common ?
All face a serious competitive threat from Google .
" Google is the new Microsoft and then some , " says Mark Stevens , CEO of MSCO ( msco.com ) , a marketing firm in White Plains , N.Y .
" Google poses a threat to more companies in more industries than anyone else in history . "
When Mike Landis learned that Google had started offering free web - traffic monitoring software , he knew it spelled trouble for his company , Mach5 Development , based in Asheville , N.C. Landis , 41 , sells a similar application and now finds himself competing with a behemoth .
Once again , Google responded with a canned statement .
This one reads in part : " We believe there is room for many players in this space . "
Landis is n't so sure .
Mach5 ( mach5.com ) has five employees and just $ 300,000 in annual revenues .
" Obviously Google is going to bleed away a lot of our sales , " says Landis .
" We 're not as attractive to our customers anymore . "
He 's not alone : Numerous software publishers have been threatened by Google 's habit of releasing freeware that competes with their products .
Google makes no apologies for crushing small competitors .
" This company is organized to be disruptive , " CEO Eric Schmidt said in a telephone interview with FSB .
Google , which had amassed a $ 2.9 billion war chest as of this spring , has been on an acquisition rampage of late , buying up companies that make software for everything from mapping to photo editing .
That 's a boon for Google users , but it puts many software vendors in the unfortunate position of trying to sell a product that Google is offering gratis .
Mega-library
Google 's recent move to assemble a vast digital library of books is viewed as a threat by much of the global publishing industry .
Google decided to forgo the usual process of obtaining permissions from thousands of book companies .
Instead it executed a nifty end - run around the publishers , cutting deals with five large libraries - including the New York Public Library and the University of Michigan library system - to digitize their entire collections .
In exchange , the libraries will get digital versions of their holdings .
Google will walk away with the ability to provide brief excerpts ( so - called snippets ) from millions of books in its search results .
Google will also sell ads against these results .
Snippets or no , many publishers contend that Google plans to pirate a universe of copyrighted material .
Last October , five large publishing companies - including McGraw - Hill ( Charts ) , Penguin Group , and Simon & Schuster - sued Google for copyright infringement .
" We believe what we 're doing is legal and consistent with copyright law , " says a Google spokesman .
Google stresses that any publisher can keep its books from being digitized simply by sending a list of titles to Google .
But that 's not good enough for Lynne Rienner , whose Boulder - based book publishing company ( Lynne Rienner Publishers ; rienner.com ) is 22 years old , has 20 employees , and books less than $ 5 million a year in sales .
" Google is trying to turn the copyright laws on their head , " she says .
" Why should I have to let Google know which books they can't copy ?
They should be seeking permission from me regarding which books they can copy . "
Rather than compiling a list of her company 's 1,200 titles ( " a waste of my staff 's time " ) , Rienner fired off an angry letter to CEO Schmidt .
Google responded with a letter agreeing not to copy any of her books .
Rienner is unmollified .
She worries that she will be cut out of some future digital moneymaking opportunity .
" Books are my unique content , " she says .
" I 'm sure the smart people at Google are busy dreaming up all kinds of ways to make money off them . "
For now Rienner has found a symbolic way to register her displeasure :
She has started using Yahoo's search engine instead of Google's .
Bull in a china shop
" Google is not yet a mature business , " says CEO Schmidt .
" Our pace of innovation is not slowing down , I assure you .
If anything , it 's accelerating . "
In effect , Schmidt 's company is many - tentacled and moving at light speed .
Small businesses race to keep up .
Neil Kugelman , founder of Goldspeed.com , an online jewelry business based in Lynbrook , N.Y. , has his computer programmed to alert him to any news about Google .
He 's especially on the lookout for announcements about new software .
To run his business , Kugelman uses a variety of free software programs offered by Google , and the company is constantly adding to its slate of offerings .
As long as you 're giving away software , why not hand over the whole box ?
The argument : Computer hardware prices are plummeting in any case .
Experts say Google may one day start giving away PCs , reducing them to the equivalent of the free calculator you get when you open a bank account .
The Google PC would come loaded with ad - supported software designed to keep people Googling - and not necessarily doing their work .
A recent study by the Nielsen Norman Group found that employees spend 11 seconds a day , on average , glancing at ads surrounding free software .
Clicking on ads wastes another 15 seconds a day .
These are tiny increments of time , but they add up .
Over a year , Nielsen Norman estimates , a free computer could easily cost a company $ 100 an employee in lost productivity .
Another new frontier for Google is cellphones .
Already the company is delivering services such as traffic updates to phone screens .
Many analysts expect Google to team up with a cellular service provider such as Sprint ( Charts ) or Cingular to offer a mobile pricing tool .
Cellphones already have cameras , goes the reasoning .
So why not add a bar - code scanner ?
You could walk into an electronics store and scan a DVD player .
Up would pop the price , along with Google ads for various area merchants , touting their lower prices on the very same item .
" This is a logical direction for Google , " says Roger Entner , a telecom analyst in the Boston office of Ovum , a research firm .
" It would extend their advertising reach out onto the actual floors of merchants . "
Or what if Google offered a certified same - day international digital document - delivery service ?
That 's eminently doable , given Google 's massive server farm .
America 's entrepreneurs would turn cartwheels in their Dockers if Google figured out a way to beat FedEx ( Charts ) and other couriers on both price and speed .
Or what about an e-mail translation service ?
Simply send an English e-mail to your Chinese supplier via google.chinese.com .
Google would translate the message into Chinese and forward it to the addressee - in real time .
If nothing else , expect Google to continue challenging established ways of doing business .
For good and ill , Google is one of the most awesome forces ever to be unleashed on the business world - or rather the Google world in which all business owners now live .

Last week 's item on " The Manchurian Clergyman " made me seek out one of my collections of the writings of H.L. Mencken , a man who might well take credit for the modern artform of " merciless rhetorical spankings of fanatics , villains , and ignoramuses . "
But , I wonder , could Mencken write a column for a newspaper today in America ?
Doubtful .
Consider this item that appeared in the Baltimore Evening Sun on December 9 , 1929 :
N0 , there is nothing notably dignified about religious ideas .
They run , rather , to a peculiarly puerile and tedious kind of nonsense ....
One may forgive a Communist or a Single Taxer on the ground that there is something the matter with his ductless glands ...[ b]ut the average theologian is a hearty , red - faced , well - fed fellow with no discernible excuse in pathology .
He disseminates his blather , not innocently , like a philosopher , but maliciously , like a politician .
There is , in fact , nothing about religious opinions that entitles them to any more respect than other opinions get .
On the contrary , they tend to be noticeably silly .
If you doubt it , then ask any pious fellow of your acquaintance to put what he believes into the form of an affidavit , and see how it reads ....
" I , John Doe , being duly sworn , do say that I believe that , at death , I shall turn into a verterbrate without substance , having neither weight , extent nor mass , but with all the intellectual powers and bodily sensations of an ordinary mammal ; ... and that , for the high crime and misdemeanor of having kissed my sister - in - law behind the door , with evil intent , I shall be boiled in molten sulphur for one billion calendar years .... "
The most curious social convention of the great age in which we live is the one to the effect that religious opinions should be respected .
Its evil effects must be plain enough to everyone .
All it accomplishes is ( a ) to throw a veil of sanctity about ideas that violate every intellectual decency , and ( b ) to make every theologian a sort of chartered libertine .
No doubt it is mainly to blame for the appalling slowness with which really sound notions make their way in the world ....
Or what of this from the Baltimore Evening Sun of June 29 , 1925 , regarding the Scopes trial :
Such obscenities as the forthcoming trial of the Tennessee evolutionist , if they serve no other purpose , at least call attention dramatically to the fact that enlightenment , among mankind , is very narrowly dispersed .
It is common to assume that human progress affects everyone -- that even the dullest man , in these bright days , knows more than any man of , say , the Eighteenth Century , and is far more civilized .
This assumption is quite erroneous .
The men of the educated minority , no doubt , know more than their predecessors , and of some of them , perhaps , it may be said that they are more civilized -- though I should not like to be put to giving names -- but the great masses of men , even in this inspired republic , are precisely where the mob was at the dawn of history .
They are ignorant , they are dishonest , they are cowardly , they are ignoble .
They know little if anything that is worth knowing , and there is not the slightest sign of a natural desire among them to increase their knowledge ....
Every step in human progress , from the first feeble stirrings in the abyss of time , has been opposed by the great majority of men .
Every valuable thing that has been added to the store of man 's possessions has been derided by them when it was new , and destroyed by them when they had the power .
They have fought every new truth ever heard of , and they have killed every truth - seeker who got into their hands .
The so - called religious organizations which now lead the war against the teaching of evolution are nothing more , at bottom , than conspiracies of the inferior man against his betters .
They mirror very accurately his congenital hatred of knowledge , his bitter enmity to the man who knows more than he does , and so gets more out of life .
Certainly it cannot have gone unnoticed that their membership is recruited , in the overwhelming main , from the lower orders -- that no man of any education or other human dignity belongs to them .
What they propose to do , at bottom and in brief , is to make the superior man infamous -- by mere abuse if it is sufficient , and if it is not , then by law ....
The popularity of Fundamentalism among the inferior orders of men is explicable in exactly the same way .
The cosmogonies that educated men toy with are all inordinately complex ....
But the cosmogony of Genesis is so simple that even a yokel can grasp it .
It is set forth in a few phrases .
It offers , to an ignorant man , the irresistible reasonableness of the nonsensical .
So he accepts it with loud hosannas , and has one more excuse for hating his betters .
Politics and the fine arts repeat the story .
The issues that the former throw up are often so complex that , in the present state of human knowledge , they must remain impenetrable , even to the most enlightened men .
How much easier to follow a mountebank with a shibboleth -- a Coolidge , a Wilson or a Roosevelt !
What all this amounts to is that the human race is divided into two sharply differentiated and mutually antagonistic classes , almost two genera -- a small minority that plays with ideas and is capable of taking them in , and a vast majority that finds them painful , and is thus arrayed against them , and against all who have traffic with them .
The intellectual heritage of the race belongs to the minority , and to the minority only .
The majority has no more to do with it than it has to do with ecclesiastic politics on Mars .
In so far as that heritage is apprehended , it is viewed with enmity .
But in the main it is not apprehended at all .
Dobbs : Congress stiffs working Americans By Lou Dobbs
CNN
Editor 's note : Lou Dobbs ' commentary appears every Wednesday on CNN.com .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Without much fanfare , the House of Representatives last week voted to give members of Congress yet another pay raise , as it has done almost every year for nearly a decade .
For some reason , our elected officials decided against holding a news conference .
Maybe that 's because they did n't want to draw attention to the fact that they raise their own salaries almost every year while refusing to raise the pay of our lowest - paid workers .
Corporate America , the Bush administration and the national economic orthodoxy with which they 're in league have consistently argued against helping working men and women at the lowest end of the wage scale by raising the minimum wage .
Big business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce say it will harm the economy and eliminate jobs .
As is so frequent with the faith - based economics that grips both political parties in Washington , such concerns have absolutely nothing to do with reality .
For example , it 's impossible to deny the national minimum wage of $ 5.15 is not enough for a family to live above the poverty line .
The annual salary for workers earning the national minimum wage still leaves a family of three about $ 6,000 short of the poverty threshold .
Raising the minimum wage to $ 7.50 would positively affect the lives of more than 8 million workers , including an estimated 760,000 single mothers and 1.8 million parents with children under 18 .
But even this 46 percent increase would get them only to the poverty line .
Do n't you think these families just might need that cost - of - living increase a bit more than our elected officials who are paid nearly $ 170,000 a year ?
With no Congressional action on raising the minimum wage since 1997 , inflation has eroded wages .
The minimum wage in the 21st century is $ 2 lower in real dollars than it was four decades ago and now stands at its lowest level since 1955 , according to the Economic Policy Institute and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
Also , since the last time Congress increased the minimum wage for our lowest - paid workers , buying power has fallen by 25 percent .
Yet over that time our elected representatives have given themselves eight pay raises totaling more than 23 percent .
Raising the minimum wage is n't simply about the price of labor .
It 's also about our respect for labor .
One of this country 's greatest business innovators , Henry Ford , made history almost a century ago by raising the salaries of his production - line workers far beyond the prevailing wage .
Ford not only paid his employees well enough to buy the products they built , but he kept his employees loyal and productive .
That 's also very good business .
The myth that raising the minimum wage will lead to job cuts is just that : a myth .
In fact , research suggests just the opposite .
According to the Fiscal Policy Institute , since 1998 , states with higher minimum wages experienced better job growth than states paying only the federal minimum wage .
Among small retail businesses in those higher minimum - wage states , job growth was double the rest of the country .
The House Appropriations Committee has passed a $ 2.10 increase as part of a spending bill , but the business lobby pressured the House leadership to hold up the measure .
" I think it 's disgraceful that we waited nine years to do this , " says Rep. David Obey , a Democrat from Wisconsin .
" We have seen gas prices go up by 140 percent since the minimum wage was increased .
We have seen home heating oil go up by 120 percent .
We have seen health care go up by almost 45 percent . "
This administration , our Republican - led Congress and the dominant corporate interests in this country want cheap labor .
And to achieve that goal they 're outsourcing middle - class jobs , importing illegal labor and cutting retirement and health - care benefits .
It 's time for the federal government to reverse the trend , to at least substantially raise the minimum wage in this country , and by doing so express how much we value all working Americans .

Das Drängen der USA und anderer westlicher Staaten zur Einführung strikter Regeln zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums in Schwellenländern wie China könnte sich bald als Bumerang erweisen .
" Heute sind wir die Erfinder und die anderen die Lizenznehmer " , gab Kenneth Cukier , Redakteur beim Wirtschaftsmagazin The Economist , auf der Verbraucherschutzkonferenz im Rahmen des Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue ( TACD ) in Brüssel über " die Politik und die Ideologie des geistigen Eigentums " zu bedenken .
" Aber wären wir bereit , von anderen Lizenzen zu kaufen ? "
Der Regulierungsexperte ist sich sicher , dass " die nächsten großen Innovationen aus Asien kommen " .
Vermutlich würde der Westen dann die jetzt noch forcierten Schutzmechanismen für Ideen im Eigeninteresse aufbrechen wollen .
Cukier stellte jedoch klar : " Wenn wir internationale Regeln schaffen , müssen wir auch gewillt sein , sie zu befolgen " .
Ein Umdenken auf der politischen Ebene hat angesichts dieser Bedrohung der westlichen Marktdominanz bereits eingesetzt .
So überraschte Bruce Lehman , langjähriger Berater der Clinton - Regierung in Fragen des geistigen Eigentums und einer der Väter mehrerer umstrittener internationaler Rechtsabkommen auf Ebene der WIPO ( World Intellectual Property Organization ) und der WTO ( World Trade Organization ) , auf der Tagung mit der Aussage , dass sich das TRIPS - Abkommen ( trade - related aspects of intellectual property rights ) zur Verbreitung geistiger Eigentumsrechte nach westlichem Muster " für die USA als großer Fehler herausgestellt hat " .
Es werde meist vergessen , dass die Vereinigten Staaten damit auch Zugang zu vielen ihrer Märkte gegeben hätten .
Dies beziehe sich auch auf Länder mit niedrigen Lohnverhältnissen und ohne Auflagen beim Umweltschutz .
Es sei daher kein Wunder , dass etwa selbst Apples iPod und damit eines der Vorzeigeprodukte der US - Hightech - Wirtschaft in China gefertigt werde .
Dass ein Großteil der Profite trotzdem in Cupertino bleibt , habe Apple allein der Eigentümerschaft am geistigen Eigentum an dem Abspielgerät zu verdanken .
Doch auch die Schutzwirkung von Patent- , Urheber - und Markenrechten könnte sich bald als negativer Wirtschaftsfaktor für den Westen erweisen .
Die Gesetzgeber und Drahtzieher internationaler Handelsvereinbarungen sehen sich damit in einem Dilemma .
Antony Taubman von der WIPO stellte die Situation in den Worten des Philosophen Soeren Kierkegaard dar : " Tu etwas oder tu nichts , du wirst es in jedem Fall bereuen " .
Das von ihm mitbetreute Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources , Traditional Knowledge and Folklore ( IGC ) schlage sich daher bereits seit Jahren mit der Frage herum , ob das Ziel des Diskussionsprozesses überhaupt ein internationaler Vertrag sein sollte .
Schließlich würde von der einen Seite befürchtet , dass mit der Verankerung geistiger Eigentumsrechte in traditionellen Gesellschaften deren Kulturen in eine " Zwangsjacke " gesteckt und bestehende Werte überlagert werden könnten .
Andererseits werde aber auch in Frage gestellt , ob es überhaupt Berechtigungen für die Existenz öffentlicher Domänen und Allmenden gäbe .
Unbeirrbar hält derweil die EU - Kommission an ihrem Kurs fest .
" Wir haben die klare Linie , dass wir das E - Business und die Rechtehalter stärken wollen " , betonte Leonardo Cervera Navas von der Generaldirektion Binnenmarkt .
Nur mit durchschlagkräftigen Schutzrechten könnten Rechtehalter ihre Geschäftsmodelle ins Internet verlagern .
Dem von der Zivilgesellschaft erhobenen Anspruch auf einen besseren Zugang zum Wissen will sich die Kommission aber dennoch nicht ganz verschließen .
Das
Thema sei auf der politischen Agenda , betonte der bekennende " Eurokrat " .
Konkret eine Rolle spiele es etwa bei der Evaluierung der Urheberrechtsrichtlinie von 2001 oder im Rahmen der Initiative zum Aufbau einer digitalen Bibliothek in Europa .
Für Verbraucherschützer und Wissenschaftler haben das breitbandige Internet und P2P - Netze dagegen bereits ganz neue ökonomische Modelle etabliert , für die sich ein unreformiertes System des geistigen Eigentums als Hindernis erweist .
" Die digitale Revolution hat die Bedingungen für einen neuen , kollaborativen Produktionsmodus geschaffen " , führte Mark Cooper , Forschungsdirektor der Consumer Federation of America , aus .
Es mache keinen Sinn mehr , digitale Güter wie Musik oder Filme künstlich rechtlich oder mithilfe technischer Restriktionen zu verknappen .
Gerade P2P habe die kosteneffektive Verbreitung einst rarer Ressourcen ermöglicht und eine Demokratisierung der Kreation digitaler Werke vorangetrieben .
P2P übersetzt Cooper daher mit " People 2 People " .
Schon im Fall Napster hätten die Verbraucher letztlich zur Selbsthilfe gegriffen und die Musikindustrie gezwungen , von ihren mit CD - Verkäufen erzielten Überschüssen einen Teil zurückzugeben .
Generell würden inzwischen 60 bis 70 Prozent der Inhalte im Netz von den Nutzern erstellt , zitierte der Verbraucherschützer aus aktuellen Studien mit Blick auf Weblogs oder Podcasting .
Auch Luc Soete , Wirtschaftswissenschaftler an der United Nations University of Maastricht , sprach von einer " kreativen Aktivierung " durch das Internet , dank der immer mehr " Amateure " enorme positive , im Prinzip nicht mehr " aufzubrauchende " Werte und Werke schaffen würden .
Historisch betrachtet wären schon immer " Kollaboration und altruistisches Verhalten " die wichtigsten Antriebsfaktoren wirtschaftlichen Handelns gewesen , weniger Tendenzen zur Kommerzialisierung der Lebenswelt .
Noch fehle es aber den Ökonomen an Maßstäben , um etwa den Wert der Erstellung von freier Software zu messen und ins erwirtschaftete Bruttosozialprodukt von Volkswirtschaften einzufügen .

Today the IFPI announced a new wave of lawsuits ( 2000 ) in Europe .
But how new is this wave ?
It seems like they keep suing the same people over and over again .
If you compare today 's press release with the one they put out last year you will see that in both cases they sued a " German judge " , a " British Councilor " and a " French Chef " .
What a coincidence !
Ok , I have to agree , it seems like the French chef got a promotion because last year he or she was just a cook .
Here are two fragments from both press releases .
April 12 , 2005
Those who are paying the price of piracy include a German judge , a French cook and a British local councilor .
April 4 , 2006
A wide variety of people are finding themselves on the receiving end of legal action and paying large financial penalties .
They include a Finnish carpenter , a British postman , a Czech IT manager , a German judge , a French chef , a British local councillor and a retired German couple .
Sure , I know that these “ lively ” examples are just a propaganda tool that is used to make us feel vulnerable .
But still , they could have been a little more creative .
Ok , I have to admit , the postman , carpenter and the retired couple are new , and very appealing .
They replaced last years nurse , truck driver and car salesman .
But I wonder why they sue the retired couple as “ a couple ” .
How does that work ?
Did they share a single windows account or what ?
Well , I think the bottom line is that the IFPI announced 2000 new lawsuits , so we all should be very scared .
Everybody is vulnerable , and the next person that ’s going to be sued could be YOU .
Senate moves to give Bush more power to wiretap Brian Beutler
Published : Tuesday August 29 , 2006 Print This Email
This A bill that expands President Bush 's ability to wiretap American phones and conduct other forms of domestic surveillance will likely appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee next Thursday , RAW STORY has learned .
The bill , which was written by judiciary chairman Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , and which has been widely and publicly excoriated by Democratic members of the committee , contains provisions such as the institution of program - wide warrants , and warrants that do not expire for a year that would weaken the strict limits that currently govern the FISA courts .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) was written nearly 20 years ago and offers guidelines about the legal use of wiretaps on phones inside the United States .
It includes provisions for the use of courts to issue warrants if the governments case against a suspect meets legal scrutiny .
The judiciary committee originally sought to bring the NSA wiretapping program into compliance with FISA , but in practice , critics claim , Specters FISA amendments actually give the president freedom to expand his wiretapping activities .
A statement released by the office of Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) states that Specters bill gives him even more power than he has asserted under his illegal NSA wiretapping program . 
A different bill , written by Senator Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) and cosponsored by Specter will also appear before the committee Thursday .
Its provisions would do more to limit the NSA program than Specters , and would even mandate that the program face judicial review .
But a Senate aide who works closely with Specter tells RAW STORY that ,  The White House said they would veto any bill that includes a provision for judicial review . 
 I cant say that the bills work hand in hand ,  an aide told RAW STORY adding that , though Specters bill does not make judicial review mandatory , it makes it optional .
Specters bill , written as a result of that threat , makes concessions to the White House that go beyond Feinsteins legislation , which itself represents a diminution of the 1978 FISA statutes .
FISA , for instance , allows 15 days of warrantless surveillance in the event of a declaration of war .
Senator Feinsteins bill extends that allowance to include the 15 days after a Congressional authorization of the use of force .
Senator Specters bill deletes the exception altogether .
 Basically , " one aide told RAW STORY , " the White House said ,  you can trust us , you have our word that we will submit the program for judicial review .
Just dont make it mandatory for us .
Senator Feinstein has come out against the new legislation , intimating that it would legalize the NSA program that was recently declared unconstitutional by a federal judge in Michigan .
If passed by Congress , Specter 's bill could potentially influence the outcome of White House appeals that may ultimately put the program before the Supreme Court .
In an op - ed cowritten with Senator Feingold in the San Francisco Chronicle , Senator Feinstein said , every time the Supreme Court has confronted a statute limiting the commander - in - chief 's authority , it has upheld the statute . "
Feinstein continued : " Congress explicitly banned wiretapping individuals in the United States without a court order , except in limited circumstances such as emergencies , when it passed FISA in 1978 .
That means the president 's power to wiretap Americans without a warrant would be viewed very skeptically by the Supreme Court .
If Congress were to pass Specter 's bill , however , the legal analysis would be much more deferential to the president .
By repealing the ban on wiretapping without a warrant Congress would help the president make his case .
Senator Specter , who unlike Senators Feingold and Feinstein does not sit on the Intelligence committee , and who therefore is privy to less information about the NSA program , had been critical of its apparent violation of FISA in the past .
When asked at a press conference recently if it was frustrating to now be in a position to write legislation for the courts without knowing the details of the wiretapping program , he responded ,  Is it frustrating ?
Yes , but I 'm used to that From the very start , I said , I do n't have to know what the program is , but the court has to know what the program is .
There has to be judicial review before you can wiretap .
That 's been the tradition . 
Patriotism is usually the refuge of the scoundrel .
He is the man who talks the loudest .
- Education and Citizenship speech , 5/14/1908
Patriot : the person who can holler the loudest without knowing what he is hollering about .
- More Maxims of Mark , Johnson , 1927
A man can be a Christian or a patriot , but he can't legally be a Christian and a patriot -- except in the usual way : one of the two with the mouth , the other with the heart .
The spirit of Christianity proclaims the brotherhood of the race and the meaning of that strong word has not been left to guesswork , but made tremendously definite -- the Christian must forgive his brother man all crimes he can imagine and commit , and all insults he can conceive and utter - forgive these injuries how many times ?
-- seventy times seven -- another way of saying there shall be no limit to this forgiveness .
That is the spirit and the law of Christianity .
Well -- Patriotism has its laws .
And it also is a perfectly definite one , there are not vaguenesses about it .
It commands that the brother over the border shall be sharply watched and brought to book every time he does us a hurt or offends us with an insult .
Word it as softly as you please , the spirit of patriotism is the spirit of the dog and wolf .
The moment there is a misunderstanding about a boundary line or a hamper of fish or some other squalid matter , see patriotism rise , and hear him split the universe with is war - whoop .
The spirit of patriotism being in its nature jealous and selfish , is just in man 's line , it comes natural to him -- he can live up to all its requirements to the letter ; but the spirit of Christianity is not in its entirety possible to him .
The prayers concealed in what I have been saying is , not that patriotism should cease and not that the talk about universal brotherhood should cease , but that the incongruous firm be dissolved and each limb of it be required to transact business by itself , for the future .

PORTRAITS BY TWO FLAGGS Charles Noel Flagg 's portrait of Clemens at age fifty - five .
Regarding this portrait , Mrs. Clemens complained only that the
necktie was crooked .
" But it 's always crooked , " said Flagg , " and I have a great fancy for the line it makes . "
She straightened it on Clemens himself , but it immediately became
crooked again .
Clemens said : " If you were to make that necktie straight people would say , ' Good
portrait , but there is something the matter with it .
I do n't know where
it is . " '
The tie was left unchanged .

We are constantly being told to avoid " artery clogging " saturated fats , found in delicious foods like butter , eggs , cheese , pork and beef .
It 's for our health , they say .
That 's a problem for me , since I have a chest freezer full of beef and pork that I raised .
I had steak ( grassfed ) and eggs ( free range ) for breakfast .
But I 'm not worried .
Most of you reading this have probably heard of the " French Paradox " , which is the idea that it is paradoxical that the French eat a very high fat diet yet suffer from very low levels of heart disease ( CHD ) .
Jefferey Steingarten claims to have been the first one to have popularized this idea .
But the French paradox is only a paradox if you believe that eating saturated fat plays a role in causing heart disease .
I do n't .
After the French paradox became widely known , researchers rushed out to explain why the French were so different from the rest of the world .
Maybe they were protected from heart disease by the red wine they drank .
Maybe it was the fruits and vegetables that they ate .
And on and on .
Apparently no one ever actually bothered to check whether or not France was an outlier , a statistical anomaly .
Until now .
I looked , and it is n't .
In fact , in Europe , the countries that eat the most fat from butter , cheese , pork and other animal sources have the lowest rates of heart disease .
France is simply the most dramatic example of this .
See for yourself :
How did I create this magical chart ?
Through tricky statistical manipulations ?
No , I 'm not a statistician and I 'm too lazy for that anyways .
All I did was go to the British Heart Foundation 's international statistics page , then got the FAO food disapearance data to see how much animal fat the people of each European country eat on average each day .
I popped the two lists of numbers into Excel and got a scatter plot .
You can easily replicate my little experiment given an hour or two .
The axis of paradox is composed of all European countries , whose dietary habits and health profiles stand in direct opposition to the idea that heart disease is primarily caused by the high consumption of saturated fat .
On average , the people of Eastern Europe eat about 50 grams of fat from animal sources per day while the men suffer from 435 deaths from heart disease per 100,000 people per year .
Their Western European contemporaries enjoy eating about 84 grams of animal fat per day while only losing about 170 men per 100,000 to heart disease each year .
If you 'd like , you may bash my little study on the grounds that it 's unscientific , but that 's loser talk .
If eating saturated fat is the primary cause of heart disease , how is it possible that French men have one NINTH the rate of heart disease mortality of Russians despite eating 125 % more fat from animal sources ?
How is it possible that the people of Uzbekistan have four and a half times the rate of heart disease mortality of the Swiss despite eating only one fourth the amount of animal fats ?
Are the Swiss doctors 18 times better ?
I do n't think so .
How is it possible that Belgians have less than a fifth the heart disease mortality of the Ukrainians despite eating twice the fat from animal sources .
I could go on , but you can see the chart and the following table - the table lists country , daily consumption of animal fat per capita , then heart disease death rate per 100,000 people among males aged 35 - 74 .
And just for the record , the US daily consumption of animal fats was 71.6 grams per in 2002 , and American men died of heart attacks at a rate of 230 people per 100,000 in 1999 , the last years available for both statistics .
You may notice that our animal fat consumption is exactly the same as Italy's , where they eat a " low - fat Mediterranean diet " yet our heart attack death rate is almost exactly double theirs .
Whoopsie !
And if you 're wondering , they eat slightly more total fat than us too , 158 grams to 157 .
Discussion and ConclusionsEven if you still want to cling idea that eating saturated fat causes heart disease , you have to admit that in Europe the consumption of saturated fat is AT BEST a secondary cause of heart disease .
A more direct conclusion would be that saturated fat does n't cause heart disease there .
Keep in mind that although correlation does not imply causation , a lack of correlation casts serious doubts onto causation .
Eastern Europeans suffer from far less heart disease than Western Europeans despite eating far less saturated fat .
There is not a single country in Europe in the top quartile of both saturated fat consumption and heart disease rates nor is there a country in the lowest quartile of both .
Conversely , France , Belgium , The Netherlands and Switzerland are in the top quartile of saturated fat consumption but in the lowest quartile of heart disease deaths .
Armenia , Georgia , Kazakstan , Krgyzstan , Russia , The Ukraine and Uzbekistan are in the lowest quartile of fat consumption but the highest quartile of heart disease .
You may think that it 's unfair to compare heart disease rates between Eastern and Western Europe due to different socioeconomic factors in the two areas , but actually that is exactly the point .
For too long , heart disease has been considered a " disease of affluence " .
Google it , you 'll see .
The idea is that as we become more affluent we get lazy and fat .
We can afford more luxury items like steak and cheese .
Then we die of heart attacks .
This graph shows that that theory is exactly wrong , methinks .
Furthermore , although there is no trend amongst Western European countries , among Eastern European countries there is a clear trend that the ones that eat the least animal fat have the most heart attacks .
There is no French Paradox .
France follows the general European trend of wealthy countries eating more animal products and having less heart disease .
If there is a paradox here , all of the European countries stand together , united and unyielding in the " Axis of Paradox " .

Subject : Ruby and Ocaml - my two favorite languages
From : " MikkelFJ " < mikkelfj - anti- spam@ g o c >
Date : Wed , 31 Jul 2002 09:57:27 +0900
While being away from Ruby land , I did investigate the OCaml language further .
I 've earlier posted some information on OCaml in this group when I was just starting to look at the OCaml language .
This is a follow up after I have gaining more experience .
I can now confidently say that Ruby and OCaml are at the absolute top of programming languages .
I 'm a bit annoyed with the fact the OCaml is in fact so good the it steals ground from Ruby .
Its a bit like a Japanese sportsmotorcycle compared to a European ditto with the nationalities reversed .
OCaml with static linking with C object files is better suited for large system applications than Ruby both becuase its faster and due to distribution of runtime as exe rather than clear source files .
What really surprised me was that OCaml actually competeded with Ruby in the discipline of rapid prototyping and still managed to produce better code than carefully developed C++ code requiring significantly more development time .
Still many bright things are happening for Ruby and I am certainly not going to dismiss Ruby .
I 'm looking forward to see Ruby increasingly involved in building the future Web both via integration with Apache and the support of Web Services where Google have been kind enough to be a Ruby front runner .
And this is possible the best recognition you can get , because I can't think of a greater application the Google .
Ruby on the other hand is class example in OO development , but what is really great OO or not , is that you can actually write modules of 2 K size that does meaningful things and plugs seamlessly into the development environment .
Ruby initially impressed me with huge number of highly functional but redicously small library implementations in native Ruby .
I spend hours searching for what the rest of the a database interface because it could n't possibly all be in those 2.5 K .
You can also write suprisingly short programs in OCaml , but overall there is more fuzz with getting the source file dependencies right in the makefile which also complicates integrating third party tools not in the standard distribution .
While Ruby is a language with one of the easiest FFI 's ( foreign function interface ) , it is actually easier in OCaml .
In fact it is so easy that provided you stick to certain datatypes , it can be almost be neglected whether you write a function in C or OCaml : Instead of writing a C prototype in a .h file , you write a similar line in OCaml and use it as if it was a native OCaml function .
Accesing OCaml in the C function requires a macro on the argument to get the desired C type , not unlike Ruby .
Callbacks the other way around is also quite managable although not as trivial .
I once looked at an enormously complex JNI interface , only to discover that this was the new greatly simplified JNI interface ... go figure .
The OCaml syntax is not the best I 've seen , so I tried to imagine all kinds of improvements .
However , once I got used to it , I still did n't quite fancy it , but I was hard pressed coming up with anything better that would be equally efficient .
OCaml is as terse as is possible without becoming entirely unreadable .
I think you could actually mix some of Ruby 's syntax with OCamls functional concepts and get an even greater language .
Must do so one day :-)
It appears that you actually write shorter programs in OCaml than in Ruby , however , you also maintain separate interface files for larger programs .
I wrote a Ruby hack to convert Yacc grammar file into a Visual Parse ditto .
This included lineparsing and grabbing a name , making it upper case and add a counter for each alternative of the rule .
Ruby is a natural for these tasks .
I started out doing a manual conversion , but halfway down realized it was actually worthwhile to write a Rubyscript just to complete the other half .
And it actually was faster to write the Ruby program than the manual conversion I did on the first half of the file .
Later I tried to write the same conversion in OCaml both to see how it would work out , and also because I could then have an executable that did not require Ruby to be installed .
I turned out to be equally easy to write the program in OCaml .
Result was possibly slightly shorter .
Execution time was irrelevant but instant in both cases .
The write code then run a test cycle was very fast in both languages .
OCaml has a toplevel interpreter that makes it possible to execute code much like Ruby - but it still needs to link libraries .
For that purpose OCaml has a program that generates a new toplevel interpreter linked with the libraries you specify .
Once a new toplevel with the necessary string library was created , the development phase compared to Ruby .
OCaml requires very frequent tests because it is strongly type checked .
Like Ruby you do not actually write the type because it can figure it out .
However , you do not want to write a bunch of code and then figure out what you did wrong with a host of infered types being something you cannot guess what is .
Upside is that with early test this works well and it did help me avoid some tricky bugs I made in the Ruby version .
The slightly disappointing side of this is , from a Ruby perspective , is that OCaml seems to be strong also in those areas where Ruby were supposed to be uniquely strong .
Still Ruby is the more natural , elegant and accessible language .
Ruby has embedded regular expressions which is something OCaml does not have directly but through a regex type .
Next version of OCaml will include a preprocessor extension that will directly inject regular expressions into the language core , without doing anything to the core language .
This change will also make it possible to create entire lexers directly in the language .
The OCaml preprocessor is far from trivial to work with , but you can do some amazing things with it .
While OCaml do have support for Objects and it does have some kind of polymorphism , this is clearly an area where Ruby is better off thanks to the dynamic typing .
The price in Ruby is that you need more runtype type checks - which is something you 'd have to remember to do in order to avoid runtime errors .
But in the end you have to cover all possibilities somehow in either language .
If I could I 'd use Ruby as a scripting language for application automation language and develop large applications in OCaml .
With these two tools , there is only low - level C programming left and little space left for C++ development .
I can positively say that for certain types of applications OCaml is 5 to 10 times faster to implement than C++ ( for an experienced C++ developer and inexperienced OCaml developer ) because I did prototype in OCaml and subsequently implemented in C ++.
I 've no reason to believe this is different for Ruby , except Ruby does n't link into executables which kind of disqualified it for the purpose .
Runtime wise I have no data , but I 'm sure the runtime is faster in OCaml than C++ due to reduced ability to retain strong typing in C++ without using rather complex template programming .
I believe Ruby runtime would not have been significantly slower for the same reason .
Ruby deals with dynamic typing and handles memory management .
Why is it so much faster to write code in Ruby or OCaml ?
Fewer steps from concept to implementation means less work resulting and fewer errors and faster results increases motivation to see yet more results rather than falling asleep over the debugger .
While I do envy the garbage collection of Java and C# , and possibly the libraries , I still consider C++ a much more powerfull language but also much more difficult and unnecessarily complex .
You can then extrapolite this with what what I wrote above .
Obviously a global standard such as Java is worth much , but the courage to go you own way has a value of its own .
I do not agree with all the Paul Graham writes , but after all it was in the NG I was introduced to his article Beating the Averages .
http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html
Which somehow makes me think of beating the top dog ... [ after writing the above , I found the following article at Grahams site for his new arc language :
http://www.paulgraham.com/vanlfsp.html it mentions OCaml as a langauge for smart people and Java for the masses - your free to add Ruby to LFSM ]
In conclusion : obviously there are many and many good languages around and you can't say a language is the best for all purposes .
But I 've been searching for a successor to C++ and came up with two languages worth further investigation .
So since you already know Ruby , I 'd recommend you also take a look at OCaml .
The very great and huge book developing applications with OCaml was recently published in a preview english translation online : http://www.ocaml.org/
http://caml.inria.fr/oreilly-book/
I feel it has been a long journey to find a new useful language , and I feel compelled to to repeat Doug Baglays editorial because I tend to agree .
Both Ruby and OCaml gets good mention http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/editorial.shtml
But while Ruby and OCaml may be my favorite languages , it is only because C for all its quirks has lifted itself out of the ordinary and become the atmosphere that makes programming possible .
Finally , Ruby cannot too soon get better closure integration as first class values and partial evaluation support .
This is an absolute killer feature of OCaml .
Most of what Ruby does great is thanks to its use of closures and most of what Ocaml does better is thanks to its improved use of closures .

Medical expenses are rising faster than the costs of any other service .
They are climbing at rates that exceed not only those of inflation and dollar depreciation but even the Federal government itself .
In fact , they are consuming an ever larger share of personal and national incomes .
Some 40 years ago American medical spending was estimated at 5 percent of national income ; today it is calculated at some 16.5 percent and rising continually .
Several reform proposals in Congress would boost the share ever higher .
Many observers offer lucid explanations of the medical - spending explosion .
Some are convinced that the present generation of Americans , which enjoys a level of income and living standard higher than that of its forebears , is more mindful of health and wholesome living and , therefore , is spending a larger share of income on health care .
But critics prefer to point to the ever growing number of Americans who are overweight or even obese , which may breed physical disorders and afflictions and finally acquire medical attention .
Other observers hold the endless stream of medical innovations responsible for rapidly rising health - care costs , such as new drugs and delicate tools for microsurgery .
They lay most of the expense explosion at the feet of technology .
But these writers never explain why new drugs and new tools should raise medical costs threefold and consume an ever larger share of national income .
Technical innovations usually lower the costs of production .
A few writers believe that the primary reason for rapidly rising costs of health care is a massive expansion of medical insurance which foots doctors and hospital bills .
They like to use an inordinate terminology that diverts the reader from the actual causes .
They broaden the concept of insurance to encompass Medicare and Medicaid , which are government programs providing medical care for the aged and needy , and then hint at insurance as the driving cost factor .
In reality , the number of Americans with health insurance actually is declining ; rising health - care costs and a declining number of employer - sponsored benefits are steadily reducing the number of insured Americans .
At the present , some 47 million Americans are bereft of any coverage .
Few observers dare to state that spiraling health - care costs are the inevitable consequence of a 1965 Social Security amendment molding Medicare and Medicaid .
It provided a basic welfare program that covers most persons aged 65 and older as well as all needy individuals .
Soon after its passage some four million patients rushed to seek treatment and some 18 million Americans registered to have 80 percent of doctor and surgeon bills paid by the new system .
By now , in 2006 , Medicare provides health benefits for 41 million elderly and disabled persons , and Medicaid , a joint federal - state program , serves some 50 million poor beneficiaries .
It is the fastest - growing item in most state budgets and accounts for some 20 percent of total state spending .
The program undoubtedly has saved lives as it has enabled elderly and poor people to receive medical treatment they were not able to afford on their own .
It has raised the quality of living for many .
But its sponsors completely ignore some undesirable consequences such as the soaring costs and the rising number of people who therefore choose to forego any health insurance coverage .
Surely , it has saved some lives but also may have cost some .
It has doubled , tripled , and quadrupled many phases of the health - care industry but also kept other service industries smaller than they would have been in a free service economy .
It has helped administrators of hospitals and extended - care facilities to embark upon substantial expansion and has stimulated development of many home - care services .
But there cannot be any doubt that the massive injection of political funds and the growing role of legislators and regulators have radically changed the very nature and structure of the health - care industry .
Medicare and Medicaid are political handiwork forged by legislators and regulators , fashioned by politicians who recast it in every national election .
It is a very popular political issue passed and argued about without ever being settled .
Politicians representing the beneficiaries are demanding ever more outlays , others speaking and acting for the people who are forced to cover the deficits are opposing the charges .
Facing ever rising costs , some want to reduce the cost - of living increases in benefits , others plan to increase the wage subject to payroll taxation .
In 2005 the benefit - politicians raised the maximum earnings subject to Social Security tax exactions to $ 90,000 with the tax rate at 12.4 percent , borne equally by employer and employee .
In 2006 they raised the maximum to $ 94,200 ; in coming years they will boost it to $ 100,000 and more .
Medicare and Medicaid stand in the center of attention in every national election as both parties may seek to outbid each other in promising more benefits .
In 2003 Congress was persuaded to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare , starting in 2006 .
Most of its costs , estimated at some $ 700 billion over the next 10 years , are to be paid by taxpayers .
But soaring costs are the least portentous consequences of the transformation of the health - care industry .
This academic observer is dismayed and disheartened by the role played by politics in such an important industry .
In a free and unhampered economy businessmen always seek to adjust their production to anticipated consumer demand ; the wishes and choices of consumers are paramount .
When government takes special interest in an industry , political judgments and motives take preference to the people 's choices .
When government on all its levels enters health care , the industry has to adjust to every dollar spent and every order given .
Surely , there are pains of readjustment but no particular economic crises .
People readily accommodate .
While they are not free to choose in the market place , they may plead and supplicate in the halls of politics .
Some courageous observers may even point to needless expenditures and waste as every health - care administrator may want to expand and improve his facilities .
After all , they no longer are limited by market orders but only by political considerations and favors .
Politics is likely to shape the future of medical care as far as the eye can see .
It builds upon popular political ideas , on old habits and predispositions , even resentment and envy .
It inflicts pain without end .
HOWTO Avoid Being Called a Bozo When Producing XML
“ There ’s just no nice way to say this :
Anyone who ca n’t make a syndication feed that ’s well - formed XML is an incompetent fool . ——
Maybe this is unkind and elitist of me , but I think that anyone who either ca n’t or wo n’t implement these measures is , as noted above , a bozo . ” – Tim Bray , co-editor of the XML 1.0 specification
There seem to be developers who think that well - formedness is awfully hard — if not impossible — to get right when producing XML programmatically and developers who can get it right and wonder why the others are so incompetent .
I assume no one wants to appear incompetent or to be called names .
Therefore , I hope the following list of dos and don’ts helps developers to move from the first group to the latter .
Note about the scope of this document :
This document focuses on the Unicode layer , the XML 1.0 layer and the Namespaces in XML layer .
Getting higher layers like XHTML and Atom right are outside the scope of this document .
Also , anything served as text / html is outside the scope of this document , alhough the methods described here can be applied to producing HTML .
In fact , doing so is even a good idea .
Contents
Do n’t think of XML as a text format
Even people who have used compilers and seen the error and warning messages seem to think that text formats can be written casually and the piece of software in the other end will be able to fix small errors like a human reader .
This is not the case with XML .
If the document is not well - formed , it is not XML and an XML processor has to cease normal processing upon finding a fatal error .
It helps if you think of XML as a binary format like PNG — only with the added bonus that you can use text tools to see what is in the file for debugging .
Do n’t use text - based templates
Text - based Web templating systems ( MovableType , WordPress , etc. ) and active page technologies that seem to allow you to embed program code in document skeleton ( ASP , PHP , JSP , Lasso , Net. Data , etc. ) are designed for tag soup .
They do n’t guarantee well - formed XML output .
They do n’t guarantee correct HTML output , either .
They seem to work with HTML , because text / html user agents are lenient and try to cope with broken HTML .
The most common mistakes involve not escaping markup - significant characters or escaping them twice .
Do n’t use these systems for producing XML .
Making mistakes with them is extremely easy and taking all cases into account is hard .
These systems have failed smart people who have actively tried to get things right .
Do n’t print
Using print ( or echo ) calls sprinkled all over your code to emit pieces of markup and literal text is error - prone as well .
Is the string you are printing markup or text that needs to be escaped ?
Have you printed multiple start tags at a time ?
Can you get the end tags right ?
When your program grows and is modified , these things become increasingly difficult to keep track of .
It is very easy to overlook something .
Indeed , it is very likely that something goes wrong .
Use an isolated serializer
Still , producing the markup characters and writing them as bytes into an output stream has to happen somewhere .
Putting all the code the writes to the output stream in a single class or compilation unit makes it possible to debug the escaping - sensitive code in one place .
The serializer should have SAX - like methods such as startElement ( nsUri , localname , attributes ) , endElement ( nsUri , localname ) , characters ( text ) , processing Instruction ( target , data ) , etc .
The methods always take unescaped strings and escape attribute values and character data .
With this approach , the notorious escaping problem just vanishes !
For Java , there is gnu.xml.util.XMLWriter and its subclass gnu.xml.pipeline .TextConsumer that plugs into the GNU JAXP SAX pipeline framework .
( A word of warning : The GNU JAXP XMLWriter does not work properly for all characters unless used with the UTF - 8 output encoding and with the XHTML mode turned off .
If you believe you need the XHTML mode — that is , the Appendix C mode — you may want to check out fi.karppinen.gnu.xml.util.XMLWriter and fi.karppinen.gnu.xml.pipeline.TextConsumer instead .
However , if you need the Appendix C mode , you are probably trying to serve XHTML as text / html .
Doing so is considered harmful , so what you really need is a serializer that produces HTML 4.01 from XHTML 1.0 SAX events . )
For Java , there is nu.validator.htmlparser.sax.XmlSerializer .
It does not support XHTML 1.0 Appendix C. If you want Appendix C support , you should probably send HTML5 as text / html instead , since serving XHTML as text / html is considered harmful .
For that , there is nu.validator.htmlparser.sax .HtmlSerializer .
For C , there is eg. GenX .
C programmers may also find the tools in libxml2 useful .
Use a tree or a stack ( or an XML parser )
Although the serializer API sketched above makes the escaping problem disappear , the application could still call startElement ( ) and endElement ( ) in a bad sequence and break well - formed nesting .
Since an XML document parses into a tree , traversing an analogous programmatically produced tree ( eg. DOM or XOM ) induces the right sequence of startElement ( ) and endElement ( ) calls .
It is worth noting that even though recursive tree traversal usually gets all the attention in algorithm and data structure text books , a tree with parent references can be traversed iteratively .
If you are serializing a tree data structure into an XML format that closely mirrors the in -memory structure , you can use the treeness of the data structure for ensuring well - formed nesting instead of first building a DOM or XOM ( or similar ) tree .
A tree may be an overkill , however .
To ensure proper nesting , a stack is sufficient .
A stack can keep track of the open elements without wasting space on parts of the document that have already been handled or have not been handled yet .
More importantly , the stack does not need to be explicit : the runtime stack can be used .
If startElement is always called at the beginning of a method and endElement is always called in the end , the runtime stack guarantees the nesting .
Code using the runtime stack for ensuring nesting would look like this :
void emitFoo( ) {
startElement ( NS_URI , " foo " ) ;
emitBar ( ) ;
if ( shouldEmitBaz ) {
emitBaz ( ) ;
}
endElement ( NS_URI , " foo " ) ;
}
Finally , one way of producing SAX events in a proper sequence may be obvious : a SAX parser emits SAX parse events in a proper sequence .
It may also be so obvious that it is easy to overlook .
The original way to get some SAX events is parsing an XML document at runtime .
But if you are producing XML dynamically , what good does it do to parse a static document ?
Well , boilerplate markup can be put in a static XML file and the interesting parts can be produced programmatically .
A SAX filter can look for interesting points in the XML document ( eg. a particular processing instruction or element ) and inject additional SAX events to the pipeline before returning to control to the parser .
The injection may involve parsing another document and injecting events from it into the same pipeline .
If the static XML data is trusted , it is possible to even name methods in processing instructions and use reflections to call back into the application based on the XML data .
Another approach to boilerplate markup is code generation in such a way that the parse events from an XML parser are recorded as generated program code that can play back the events efficiently without actually reading input at runtime .
My SaxCompiler takes this approach .
Since the events are recorded from an XML parser , they occur in a permissible sequence .
Do n’t try to manage namespace declarations manually
Namespaces in XML makes it possible for XML element and attribute names to be in a namespace .
Being in a namespace means being associated with an additional string symbol , which is required to be an URI alhough it is compared code point for code point .
The name of the XHTML element for paragraps is not just p .
It is the pair consisting of the XHTML namespace URI and p — that is ( http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml , p ) or in James Clark ’s notation { http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}p .
The URI is bound to the local name by using an intermediate syntactic abstraction .
The namespace can be declared as a default that affects unprefixed element name ( but not attribute names ) or it can be bound to a prefix .
The crucial point is that the prefix string itself can be chosen arbitrarily and carries no meaning .
Also , the declarations can appear earlier in the document tree and are scoped .
My aim in the above paragraps is to convey that the namespace mechanism is sufficiently complex to be dangerous to be left up to the casual programmer and application code .
Instead , the application programmer should use the URI –local name pair and leave the management of the namespace declarations and prefixes to a dedicated piece of code that someone has already debugged .
( Of course , it is OK for the programmer to suggest prefixes to make the output more readable . )
For the GNU JAXP framework , gnu.xml.pipeline.NSFilter is such a piece of code .
GenX , on the other hand , does this within the serializer component itself .
Use unescaped Unicode strings in memory
To keep the abstractions clear , the content strings in memory should be in the unescaped parsed form .
For example , if you have content that says two is greater than one the string in the memory should be “ 2 > 1 ” .
In particular , it should not be “ 2 > 1 ” .
“ 2 > 1 ” is what you mean .
Only when the string reaches the serializer , it is the responsibility on the serializer to write “ 2 > 1 ” in the output .
Passing along a chunk of markup is done either by passing a tree data structure ( eg. DOM fragment ) or by emitting multiple SAX events in sequence .
Moreover , the chances for mistakes are minimized when in - memory strings use the encoding of the built - in Unicode string type of the programming language if your language ( or framework ) has one .
For example , in Java you ’d use java.lang .
String and char[ ] and , therefore , UTF - 16 .
Python has the complication that the Unicode string type can be either UTF - 16 ( OS X , Jython ) or UTF - 32 ( Debian ) depending on how the interpreter was compiled .
With C it makes sense to choose one UTF and stick to it .
Use UTF - 8 ( or UTF - 16 ) for output
The XML 1.0 specification requires all XML processors to support the UTF - 8 and UTF - 16 encodings .
XML processors may support other encodings , but they are not required to .
It follows that using any encoding other than UTF - 8 or UTF - 16 is unsafe , because the XML processor used by the recipient might not support the encoding .
If you use an encoding other than UTF - 8 or UTF - 16 and communication fails , it is your fault .
Arguments about particular legacy encodings being common in a particular locale ( eg. Shift_JIS in Japan or ISO - 8859 - 1 in Western Europe ) are totally irrelevant here .
( The xml:lang attribute can be used for CJK disambiguation .
There is no need to use parochial encodings for that . )
From the XML point of view both UTF - 8 and UTF - 16 are equally right .
If your serializer only supports either one , just go with the one the serializer already supports .
UTF - 8 is more compact than UTF - 16 ( in terms of bytes ) for characters in the ASCII range .
Even if your content does not contain characters from the ASCII range frequently , the element and attribute names in well - known vocabularies as well the XML syntax itself consist of characters from the ASCII range .
UTF - 8 data is also easier to examine for debugging with byte / ASCII - oriented network sniffing and file examination tools .
UTF - 16 is more compact than UTF - 8 only when the number of characters from the U+0800 –U+FFFF range exceeds the number of characters from the ASCII range — and the latter includes markup whenever well - known XML vocabularies are used .
It might be tempting to try to optimize the size of the document by choosing the encoding depending on the content or the expected content .
However , doing so opens up more possibilities for bugs .
Even when the serializer offers a choice , it is safer to pick either UTF - 8 or UTF - 16 and stick to the choice regardless of content or deployment locale .
I am biased in favor of UTF - 8 .
Use NFC
In Unicode , common accented letters can be expressed in two different ways : as a single character or as a base character followed by combining character .
For example ‘ ä ’ can be represented as one character ( LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS ) or as two characters ( LATIN SMALL LETTER A followed by COMBINING DIAERESIS ) .
The former is known as the precomposed form and the latter as the decomposed form .
There are also presentation forms that are considered compatibility equivalents of other characters .
For example , LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI is a presentation form of LATIN SMALL LETTER F and LATIN SMALL LETTER I .
Unicode Normalization
Forms defines four normalization forms of Unicode that differ in their representation of characters that can be decomposed or that have compatibility equivalents .
Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0 : Normalization ( which is still a working draft ) specifies that the Normalization Form C ( NFC for short ) ought to be used on the Web .
There are a lot of transitional applications that treat Unicode as wide ISO - 8859 - 1 — like ISO - 8859 - 1 is wide ASCII .
These applications are able to deal with precomposed accented characters but not with the canonically equivalent NFD representations .
Thus , NFC is the safer choice if you want to maximize the probability that your text renders nicely .
Using NFC is not a well - formedness requirement — just a robustness bonus .
According to the XML spec , “ an XML processor MAY , but need not , make it possible for an application to retrieve the text of comments ” .
Since the receiving application is not guaranteed to see the comments , comments are not an appropriate place for data that you want to the recipient to process .
That a particular DTD does not allow embedded RDF metadata does not make comments an appropriate place for metadata .
Do n’t rely on external entities on the Web
It follows from the XML spec that external entities are inherently unsafe for Web documents , because non-validating XML processors are allowed not to process them and someone may be using a non-validating XML processor to parse the content you serve on the Web .
Therefore , it makes sense not to rely on external entities .
When you are not relying on them , why have them around at all ?
Anyone processing them would just waste time .
The straight - forward way is to produce doctypeless XML .
But what about validation ?
It turns out there is a better validation formalism than DTDs .
It is more interesting to know the answer to the question “ Does this document conform to these rules ? ” than to the question “ Does this document conform to the rules it declares itself ? ” RELAX NG validation answers the first question .
DTD validation of answers the second .
RELAX NG allows you to validate a document against a schema that is more expressive than a DTD without polluting the document with schema - specific syntax .
Do n’t bother with CDATA sections
XML provides two ways of escaping markup - significant characters : predefined entities and CDATA sections .
CDATA sections are only syntactic sugar .
The two alternative syntactic constructs have no semantic difference .
CDATA sections are convenient when you are editing XML manually and need to paste a large chunk of text that includes markup - significant characters ( eg. code samples ) .
However , when producing XML using a serializer , the serializer takes care of escaping automatically and trying to micromanage the choice of escaping method only opens up possibilities for bugs .
Do n’t bother with escaping non-ASCII
Since you are using UTF - 8 ( or UTF - 16 ) , the output encoding can represent the whole of Unicode directly .
There is no need to escape non-ASCII characters in any way .
Only < , > , & and ( in attribute values ) " need escaping .
That ’s it .
No entities needed .
No numeric character references needed .
If you insist on escaping non-ASCII , please make sure you handle astral characters correctly .
Avoid adding pretty - printing white space in character data
XML has a design problem that makes source formatting leak into parsed content .
Instead of reserving eg. literal tabs and line feeds exclusively for source formatting so that the parser could always discard them , XML allows white space to be both significant content and meaningless pretty - printing .
The mess is left for higher layers to sort out .
To avoid problems , it is prudent never to introduce pretty - printing white space in character data .
Personally , I do n’t pretty - print at all when I produce XML programmatically .
The safe way to pretty - print is to put the white space inside the tags themselves instead of putting it between them .
That is , if you have
< foo > bar </ foo >
instead of doing this
< foo >
bar
</ foo >
do this
< foo
> bar</ foo
>
Do n’t use text / xml
The XML specification provides a means for XML documents to declare their own character encoding .
This way , the encoding information travels with the document even in environments that ca n’t store or communicate the encoding information externally .
Unfortunately , the XML specification allows external encoding information to override the internal encoding information .
Considering Ruby ’s Postulate , it would probably be a better idea to count on the internal information just like you trust a ZIP file itself when it comes to figuring out which compression method has been used instead of letting an external HTTP header say which decompression method you should apply .
According to RFC 3023 , the text / xml content type never allows you to use the internal information .
Even in the absence of an explicit charset parameter , the default is US - ASCII trumping the XML spec .
( Of course , there ’s a lot of software that ignores the RFC , but that ’s not a good basis to build on . )
When the type application / xml is used without the charset parameter , the XML spec governs on the matter of character encoding .
For some vocabularies , there are types of the form application / *+xml , which also do n’t suffer from the counter - intuitive encoding default of text / xml .
Use XML 1.0
XML 1.0 is well supported .
XML 1.1 is not interoperable with XML 1.0 software .
XML 1.0 processors are required to reject XML 1.1 documents .
XML 1.1 adds the ability to use some previously forbidden control characters like the form feed while still forbidding U+0000 , so you still cannot zero - extend random binary data and smuggle it over XML as text .
XML 1.1 also allows you to use Khmer , Amharic , Ge ’ez , Thaana , Cherokee , and Burmese characters in element and attribute names .
Contrary to what XML 1.1 propaganda may lead people to believe , XML 1.0 already allows content in those languages .
Additionally , XML 1.1 changes the definition of white space to accommodate IBM mainframe text conventions .
Test with astral characters
Unicode was originally supposed to be 16 bits wide .
However , the original 16 bits running up to U+FFFF turned out to be insufficient .
Thus , Unicode was extended to extend up to U+10 FFFF .
The range of scalar values is considered to be partitioned into 17 planes with 16 bits worth of code points on each plane .
The characters in the range of the original 16 bits constitute the Basic Multilingual Plane ( or BMP or Plane 0 ) .
The range above U+FFFF consists of astral planes and the characters above U+FFFF are called astral characters .
The original way of simply storing a character as an unsigned 16 - bit integer was extended to cover the astral planes using surrogate pairs yielding the UTF - 16 encoding .
A range of values that fall in the BMP are set aside to be used as surrogates .
An astral character is represented as a surrogate pair : a high surrogate ( a 16 - bit code unit ) followed by a low surrogate ( another 16 - bit code unit ) .
Some programs operating on 16 - bit units may not pass surrogate pairs through intact even though one might think the surrogate pairs could be smuggled through legacy software as two adjacent “ characters ” .
Moreover , when UTF - 16 data is converted into UTF - 8 , the surrogate pair needs to be converted into the scalar value of the code point which is then converted into a 4 - byte UTF - 8 byte sequence .
Some broken converters may produce a 3 - byte sequence for each surrogate instead .
( This kind of broken UTF - 8 has been formalized as CESU - 8 . )
Because of these issues , it is a good idea to test that astral characters can travel through your system intact and that the output produced is proper UTF - 8 and not CESU - 8 .
Test with forbidden control characters
XML semi-arbitrarily forbids some ASCII control characters and Unicode values that are reserved to be used as sentinels ( eg. U+0000 and U+FFFF ) .
These characters render the document ill - formed .
Therefore , it is important to make sure they cannot occur in the output of your system .
It is a good idea to try to introduce these characters into the system and make sure that they are either caught right upon input or at least filtered out in the XML serializer .
Test with broken UTF -*
Whichever UTF you use in memory or for input , it is possible to construct illegal code unit sequences .
With UTF - 32 the scalar value may be outside the Unicode range .
With UTF - 16 there may be unpaired surrogates .
With UTF - 8 there may be overlong byte sequences , sequences that are not the shortest form for a given character or sequences whose scalar value fall in the surrogate range .
You should try throwing broken code unit sequences at your system and make sure that broken input can never silently translate into broken output .
Most importantly , if your input or memory UTF is the same as the output UTF , you should not merely copy code units into the output without checking them .
Usually checking is achieved as a side effect by using UTF - 8 for input and output and UTF - 16 in memory , so broken data is caught in the conversion .

Danny turned our makeup trailer into an oasis of order amid the chaos and oftentimes panic of the set .
Well before my tardy clomp up the trailer steps , he would arrange his station , make coffee , tune in National Public Radio and sometimes put out a plate of breakfast delicacies .
My shaving tools would be at the ready -- a Norelco razor , a stick of roll - on talc , a disposable blade for the tough whiskers .
And then , with a ritualistic slap of Sea Breeze on my face , I 'd declare , " Shave , where be thy sting ? " and off to work we'd go .
On both movies that were fun ( " Catch Me if You Can " ) and movies that were tough ( " Turner & Hooch " -- ridiculously tough ) , Danny juggled my mercurial attitudes and the condition of my skin , offering his ear for my complaints and altering my body chemistry when necessary with a new facial scrub , a homemade bran muffin or a glass of cabernet .
My makeup man and I worked around the world and at every studio in Hollywood .
With my face as his canvas , he turned me into a cop , an astronaut , an Army Ranger , an F.B.I. agent , a Master of the Universe , a Slavic tourist and even Santa Claus .
Through a freezing Chicago winter on " Road to Perdition , " he showed the violence of my character with a slightly broken nose and eyes framed by the harsh lines of my hat and mustache .
" Cast Away " was all Danny and the hair stylist Kathy Blondell .
As I lost weight to show four years of being marooned in the South Pacific , Danny created scars , sunburns , rashes , rotted teeth and seeping wounds .
Hours before sunrise on the set in a Fijian paradise , I nodded back to sleep as Danny and his crew fought fatigue and the clock , deconstructing me in a frenzy equal to a Nascar pit crew getting a car back onto the track .
On " Forrest Gump , " we worked a 27 - day stretch without a day off , grabbing shots in New Hampshire , Vermont and Maine before returning to South Carolina , all in one weekend .
That 's four states and three full - length beards in two days !
Danny took me from a teenager to a Vietnam soldier to parenthood as Sally Field died of cancer , earning him and his team one of Gump 's Academy Award nominations .
Perhaps because few voters realized the makeup was there , he went home empty - handed .

When I was last in Costa Rica , I was on the lookout , as usual , for interesting things .
And I found plenty of them : sloths , leaf cutter ants , poison dart frogs , volcanoes , and so on .
I was not , however , on the lookout for lawn ornaments , under the assumption that decorative stone sculptures were not particularly interesting .
I should have known better than to make such an assumption — after all , I saw Amélie , which cast an entirely new light on garden gnomes .
Shortly before the end of my trip , a fellow tourist asked me if I knew about the stone balls .
“ What stone balls ? ” I asked .
“ There are these mysterious ancient balls , ” he said , “ that are so perfectly round , they could not have been carved by hand .
Nobody knows where they came from or how they were made , but they ’re scattered all over the country , and people like to find them and use them as lawn ornaments . ”
Sure enough , as we drove along , I spotted stone balls in a few yards , but I did n’t have a chance to photograph one .
It seemed strange to me that artifacts with such obvious archeological significance would end up as the Costa Rican equivalent of plastic pink flamingos .
Rolling With the Bunches
The first discovery of the unusual stone balls was made around 1940 .
The United Fruit Company was preparing large tracts of land in the Diquis Delta on the southern Pacific coast to be used for banana plantations .
In the process of clearing the land , they unearthed several dozen balls , ranging in size from a few centimeters to over two meters in diameter .
Subsequent archeological research identified and catalogued hundreds of the balls , some of which appeared in other parts of the country .
As news of the find began to spread , the balls were rounded up ( sorry ) by collectors and treasure hunters ; today , only six are known to remain in their original positions .
No one knows exactly how old the balls are , because Costa Rica had no recorded history before 1502 , when Columbus arrived there on his fourth transatlantic voyage .
Archeologists have made educated guesses by dating pottery and other artifacts found near the balls or buried at a similar depth .
Assuming the balls were made at about the same time as the surrounding objects , they could have been carved anywhere between 200 and 1500 CE , with most estimates in the range of 800 to 1200 CE .
So they ’re old , but not that old — unlike , say , the pyramids or Stonehenge .
Most of the balls are made of a hard , volcanic stone called granodiorite , though a few are composed of coquina , a type of limestone .
The quarry from which the granodiorite came is located in the Talamanca mountain range , about 50 miles ( 80 km ) from the area where the balls were located .
This discovery of course led to speculation as to how such massive stones could have been moved such a long distance without modern transportation .
I see no mystery here ; spherical objects have been known to roll rather readily , especially downhill ; presumably they were carved before being moved .
There are , however , two very interesting questions about the balls :
How were they made , and why ?
Round , Round , Get Around
There ’s nothing particularly tricky about carving stone ; many ancient cultures all over the world made complex statues .
But according to some accounts , these spheres are so perfectly round that not even modern equipment could have produced something with such precise tolerances .
This seems to imply either a lost technology , or — as some have predictably conjectured — help from aliens .
These claims of perfection have some problems , however .
For one thing , few of the balls have actually been measured with any precision , and in some cases , measurements that appeared to be mysteriously perfect were made on only a portion of a partially buried ball .
For another thing , many of the balls have been subjected to centuries of wear and erosion from sunlight , wind , and rain , so no meaningful statements can be made about how round they might once have been .
And even the best specimens have ( and probably always had ) rough surfaces , making truly precise measurement a lost cause .
That said , it is certainly true that at least some of the balls , having been preserved nicely over the years by layers of soil , are surprisingly round .
This fact , interesting though it may be , does not require a belief in extraterrestrials .
Geologists have noted that when granodiorite is heated and then quickly cooled , a thin layer of stone comes off in flakes .
It ’s simple enough to pile some hot coals under a rock and then splash some cold water on it .
If this procedure is performed repeatedly and with care , a fair approximation of a sphere can result .
The stones could then have been chiseled or ground to a more perfect ball shape using simple guides fashioned from wood or even rope .
It would have been difficult and tedious , for sure , and would have required a fair amount of mathematical sophistication on the part of the carvers .
Thus the precision is interesting — perhaps even astonishing — but not unbelievable .
My , What Big… Ornaments You Have
The only real mystery , then — and it ’s a doozy — is why so many of these extraordinary sculptures were created .
Dozens of reasons have been advanced , but in the absence of written records , there ’s no way to say for sure .
One popular theory is that they were used as markers of some sort — as signposts , celestial references , or indicators of property lines .
Unfortunately , if this was indeed the case , we ’ll never know , since nearly all the stones have been moved from their original positions .
Some people believe the stones functioned as antennae in an ancient power grid , or that they were part of a receiver for alien communications .
Or they may have had ceremonial significance in religious rituals .
My favorite theory , however , is the one that says they were created as status symbols .
In other words , they were in fact designed to be the lawn ornaments they now are .
Besides the fact that most of the spheres have lost any positional meaning they may once have had , many have been damaged by agricultural machinery , worn away by the elements , or even destroyed by people who believed a popular myth that gold was hidden inside them .
So they are , in a sense , yet another addition to Costa Rica ’s endangered species list .

Hotspots are popping up all over the country
It is believed to be the first case of its kind in the UK , but with an estimated one million wi-fi users around the country , it is unlikely to be the last .
" There are a lot of implications and this could open the floodgates to many more such cases , " said Phil Cracknell , chief technology officer of security firm NetSurity .
Details in this particular case are sketchy , although it is known that Gregory Straszkiewicz had " piggybacked " on a wireless broadband network of a local Ealing resident , using a laptop while sitting in his car .
He had been seen in the area on several previous occasions over the past three months and is believed to have been reported to police by a neighbour concerned that he was acting suspiciously .
The case is some way away from that of Brian Salcedo , who was sentenced to nine years in a US jail last year for the far more serious crime of siphoning credit card numbers over the wireless network of hardware store Lowes .
Unauthorised access
The criminal aspect of the case of Salcedo is obvious and is clearly reflected in the sentence dished out .
Wireless networks at home give people freedom to move about
Not to Simon Janes , a former head of the Computer Crime Unit and now operations manager for computer forensics firm Ibas .
" Gaining unauthorised access to someone else 's network is an offence and people have to take responsibility for their actions .
Some people might argue that taking a joy - ride in someone else 's car is not an offence either , " he said .
Gaining unauthorised access to a computer is an offence covered by the Computer Misuse Act .
In Straszkiewcz 's case , he was prosecuted under the Communications Act and found guilty of dishonestly obtaining an electronic communications service .
" I guess , and it is a guess , that they could n't prove he accessed the actual computer and that is why they used another legal avenue , " said Mr Janes .
But whatever route the case took , the outcome proves that borrowing someone else 's network is not as harmless as the hobbyist wi-fi user might think .
Lax security
It is not just those people driving around in search of a " free " network who have to worry .
The perception among domestic users is that providing security is difficult and it does depend on the competence of the user
Simon Janes , Ibas
" There have been incidences where paedophiles deliberately leave their wireless networks open so that , if caught , they can say that is was n't them that used the network for illegal purposes , " said NetSurity 's Mr Cracknell .
Such a defence would hold little water as the person installing the network , be they a home user or a business , has ultimate responsibility for any criminal activity that takes place on that network , whether it be launching a hack attack or downloading illegal pornography .
Despite this , businesses and residential users continue to fail to take that responsibility seriously by securing their networks , said Mr Cracknell .
A joint survey by RSA Security and NetSurity , conducted in March of this year , found that more than a third of wireless networks in London and Frankfurt had the basic security features turned off .
Many had failed to turn on the encryption that scrambles the data traffic between users and the access point .
Freebie wi-fi
" The perception among domestic users is that providing security is difficult and it does depend on the competence of the user , " said Mr Janes .
Mr Cracknell called for an awareness campaign , similar to the one recently run on TV highlighting the threats of identity theft .
The perception in the past has been that borrowing a bit of bandwidth is cheeky but not really criminal behaviour .
With wi - fi operating at speeds of up to 20 times faster than broadband it is unlikely to slow the system down noticeably unless the borrower is downloading huge files and , unless the owner of the network has intrusion detection software , he or she is unlikely to notice the squatters .
The fact that Straszkiewicz narrowly escaped a harsher sentence , had to pay a £ 500 fine and had his laptop and wireless card confiscated indicates such squatting might not be worthwhile .
Detective Constable Stephone Rothwell from Ealing CID was involved in the case and said future cases would be treated in the same way .
" This case is the first of its type in the United Kingdom and it sets an example to people who use increased computer technology to try and avoid paying for the internet , " he said .
It could be that the days of freebie wi-fi are coming to an end .
They call him the the new Che Guevara .
Loved and loathed in equal measure , Venezuela 's President Hugo Chávez has become the poster boy of the international left , revered by his disciples at home but reviled in Washington .
On the eve of Chavez 's visit to Britain , foreign affairs editor Peter Beaumont travels to Caracas and asks if the Castro - loving , Bush - hating , head of state is a revolutionary democrat or a dictator in the making ?
It is Sunday , and in Venezuela it 's time to watch President Hugo Chávez 's television programme .
This week he has taken his media roadshow to the town of El Tigre , where Aló Presidente is being broadcast from one of the cost - price supermarkets - known as Mercals - that he has set up to provide cheap food for the poor .
As always , the show 's main interest , its star , is the President himself .
In a red shirt worn over a red T - shirt , Chávez leaves his anchor 's table and strides through the store .
He picks goods off the shelf and reads aloud from the packets , which are printed with extracts from his constitution , and offers a little homily on each .
He is accompanied by a wilting and sweating Daniel Ortega , the former Nicaraguan President and Sandinista leader , who looks on baffled as Chávez maintains a breathless commentary on the micro-management of his ' Bolívarian revolution ' by way of the food basket .
' I should n't say I hope you win , because they will accuse me of sticking my nose into Nicaraguan internal affairs , ' Chávez jokes with Ortega at one point .
' But I hope you win ! '
However , it is not Nicaragua 's elections in November Chávez has on his mind but Venezuela 's presidential elections the following month .
For that reason , he is showing off the quality of food he is providing for the poor , who he can reasonably expect to keep him in power .
' Mmm ... smell that , ' says the President , opening a bottle of ketchup .
' Mmmm ! '
Ortega affirms when the bottle is shoved under his nose .
A packet of coffee is presented next .
' We should put on the packet that it is 100 per cent Venezuelan , ' says Chávez .
' We are going to keep increasing production every year .
First for national consumption , then we are going to do something else .
Maybe start exporting .
Dunno where ...'
The whirlwind of words continues .
Chávez talks to checkout staff .
He puts his hand on a woman's arm as she explains that she has just completed her high school degree in one of the special schools Chávez has set up .
' In July , 30,000 people are going to graduate , ' Chávez tells her .
' Then you are going to go to a college of further education .
Then you 'll study nursing ...'
He greets and kisses other staff before returning to where he started , at his desk .
But there is another side to this touchy - feely President , friend of Venezuela 's poor .
That is the international revolutionary fi ebrand who talks about the ' coming war with the US ' for which he has warned his people to prepare ; the friend of Cuba 's Fidel Castro ; and the figure at the apex of the rapid left - wing swing of South America .
This is the man described by US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as ' Hitler ' and by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as the ' most dangerous in the region ' - a role that Chávez has gleefully and aggressively played up to , in turn calling Bush ' Mr Danger ' and occasionally ' asshole ' .
( On Rice , Chávez has suggested ' her problem ' is sexual frustration . )
The ability of Chávez to prick the US has been made possible not by a large and modern army , or weapons of mass destruction , or support for terror , but by the simple fact of America 's large dependence on Venezuelan oil in the middle of an oil crisis .
Chávez , a visceral opponent of the influence of America in a Latin America that , like his 19th - century predecessor Simón Bolívar , he would like to lead , has found his dangerous global stage .
As self - appointed champion against ' the murderer '
Bush , he has acted as ringmaster to those who loathe America 's First Man : film stars , musicians , unionists , statesmen and writers .
Later this month he arrives in London where he will be entertained by Mayor Ken Livingstone , a long - time Chávez supporter who has accused the US of trying to undermine democracy in Venezuela .
Chávez has constructed alliances with everyone the White House hates most - including the Iranian President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and Evo Morales , the left - wing Bolivian President and former coca farmers ' leader .
And Chávez has included Morales in his ' axis of good ' with Castro in his struggle with the US .
In doing so , Chávez has plugged himself into a series of key international issues that have given him an influence way beyond Venezuela 's normal status in world aff airs .
On issues as diverse as the anti-globalisation movement , Latin America 's future political shape , oil , Iran , and even America 's relationships with India and China , Chávez is there stirring it up .
At home , the people will tell you that all you need to know about the Presidente is on display in Aló Presidente .
There he is : enthusiastic , verbose and sometimes staccato - the Castro of an era brought up on soap operas and reality TV .
He grazes on ideas as they occur to him .
Sometimes they run into the sand .
He encourages and fires officials .
He sketches the line of planned roads and jokes about his sex life .
There are lengthy denunciations of the evils of capitalism and the US .
He relates anecdotes from his life appropriate to the day 's message .
Sometimes he sings in a not unpleasant voice .
But what keeps Venezuela 's media and political classes glued to The Voice for hours on end is the knowledge that Chávez governs his country via his show .
If it has not happened on Aló Presidente on Sunday , Venezuelans think , it has not really happened .
I start watching Aló Presidente near the ugly concrete centre of the capital , Caracas , in a fast food restaurant smelling of criollo , the national dish .
One customer stands staring at Chávez on the overhead T V screen .
Later he says proudly : ' That 's my President , that is . '
I recognise the same look later , when I watch more of the show in an apartment in a slum barrio .
It is the expression worn by many of those poor and ordinary Venezuelans invited on to Chávez 's show and it borders on adoration .
It is also a look of deep familiarity .
He may be President , the faces say , but he 's also one of us .
On average , Chávez 's voice is present in their lives for 40 hours a week in speeches , proclamations and media events , including Aló Presidente .
His critics , largely in the middle class - led opposition , have wondered when he finds time to be President .
The chavistas ( Chávez 's supporters ) call his opponents escualidos - ' squalid-ones ' , after their efforts to depose him .
They tried once with a farcical coup that lasted two days in 2002 and was defeated by street power when his supporters among the poor demanded to speak to Chávez : to hear from him that he had really ' resigned ' .
The escualidos tried again by way of the constitution , trying to force early elections with a recall referendum - a gambit that also failed .
Chávez 's supporters have no doubts about how he spends his time .
They are the main beneficiaries of his misiones , the multi-billion dollar programmes that have provided the Mercals and schools and universities for the poor , financial benefi ts and healthcare at the hands of 17,000 guest Cuban doctors housed in the poorest areas .
It is a support that verges on religious devotion .
I hear , but cannot confirm , that there are some who pray to images of Chávez .
And nowhere is that devotion more strongly felt than in the Caracas barrio of 23 de Enero ( 23 January ) where Chávez himself votes .
This is a place of decrepit tower blocks and box housesthat hang precariously from the slopes of the hills surrounding the city .
It is not just the danger of landslide that makes this a risky place .
One housing block is known as the Seven Men and is home to the barrio's most dangerous gangsters .
Across the barrio , huge colourful murals depict Chávez fl anked by the two key figures in the mythology of his revolution : Che Guevara and Simón Bolívar , the 19th - century Venezuelan ' liberator ' of South America from Spanish colonial rule .
It is to this slum that revolutionary tourists from around the world are taken by the chavistas to see Hugo 's good works .
For Chávez , like Ortega and the Sandinistas in the 1980s , has become a totem for the international left .
They come to study for a few months at the ' Bolívarian '
University , live in the barrios or volunteer for one of his projects before going home as apostles of his revolution .
Many visitors are led first into the presence of Lisandro Perez , better known by his nom de guerre of ' Mao ' , the chief of the municipality .
' Mao 's ' office sums up the postmodern complexities of Chávez 's idea of ' 21st - century socialism ' .
The former high school teacher and left - wing guerrilla 's walls are decorated with pictures of Chairman Mao , Che and Bolívar .
There is a poster of Chávez too along with religious statuary and a wanted poster from ' Mao 's days on the run .
Perez , 47 , tells me he has been a rebel since the age of 12 , imprisoned five times and tortured while in jail .
As we talk , he reaches across to a tape recorder .
I anticipate a revolutionary song , perhaps sung by Chávez .
Instead it is the Beatles singing ' With a Little Help from My Friends ' .
Chávez 's Bolívarian revolution , as retold by ' Mao ' , is a mishmash of contradictory ideas .
Perez says : ' Christ was the first and greatest communist , ' that multiparty politics have had their day , but that the revolution is also democratic .
If the opposition won in December 's presidential elections the chavistas would respect that victory .
He claims that the movement does not want to export its revolution to other countries in Latin America and then concludes by saying that it does .
' In the phase that we are in , Hugo Chávez is very important because he has dared to set the agenda . ...
Chávez is the absolute leader because in his role he has permitted the process to go forward .
Political parties need to be abolished .
We need mass organisations .
People should direct the government .
That 's why Chávez says , " You the people should govern . " '
But the truth , as everybody knows , is that Chávez governs almost alone through a politics of improvisation .
Venezuelans see it weekly on TV .
Teodoro Petkoff , editor of the Tal Cual newspaper and putative presidential candidate , describes Chávez ( in an introduction to Hugo Chávez sin Uniforme , a biography published last year ) as a latterday Zelig - forever changing and forever interposing himself in each scene in history .
Other Chávez watchers suggest a different model : that of Argentina 's great populist , Juan Perón , and his wife Evita .
The authors of Hugo Chávez sin Uniforme - Cristina Marcano and Alberto Barrera Tyszka - cite the President 's own psychiatrist , who credited Chávez with a ' narcissistic personality ' .
While both Marcano and Barrera Tyszka are critics of Chávez , they believe he should be given credit for putting poverty on the agenda .
I meet the authors , who are husband and wife , in a cafe in Los Palos Grandes , not far from the huge square with its obelisk , typically the scene of opposition rallies .
It is the polar opposite to the blocks and narrow alleyways of the barrios .
Here air - conditioned restaurants serve chilled wine to ladies who lunch and busy young executives and lawyers .
Though middle - class themselves , Marcano and Barrera Tyszka place themselves in the rare , and little populated , centre of Venezuela 's polarised political life .
' I think most of the time he simply looks and behaves in the way he wants to be perceived , ' says Marcano .
' When Chávez is meeting businessmen he dresses like a businessman .
If he goes to meet the poor he wears his red shirt open at the neck .
He wants to be loved . '
But not loved by everyone of course .
' He has always had the necessity of an enemy both external and internal , ' says Marcano .
' It is an old trick of his .
He calls Bush a murderer and gets the attention of the world and captivates the left . '
' How can you be a big hero , ' interjects Barrera Tyszka , ' in the mould of Bolívar or Guevara , without an enemy ? '
Marcano believes , moreover , that beyond the theatrics there is a real Chávez who remains as yet unseen and untested .
' I have always said that we will get to knowthe real Chávez only when he stops being popular ...
What will he do then ?'
That is the big question .
His bellicose rhetoric in opposition to the US has seen an increase from 10 per cent to 30 per cent of Venezuelans who believe the US will eventually invade .
And fear is useful .
Citing the US threat , Chávez is militarising Venezuelan society , raising a new territorial guard , which can be seen assiduously training in Venezuela 's public spaces .
What does Chávez 's revolution stand for ?
Is it Marxist or religious in its inspiration ?
Does it represent a new economics , as he insists , or is it dependent on the old capitalism he claims to despise ?
Then there is Chávez himself .
Is he democratic or authoritarian ?
Above all , where does the rhetoric of his struggle with the US , with its threats , its risky alliances and ominous warnings of invasions and 1,000 - year resistance wars , begin and end ?
Above all , what is real , and what theatrical performance ?
Certainly his left - wing credentials are not in doubt .
Born in 1953 of mixed Amerindian , African and Spanish descent ( his parents were schoolteachers in Sabineta ) , Chávez came from the group to whom he now appeals : the poor .
As a boy he was sent to live with his grandmother , but it was the army - which he joined at 17 - that moulded him , giving him the education that would otherwise have been unavailable .
And it was as a young officer that Chávez first developed his ideas about ' Bolívarianism ' that later were forged into his Revolutionary Bolívarian Movement - 200 .
It was founded on a combination of the romantic ideals of South America 's anti-colonial struggles and a strong sense of social justice .
It found its expression amid the economic stagnation and collapse of party politics in the late 1980s , culminating in a failed neo-liberal experiment that made Venezuela 's poor more impoverished .
The scene was set , in 1992 , for an attempted coup by Chávez and his supporters in the military .
It ran into the ground when the unit commanded by Chávez failed to seize the initiative in the capital .
To avoid further bloodshed , the captured Chávez was put on TV .
What happened next was to launch his career as a popular leader .
The handsome and media - friendly young officer asked his soldiers to stand down , famously telling the country that he had failed ' por ahora ' - for now .
And , as Chávez the failed golpista was jailed , Chávez the democrat was born .
The two characters have never been reconciled .
As a democrat , Chávez has won election after election largely fair and square since his first campaign in 1998 .
Thereare few egregious human rights abuses , little serious repression and , despite a new media law , Venezuela enjoys a lively and usually critical press .
If the middle class - led opposition has failed to remove him democratically it is not because of widespread skulduggery ; it is because its movement is fragmented and represents , for all its claims to the contrary , a minority .
But there is another prism through which Chávez 's democratic credentials look more dubious .
On top of his leadership of the failed coup , and his relationships with left - wing revolutionary guerrillas , there is the fact that in his seven years in power he has consolidated personal control over all of Venezuela 's institutions .
The army answers to Chávez , as does the central bank , the treasury and the state oil - company PDVSA , which provides the vast bulk of Venezuela 's revenue as the world 's fifth - largest oil exporter .
In 2002 , when many members of the 19,000 - strong company joined a lock - out strike in support of calling early elections to oust him , he fired them all , replacing them with chavistas .
He has packed the judiciary with his supporters and rewritten the constitution to suit his ends .
Most worryingly , he has talked about finessing the constitution to enable him to stay in office until 2030 .
And it is not just because of his political inclinations that Chávez appears to be being pulled in contrary directions - between the authoritarianism of the classic South American caudillo ( strongman ) and democrat .
His personality too appears to be elusive and , say observers , deeply unpredictable .
For a dictator in the making , as his opponents claim he is , he may have the rhetoric and perhaps some of the inclinations of a caudillo , but his record in confrontation has been more mixed .
When Chávez began reallocating land from major landowners to the poor , whom he had encouraged to squat , it looked like the end for Venezuela 's major estates - the latifundios - including the British - owned Vesty .
But Chávez stopped short .
For now the policy is one of negotiation , allowing the big businesses to keep some land in exchange for giving up a little .
Then there was the confrontation with the middle classes , which resulted in the names of anyone who had signed a petition for a referendum demanding Chávez 's recall ( popularly known as la lista ) being published by a prominent Chávez supporter .
This so - called ' Tascón list ' was subsequently used to deny signatories government jobs and contracts .
It looked like an old - fashioned purge .
On the steep , grassy banks of the busy autopista linking Caracas and the coast , I meet a victim of the Tascón list at an opposition demonstration .
They are a strange group , mostly older and welldressed professionals and well - to - do Caracas housewives , some of them in Tshirts proclaiming their allegiance to the ' National Commando of the Resistance ' .
It is not a formation , you imagine , that scares Chávez .
Among them is Rodello Gonzales Martinez , 55 , a former commercial pilot who had signed la lista in 2003 - 04 .
' When I went to reapply for my licence and medical , nothing happened for a long time .
I did n't get a reply , ' he says .
' When I finally went to the Ministry of Transportation in person the girl asked for my ID .
She typed in my name and said : " You 're on the list " and ripped up my application in front of my face . '
It is a familiar story , although whether it is as widespread as the opposition claims is impossible to tell .
Again Chávez backed down , publicly calling on his supporters to stop using the list to punish escualidos - one of a series of measures to court the middle classes .
Most telling , there is evidence that , despite his tough language with the US , and a flurry of ' deals ' to sell his oil elsewhere , he has done little to restructure Venezuela 's oil business and steer it away from the convenient flow of America 's billions that are paying for his revolution .
It is contradictory , like so much in the Bolívarian Revolution .
Yet Alberto Garrido , one of Venezuela 's most respected political analysts , believes it is possible to reconcile the two Chávezes .
' Chávez has threatened to blow up his own oil installations in the event of an American invasion .
You can consider it rhetoric , but it is not really that .
He is intent on destroying imperialism .
By that he means the " empire of the US " .
His discourse does n't include Europe .
It is very localised .
But while the reality is Latin America 's independence from US influence , the reality is changeable .
Chávez is tactically pragmatic , but strategically obsessive .
Since he is pragmatic , he will continue selling oil to the US and resist pressure from more radical sectors of his movement to stop .
' What needs to be understood is that his main interest is geopolitical .
Everything that can be seen as ambiguous needs to be recognised as the fact he is leading a transitional phase .
He will allow the US to keep paying for his oil to strengthen his project .
His project - he has said it himself - will be 20 - 30 years in the making . '
It is the message that is visible on children 's singlets being sold by a street vendor at a chavista rally .
Beneath screenprinted images of Chávez 's face the legend reads : 2030 .
But what you realise , walking with these young people through Caracas 's dirty streets behind lorries blasting out music and bands of drummers , is that , for all the contradictions of his revolution , Chávez has harnessed the energy of the impoverished majority .
The noisy good humour of the thousands who march , the dynamism , is in stark contrast to a rival rally called by the opposition .
The chavistas march and sing and fill the capital 's streets , the middle classes opt to lie down and play dead .
It is hot and humid in Caracas : the rainy season has yet to come .
It is a national holiday and so those who can afford it have driven to the beaches .
The alternative is the Magic Mountain , an amusement park in the foothills of the Andes , a cable car ride above the capital .
It is not cheap , so most of those queuing for the ride up above the forested slopes are middle class .
They stroll along paths above a plunging valley filled with the weekend villas of the wealthy .
Inside its alpine - themed restaurant , Juan Garcia , an electrical engineer , is eating a picnic with his two children .
' We like to come when it 's cool , ' says Juan , 43 , a fierce opponent of Chávez .
' I am completely against him .
He is pushing our country into something that it 's not .
The social struggle that he talks about among Venezuela 's classes - before he came it did not exist .
He has strengthened the hate between the poor and the rich .
He gives the impression that if they follow him they can all wear white clothes and drive nice cars .
Unfortunately I do n't think that it is going to stop .
Once the idea has been sold there is no end to it . '
Not everyone on the Magic Mountain agrees .
Vanessa Aular , a student and a single mother , has taken her four - yearold son Antoine Escobar up the cable car for a treat .
An admirer of Chávez , Vanessa was sent to Cuba on a government scheme to train as a social worker .
' Where I have really benefited , ' she says , 'is with my son .
He needed to have his tonsils out , which would have been difficult for us before Chávez .
Our neighbours have got housing benefi t for the first time and a neighbour is going to Cuba for an eye operation . '
Chávez 's popularity is not , as the fragmenting opposition desperately hopes , built on a fake premise .
What Venezuela 's underclasses recognise is that he is no forgery .
They see it in his dark skin , his poor background and in his manners .
His aspirations are also theirs : the poor boy who joined the army in the hope of becoming a baseball star , who instead got himself the kind of education he is now offering to them .
He is the child from the shack who rose to the stuccoed grandeur of the Miraflores Palace .
This resonates with his core constituency .
For the poor , who have benefited from his seven years in power , democracy means social inclusion - not who controls the institutions that in Venezuela have often been either weak or hopelessly corrupt .
At present that social inclusion means Chávez 's misiones , which like the Mercals alleviate poverty , offering free and widespread healthcare , provided by 17,000 Cuban doctors , access to education , housing titles , land ownership and cheap start - up loans for businesses .
It is on these schemes - paid for by the oil receipts of the past two years - that Chávez 's popularity is based .
And it is not just in Venezuela .
Chávez spends his billions elsewhere in the region .
He buys debt from neighbouring countries , funds projects , supports parties in the left 's new rise to power in Latin America .
It is this that is the real source of friction with the US - that a revolutionary regime , with deep pockets filled with its own dollars , is undermining US policy , not least in fronting the resistance to the creation of the neo-liberal Free Trade Area of the Americas .
Chávez 's message , as in the barrios , is social justice .
But is that social justice policy working ?
I went to the barrio of Petare , without the presence of chavista minders , where people were more free to talk , to try to find out .
It is a place not much different from the 23 de Enero barrio - though it lacks the high - rises .
The hairdressing salon where Miriam Josefina Mejillas , 34 , works is open to the street .
She shops in the local Mercal and gets free medical treatment for her family from the Cuban doctors .
She is defensive about criticism of Chávez , although she recognises the country 's deep and lasting problems .
Mostly , however , she is grateful .
' I do n't think everything in this country is his fault .
He is a human being just like us .
There are lots of crises but they are not his fault .
There are all these people who say because of Chávez they do n't have work .
But there are people around him who are traitors to him . '
It is a familiar refrain among Chávez ' sleast well - off supporters .
If there are faults with the Bolívarian Revolution , they say , it is only because the President is surrounded by bad advisers and is not hearing about their problems .
If he knew , they argue , he would intervene .
There may be some truth in this .
In a movement largely suspicious of the technocrats and political classes who once ran the country , there is a shortage of expertise .
' Chávez has said in his own words that the three enemies of his revolution are corruption , inefficiency and bureaucracy , ' says Alberto Garrido .
' He also criticises nepotism .
The management of this state is absolutely terrible .
He trusts a small group of allies unconditionally .
' Chávez is still in the " charismatic phase " where he is above good and bad for his people and he has cleverly separated himself from the image of inefficiency and corruption of his government .
But that can not be eternal .
If he does not quickly succeed in restructuring the country 's problems , people will start losing hope in him .
That is his black spot .
If he does n't stop that mismanagement it will stop him . '
While Chávez has undertaken a remarkable intervention on the level of primary assistance , many even among those who support him are concerned that , if and when oil prices drop from their record levels , there will be little left to see of his revolution .
One day the Cuban doctors , who have transformed primary healthcare , will go home .
While Chávez has been busy educating a few thousand Venezuelan doctors , all his billions of oil money have not rebuilt the decrepit hospitals .
The Mercals are dependent on oil largesse and there is evidence that the importing of cheaper food is undermining the fragile farming and agriculture sectors .
While the Bolívarian schools and universities have transformed the literacy of the poor , the biggest problem is highlighted by their adult graduates .
Few new jobs have been created by the revolution , which has done little to diversify the economy .
The chavistas say that this is missing the point .
Chávez 's vision is not about outdated Western political and economic models ; it is about creating revolutionary ' fusion ' and breaking new ground .
In Latin America , at least , his example is influential most notably with Bolivia 's Evo Morales .
Just last week Morales nationalised his gas industry , sending in troops to secure production and telling foreign companies to leave if they did not comply .
Amid all the threats of economic meltdown and utopian promises , it is Lopez Maya who seems to present the most honest assessment of the likely prospects .
' Venezuela has a lot of money because of oil , ' she says .
' But in two years the prospects could be very different .
It is very difficult to assess the performance of the government .
In the past , when the oil price has dropped the defects of our government strategy have emerged .
Now the question is : is Chávez doing a good job or is it just the same again ? '

Bacteria are developing resistance to current drugs
The researchers , from the drug company Merck , isolated platensimycin from a sample of South African soil .
If the compound passes clinical trials it will become only the third entirely new antibiotic developed in the last four decades .
Details in the journal Nature reveal the antibiotic works in a completely different way to all others .
We very much need new drugs in the pipeline as soon as we can
Professor Tony Maxwell
Most classes of antibiotic were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s , and work by blocking synthesis of the cell wall , DNA and proteins within bacteria .
Most of today 's antibiotics are simply tweaks of this basic format .
The fact that they work in similar ways may be one reason why bacteria are proving so adept at developing resistance .
Thus a new class of antibiotics with a different method of action could represent a major breakthrough .
Natural extracts
The researchers hit upon platensimycin during a project in which they screened 250,000 natural product extracts for their antibiotic potential .
It is produced by a strain of the bacteria Streptomyces platensis .
In lab tests , the antibiotic cleared mice of infection with a form of bacteria related to MRSA and did not appear to cause toxic side effects .
Further testing showed activity against a variety of drug - resistant organisms , including MRSA .
Professor Tony Maxwell , who is carrying out similar work at the John Innes Centre ( JIC ) at Colney in Norfolk , UK , said : " This sounds very promising .
" A number of big pharmaceutical firms have pulled out of antibiotic drug discovery .
" With MRSA cases increasing , and the number of new drugs on the market decreasing , we very much need new drugs in the pipeline as soon as we can . "
Alan Johnson , an expert at the Health Protection Agency , said : " There is an increasing problem with antibiotic resistance .
" The Agency welcomes the news that a new antibiotic has been identified that could help to treat infections , particularly those caused by organisms such as MRSA which are resistant to many currently available drugs .
" It should be stressed , however , that the drug is at a very early stage of development and it may be several years before it could be used to treat humans . "
Secret codes enbedded into pages printed by some colour laser printers pose a risk to personal privacy , according to the Electronic Frontier Fundation .
The US privacy group warns the approach - ostensibly only designed to identify counterfeiters - has become a tool for government surveillance , unchecked by laws to prevent abuse .
" In the current political climate , it 's not hard to imagine the government using the ability to determine who may have printed what document for purposes other than identifying counterfeiters , " the EFF said .
The ACLU recently issued a report revealing that the FBI has amassed more than 1,100 pages of documents on the organization since 2001 , as well as documents concerning other non-violent groups , including Greenpeace and United for Peace and Justice .
EFF notes that only the privacy policy of your printer manufacturers - rather than any legislative controls - stop the Secret Service from using printer codes to secretly trace the origin of non-currency documents .
" No law regulates what sort of documents the Secret Service or any other domestic or foreign government agency is permitted to request for identification , not to mention how such a forensics tool could be developed and implemented in printers in the first place .
With no laws on the books , there 's nothing to stop the privacy violations this technology enables , " the EFF warns .
All this sounds like the stuff of black helicopter conspiracy theory but the EFF wants to flesh out its preliminary research by gathering information about what printers are revealing and how .
It 's asking consumers to get involved by sending in test sheets from colour laser printers .
In addition to documenting what printers are revealing , the EFF is filing a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request over the issue .
These research efforts are a necessary precursor to any legal challenge from the EFF and ammunition for possible lobbying on legislation to protect consumer privacy . ®

Even though Diamond , Country Value and Professional brand dog foods have been recalled for containing highly toxic aflatoxins , they have caused at least 100 dog deaths in recent weeks , say Cornell University veterinarians , who are growing increasingly alarmed .
Some kennels and consumers around the nation and possibly in more than two dozen other countries remain unaware of the tainted food , and as a result , they continue to give dogs food containing a lethal toxin .
To better screen affected dogs so they can be treated as soon as possible , Cornell veterinarians report that they now have a new test , adapted from one used in humans , to accurately assess aflatoxin poisoning in dogs ( see companion story ) .
Currently , about two - thirds of dogs that show symptoms after eating the tainted food die .
" Entire kennels have been wiped out , and because of the holiday these past few weeks , the dispersal of recall information was disrupted , " says Sharon Center , a professor of veterinary medicine who specializes in liver function and disease at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell , which is emerging as a central clearinghouse for information about the dog food poisoning .
The Cornell Vet College is continually updating its Web site ( http://www.vet.cornell.edu ) to keep the public and veterinarians informed as new information on the poisonings emerge .
Cornell 's Animal Health Diagnostic Center ( AHDC ) is analyzing blood and liver samples from sick dogs around the country , testing suspected dog food , conducting autopsies and collecting as many livers as possible from dead dogs to confirm cause of death , tracking dogs that have died and following up on the health of dogs that survive the food poisoning .
The AHDC has information for veterinarians on its Web site http://diaglab.vet.cornell.edu/news.asp.
" We suspect that dogs have been dying since November , perhaps even October , but it took the perfect storm of circumstances to get the diagnosis , " said Karyn Bischoff , the veterinary toxicologist at Cornell who first identified aflatoxin as the culprit in the recent wave of deaths .
Trying to save dogs
Over the recent holiday weeks , Center and her staff worked around - the - clock to try to save the 17 poisoned dogs admitted to Cornell 's Hospital for Animals .
" I 've been working with liver disease in dogs for 30 years , and I 've never seen such miserably ill dogs , " said Center , noting that severely affected dogs suffer from intractable vomiting and internal bleeding .
" Despite our understanding of this complex toxin , we have no direct antidote for this poisoning .
This has been an immensely sad holiday and one that will leave an indelible mark on the owners that lost their cherished family members . "
Of those 17 dogs , Center euthanized 12 when it became clear they could not survive ; five are still being treated .
Dogs that have survived had consumed a smaller amount of the food than dogs that died , Center said .
" Some dogs were stealing food from the kitchen counter .
Others just stopped eating the food and begged for treats .
Unfortunately , some owners used gravy and other mixers to entice their dogs to consume what they thought was safe , quality dog food . "
" It 's devastating to dog owners who feel responsible for poisoning their beloved dogs , " said Bischoff .
Although only about two dozen animal deaths have been officially linked to the tainted pet food , Center and Bischoff know that many more have died or become ill from the tainted food , based on their many communications with veterinarians as far south as Georgia .
" Every day , we 're hearing reports from veterinarians in the East and Southeast who have treated dogs that have died from liver damage this past month or so , " said Center .
" We 're also concerned about the long - term health of dogs that survive as well as dogs that have eaten the tainted food but show no clinical signs . "
She suspects that surviving dogs may develop chronic liver disease , perhaps liver cancer , and that many dogs that ate the tainted food appear healthy are nevertheless victims of liver damage .
Yet many dog and kennel owners remain unaware that some 19 brands of Diamond , Country Value and Professional dog foods have been recalled .
" About half of our clients bringing in sick dogs this past week say that they were not aware of the contaminated dog food problem , " said Sara Sanders , one of the veterinarians at Mendon Valley Animal Hospital near Rochester -- the sort of ground zero for the epidemic that resulted in the recall .
She first realized that several dogs she was treating for liver problems in December were all eating Diamond food , and she sent food and tissue samples to Cornell , her alma mater , for testing .
Screening ill dogs
Early signs that a dog has been poisoned by afltoxin include lethargy , loss of appetite and vomiting and , later , orange - colored urine and jaundice ( a yellowing of the eyes , gums and nonpigmented skin that reflects substantial liver injury ) .
Severely affected dogs produce a blood - tinged vomit and bloody or blackened stools .
" Since dogs can take several days to three weeks to exhibit serious signs of illness , all animals that consumed recalled lots of food should be examined by a veterinarian as early as possible , " Center said .
" Physical exams and blood tests are necessary to differentiate dogs that have been poisoned from those that have not .
Unfortunately , the latent onset of signs may require that an individual dog be evaluated several times . "
Cornell veterinarians have verified diagnostic tests enabling detection of seriously poisoned dogs .
Aflatoxin curtails the production of cholesterol and many proteins that profoundly affect blood clotting .
A minimum screening profile should assess the liver enzyme ALT to detect damage to the liver , serum cholesterol , total bilirubin concentration and the activity of the anticoagulant proteins antithrombin III ( ATIII ) and protein C .
The coagulation protein tests , which have been adapted for dogs by Cornell researchers , have high value in detecting affected dogs but require collection of a special blood sample ( citrated plasma sample ) and an assessment by Cornell 's Animal Health Diagnostic Center .
Any dog suspected of aflatoxin poisoning should also have a liver specimen sent to Cornell to definitively confirm the pathologic changes in the liver unique for aflatoxin toxicity , such as fatty degeneration of individual cells .
" Even if dogs show no signs of illness , if they have eaten the affected food , they should have blood tests submitted to detect liver injury , " Center stressed .
" Dogs that show positive results on any of the above tests should be prescribed liver protectants for two months . "
For more details , veterinarians should check the Cornell Vet College Web site .
Owners also should take cats that might have eaten contaminated dog food to a vet .
Two cats that may have eaten the tainted dog food have died , but no cause of death was determined .

The title comes from this excellent article from MyWestTexas , Valero trading room grapples with ' Feeding the Beast ' ( reprinted from the San Antonio Express News ) :
And today we learn that the US consumption beast is not the only thing Valero is feeding .
DoD awards Valero contract to ship jet fuel to Israel How 's Valero doing ?
Let 's talk briefly about how this refining and retail company does business under the current oil and gasoline market conditions .
Of the 3.3 / mbd of crude oil processed , about 65 % is bought under long term contracts .
The remaining 35 % is bought on the spot market .
Valero buys 25 % of its oil domestically .
The rest is purchased from countries all over the world including Mexico , Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Kuwait , Venezuela , Ecuador and several nations in Africa .
At any given time , Valero has about 200 million barrels of price exposure , so " risk management is very important " .
Also , about 40 % of the crude they buy is from " politically unstable nations " .
So , they must keep abreast of geopolitical events .
No doubt this has an impact on the risk management .
, so " risk management is very important " .
Also , about 40 % of the crude they buy is from " politically unstable nations " .
So , they must keep abreast of geopolitical events .
No doubt this has an impact on the risk management .
The 3.3 million barrels Valero buys and processes each day represents almost 4 % of world production .
Meanwhile for upstream producers and refiners [ like Valero ] , these high prices have presented a different kind of dilemma in hedging terms ; whether to [ 1 ] sell such apparently high prices in forward markets whilst they are available , and which may not be able to be achieved indefinitely , or [ 2 ] to adjust their expectations to a ' new paradigm ' of permanently high oil prices .
The condition and capacity of global refining and pipeline infrastructure may have to wait for funds released by collateral sales of forward energy before the necessary refinements and capacity can be undertaken and thus have any effect in adjusting supply better to continuing high demand .
Then there 's the sell side .
Valero 's plants churn out more than 1.4 million barrels of gasoline a day and about 1.1 million gallons of products called distillates that include diesel and jet fuel .
A significant amount of the product is sold on the spot market , [ executive vice president of marketing and supply ]
Gorder said .
At Valero Energy Corp , they areabout the future .
For a summary of their business , Wikipedia has an informative article here .
It 's the MyWestTexas piece that has the good stuff in it .
Presumably , Valero has no price exposure for oil bought under long term contracts while prices rise ( see below ) -- only for the 35 % spent on the volatile spot market where the price for August ( CLQ06 .NYM ) is $ 76.14 as of this writing .
I do n't know how Valero calculates its price exposure but counting both contracts and the spot market , that 's an astonishing 60.6 days of supply amounting to 15.23 billion dollars .
How do they hedge that risk ?
I do n't know because those kind of details are not available .
Buying gold is always a good idea given the geopolitical tensions .
But some considerations are offered by Platts in Oil Price Risk Management
If the importer sells high prices ( for oil or refined products like gasoline ) as a hedge , they think that prices are abnormally high and will come down .
But Valero isoil in the forward markets ; I believe they have adopted strategy # 2 in which there is a " new paradigm " of permanently high oil prices and demand remains strong .
Common sense tells us that spot purchases leave Valero exposed to price variations .
For example , they must manage the risk of a price spike due to an oil shock because they must keep sufficiently high margins to continue upstream purchases in such an event .
In this case , the sudden spike is a detrimental price development .
On the other hand , forward purchases ( contracts ) for oil leave Valero protected against ( whatever the cause ) but leave them exposed to detrimental .
This strategy is reflected in their robust 2006 1st quarter earnings report ( see below ) and is in concert with the oil futures markets , which are in contango .
As for their refined products , MyWestTexas saysSelling a significant amount of your product on the spot market is consistent with a strategy that views high gasoline prices as here to stay .
I would be remiss if I did n't mention the distinct possibility that should the Israeli conflicts with Hezbollah and Hamas escalate into a war involving Syria and Iran , there might be a spike sending oil prices over $ 100 / barrel or the spike could be weaker .
This in turn could dampen demand sharply even in the near term and reduce oil prices .
I do not know how Valero is hedging against this possibility or if they are .
The atmosphere may be tense on Valero 's trading - room floor right about now .
No one really knows how high prices must go before Americans cut their consumption significantly .
In any case , to hurt Valero prices would have to drop somewhere below today 's levels .
This kind of price swing appears unlikely .
The volatility will depend on the demand elasticity among other things .
My view , and it could very well be Valero 's as well , is that US transportation fuel demand has little elasticity .
People who have some slack will forego other discretionary spending before they cut back on their vehicle miles traveled .
Not the Cable TV though !
Using the forward purchase contracts is paying off for Valero as we see from this 1st quarter summary -- Valero Energy Corporation Reports First Quarter Earnings .
" The second quarter is off to an outstanding start .
Gulf Coast gasoline and diesel margins are at record levels for April .
The forward curve is showing these record margins continuing through the summer .
Sour crude oil discounts also remain terrific with the heavy Maya crude oil discount averaging more than $ 14 per barrel for April and medium sour crude oils , such as Mars , averaging more than $ 6 per barrel discount .
Given that 60 percent of our feedstocks are purchased at [ forward ] discounts to benchmark sweet crude oil prices , these discounts play a significant role in our earnings .
With our leverage to these outstanding product margins and sour crude oil discounts , the second quarter is shaping up to be the highest earnings quarter in Valero 's history .
" Looking at refining fundamentals for the rest of the year , we feel very confident that the refining environment will remain strong .
The combination of growing refined product demand , despite higher price levels globally , and regulatory pressures on supply should support continued strength in refined product margins .
Sour crude oil discounts should continue to be wide due to ample supplies of sour grades and higher demand for sweet crudes as refiners try to meet lower sulfur specifications and increase yields of high - value clean products , " [ Valero CEO Bill ]
Klesse said .
Regarding the company 's cash flow , capital spending for the first quarter was approximately $ 975 million , of which $ 200 million was for turnaround expenditures .
For the year , the company anticipates capital spending of approximately $ 3.5 billion .
In addition , the company paid off $ 221 million of long - term debt and purchased 10.7 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter .
The discrepancy between 60 % and 65 % as quoted above may be significant but I do n't know the reason for it .
I 'm not sure what " regulatory pressures on supply " means in this context .
Regarding paying off debt and repurchasing their common stock , I need only point out that Valero is bullish on Valero .
The point is simply this .
Despite some volatility , prices continue to go up .
US demand remains strong in the face of rising prices and heavy sour crude discounts are large .
As Klesse says above , that is an economic environment in which Valero thrives .
Since prices continue to rise and costs are passed on immediately , " gasoline and diesel margins are at record levels " as of April and forecast to stay strong all summer .
Moreover , sour and medium sour discounts continue to be strong .
Why ?
Because there is a glut ( from MSN Money ) of heavy sour crude on the market .
This makes perfect sense .
Here 's the crux of the problem for gasoline consumers and oil companies :
There 's just not enough light sweet crude to meet demand .
And , while there 's plenty of heavy sour crude , a barrel of heavy sour crude yields about a third less gasoline than does a barrel of sweet light crude .
That 's if you can refine it to begin with ...
How big a glut ?
A big , big one , judging by the price of light sweet and heavy sour crude .
At the end of June , Nigerian Bonny Light , one of most sought - after grades of light sweet crude , was selling on the spot market for $ 71.65 a barrel , while Saudi Arabian Heavy sold for $ 58.70 a barrel , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
That 's a spread of almost $ 13 a barrel , way above the $ 5 a barrel historical average for the spread between light sweet and heavy sour grades .
Refineries that can turn heavy sour crude into gasoline are n't evenly distributed around the world .
Europe and the United States have more than their share .
About 60 % of the crude refined in 2005 by Valero Energy ( VLO , news , msgs ) , for example , was heavy sour crude .
Among those who have announced expansions are Valero , adding an additional 400,000 barrels per day , and Chevron and ExxonMobil , each adding 75,000 barrels per day .
Suncor , Motiva , and Citgo also have expansion plans .
This represents a profit opportunity for Valero since they can handle the heavy sour crude refining whereas some foreign refiners can not .
The MSN Money analyst Jim Jubak lists Valero as his top stock pick , noting that " Valero swallowed Premcor , another specialist in refining heavy sour crude , in 2005 to become the leading heavy sour - oil pure play " .
Refining on Wall Street ?
Valero 's current profits and rosy outlook is also consistent with investment in new capacity -- see Refinery bottleneck to ease ( from the CS Monitor ) in which we learn thatSo , Valero continues to feed the beast and light sweet crude production has peaked for the time being , probably forever .
Prices are volatile but continue to go up .
American gasoline demand has not slackened much -- it is still growing .

Selling jet fuel to Israel can't hurt prices any .
Valero is prospering and bullish on future oil prices because the beast is never satiated .
One of Bush 's top aides says he did not break the law
Under a 2002 presidential order , the National Security Agency has been monitoring international communications of hundreds in the US , the paper says .
Before , the NSA had typically limited US surveillance to foreign embassies .
Questioned about the report , Condoleezza Rice said Mr Bush had never ordered anyone to do anything illegal .
But some NSA officials familiar with the operation have questioned whether the surveillance of calls and e-mails has crossed constitutional limits on legal searches , according to the Times .
American law usually requires a secret court , known as a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , to give permission before intelligence officers can conduct surveillance on US soil .
When asked about the programme on US TV , the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said : " The president acted lawfully in every step that he has taken " .
" He takes absolutely seriously his constitutional responsibility both to defend Americans and to do it within the law , " she said .
She declined to discuss details of the New York Times report .
' Sea change '
The newspaper said nearly a dozen current and former administration officials discussed the programme with reporters .
It 's almost a mainstay of this country that the NSA only does foreign searches
Unnamed ex-senior official
They were granted anonymity because of the classified nature of the scheme .
Under the programme , the NSA has eavesdropped on as many as 500 people inside the US at any given time in its search for evidence of terrorist activity , the paper said .
Overseas , 5,000 to 7,000 people suspected of terrorist ties are monitored at one time .
" This is really a sea change , " a former senior official who specialises in national security law told the paper .
" It 's almost a mainstay of this country that the NSA only does foreign searches . "
The New York Times said it delayed publishing the information on the move for a year , in response to White House concerns it could jeopardise investigations .
Some officials said the programme had helped to uncover several terror plots , including one by an Ohio lorry driver who was jailed in 2003 for supporting al - Qaeda and targeting a New York bridge for sabotage .
' Above the law '
Officials cited by the paper said the Bush administration saw the scheme as necessary to disclose terror threats .
However , the paper reported that questions about the legality of the scheme led the Bush administration to suspend it temporarily last year and impose new restrictions .
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) said eavesdropping in the US without a court order and without complying with the procedures of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was " both illegal and unconstitutional " .
" The administration is claiming extraordinary presidential powers at the expense of civil liberties and is putting the president above the law , " director Caroline Fredrickson said .
The group called on Congress to investigate the report .
The Bush administration has faced opposition over some anti-terrorism initiatives in the past , such as the Patriot Act , which is up for renewal by Congress .
The law grants government agencies extraordinary powers to spy on and prosecute those suspected of terrorism .
Opponents say many of its provisions infringe civil liberties .

WINOGRAD'S SHRDLU
Reference Cognitive Psychology 3 No 1 1972 Academic Press 1972
Winograd 's program for understanding natural language .
INTRODUCTION
It is not a simulation but it uses important ideas about human syntactic semantic and problem solving activities and about their interactions in understanding natural language discourse .
The system answers questions executes commands and accepts information in an interactive English dialogue .
Understanding of English requires an integrated study of syntax semantics and inference .
Winograd felt that the best way to experiment with complex models of language was to write a program which can actually understand language within some domain .
In this case with a robot which has a hand and eye and the ability to manipulate toy blocks .
The program attempts
1 to be a useable language understanding system
2 to gain a better understanding of what language is and how to put it together
3 to understand what intelligence is and how it can be put into computers .
A comparatively recent commendation of SHRDLU .
SHRDLU is head and shoulders above contempoary systems when it comes to intelligent conversation .
Although its domain of discourse is restricted to a tabletop world of coloured objects SHRDLU really understands this world in terms of the relation between semantics and the physical properties of the blocks and the tabletop .
It consists of subsystems that parse interpret and construct sentences carry out dictionary searches and semantic analyses and makes logical deductions .
Conversational systems such as SHRDLU undoubtedly herald the future the advantages of a computer that is able to discuss problems intelligently with humans rather than passively accepting programs to solve the problems are too obvious to miss .
Computer scientists in artificial intelligence work in part to this goal .
The system uses Halliday 's systemic grammar which emphasises the limited and highly structured choices made in producing syntactic structure abstracting the features that are important for conveying meaning .
The parser is special and interprets the recognition grammars .
Meaning is covered by the development of a formalism for concepts within a language user 's model of the world representing objects events and relationships .
Semantics is represented by a system which is developed to work in conjunction with the parser a dictionary and the problem solving programs .
It considers not only meaning but context .
1 MONITOR is a small LISP program which calls the other parts of the system .
2 INPUT is a LISP program which accepts typed English input looks up words in the dictionary performs morphemic analysisand returns a string of words with their definitions .
This is the string upon which the grammar works .
3 The GRAMMAR is the main coordinator of the understanding process it is written in PROGRAMMAR .
The routines are then translated into LISP .
4. SEMANTICS is a collection of LISP programs which work witrh GRAMMAR to interpret sentences .
Each basic unit of grammar has many programs asociated with it .
5 ANSWER is a collection of LISP programs that control the responses of the system and it also remembers conversation for future discussion .
It uses heuristics to produce the best English in its answers .
6 PROGRAMMAR is a parsing system which interprets the grammars written in terms of programs .
It is written in LISP and builds a parse tree and has mechanisms for manipulating and exploring the tree .
7 The dictionary consists of two parts the first part holds the syntactic features of each word .
The semantic features of each word are held in the second part and are interpreted by the SEMANTICS program .
There are facilities for irregular forms and the definitions are held in a property list .
8 SEMANTIC features are also held in a property list and used in semantic analysis .
9 BLOCKS is a collection of PLANNER theorems which handle the dynamics of the building blocks on the tabletop .
10 MOVER is a set of display routines which simulate robot's world on the DEC340 graphic display attached to the PDP - 10
11 PLANNER is the deductive system used to direct the parsing process and to deduce facts in the BLOCKS world .
STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM
Click here for Picture
SAMPLE DIALOGUE
start at figure 3
1 pick up a red block
OK
in order to pick up the red block it had to find a space to place the gren one on top .
2 grasp the pyramid
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHICH PYRAMID YOU MEAN
there are three pyramids so nothing is done
3 find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it in the box
BY " IT " I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE BLOCK WHICH IS TALLER THAN THE ONE I AM HOLDING OK
the system interprets one and it and puts down the red block and picks up the taller blue block reach figure 4
4 what does the box contain ?
THE BLUE PYRAMID AND THE BLUE BLOCK
5 what is the pyramid supported by ?
THE BOX
earlier the system did not know which pyramid now it assumes the one in the box
6 how many blocks are not in the box ?
FOUR OF THEM
7 is at least one of them narrower than the one which I told you to pick up ?
YES THE RED CUBE
the phrases " at least one of " and " the one which " refer back to previous questions and the form of noun groups ie the syntactic structure helps here .
8 is it supported ?
YES BY THE TABLE
passive
9 can the table pick up blocks ?
NO
the semantic rules make this silly thus false
10 can a pyramid be supported by a block ?
YES
the deductive system can find an example of this occurring
11 can a pyramid support a pyramid ?
I DON'T KNOW
the deductive system cannot find an example
12 stack up two pyramids
I CAN'T
the system tries and fails
13 the blue pyramid is mine
I UNDERSTAND
14 I own blocks which are not red but I do n't own anything which supports a pyramid
I UNDERSTAND
15 do I own the box ?
NO
the box supports a pyramid
16 do I own anything in the box ?
YES TWO THINGS THE BLUE PYRAMID AND THE BLUE BLOCK
17 will you please stack up both of the red blocks and either a green cube or a pyramid ?
OK
it places the green block on the big red block removes the green pyramid and then puts the red block on the top see figure 5
18 which cube is sitting on the table ?
THE LARGE GREEN ONE WHICH SUPPORTS THE RED PYRAMID
this helps to distinguish the correct cube
19 is there a large block behind a pyramid ?
YES THREE OF THEM A LARGE RED ONE A LARGE GREEN CUBE AND THE BLUE ONE
20 put a small one onto the green cube which supports a pyramid
OK
a small one means a small block
21 put the littlest pyramid on top of it
OK
littlest must be interpreted from its root
22 how many things are on top of green cubes
I 'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY " ON TOP OF " IN THE PHRASE
" ON TOP OF GREEN CUBES "
DO YOU MEAN
1 DIRECTLY ON THE SURFACE
2 ANYWHERE ON TOP OF ?
2
THREE OF THEM
where there is ambiguity questions involving paraphrases are developed using heuristics
23 had you touched any pyramid before you put the green one on the little cube ?
YES THE GREEN ONE
the system needs to find the correct event which involves the tenses of verb groups
24 when did you pick it up ?
WHILE I WAS STACKING UP THE RED CUBE A LARGE RED BLOCK AND A LARGE GREEN CUBE
the time consists of the goal
25 why ?
TO GET RID OF IT
26 why did you do that ?
TO CLEAN OFF THE RED CUBE
the answer involves considering the subgoals in the tree
27 why did you clear off that cube ?
TO PUT IT ON A LARGE GREEN CUBE
28 why did you do that ?
TO STACK UP THE RED CUBE A LARGE RED BLOCK AND A LARGE GREEN CUBE
29 why did you do that ?
BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME TO DO IT

SYNTAX
SYNTAX and MEANING
The decision to consider syntax as a proper study devoid of semantics is a basic tenet of many recent linguistic theories .
Language is viewed as a way of organising strings of abstract symbols and competence is explained in terms of symbol manipulating rules .
Although these methods have been remarkably successful in one sense they have almost completely lost the semantics .
The problem is not that current theories are finding wrong answers to the questions they ask it is that they are asking the wrong questions .
What is needed is an approach which can deal meaningfully with the question
" how is language organised to convey meaning ? " rather than
" how are syntactic structures viewed in isolation ? "
Syntax helps the speaker convey meaning beyond the meaning of words .
The sentence is a series of syntactic structures chosen by the speaker to encode meaning .
The listener must detect these structures to interpret the meaning of the sentence .
The system is based upon Halliday 's grammar which places greater emphasis on the way language is structured .
It deals with word groupings rather than deep structures .
Systemic grammar pays more attention to the way language is organised into units each of which has a special role in cinveying meaning
.
In English we can distinguish three basic ranks of units
the CLAUSE ,
the GROUP and
the WORD .
There are several types of GROUP
NOUN GROUPS NG
VERB GROUPS VG
PREPOSITION GROUPS PREPG
ADJECTIVE GROUPS ADJG
Consider the analysis of the sentence
the three big red dogs ate a raw juicy steak
which is parsed using systemic grammar as shown on the next page .
The WORD is the basic building block and any particular word has features so dogs is seen as plural , the word ate is eat in a different tense .
Click here for Picture
The next unit above a WORD is a GROUP and there are four types .
Each group has a particular function in conveying meaning NG describe objects VG can convey messages about time .
Each group can have variable numbers of slots for the words .
NG allows number determiners adjectives and nouns .
Each group exhibits features such as definite - the- plural modal - could have been seen - .
The CLAUSE can be a QUESTION or a DECLARATIVE or an IMPERATIVE .
It can be active or passive .
The above parse tree has a three level structure where the CLAUSE is split up into three GROUPS and each of the GROUPS is split into individual WORDS .
As not all sentences have this structure we encounter the concept of a rankshift where a group can occur at a different level , for example , the man who came to dinner , or , by leaving the coutntry .
The rankshift is one of the principles of the systemic grammar .
The next question to tackle is why does the rankshift provide an advantage over the deep structure and the answer lies in the features that each unit can have .
We can sat that all sentences can be a QUESTION or a DECLARATIVE or an IMPERATIVE and that if they are questions then they can be subdivided into YES_NO or WH types .
This last choice is meaningless if the sentence is not a question but if it is then the distinction must be made .
If the CLAUSE is a sentence or a MAJOR clause then it must be partitioned into one of the permissable types but this distinction is not appropriate for a secondary clause SEC .
We can depict these structures as follows on the next page .
Click here for Picture
The work of relating the set of features of an actual sentence to the surface structure is done in systemic grammar by realisation rules .
If we consider sentences in different forms
Sally saw the squirrel
did Sally see the squirrel ?
the squirrel was seen by Sally
In transformational grammars these forms would be equivalent but the word orders would be achieved by means of transformations .
In systemic grammar the features would be noted and these would have a good overlap except for active | passive declarative | question .
The realisation rules would then signal the exact word order .
PARSING
The parsing for this program is achieved by using the language PROGRAMMAR and an interpreter .
It is basically a top - down left - to right parser but it can modify this technique if it sees fit .
Chomsky said that the grammar should associate a structural description to each permissable sentance in the language and this parsing program does that .
We can set up special tools to handle complexities such as ' and , or ' and these cause interrupts in the parsing process .
Interrupts are also caused by idioms .
The parsing process can be interrupted at any time and semantivc considerations can be introduced .
When we see the sentence
he gave the boy plants to water .
we do not confuse it with
he gave the house plants to charity .
The phrase boy plants is not meaningful like boy scouts so we reject any structure based upon this concept .
This ability to integrate semantics with syntax is particularly important .
AMBIGUITY
The program tries to find a possible parsing for a sentence and as soon as ot finds an answer it returns it this is what it is designed to do .
The process is unified with the results of the semantic interpretation being used to guide the parsing .
If in parsing a noun group a call to the semantic interpreter fails to make sense of the noun group the parsing is immediately redirected .
The way to treat ambiguity is not to list all possible solutions to the parsing problem by finding all possible interpretations of the sentance but in being clever in choosing the first possible parsing .
The parser will consider a failure if one occurs analyse the reasons for its occurrence and then take appropriate action .
Suppose we have the sentance
I rode down the street in a car
the parser may wish to consider the noun group
the street in a car
the semantic analyser will reject the phrase
in a car
as a qualifier of a street .
Since the semantic programs are part of a general deductive system with a definite worl model the semantic evaluation which guides parsing can include both general knowledge and specific knowledge .
Few sentences seem ambiguous to humans when first read .
They are guided by an understanding of what is said to pick a single parsing and a few very different meanings .
By using this same knowledge to guide its parsing a computer understanding system can take advantage of the same technique to parse meaningful sentences quickly and efficiently .
A semantic theory must account for multiple meanings of wordsphrase and sentences .
Words may have several senses producing multiple possible interpretations of phrases and sentences involving them .
Sometimes a sentence may also be described with several different syntactic structures leading to ambiguities .
The sentance
the woman sitting in the room saw the flash of lightning
will be ambiguous if each word has a specific meaning .
It could mean
the woman who was sitting in the room
the woman who is sitting in the room
In parsing we do not carry forward two possible structures we try to find the best and only seek others if we run into trouble .
In semantics we take the other approach and if a word has two possible meanings we proceed in parallel .
There is a danger here of combinatorial explosion .
If each word in a group of four has three meanings there could be 81 alternatives .
Consider the phrase
the green ball
we know that green can mean the colour unripe or a rooky
ball can be a sherical object or a grand dance
but it would be naive to associate the meanings
a rooky dance
or an unripe dance
so we are left with a coloured spherical object .
PROCEDURAL DEDUCTIVE SYTEMS
The system requies programming techniques capable of using procedural information but at the same time expressing this information in ways which do not depend on the idiosyncracies of particular languages .
PLANNER is a goal - oriented procedural language designed to specify the bill .
It handles simple assertions efficiently and it can handle complex information expressable in predicate calculus .
Complex information is expressed in procedural form and this can include ideas of how to go about a proof .
Being goal - oriented it is not concerned about interaction between procedures .
The language is concerned with achieving goals not in how they are achieved and any valid accelerator can be introduced .
New theorems can be easily added .
PLANNER is a uniform notation for expressing procedural knowledge just as predicate calculus is a notation for describing a limited range of information .
COMPARISON WITH OTHER PARSERS
The early machine - translator dseigners were forced to develop their own linguistics as they worked and they produced rough versions .
The parsers were packages of routines that evolved as the grammars emerged and grew to handle more complex sentances .
When the machine - translation failed it seemed clear that it had been premature to tackle the natural language problem without sufficient linguistic development .
Computer programs for natural language took separate paths :
the first was to ignore syntax completely and to use a general pattern matching process to derive information for example SIR STUDENT and ELIZA .
They limited the user to a small set of inputs or their understanding to things that ignored syntax .
the second was to take a simplified subset of English which could be handled by a well understood form of grammar .
Bobrow has produced a summary of this work .
AUGMENTED TRANSITION NETWORKS
ATN's have the power of Turing machines since they have changeable registers and can transfer control depending on the state of these registers .
They can handle any type of gramar that can be parsed by any machine .
ATN 's appear to operate more closely with the way humans work thus they give a natural and understandable representation for grammars .
GRAMMAR
As we have seen it uses the concepts of CLAUSE GROOUP and WORD
the structure of a CLAUSE is quite complex and a simplified form has been shown .
NOUN GROUP
The noun group consists of the components
determiner the
ordinals first
numbers six
adjectives intelligent
classifier wales
noun england
qualifier prepositional group --- in the moon
VERB GROUPS
ACTIVE
took -- past
takes -- present
will take -- future
can take -- modal
has taken -- past in present
was taking -- present in past
was goint to have taken -- past in future in past
was going to have been taking -- present in past in future in past
PASSIVE

has been going to have been taken -- past in future in past in present
Words have features
There is a sophisticated algorithm to analyse word endings
The grammar appears in LISP
for example

2 NP ->DETERMINER NOUN
3 VP ->VERB/INTRANSITIVE
4 VP ->VERB / TRANSITIVE
5 DETERMINER ->

6 NOUN -> giraffe
7 NOUN -> apple

SEMANTICS
We need a transducer that can work with a syntax analyser and produce data which is acceptable to a logical deductive system .
The semantic theory must describe relationships at three different levels .
It must define the meaning of words which involves its relationship to a vocabulary and a structure of concepts .
The next level relates the emaning of groups of words in syntactic structures .
We need an analysis of the ways in which English structures convey meaning and the roles that words play .
Finally an English sentance is not viewed in isolation .
A semantic theory must describe how the meaning of a sentance depends on its context .

A Quiz Designed to Give You Fitts ( Turkish translation available at http://idefter.com/sayfa/fitts-yasasi-kucuk-bir-test.)
So you think you are an interaction designer ?
Not if you cannot answer all the following questions quickly and with authority .
If you 're not an interaction designer , but you know one or you are thinking of hiring one slip them just the questions , and see how well they do .
I 've used variations of this quiz for years during the interview process to good effect .
These questions and answers assume that you have total control over all screen real estate , the OS , etc .
Just pretend you are chief designer for Microsoft or Apple .
If you are new to matters Fitts , take the quiz before looking at the text the follows anyway .
The answers are going to thoroughly teach the principles involved , but taking your best shot at the quiz first will make clear to you what assumptions you have been using in the past .
You can then measure those assumptions against the answers that follow .
And do n't feel bad with your initial results :
The overwhelming majority of people , even those that have been involved with computers for years , do poorly on their first time around .
The good news is that they do great on the retake , and many have found this the most valuable single article on this website , immediately and permanently applicable to their future design work .
The Quiz
You may want to read through all the questions ( but not the answers ! ) once just to get the " lay of the land . "
Then , go back and answer them .
And you really do have to answer them .
This is not a quiz that lends itself to looking at a question and saying ,  Oh , yeah , sure .
I know that one ,  and scanning on down .
You have to actually articulate the answer .
( Otherwise , you are considered to have gotten it wrong . )
No tricks are hiding within .
This is all straight business .
However , the answers may seem counter - intuitive or counter - experiential , so apparent " obviousness " might not suffice .
Microsoft Toolbars offer the user the option of displaying a label below each tool .
Name at least one reason why labeled tools can be accessed faster .
( Assume , for this , that the user knows the tool and does not need the label just simply to identify the tool . )
You have a palette of tools in a graphics application that consists of a matrix of 16x16 - pixel icons laid out as a 2x8 array that lies along the left - hand edge of the screen .
Without moving the array from the left - hand side of the screen or changing the size of the icons , what steps can you take to decrease the time necessary to access the average tool ?
A right - handed user is known to be within 10 pixels of the exact center of a large , 1600 X 1200 screen .
You will place a single - pixel target on the screen that the user must point to exactly .
List the five pixel locations on the screen that the user can access fastest .
For extra credit , list them in order from fastest to slowest access .
Microsoft offers a Taskbar which can be oriented along the top , side or bottom of the screen , enabling users to get to hidden windows and applications .
This Taskbar may either be hidden or constantly displayed .
Describe at least two reasons why the method of triggering an auto - hidden Microsoft Taskbar is grossly inefficient .
Explain why a Macintosh pull - down menu can be accessed at least five times faster than a typical Windows pull - down menu .

The industrial designers let loose on the Mac have screwed up most of the keyboards by cutting their function keys in half so the total depth of the keyboard was reduced by half a key .
Why was this incredibly stupid ?
What do the primary solutions to all these questions have in common ?
If you cant answer the last question , you are going to have all kinds of trouble with the rest .
You arent alone , of course , as evidence abounds that no one at Microsoft and fewer and fewer people at Apple could answer these questions .
Microsoft sort of has an excuse .
They claimed from the beginning that a visual interface with the mouse and all that junk is inferior to a keyboard interface .
They might have looked foolish if they had ever really tried to build a real GUI .
By consistently sabotaging the visual interface , they have avoided such embarrassment .
What has happened at Apple is a little more mysterious .
The industrial - design blunders are expected .
Apples outside industrial designers have always hovered between cluelessness and hostility when it came to human factors .
However , lately , Apple has been doing some pretty stupid stuff in - house , too .
Like turning the rapid - access Labels menu into a hierarchical , slowing it down by five or ten times .
The Answers Let 's start out with a preview of the answer to question 10 , Fitts ' law , since all the others revolve around it .
From First Principles of Design : Fitts ' Law :
The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target .
This little bit of obviousness is so often ignored , I sometimes wonder if it is on purpose .
Usually , though , it is merely a leading indicator of overall ignorance , amplified by superstition and unsullied by facts or study .
Fortunately , readers of AskTog , being as tenacious as they are perspicacious , either know exactly what Fitts '
Law is or will before they go to bed tonight .
Fitts ' Law ( properly spelled " Fitts's , " per the rules of American English , though rarely done so ) is simple , absolute , and immutable .
Let 's see how it pertains to the questions : Question 1 Microsoft
Toolbars offer the user the option of displaying a label below each tool .
Name at least one reason why labeled tools can be accessed faster .
( Assume , for this , that the user knows the tool and does not need the label just simply to identify the tool . )
Here are two answers .
You may have more .
The label becomes part of the target .
The target is therefore bigger .
Bigger targets , all else being equal , can always be acccessed faster .
Fitts ' Law .
When labels are not used , the tool icons crowd together .
At first glance , it might appear advantageous to crowd the icons together , since it results in less distance among targets .
However , the task here is not to hop from target to target .
Instead , the point of origin when a user decides to access the toolbar will usually be somewhere in the content region , away from all the targets .
When the icons are spread apart , users have a " buffer zone " between icons , where an incorrect acquisition will result in no action .
When the targets are crowded together , however , the user has more chance to initiate an unwanted action .
To avoid this possibility , non-label users learn to slow way down .
( Do n't bother to ask them whether they 've slowed down .
They 'll tell you it sped them up .
Only the stopwatch knows for sure . )
Another way to make the targets bigger , of course , is to always choose large icons , rather than small .
Pity the " power - user " with the 4x4 - pixel icons who thinks he 's going faster .
Question 2
You have a palette of tools in a graphics application that consists of a matrix of 16x16 - pixel icons laid out as a 2x8 array that lies along the left - hand edge of the screen .
Without moving the array from the left - hand side of the screen or changing the size of the icons , what steps can you take to decrease the time necessary to access the average tool ?
Two separate steps may be necessary to average tool access time .
Both are important .
Change the array to 1X16 , so all the tools lie along the edge of the screen .
Ensure that the user can click on the very first row of pixels along the edge of the screen to select a tool .
There should be no buffer zone .
This second step is vital , and is so often ignored .
Remember that Fitts '
Law states that access time is a function of distance and target size .
If the target size is larger , then the time is reduced .
It is reduced for a simple reason : the user need not slow down when approaching the target for fear of overshooting .
Now consider the screen edge .
How deep is the target ?
If it were really only the one pixel it appears , it would be very hard to hit .
However , the screen edge is , for all practical purposes , infinitely deep .
It does n't matter how fast that mouse is going when it hits the screen edge , that pointer absolutely will not overshoot .
Having to hit a pixel two pixels in from the screen edge takes much longer than hitting the edge itself .
Use that edge .
It is your friend .
Question 3
A right - handed user is known to be within 10 pixels of the exact center of a large , 1600 X 1200 screen .
You will place a single - pixel target on the screen that the user must stop upon and point to exactly .
List the five pixel locations on the screen that the user can access fastest .
For extra credit , list them in order from fastest to slowest access .
No , this is not a trick question .
And the first part should be immediately answerable by any interaction designer .
The extra credit question is not quite as simple .
But first , the locations of the five " magic pixels " :
The prime pixel is located at the current location of the mouse pointer .
Popup menus make use of this pixel , showing up relative to the mouse pointer , no matter where the user may have moved it .
This pixel requires zero travel and is , in effect , an infinitely large target you just can't miss it .
The other four pixels are located , on average , as far away from the mouse pointer as you can get .
Their distance , however , is more than made up for by their target size , which is infinite in two dimensions .
These magic pixels are the four corners of the screen .
Throw the mouse in any direction you desire and the odds are overwhelming that if you threw it with enough velocity , it will end up in one of those four corners .
This presupposes a properly designed acceleration function for the mouse .
The key to the extra credit question is in the user 's right - handedness .
A right - handed user can access , in order of increasing difficulty , and starting with the point already mentioned :
The pixel immediately at the current cursor location : Click the mouse and you 're done .
The bottom - right corner .
The top - left corner .
The top - right corner .
The bottom - left corner .
If you hold the mouse in your right hand and move the mouse , using just your wrist and hand , in the four different directions , you will see how the mechanics of your arm leads to this .
The answers for a left handed person are , of course , reversed .
These differences are relatively small compared to the power of the " magic pixels . "
All four corners should be used and used well .
Question 4 : Microsoft offers a Taskbar which can be oriented along the top , side or bottom of the screen , enabling users to get to hidden windows and applications .
This Taskbar may either be hidden or constantly displayed .
Describe at least two reasons why the method of triggering an auto - hidden Microsoft Taskbar is grossly inefficient .
Now these should have started getting easier .
Screen edges are prime real estate .
You do n't waste an entire edge that could be housing a couple of dozen different fast - access icons just for one object , the Taskbar .
The auto - hidden Taskbar is entirely too easy to display by accident .
Users are constantly triggering it when trying to access something that is close to , but not at , the edge .
The Taskbar would not have any of these problems , yet be even quicker to get to if it were located at any one of four corners of the display .
Throw the mouse up and to the left , for example , and you 'll have a taskbar displayed .
Fast access without the false triggering .
Question 5 Explain why a Macintosh pull - down menu can be accessed at least five times faster than a typical Windows pull - down menu .
For extra credit , suggest at least two reasons why Microsoft made such an apparently stupid decision .
Microsoft , Sun , and others have made the decision to mount the menu bar on the window , rather than at the top of the display , as Apple did .
They made this decision for at least two reasons :
Apple claimed copyright and patent rights on the Apple menu bar Everyone else assumed that moving the menu bar closer to the user , by putting it at the top of the window , would speed things up .
Phalanxes of lawyers have discussed point 1 .
Let 's deal with point two .
The Apple menu bar is a lot faster than menu bars in windows .
Why ?
Because , since the menu bar lies on a screen edge , it has an infinite height .
As a result , Mac users can just throw their mice toward the top of the screen with the assurance that it will never penetrate and disappear .
Unless , of course , I 'm testing them at the time .
I did a test at Apple where I mounted one monitor on top of another , with the menu bar at the top of the lower display .
The only way the user could get to the top monitor was by passing through the menu bar enroute .
I then gave users the task of repeatedly accessing menu bar items .
When they first started out , they penetrated into the upper screen by around nine inches on average , just because their mouse velocity was so high .
Then they learned they had to slow down and really aim for the menu .
By the time they adjusted , their menu-access times became so ponderously slow , they took around the same time as the average Windows user .
The other " advantage " usually ascribed to a menu bar at the top of each window is that users always know where to look for the items pertaining to the task they are carrying out .
This is silly .
Users may do various tasks within a given window , and the menu items may change .
Not only that , but a great many perverse applications exist , particularly in the Sun world , where the menu bar you need to access is not even in the window in which you are working !
That is truly bizarre and mind - bending .
Microsoft applications are beginning to offer the possibility , in full - screen mode , of a menu bar at the top of the display .
Try this out in Word or Excel .
It is much faster .
Microsoft 's general cluelessness has never been so amply displayed , however , as it is in Microsoft Visual Studio , which has a menu bar at the top of the screen with a one - pixel barrier between the screentop and the menu .
Talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory .
Question 6
What is the bottleneck in hierarchical menus and what techniques could make that bottleneck less of a problem ?
The bottleneck is the passage between the first - level menu and the second - level menu .
Users first slide the mouse pointer down to the category menu item .
Then , they must carefully slide the mouse directly across ( horizontally ) in order to move the pointer into the secondary menu .
The engineer who originally designed hierarchicals apparently had his forearm mounted on a track so that he could move it perfectly in a horizontal direction without any vertical component .
Most of us , however , have our forarms mounted on a pivot we like to call our elbow .
That means that moving our hand describes an arc , rather than a straight line .
Demanding that pivoted people move a mouse pointer along in a straight line horizontally is just wrong .
We are naturally going to slip downward even as we try to slide sideways .
When we are not allowed to slip downward , the menu we 're after is going to slam shut just before we get there .
The Windows folks tried to overcome the pivot problem with a hack :
If they see the user move down into range of the next item on the primary menu , they do n't instantly close the second - level menu .
Instead , they leave it open for around a half second , so , if users are really quick , they can be inaccurate but still get into the second - level menu before it slams shut .
Unfortunately , people 's reactions to heightened chance of error is to slow down , rather than speed up , a well - established phenomenon .
Therefore , few users will ever figure out that moving faster could solve their problem .
Microsoft 's solution is exactly wrong .
When I specified the Mac hierarchical menu algorthm in the mid-'80s , I called for a buffer zone shaped like a < , so that users could make an increasingly - greater error as they neared the hierarchical without fear of jumping to an unwanted menu .
As long as the user 's pointer was moving a few pixels over for every one down , on average , the menu stayed open , no matter how slow they moved .
( Cancelling was still really easy ; just deliberately move up or down . )
Apple hierarchicals were still less efficient than single level menus , because of the added target , but at least they were less challenging than the average video game .
Sadly , the NeXT folks , when coming to Apple , copied Windows , rather than the Mac , in designing the hierarchical menu interface for OSX .
Today 's Mac hierarchicals are just as difficult to use as those of Windows .
Fitts ' law is not just about target size and distance ; it 's also about the number of targets .
The more targets , all else being equal , the longer the task will take .
Hierarchicals automatically add one extra target .
Making it difficult to enter a second - level menu adds an additional target , the second - level menu itself .
With my hierarchicals on the pre-OSX Macs , in most cases , the user did not even have to think about targetting the second - level menu .
The menu opened , and the user simply aimed for the desired item .
The only time the user had to consider the second - level menu separately was when there were so many items in the menu that the one the user was after was way up or way down the list , out of range of the allowable pivot for entry .
Even then , users would typically arc along a more radical curve to reach their items in a single motion , rather than breaking things down into the jerky Etch - A - Sketch types of moves users typically make with today 's hierarchicals .
When designing a user 's required motions , reduce the number of motions needed along with both distance and required precision for each motion , then consider how your proposed scheme maps onto a human 's ability to make those motions .
Question 7
Name at least one advantage circular popup menus have over standard , linear popup menus .
With the options displayed around you in a circle , you need only move a pixel or two to enter the " slice of pie " you want .
Less travel , good target size .
Good design .
They have a second advantage of feeding not only distance , but direction information into your motor memory .
As long as the options are few enough , you will soon learn to move your mouse up and to the left to print , down and to the right to fax , etc .
In fact , once these simple gestures are learned , you need n't even display the menu anymore , unless the user hesitates long enough to indicate they may be unsure .
( This was borne out during the course of the Fabrik project at Apple in the late 1980s . )
Question 8
What can you do to linear popup menus to better balance access time for all items ?
You can " Fittsize " them by making those items farther away from the mouse pointer larger .
They need not literally be larger , since the user is not having any trouble seeing the farther items .
Instead , the mapping of mouse - to - screen could be such that , as the user pulls further down the menu , more movement of the mouse is necessary to get a corresponding movement of the pointer .
In effect , you are decoupling the behavioral map of the screen from the visual map .
Other decoupling tricks include setting up local gravity , so that once a mouse pointer gets near the target , it is drawn to the target .
Barriers can be erected , so that once the mouse enters an object , it is difficult for it to pass through to the other side .
This can be frustrating .
Having a pressure - sensitive mouse that could " push through " if pushed down upon would enable the user either to be caught by the object or to flee to the territory beyond .
Reader Victor Zambrano has suggested another technique that will reduce acquisition time : Center the child menu , so that no item is more than total items / 2 away from the mouse . , as illustrated by Victor below :
A grave where skeletons of Africans were found in the cemetery in Campeche , Mexico .
Archaeologists have found what they think are the oldest remains of slaves brought from Africa to the New World .
The remains , in a colonial era graveyard in one of the oldest European cities in Mexico , date between the late - 16th century and the mid-17th century , not long after Columbus first set foot in the Americas .
The African origin of the slaves was determined by studying a chemical in their tooth enamel that reveals plant and rock types of their native land .
The chemical enters the body through the food chain as nutrients pass from bedrock through soil and water to plants and animals .
It is an indelible signature of birthplace , the researchers said , because it can be directly linked to the bedrock of specific locales .
Researchers examined remains of four individuals from among 180 burials found in a multiethnic burial ground associated with the ruins of a colonial church in Campeche , Mexico , a port city on the Yucatan Peninsula .
" This is the earliest documentation of the African Diaspora in the New World , " said study co-leader T. Douglas Price of University of Wisconsin - Madison .
" It does mean that slaves were brought here almost as soon as Europeans arrived . "
The discovery will be detailed in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology .
Over a span of nearly 400 years , as many as 12 million people were placed in bondage and brought across the Atlantic under horrific conditions to work , primarily , in the mines and plantations of the New World , Price and his colleagues said .
In early colonial Mexico , Campeche was an important Spanish gateway to the New World .
It served as a base for exploration and conquest and was a key defensive outpost in a region infested with pirates , the researchers say .
They think slaves from the infamous West African port of Elmina were shipped to Campeche where they may have been used as domestic servants .
The discovery of the remains of slaves born in Africa from such an early date shows that slavery became an integral aspect of the New World economy not long after the Conquistadors completed the subjugation of Mexico , Price said .
Archaeological and historical evidence , including a map of colonial Campeche , suggest the graveyard was in use from about 1550 to the late 1600s .
It was uncovered , along with the foundations of a colonial era church , in 2000 by construction workers digging around Campeche 's central park .
The site was excavated under the direction of Tiesler .

Much has been made of Keira Knightley 's slender frame and relatively flat chest .
Indeed , Keira herself has spoken openly of not having breasts , but ' pecs ' , and said that she would die for a curvy body like Scarlett Johansson's .

• Watch a trailer of Pirates of the Caribbean in our viewing room
But in an extraordinarily revealing interview , the actress has told of how American audiences view her rather differently .
The 21 - year - old star of the Pirates of the Caribbean films has spoken of her bemusement at being surgically enhanced by computer trickery in promotional material publicising her films in the US .
She says studio executives and magazine publishers have decided that instead of presenting her as she really is , she should be seen as a lot bustier in case her flat chest ' turned people off ' .
The actress says her breasts were digitally boosted for the advertising campaign for her 2004 movie King Arthur .
She also claims magazine publishers in the US ban stars from appearing on their front covers unless they have at least a C - cup size , or are willing to be digitally enhanced to make it appear as if they have .
Keira , who played Guinevere in King Arthur , said her normal breasts were blown out of all proportion and looked droopy on the advert to promote the film .
' Those things certainly were n't mine , ' she told a US magazine yesterday .
' I remember we had an interesting discussion when they said , " We want to make them slightly larger and you 'll get approval " and I was like , " OK , fine .
' I honestly do n't give a s***. "
' But then they showed me the first copy and these things must have been double - Es - and they were down to my knees .
' And I was like , " I do n't mind you making them bigger , but do n't give me droopy breasts .
They look like your grandmother 's t***' , the actress said .
She then went on to say the incident was certainly not the first time she has had her chest digitally enhanced .
She explained : ' I did one magazine and found out you 're not actually allowed to be on a cover in the US without at least a C cup because it turns people off .
' Apparently they have done market research and found that women want to see no less than a C cup on other women .
Is n't that crazy ?
' So they made my t*** bigger for that as well . '
Miss Knightley 's comments will be seen as refreshingly honest in an industry fettered by publicists and agents watching every word .
the actress has an agent , but unusually , no publicist .
The tower has been redesigned more than once
The Freedom Tower is being built on the site of the Twin Towers destroyed in the 11 September 2001 attacks .
Architects redesigned it after police expressed concern that the 1,776 - foot ( 540 - metre ) building could be vulnerable to truck bomb attacks .
Under new plans it is further from the road and has a strengthened structure .
The redesign calls for a concrete and steel pedestal , clad in ornamental metalwork , and topped by a tower of glass .
The building is capped with a mast incorporating an antenna , which is meant to evoke the torch of the Statue of Liberty .
" This new design reflects a soaring tribute to freedom and a bedrock commitment to safety and security , " New York Governor George Pataki said .
Completion delay
The symbolic height - which in feet refers to the year of the American Declaration of Independence - is one of the few features left from the initial plans .
The building 's chief architect said he felt better about the new one than the original .
WORLD TRADE CENTER SITE TIMELINE July 2002 : Lower Manhattan Development Corporation ( LMDC ) releases six initial design concepts and , in following months , launches global search for design and planning professionals Dec 2002 : LMDC releases nine initial designs and launches outreach campaign to engage public in planning process Feb 2003 : Memory Foundations by Studio Daniel Libeskind selected as plan Sept 2003 : Release of refined master site plan July 2004 :
The cornerstone of the new building is laid
Libeskind : Visionary architect
The Freedom Tower 's cornerstone was laid last July , but an assessment by the New York Police Department urged architects to rethink some elements of its structure .
Police feared it would be difficult to protect the building against a possible truck bomb because of the heavy traffic along nearby West Street .
Under the new plans , the distance from West Street has been increased from 25 feet ( 7.6 metres ) to an average of 90 feet ( 28 metres ) , AP reports .
Rows and hitches
The project has been mired in controversy .
Initial designs for a replacement for the World Trade Center were greeted with disappointment by the public .
In 2003 the plan submitted by architect Daniel Libeskind was selected , but the boldness of his original proposals was later toned down .
A lower insurance payout on the Twin Towers than had been expected by the leaseholder further complicated the project .
And victims ' relatives argued that construction would damage the foundations of the Twin Towers , which they regard a piece of American history .
The building is due to be completed by the end of the decade .
The skyscraper is planned to be among the tallest buildings in the world .
Note :
This is my foreword to Mike Gunderloy ’s awesome new book , Coder to Developer .
The book is now available from SYBEX .
You know what drives me crazy ?
“ Everything ? ” you ask .
Well , OK , some of you know me a bit too well by now .
But seriously , folks , what drives me crazy is that most software developers do n’t realize just how little they know about software development .
Take , for example , me .
When I was a teenager , as soon as I finished reading Peter Norton ’s famous guide to programming the IBM - PC in Assembler , I was convinced that I knew everything there was to know about software development in general .
Heck , I was ready to start a software company to make a word processor , you see , and it was going to be really good .
My imaginary software company was going to have coffee breaks with free donuts every hour .
A lot of my daydreams in those days involved donuts .
When I got out of the army , I headed off to college and got a degree in Computer Science .
Now I really knew everything .
I knew more than everything , because I had learned a bunch of computer - scientific junk about linear algebra and NP completeness and frigging lambda calculus which was obviously useless , so I thought they must have run out of useful things to teach us and were scraping the bottom of the barrel .
Nope .
At my first job I noticed how many things there are that many Computer Science departments are too snooty to actually teach you .
Things like software teamwork .
Practical advice about user interface design .
Professional tools like source code control , bug tracking databases , debuggers and profilers .
Business things .
Computer Science departments in the most prestigious institutions just wo n’t teach you this stuff because they consider it “ vocational , ” not academic ; the kind of thing that high school dropouts learn at the local technical institute so they can have a career as an auto mechanic , or an air - conditioner repairman , or a ( holding nose between thumb and forefinger ) “ software developer . ”
I can sort of understand that attitude .
After all , many prestigious undergraduate institutions see their goal as preparing you for life , not teaching you a career , least of all a career in a field that changes so rapidly any technologies you learn now will be obsolete in a decade .
Over the next decade I proceeded to learn an incredible amount about software development and all the things it takes to produce software .
I worked at Microsoft on the Excel team , at Viacom on the web team , and at Juno on their email client .
And , you know what ?
At every point in the learning cycle , I was completely convinced that I knew everything there was to know about software development .
“ Maybe you ’re just an arrogant sod ? ” you ask , possibly using an even spicier word than “ sod . ”
I beg your pardon : this is my foreword ; if you want to be rude write your own damn foreword , tear mine out of the book , and put yours in instead .
There ’s something weird about software development , some mystical quality , that makes all kinds of people think they know how to do it .
I ’ve worked at dotcom - type companies full of liberal arts majors with no software experience or training who nevertheless were convinced that they knew how to manage software teams and design user interfaces .
This is weird , because nobody thinks they know how to remove a burst appendix , or rebuild a car engine , unless they actually know how to do it , but for some reason there are all these people floating around who think they know everything there is to know about software development .
Anyway , the responsibility is going to fall on your shoulders .
You ’re probably going to have to learn how to do software development on your own .
If you ’re really lucky , you ’ve had some experience working directly with top notch software developers who can teach you this stuff , but most people do n’t have that opportunity .
So I ’m glad to see that Mike Gunderloy has taken upon himself to write the book you hold in your hands .
Here you will find a well - written and enjoyable introduction to many of the most important things that you ’re going to need to know as you move from being a person who can write code to being a person who can develop software .
Do those sound like the same thing ?
They ’re not .
That ’s roughly the equivalent of going from being a six year old who can crayon some simple words , backwards N’s and all , to being a successful novelist who writes books that receive rave reviews and sell millions of copies .
Being a software developer means you can take a concept , build a team , set up state of the art development processes , design a software product , the right software product , and produce it .
Not just any software product : a high quality software product that solves a problem and delights your users .
With documentation .
A web page .
A setup program .
Test cases .
Norwegian versions .
Bokmål and Nynorsk .
Appetizers , dessert , and twenty seven eight - by - ten color glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was .
( Apologies to Arlo Guthrie . )
And then , one day , finally , perhaps when it ’s too late , you ’ll wake up and say , “ Hmm .
Maybe I really do n’t know what it really takes to develop software . ”
And on that day only , and not one minute before , but on that day and from that day forward , you will have earned the right to call yourself a software developer .
In the meantime , all is not lost : you still have my blessing if you want to eat donuts every hour .

A BIG FAKE !
Not so much a fake as an homage .
Oh well .
Having been a non-employee for about 14 years now , I ’ve made my share of stupid business mistakes .
I ’ve also coached a number of people to start their own businesses , and I ’ve seen many of them make similar mistakes .
This advice is geared towards small business owners , particularly people who are just starting ( or about to start ) their own business .
1. Selling to the wrong people .
While sales are important to the survival of any business , you do n’t need to push your business on everyone you meet , including friends and family .
Furthermore , it ’s a waste of time to try selling to people who simply do n’t need what you ’re offering .
Selling to the wrong people includes trying to sell to everyone .
Some customers are much easier to sell to than others .
For a web consulting business , if a potential customer is broke and obsessively worried about every nickel they spend , if they want a web site but do n’t know why , or if they simply do n’t understand the Internet well enough , they wo n’t be a good client in the long run .
Feel free to say no to customers that are more trouble than they ’re worth .
Let your competitors sell to them instead .
You ’ll save yourself many headaches , and you ’ll free up more time to focus on serving the best customers .
Just because someone is interested in doing business with you does n’t mean you should accept .
In my first year in business , I probably said yes to at least 50 % of the people who approached me with a potential business relationship .
I wasted a lot of time pursuing deals that were too much of a stretch to begin with .
I accepted lunch invitations from random business people who just wanted to “ see if there ’s a way we could do something together . ”
Virtually none of them made me a dime .
If you think a meeting is pointless , it probably is .
Do n’t network with random people just because you think you ’re supposed to network .
Today I accept such invitations less than 1/10 as often .
If an offer does n’t excite me right away , I usually decline or ignore it .
Most relationships simply are n’t worth pursuing .
Learn to say no to the weak opportunities so you have the capacity to say yes to the golden opportunities .
2. Spending too much money .
Until you have a steady cashflow coming in , do n’t spend your precious start - up cash unless it ’s absolutely necessary .
I started my computer games business with about $ 20,000 cash ( my own money ) , and it went fast ; shortly thereafter I was using debt to finance the business .
Unfortunately , the original business model did n’t work , and it took five years before the business was generating a positive cashflow .
I soon learned that every dollar invested in the business was another dollar that eventually had to be recouped from sales .
In 2004 I started this personal development business with only $ 9 cash even though I could have spent much more on it .
No fancy logo , no snazzy web design , no business cards or stationery .
I paid to register the domain name , and that was it .
That ’s as much as I was willing to spend before I started generating a positive cashflow .
All other business expenditures came out of that cashflow .
Your business should put cash into your pocket , so before you “ invest ” money into it , be clear on how you ’re going to pull that cash back out again .
Obviously some businesses require lots of cash to start , but in the age of the Internet business , you can very easily start a lucrative business for pocket change .
3. Spending too little money .
It ’s also a mistake to be too stingy with your cash .
Do n’t let frugality get in the way of efficiency .
Take advantage of skilled contractors who can do certain tasks more efficiently than you can .
Buy decent equipment when it ’s clear you ’ll get your money ’s worth .
You do n’t have to overspend on fancy furniture , but get functional furniture that helps you be more productive .
Do n’t use an antiquated computer with outdated software that slows you down if you can afford something better .
It takes time to develop the wisdom to know when you ’re being too tight or too loose with your cash , so if you ’re just starting out , get a second opinion .
Often the very thought of getting a second opinion makes the correct choice clear .
If you ca n’t justify the expenditure to someone you respect , it ’s probably a mistake .
On the other hand , there are situations where it ’s hard to justify not spending the cash .
4. Putting on a fake front .
Many one - person businesses refer to themselves as “ we . ”
That ’s something a lot of new entrepreneurs do , but it is n’t necessary .
There ’s nothing wrong with a one - person business , especially today .
My games business has mostly been a we over the years , but my personal development business is still an I .
It ’s perfectly OK to refer to your business as an I when you ’re the only one working in it .
Pretending that you ’re a we when you ’re really an I is a bit silly .
It ’s not going to gain you any respect in a way that matters .
Promoting yourself as an I may even be an advantage today , since people will know the buck stops with you , and if you make a promise , you ’re the one who will carry it out .
Promises from a we sometimes are n’t worth very much .
If you ’re a newly self - employed person , do n’t pretend you ’re anything else .
Price your products and services fairly for your level of skills and talents .
Some newly self - employed people think they must become actors .
The business they promote to the world is pure fantasy .
Trying to fool your customers in this manner will only backfire .
If you ’re so desperate for business that you need to lie , you should n’t be starting your own business .
If you ca n’t provide real value and charge fairly for it , do n’t play the game of business .
Develop your skills a bit more first .
5 . Assuming a signed contract will be honored .
I ’ve made this mistake more than I care to admit .
I ’ve had signed contracts with supposedly reputable corporations , and they were n’t worth squat when the CEO decided he wanted out of the deal , even for completely dishonorable reasons .
Sure I was in the right , but did I want to go to court to enforce it ?
No , I ’d rather continue doing meaningful work .
A signed contract is just a piece of paper .
What ’s behind a signed contract is a relationship .
If the relationship goes sour , the contract wo n’t save you .
The purpose of a contract is to clearly define everyone ’s roles and commitments .
But it ’s the relationship , not the paper , that ultimately enforces those commitments .
When I understood this , I focused more on relationships and worried less about what was on paper , and my business deals went much more smoothly .
Once you start falling back on the paper , the deal is already in trouble .
Creative ( and lucrative ) business deals almost always stray from the paper contracts that represent them .
One of my attorneys , who had worked on dozens of game development deals , told me that no deal he worked on ever followed the contract exactly ; most were n’t even close .
And these were big money deals in many cases .
Business relationships are similar to other personal relationships — they twist and turn all over the place .
Written contracts are still necessary , especially when dealing with larger corporations where people come and go , but they ’re secondary to relationships .
Just do n’t make the mistake of assuming that the contract is the deal .
The contract is only the deal ’s shadow .
The real deal is the relationship .
Keep your business relationships in good order , and you wo n’t have to worry so much about what ’s on paper .
It ’s sad but true that there are loads of scoundrels in business .
Many of them hold titles like CEO , President , and CFO .
There are indeed people out there who seem to care about nothing but money , and they will lie , cheat , and steal to get it .
In recent years some of the more despicable ones have gotten themselves indicted ( or are already behind bars ) .
But there are plenty of others to whom the word honor has no meaning .
For example , in the computer gaming industry , it is n’t unusual for large publishers to feign interest in certain games and string the developers along .
They give the developer every indication that a deal is pending , but all the developer sees are delays and false verbal promises .
In reality the publisher only wants to keep the game off the market to keep it from competing with one of their own titles ; they hope to cause the developer to miss the next Christmas season or to run out of cash and cancel the title altogether .
It happens .
Business , especially the entertainment industry , is not for the timid .
6. Going against your intuition .
Intuition is just as important in business as it is in other settings .
You ’d be amazed at how many gigantic corporate deals are green - lighted or red-lighted because of some CEO ’s gut feeling .
While you might think that logic is the language of business , that ’s far from reality .
If you base all your business deals on hard logic and ignore your intuition , most likely you ’ll be in for a world of hurt .
We humans are n’t very logical to begin with .
We simply do n’t have enough data to make truly logical decisions because business deals depend on human beings , and we do n’t have a logical system for accurately predicting human behavior .
Not being able to predict how other humans will behave is a pretty big gap in our logic .
And intuition has to fill that gap .
The real performance of human beings is what makes or breaks business deals .
But to assume everyone will perform as expected is unrealistic in the extreme .
No deal ever goes perfectly .
It ’s hard to say no to a deal that seems juicy by the numbers when my gut is saying , “ You ’ll regret it , ” but more often than not , I later see evidence my intuition was right all along .
Sometimes I just get a bad read on someone , and then years later , several people I know are complaining about being ripped off by that person .
Intuition is a critical part of the decision - making process in business .
Since business deals depend on relationships , you need to get a read on the other people involved in any deal you consider .
If you get a bad read , walk away .
If you get a good read , proceed with caution .
7. Being too formal .
I ’ll say it again .
Business is built on relationships .
In some settings a certain degree of formality is appropriate , but in most business situations being too formal only gets in the way .
Business relationships work best when there ’s a decent human - to - human connection behind them .
I think it ’s a mistake to be too formal even when looking to establish new business relationships .
If someone mails me a letter that starts with “ Dear Mr. Pavlina ” and then goes on to explain a long - winded business proposal , I ’ll usually just trash it , especially if it uses the word “ we ” a lot .
Better to fire off an email with a “ Hi Steve , ” and just ask me very informally if I ’m interested in the kind of arrangement you ’re seeking .
It saves time and opens the door to a real human relationship .
Human beings do n’t want to build relationships with faceless corporations .
They only want relationships with other human beings … sometimes animals too I suppose .
Treat your business relationships like friendships ( or potential friendships ) .
Formality puts up walls , and walls do n’t foster good business relationships .
No one is loyal to a wall … except the one in China .
Formality is boring and tedious .
People want to enjoy their work .
If someone addresses me like a computer , I ’ll respond in kind — by hitting delete .
But if someone demonstrates they have a real personality and a good sense of humor , a connection is far more likely .
8. Sacrificing your personality quirks .
In the early years of running my games business , I took myself too seriously and assumed that I had to act “ businesslike ” … whatever that meant .
Being self - employed was a weighty responsibility , and other people were counting on me .
Sink or swim , right ?
I started my games business in my early 20s , and people in their early 20s are invariably weird .
But I assumed that as a business owner , being weird was n’t appropriate or acceptable .
So most of my business letters and emails looked like they were written by the same people who created Microsoft ’s EULAs .
The job title of “ President ” really went to my head .
I learned how to function without a personality .
It took a number of years , but eventually I became comfortable just being myself , especially after my games business became profitable .
Now that I ’m a blogger , my personality quirks and unusual experiences are strengths .
My personal oddities give this blog a unique flavor .
If I were to take myself too seriously and write more formally , this blog would be very dull and would likely lose much of its audience .
It ’s perfectly OK to be your own weird self and to inject your own unique spirit into your business , especially if you ’re in your teens or 20s .
Do n’t be afraid to be more like Steve Jobs … and less like Steve Ballmer .
Do n’t pretend to be something you ’re not .
Ultimately you ’ll enjoy your work much more if you attract the kinds of customers and partners that want to work with you for who you are — warts and all .
Send the people who only want to work with androids to your corporate competitors .
They deserve each other . 🙂
If other people ca n’t handle your weirdness , too bad for them .
Focus your energy on the people who can .
9 . Failing to focus on value creation .
It ’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that the purpose of a business is to make money .
But the real purpose of a business is to create value .
While it ’s possible to make money in the short run without creating much value , in the long run it ’s unsustainable .
Even criminal organizations have to create value for someone .
When you know your business is just sucking value away from others without providing anything in return , it will erode your self - esteem , and the business wo n’t be much fun to run .
Why does your business exist ?
It exists to provide some sort of value , both for you and your customers .
The better you understand what value you ’re trying to provide , the better you ’ll be able to focus .
The basic value provided by my games business was cerebral entertainment .
The basic value provided by StevePavlina.com is personal growth .
Too often business owners are n’t clear on what value they ’re trying to provide .
They just sell stuff and hope for the best .
That ’s a lousy business model .
The world does n’t need more selling or more stuff .
But it always needs and wants genuine value creation , and that ’s where you should direct your efforts .
Presently this web site contains over 400 free articles .
That ’s a lot of value creation .
Thousands of people visit each day to receive some of that value .
Helping people grow is the business ’ primary aim .
10 . Failing to optimize .
Although value creation is essential to a sustainable business , it ’s equally naive to assume you can simply focus on creating value , and the rest will take care of itself .
You may build a business that provides good value but loses money .
As a business owner , you need to find a way to deliver your value in a cost effective manner .
Most likely your first attempt will be very suboptimal .
You ’ll waste too much time , money , and resources trying to produce and deliver your value .
That ’s OK though .
Many businesses start out that way .
Just do n’t let yours stay that way .
Once you have a particular business process in place , pull it apart and re-optimize it from time to time .
Look for ways to make it more efficient .
Can you get it done in less time ?
At less cost ?
Can you do it less frequently ?
Can you outsource it ?
Can you dump the process altogether ?
I used to process credit orders for my games business manually .
I started the business in 1994 , and when I ’d receive an order through the mail or via my web site , I ’d use some software to input and run the orders by modem .
At the end of each month , I ’d manually tally the sales .
That worked fine when sales were low , but it became burdensome as more products were released and sales increased .
Several years ago I upgraded the process such that online orders were fully automated , including instant delivery of the game download .
All orders are recorded in a database , and I can view real - time reports to see how sales are doing for each product .
It took some work to set this up , but it was well worth it .
That one optimization saved me a lot of time and effort , and I do n’t have to pay high fees for a third - party order processing service .
Do n’t fall into the trap of using archaic methods for doing routine tasks that could be automated , including inventory management , billing , accounting , order processing , communications , and marketing .
If you find yourself doing the same repetitive tasks month after month , make sure you put some effort into optimizing them .
Not optimizing is like throwing time and money down the drain .
It ’s often much easier to save time and money than it is to create them .
An Internet business has abundant opportunities for optimization because it ’s so easy to try new things and measure the results .
In the first year after launching this site , I experimented quite a bit with Google Adsense .
Many people do n’t like the ad layout on this site , but it ’s the most effective layout I ’ve tried so far .
I use it because it works .
Adding the donations page was another optimization .
Some people click ads , some people donate , and some do both .
So even though value creation is the primary aim of the business , this is still a for - profit business and needs to generate income in order to be sustainable .
If I do n’t eat , I do n’t write .
More money means more resources for ongoing value creation .
So value creation and optimization go hand - in - hand .
It takes significant effort to build a successful business , but it ’s also a tremendous growth experience .
I know many people who have quit their jobs to run their own businesses .
Many of them did n’t do as well as they ’d hoped , but I do n’t know any that regretted taking the plunge .
There ’s simply no substitute for holding the reins of your own destiny .
A few current and former signals intelligence guys have been checking in since this NSA domestic spying story broke .
Their reactions range between midly creeped out and completely pissed off .
All of the sigint specialists emphasized repeatedly that keeping tabs on Americans is way beyond the bounds of what they ordinarily do — no matter what the conspiracy crowd may think .
“ It ’s drilled into you from minute one that you should not ever , ever , ever , under any fucking circumstances turn this massive apparatus on an American citizen , ” one source says .
“ You do a lot of weird shit .
But at least you do n’t fuck with your own people . “
Another , who ’s generally very pro-Administration , emphasized that the operation at least started with people that had Al - Qaeda connections — with some mass - spying master list .
As the Times , in its original story , noted :
The C.I.A. seized the terrorists ’ computers , cellphones and personal phone directories , said the officials familiar with the program .
The N.S.A. surveillance was intended to exploit those numbers and addresses as quickly as possible , they said .
…In addition to eavesdropping on those numbers and reading e-mail messages to and from the Qaeda figures , the N.S.A. began monitoring others linked to them , creating an expanding chain .
While most of the numbers and addresses were overseas , hundreds were in the United States , the officials said .
… Since 2002 , the agency has been conducting some warrantless eavesdropping on people in the United States who are linked , even if indirectly , to suspected terrorists through the chain of phone numbers and e-mail addresses .
But this call chain could very well have grown out of control , the source admits .
Suddenly , people ten and twelve degrees of separation away from Osama may have been targeted .
Deputy Director for National Intelligence Michael Hayden hinted at what might be going on in a press conference yesterday :
And here the key is not so much persistence as it is agility .
It ’s a quicker trigger .
It ’s a subtly softer trigger .
And the intrusion into privacy — the intrusion into privacy is significantly less .
It ’s only international calls .
The period of time in which we do this is , in most cases , far less than that which would be gained by getting a court order .
That points to a diferent type of technology at work , as I suggested the other day .
Senator Jay Rockefeller , in a remarkable pair of handwritten letters ( one kept for safe keeping , in case someone tried to say later on that he approved of the program ) seems to back this point of view .
As I reflected on the meeting today , and the future we face , John Poindexter ’s TIA project sprung to mind , exacerbating my concern regarding the direction the Administration is moving with regard to security , technology , and surveillance .
TIA , of course , would be “ Total Information Awareness , ” Darpa ’s effort to find potential enemies of the state in the data trails of ordinary folks .
The program was cancelled a few years back .
But a whole bunch of similar efforts continue throughout the government .
A former sigint type — who also talked to Ryan , apparently — suggests a different technological approach : the NSA “ may have compromised a hardware manufacturer — say Motorola or a satellite phone manufacturer , a telecom carrier or a satellite (s ) . “
I ’ll keep my ears open .
UPDATE 11:27 AM :
There ’s a ton of surveillance - related news that has come out in the last day , including :
- FBI spied on PETA
– Bush personally asked the Times to kill its NSA story
– “ Pentagon ’s Intelligence Authority Widens “
– DoD : gay law school groups a “ credible ” terror threat
UPDATE 12:22 PM : Laura points us to an absolute must - read post from Bill Arkin today :
In the spring of 2001 , NSA began to change direction in its counter - terrorism targeting under Lt. Gen .
Hayden : rather than analyzing the mass of what was collected hoping for the gem in the growing mass of available material , NSA began a methodical process of dissecting terrorist target communications practices and network to determine what to collect .
This is commonly referred to at NSA as hunting rather than gathering .
It was a procedure that was in its infancy on 9/11 .
So what happened ?
The perceived shackles of domestic collection were removed , the gathering process began again to overwhelm the hunting process , new software , data - mining and link analysis methods were applied to isolate potential domestic targets .
UPDATE 2:07 PM : Check out Bruce Schneier for a quick history of domestic eavesdropping .

The findings appeared in an audit of a children ’s hospital in Basra , but they referred to the wider reconstruction activities of the development agency in Iraq .
American and Iraqi officials reported this week that the State Department planned to drop Bechtel , its contractor on that project , as signs of budget and scheduling problems began to surface .
The United States Embassy in Baghdad referred questions about the audit to the State Department in Washington , where a spokesman , Justin Higgins , said Saturday , “ We have not yet had a chance to fully review this report , but certainly will consider it carefully , as we do all the findings of the inspector general . ”
Bechtel has said that because of the deteriorating security in Basra , the hospital project could not be completed as envisioned .
But Mr. Higgins said : “ Despite the challenges , we are committed to completing this project so that sick children in Basra can receive the medical help they need .
The necessary funding is now in place to ensure that will happen . ”
In March 2005 , A.I.D. asked the Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office at the United States Embassy in Baghdad for permission to downsize some projects to ease widespread financing problems .
In its request , it said that it had to “ absorb greatly increased construction costs ” at the Basra hospital and that it would make a modest shift of priorities and reduce “ contractor overhead ” on the project .
The embassy office approved the request .
But the audit found that the agency interpreted the document as permission to change reporting of costs across its program .

A mobile device is not just a portable communication gadget .
For many company owners and managers here in Singapore , it is practically part of their daily necessities to survive .
Smartphones always go with us — it sits with us on the table , keep us company in the bathroom and sleeps beside us in bed .
With the ever evolving needs of human , technology has got to adopt .
The mobile features of technology have quenched the thirst of business - minded people for better processes and productivity .
But has your business CRM system received the memo ?
Despite the countless benefits of mobile CRM and the tight competition in the industry , many companies and organizations in Singapore are still stuck on non-mobile solutions .
To convince you to finally make the big leap , here ’s a few of the many reasons why a mobile CRM software is beneficial for your growing company .
1. Mobile CRM is flexible
Depending on the industry , it is unlikely that your entire sales team stays seated in the office the whole day .
In fact , some sales staffs only see their desks in the office several times a month .
Regardless where your team members are , whether just down the office hall or in Europe , you can be sure that they have their phones with them always .
Mobile CRM software lets every person in the team access essential information and get the work done while on the go .
They do not need to go back to the office or look for a PC to get the job done .
2. Mobile CRM can streamline your sales process
Ideally , sales workforce should focus on getting more sales and new customers .
However , administrative tasks get in the way and easily eat up significant amount of their time .
If your CRM system does not have mobile features that allow automatic update of contact information , assigning tasks to every team member and logging of new leads , all of these things will have to wait until your staffs get back at their office table .
3. Mobile CRM lets you answer anytime , anywhere
Utilizing a CRM software from Singapore for your sales management and customer relationship management already is a plus to your business operations ; adding in a mobile feature on brings much more benefits to your overall productivity .
Combining cloud CRM and mobility will give your workforce a whole new dimension of customer relationship management capabilities .
Not only will your patrons be able to contact you whichever way they prefer , but you can respond and manage every case the best way possible with the help of your CRM .
4. Mobile CRM provides real - time responses
For sales agents , every minute counts .
Even a short five - minute delay to business processes can cost them a major sales opportunity .
So , try to figure out how many deals your sales reps would miss of they are not equipped with mobile CRM .
With mobile CRM , every sales agent can send and receive responses from their clients , prospects , co-agents and team leaders even when they are in the field .
Mobile CRM allows you to quickly respond to your prospects ’ queries while you ’re on your way to meeting another one .
5. Mobile CRM is ideal for collaborative works
In today ’s age of business and marketing , collaboration is the key .
There are times you will need to do collaborative works with your teammates to come up with the best solution to a customer or prospect client ’s concern .
Mobile CRM can help by providing you a detailed history of recent activities and other important data to engage with clients and leads .
In addition , you can share opportunities in real - time with member of your marketing , sales and / or customer service reps .
6. Mobile CRM enhances your customer service
Whether through phone call or personal meeting , when clients and prospects speak with you , they expect you to know everything about your products and services and to understand their needs .
Consumers can be demanding and want fast solutions and responses .
Mobile CRM lets you access all customer data anytime .
This way , you can eliminate back - and - forth calls and focus more on providing choices for solutions according to the needs of your client .
As a result , you will impress your clients and more likely to close deals with prospects .
Mobile CRM — Selling While On the Move
Integration of mobile CRM to your business operations can provide significant improvement to your sales management .
Everyone in your team can update information and synchronize all records while on the move and share data in real - time through cloud CRM .
Your staff can do their duties without being dependent on PC units and be able to conveniently perform everyday tasks , such as the following :
• Join meetings from remote locations through online calling
• Plan everyday tasks through calendar integration
• Manage sales effectively through sales reports and analytics
• Access and update lead and customer information
• Share files with the rest of the team
Today ’s CRM platforms can provide so much more elements .
Add cloud - based feature and you are no longer saving your files in a local network — you ’re saving it live and where everyone can access it from whichever device they choose .
Every team member has the complete analytics and data right at their fingertips for better customer relationship management .
The entire team can access all sorts of data , from sales reports to customer information , wherever and whenever they need and want .

Azul Sysmtes ( 米日 ) は Java や .NET に特化した専用計算機 Network Attached Processing ( NAP ) を提唱し、 製品として Azul Compute Appliance を開発した。 Azul Compute Appliance は、 すでに稼動中 の
Solaris / Linux の J2SE/J2 EE システムの Java VM を Azul Systems が提供するスタブ JVM に置き換えるだけで、 元のマシンで実行されていたプログラム( バイトコード ) が Azul Compute Appliance に転送・実行されるようになる リモート計算機だ ( * 1 ) 。
Azul Systems は専用の CPU ( Vega ) を一から設計・実装し、 その上で動く Azul Virtual Machine も独自開発し た ( * 2 ) 。 そのためふつ〜のプロセッサの
Java VM
にはない独自機構を数多く備えている。 このページでは NAP の特殊な機構のうち 、 JavaOne Tokyo 2005 で 開発者の Dr. Cliff Click から聞いた GC アルゴリズム部分を紹介する 。
ガーベージコレクショ ン( GC ) の分類方法には Stop - The - World 型 ( STW ) と
On - the - fly 型 の 2 つに分ける方法がある 。
STW は GC が起動する前にアプリケーションスレッ ド( Java の場合は Java スレッド ) を「 時よ止まれ」と全て停止ささせ、 その後にガーベージとなったオブジェクトを回収し、
回収が終わったらアプリケーションスレッドを再開するタイプの
GC だ。 そのためどうしても GC ポーズ時間 が生じる。 このポーズ時間の間、 タイマー処理もネットワークの待ち受けも停止して何もできない状態が続く。 そのためポーズ時間が長すぎるといろいろ破綻が起きる。
一方 On - the - fly 型 GC の場合、アプリケーションスレッドと GC スレッドが平行に動作し、 アプリケーションスレッドを完全に停止させることなく
GC スレッドがガーベージを再利用可能にしてゆく。
上の説明だけを読む と
On - the - fly 型の方が優れていると思うかもしれないが、 GC 以外も含めた全体性能・信頼性を比較する と
On - the - fly 型 GC は STW 型 GC に負けることが多い。 そのため各種言語・ランタイムの GC アルゴリズムを見ると、 STW 型を採用する方が多い 。
ただ GC 採用に先鞭をつけた Java システムは、 エンタープライズシステムの世界で使用されることが多くなってきた。
STW 型 GC の多くはメモリの使用量に比例して GC ポーズ時間が伸びてゆく傾向があるので、 Java 仮想マシンにギガバイト単位のメモリが与えられると、
GC ポーズ時間は数秒〜数分に到達するようになる。 これではたまらんので最近 の Sun、IBM の Java 仮想マシンは STW 型と On - the - fly 型の折衷であ る Mostly Concurrent Mark & Sweep を採用したりして 、GC ポーズ時間の増大を凌ごうとしている。 しかし mostly という単語がつくことから分かるように この GC は完全な無停止 GC ではなく、 やはり使用メモリ量に比例し たGC停止時間が必要となる。
ここから本題 。 Azul Sytems の NAP は Pauseless GC という一風変わった GC アルゴリズムを採用している。 Pauseless GC は理論上 STW がない。 にも関わらず性能もあまり悪くないというキ印もの 。
Pauseless GC は、 まず以下の 3 つのフェーズを持つ GC である 。
GC スレッドは marking → relocation → remap の順に GC を実行し、 その間にアプリケーションスレッドも平行( concurrent ) に動作する。 また 1回目の GC の remap phase と 2 回目の GC の makring phase も concurrent に重ね合わせることが可能だ 。
注目すべきは Pauseless GC は 「 オブジェクトの移動 」をやるタイプの
GC だという点。 GC の別の分類方法では 、 Mark & Sweep GC のようにオブジェクトを割り当てたら移動させず空き領域はフリーリストで管理する
GC と、 Copying GC や Mark & Compaction GC のようにオブジェクトを移動させて 連続した空き領域を作る GC に分類することができる 。
前者のオブジェクトの移動をしないタイプの方が
GC 時間は短くなるし concurrent にもしやすいが、 どうしてもメモリ空間の断片化が避けられない。 生きているオブジェクトが飛び石のようにヒープ中に散らばるので、 プログラムが長い間 稼動している と
「 100 M B のメモリがあって 90 % はフリーなの に 10 K バイトのオブジェクトが割り付けられない」というような事態に陥る。
それじゃ困るので実用を考えると メインの GC が非移動型でも フラグメンテーションが進んだ場合の奥の手として移動型 GC を用意せざるえない 。
一方、 後者のオブジェクト移動型 GC は メモリ空間に隙間がなくなりフリーな領域を有効に使用できるし、 空間内のオブジェクトの充填率が高い分 キャッシュヒット率も上げることができる。 ただしふつ〜のアーキテクチャでの
GC 実装では、 relocation と remap は Java スレッドを停止させた状態で同時に行う必要がある( * 3 ) 。 そのため 1回の GC ポーズ時間がどうしても長くなる傾向にある。 しかし Pauseless GC の場合 ここも concurrent に動作させることができる のが凄いのだ 。
もう一点すごいのは marking が完全に concurrent な点だ 。 Mostly concurrent ではない。 この実現方法が凄いと言うか、インチキというか... 鍵になっているのは ハードウェア・サポート だ。
Marking を Java スレッドと GC スレッドで並列にやるのは難しい。 2 つ問題がある 。
1つは、 marking をしている間に Java スレッドがプログラムを進めてしまうと、 それまで生きていたオブジェクトが死んでしまう可能性があること。 そのため concurrent marking は「 本当はガーベージなんだけど生きているとマークをつけてしまう」可能性がある。
ただこういう漏れガーベージは、効率が悪くなるがエラーにはならないので、無視することは可能だ。
も う1つはより深刻で、 「 本当は生きているんだけどマークがつけられない」可能性だ。
マーキングした後のオブジェクトを
Java スレッドが書き換えてしまうと問題が発生する。
図 1のようなパターンは、 GC スレッドと Java スレッドがコンテキストスイッチによってタイムスライスしながら動いていると考えて欲しい。
GC スレッドが Step1 まで処理を進めた後で停止し 、Java スレッドが Step2 の処理をしてしまうと、 Step3 で GC スレッドが再開してもオブジェク ト
E が未マークのまま放置されることになる。 誤ってガーベージと判定されてしまうのだ。 オブジェク ト E を回収してしまうと、 エラーが発生することになる 。
このマーク漏れの問題を Mostly Concurrent Marking は、 concurrent marking phase と serial makring phase の 2 つ に分けることで解決した。 最初 、GC スレッドが concurrent marking phase を処理している間 は Java スレッドに動作させることができるが、 concurrent marking phase が終了する と
Java スレッドは停止させ て GC スレッドだけが serial marking phase で塗り洩らしの解決をする。 つまり serial marking phase 中は STW だ。
塗り残しとなるのは、 Java スレッドによって参照が書き換えられたオブジェクトである。 そのため Java スレッドは write barrier を導入し、 参照の書き換えが起こったオブジェクトに専用のタグを打っていく。
Serial marking phase では、 「 マーク済みであり 」かつ「書き換えタグ」がついたオブジェクトを起点にして
2度目のマーキングを行う。 処理が完了すれば、生きているオブジェクトの全てがマーク済みになる。
だが mostly concurrent marking には serial makring phase でどうしても STW が必要になってしまう。 経験的には concurrent marking phase で大部分のマーキングを済ませることができ serial marking phase は残りの部分だけを行うので 大概の場合には STW 時間は短い。 ただしオブジェクトのリンク状態によっては serial marking phase に時間がかかることもある。 このため 「 最悪 」 の GC ポーズ時間は短くならない 。
Pauseless GC は別のアプローチを使う。 それは巡回したオブジェクトにマークをつけると同時に、 巡回に使った参照にもチェックをつけるという方法だ。
Java の参照は実装的にはメモリ上のオブジェクトの位置を指す「 ポインタ」として実装されている。
Java オブジェクトは 64 ビット境界にあわせて配置されるので 「 ポインタ 」の下位3ビットは常に
0 になる。 常に 0 になっているビットというのは冗長なので、 このビットの一つを Not -Marked - Through ( NMT ) bit というタグに転用する。 GC スレッドは marking 中に巡回した参 照 ( ポインタ ) の NMT ビットを立て、 巡回・未巡回を区別していく 。
同時に Java スレッドも concurrent marking に協力する 。 Java スレッドがオブジェクトの参照をする時に read barrier を行う。 NMT bit がセットされていない参 照( ポインタ ) をロードすると、 Java スレッドは発見した未巡回ポインタを GC スレッドの queue に突っ込み、 ( 後で同じトラップに引っかからないように ) NMT bit を立てて元の処理に戻る 。
C++ であらわすと LoadReferenceWithReadBarrier のようになる。
Object* LoadReferenceWithReadBarrier ( Object ** address ) { intptr_t value = ( intptr_t ) ( * address ) ; if ( value & NMT_MASK ) { return ( Object * ) ( ~7 & value ) ; // 下位3 ビットのクリア } else { Object * pointer = ( Object * ) value ; push_marking_queue ( pointer ) ; // marking queue * address = ( Object * ) ( value | NMT_MASK ) ; // NMT bit をセット return pointer ; } } // メモリ上にあるオブジェクトのポインタ pointer を使用する時は LoadReferenceWithReadBarrier を通してから extern Object * pointer ; Object * p = LoadReferenceWithReadBarrier ( &pointer ) ; int fieldValue = p->getField ( fieldDescriptor ) ;

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Israel Lebanon Middle East Disarmament or or Create Your Own
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
We Americans like to think we 're a pretty smart people , even when evidence to the contrary is overwhelming .
And nowhere is that evidence more overwhelming than in the Middle East .
History in the Middle East is everything , and we Americans seem to learn nothing from it .
President Harry Truman took about 20 minutes to recognize the state of Israel when it declared independence in 1948 .
Since then , more than 58 years of war , terrorism and blood - letting have led to the events of the past week .
Even now , as Katyusha rockets rain down on northern Israel and Israeli fighter jets blast Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon , we simultaneously decry radical Islamist terrorism and Israel 's lack of restraint in defending itself .
And the U.S. government , which wants no part of a cease - fire until Israel is given every opportunity to rescue its kidnapped soldiers and destroy as many Hezbollah and Hezbollah armaments as possible , urges caution in the interest of preserving a nascent and fragile democratic government in Lebanon .
Could we be more conflicted ?
While the United States provides about $ 2.5 billion in military and economic aid to Israel each year , U.S. aid to Lebanon amounts to no more than $ 40 million .
This despite the fact that the per capita GDP of Israel is among the highest in the world at $ 24,600 , nearly four times as high as Lebanon 's GDP per capita of $ 6,200 .
Lebanon 's lack of wealth is matched by the Palestinians -- three out of every four Palestinians live below the poverty line .
Yet the vast majority of our giving in the region flows to Israel .
This kind of geopolitical inconsistency and shortsightedness has contributed to the Arab - Israeli conflict that the Western world seems content to allow to perpetuate endlessly .
After a week of escalating violence , around two dozen Israelis and roughly 200 Lebanese have died .
That has been sufficient bloodshed for United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and British Prime Minister Tony Blair to join in the call for an international security force , ignoring the fact that a U.N. force is already in Southern Lebanon , having failed to secure the border against Hezbollah 's incursions and attacks and the murder and kidnapping of Israeli soldiers .
As our airwaves fill with images and sounds of exploding Hezbollah rockets and Israeli bombs , this seven - day conflict has completely displaced from our view another war in which 10 Americans and more than 300 Iraqis have died during the same week .
And it is a conflict now of more than three years duration that has claimed almost 15,000 lives so far this year alone .
An estimated 50,000 Iraqis and more than 2,500 American troops have been killed since the insurgency began in March of 2003 , which by some estimates is more than the number of dead on both sides of the Arab - Israeli conflict over the past 58 years of wars and intifadas .
Yet we have seen no rescue ships moving up the Euphrates for Iraqis who are dying in their streets , markets and mosques each day .
French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin has not leaped to Baghdad as he did Beirut .
And there are no meetings of the Arab League , and no U.S. diplomacy with Egypt , Syria and Jordan directed at ending the Iraqi conflict .
In the Middle East , where is our sense of proportion ?
Where is our sense of perspective ?
Where is our sense of decency ?
And , finally , just how smart are we ?
Radiozeugnisse : Versetzung gefährdet Horst Müller
Deutschlands Radiosender befinden sich auf dem
Weg in eine ernsthafte Krise
Innerhalb eines halben Jahres sind den Hörfunkern weit mehr als eine halbe Million Hörer abhanden gekommen .
Das ist zumindest das Kernergebnis der Media - Analyse , die am 8 .
März veröffentlicht wurde .
Für die als „ offizielle Währung “ im deutschen Radiomarkt geltende Untersuchung waren im Frühjahr und Herbst des vergangenen Jahres mehr als 58.000 Deutsche telefonisch befragt worden .
Grund zum Jubeln gab ’s eigentlich nur in Ismaning bei München .
Unter Radiomanagern kursiert eine Faustregel für Umsatzsteigerungen : Pro 10.000 dazu gewonnener Hörer in der Media - Analyse , erhöhen sich die Werbeumsätze im Folgejahr um 1 Million Euro .
Für Antenne Bayern hieße das ein Umsatzplus von 15 Millionen Euro – schließlich wurde für den Privatsender in der aktuell veröffentlichten Media - Analyse ein Zugewinn von knapp 150.000 - auf fast eine Million Hörer - in der Durchschnittstunde ausgewiesen .
„ Antenne Bayern schlägt alle Rekorde “ , freuten sich die Radiomacher aus Ismaning bei München in einer eilig verbreiteten Pressemitteilung und stellten zudem fest , dass „ Antenne Bayern seit heute nicht nur Bayerns , sondern Deutschlands meistgehörter Radiosender “ sei .
Mit „ Dingsbums “ zum Erfolg
Ganz korrekt ist diese Feststellung nicht – schließlich sind die Daten der jetzt veröffentlichten Media - Analyse zwischen sechs und 12 Monate alt .
Und auch die von Antenne Bayern angeführten Gründe für den Erfolg sind zweifelhaft : “ Es war der Mut der Mannschaft manchmal andere Wege zu gehen , als die anderen .
So haben wir in den letzten Jahren unser Informationsangebot kontinuierlich ausgebaut “ , ließ Programmdirektorin Valerie Weber per Pressemitteilung verlauten .
Die von groß angelegten Anzeigen - und Plakatierungskampagnen begleiteten Gewinnaktionen des Senders wie „ Dingsbums “ , hat die Radiofrau in diesem Zusammenhang lieber verschwiegen .
Auffallend ist allerdings , dass Antenne Bayern seine Hörerzahlen kontinuierlich steigert , seitdem Radioberater Rik de Lisle den Hörfunkern aus Ismaning bei München vor knapp zwei Jahren den massiven Einsatz der zumeist dümmlichen Aktionen mit hohen Gewinnversprechen verordnet hatte .
„ Losbudenradio “ mit begrenzter Haltbarkeit
Dass diese
Art von Losbudenradio nur eine begrenzte Haltbarkeit hat , müssen andere – ebenfalls von de Lisle betreute - Privatprogramme längst registrieren .
In den vergangenen zwei Jahren verlor der sächsische Privatsender Radio PSR mehr als ein Drittel seiner Hörerschaft .
„ Radscho , nee lass ma “ , sagen sich offenbar immer mehr Sachsen .
Allein im Freistaat sind in dieser Media - Analyse über 50.000 Hörer weniger aufgelistet , als noch ein halbes Jahr zuvor .
Bundesweit kamen gar über 550.000 Hörer abhanden .
Vor allem bei den Jüngeren macht sich immer mehr Radiomüdigkeit breit .
In der vermeintlich werberelevanten Zielgruppe der 14 - 49 jährigen waren es diesmal allein 489.000 Hörer weniger – das ist innerhalb eines halben Jahres ein Rückgang von 3,9 % .
Wohl nie zuvor ist die Nutzung eines Mediums in Deutschland in einer vergleichbar kurzen Zeit dermaßen stark gesunken .
Radio befindet sich längst in einer ernsthaften Krise .
Das werden demnächst wohl auch Werbeentscheider zunehmend feststellen und gemeinsam mit ehemaligen – vor allem jüngeren - Hörern zu anderen Medien wie dem Internet abwandern .
Ob die Faustregel für Umsatzsteigerungen für den „ MA - Gewinner “ Antenne Bayern überhaupt noch zutreffen wird , ist offen .
Programmdirektorin
Weber hauchte dennoch am Mittwoch mehrfach ein „ Danke fürs Einschalten “ ins Mikrofon ihres Senders .
Horst Müller ist Professor für Redaktionspraxis im Fachbereich Medien an der Hochschule Mittweida ( FH ) .

Give users a Hollywood ending
We can all take a lesson from filmmakers : endings matter .
The way we end a conversation , blog post , user experience , presentation , tech support session , chapter , church service , song , whatever ... is what they 'll remember most .
The end can matter more to users than everything we did before .
And the feeling they leave with is the one they might have forever .
Think of all the movies where the best song is saved for the ending .
A big chunk of " Best Original Song " Academy Award winners have been songs that played only during the closing credits .
They want you to leave the theater with the feeling that song evoked .
When a movie goes through " beta " ( a test screening ) , the studios are n't looking for feedback on the whole damn movie ... they 're measuring audience reaction to the end .
If the audience hates the ending ( too sad , too absurd , too unresolved , etc. ) , that 's what they reshoot .
I was reminded of the power of endings when I went to another Red Rocks concert a few weeks ' back -- this time it was David Gray ( with Aimme Mann and Beth Orton ) .
Whatever you may think of David Gray 's music , the guy gives good encore .
They 're like a whole separate show , and he leaves you feeling with a powerful , emotional , energetic , finale .
It 's not just filmmakers that appreciate The End - - learning theory has known this for a long time .
Students in a classroom are more likely to remember what they learned / heard / did first and last than whatever happened in the middle .
It 's the Recency Effect ( along with its counterpart for beginings , the Primacy Effect ) .
Good teachers try to have more beginnings and endings by breaking up lessons into small chunks , rather than doing a single 45 - minute lecture .
In fact , here 's what matters in my blog posts :
From a retention and recall view , middles suck .
So let 's talk about endings since they 're one of my personal weak spots .
Even when psychology / cognitive science tells us that the end can matter more than the middle , it feels counterintuitive .
We focus so heavily on the meaty - middle while the ending is just a tacked on afterthought .
So what if we left the customer feeling frustrated and unsatisfied with our tech support as long as they know we spent a ton of time trying ?
Who cares if the presentation just ... sort ... of ... fades ... out ... if the rest of it was killer ?
And the ending of a chapter is just another paragraph , right ?
Yes , I want to think more like a filmmaker on this .
As Sacha Molitorisz put it in Now that 's an ending :
" When a film resolves itself well , audiences leave satisfied and content , even if the preceding 90 minutes have been uninspiring .
If , however , the climax is forced or implausible , the preceding scenes will be stripped of any poignancy .
In other words : a terrific ending can make an excellent film a masterpiece ; a dud ending can ruin an otherwise intriguing offering . "
But even if you buy into the power of the ending , the next question is , " What kind of ending ? "
Should it be a Hollywood ending ?
As opposed to , say , an indie finish ?
That depends on your definition and the circumstances , of course .
There 's hollywood endings and then there 's HOLLYWOOD ENDINGS .
Not all Hollywood endings must be happy , and not all indie films must end in complete and utter incomprehensability ( in that " I 'm more unresolved than thou " way . )
It all gets back to what we hope our users will think and feel at the end .
I need to be asking the right questions about my goals , to figure out how to end :
* Do I want to help my users memorize something ?
Then I should stick that at the end , or at least repeat it at the end .
* Do I want to help and motivate my users to do something ?
Then I should end with what the sales / ad / preachers refer to as an inspiring Call To Action .
* Do I want my users to think more deeply ( or more creatively ) about something ?
Then I should end with some things still unresolved ( easy for me since I 've rarely figured anything all - the - way out ) .
* Do I want my users to be curious ?
Then I should end with a teaser ... something that hints at what 's to come , whether it's new products , new capabilities the user will have , new and exciting ways for them to participate , etc .
Leave them with a question ...
* Do I want my users to care about something ?
Then I should end by giving them a damn good reason ... something that touches the emotional side of their brain .
( Note : by " care " I 'm talking about things like , " care about writing software tests " or " care about creating good user docs " or " care about the importance of endings . " )
* Do I want my users to know that we care about them ?
Then make sure the user experience has a satisfying ending , and that means every session .
( Think of how many times you 've bought something online and while the shopping part is compelling , once they 've taken your credit card info you 're lucky to even get a text confirmation on the screen . )
* Do I want my users to feel like they kick ass ?
Then I should focus less on what they think of me or my product , and more on how they 'll feel about themselves as a result of the interaction .
If they experience frustration , confusion , fear , anxiety , intimidation , and so on , that can be an " I suck " experience .
So , endings are crucial .
They 're what sticks .
But why , then , are there so many examples of bad ( or at least wimpy ) endings ?
What do YOU think ?
Do you have any examples of good or bad endings ?

My favorite endings are ones that took you someplace you did n't expect - but yet make a whole lot of new " connections " to all the stuff that came before as well as your own experience .
Good writers / storytellers / movie makers do it well .

I 'm in the process of putting together a presentation on what I have accomplished in my 4 years as the IT Manager at a university residential college and have been trying to work out on what point I wanted to end .
Having just read your post , I 've now gone back and reorganised it to end on a much stronger finish than what I was going to have !
So great article Kathy and good timing :)

" When a film resolves itself well , audiences leave satisfied and content , even if the preceding 90 minutes have been uninspiring . "
I can think of good movies with bad endings but I can't think of a single bad movie with a good ending .
Even if one exists , it certainly would n't leave me satisfied .
" Oh my god , that movie sucked !
Oh , but cool ending " .
NOT .
Likewise , if your presentation sucks , a good ending is n't going to save it .
Posted by : Daniel Berger | Aug 16 , 2006 10:43:55 PM
Sara : excellent point !
It was Mamet , I think , who said that when things happen in the film they should be " surprising yet self - evident " ( I think I made a post on that somewhere on this blog ... )
I like to think of that for teaching , especially , where you set up completely unexpected scenarios , but then afterwards you think , " Of COURSE ... how else could it possibly have worked ? "
Hobbes : good for you , and good luck : )
Daniel : " ... I ca n't think of a single bad movie with a good ending . "
Well , you may have just proved the point -- how can you say that your perception of the movie was n't * changed * ( backward in time , even ) , by the ending ?
How do we know for certain that our opinion of the entire movie was n't altered by the end ?
But I do think that the notion of an ending fixing something no matter how bad it is would be pretty ridiculous , but that 's not what I said .
And if a presentation truly sucks , an ending wo n't fix that , but that 's not what I said .
An ending cannot work a miracle , but it CAN make a big difference in how all that went before it is perceived ( or at least recalled ) .
Brains are full of tricks .
There 's an unrelated but potentially relevant set of studies that have proven that people WILL change their perception of * the very same piece of video visuals * based solely on the quality of the audio .
If the audio is good , their perception / rating of the * visuals * goes UP .
If the quality of the audio is bad , they do not say , " The video was good but the audio sucked " , but rather they honestly believe that the visuals were worse as well .
We know from these studies that the power of audio is ( in this context ) more important than the visuals , because the reverse is not true .
Nobody changed their opinion of the audio based on the visual quality .
In other words , sound has the power to alter our perception of visual quality , but visuals do not have the power to alter our perception of the audio quality .
OK , now I 'm not sure why I brought that up ; )
But at least it does show that our perception of things ( in this case , films ) can be altered by the quality of a particular aspect .
And while I know that her comment was extreme , I worked for a motion picture ad agency ( and did work for several studios ) long enough to see just how much the ending really * did * matter during those tests .
There are lots of other situations , too , where our perception of one thing changes our perception of something else .
I 'll have to do a post on how students rank the quality of their instructors ...

Curses !
Sara stole my comment ! ( nearly ) :-)
I was going to point out that one trap to avoid when thinking of your killer ending is that the end is not necessarily where you think it is .
Just because you 're the one who gave the presentation , or you 're the one who wrote the blog entry , or you 're the one who delivered the stuff that enabled the user experience - do n't be lulled into thinking that you 're the one who gets to say where the ending is going to be .
If one of your customers calls up for support on your product - that 's not a _new_ interaction .
That 's just replacing the ending on the last interaction that you had with your customer .
You did well last time ?
You delivered a kick - a** product to your customer ?
That can all come unravelled when they next talk to you .
Likewise , blog entries .
You 've spent a heap of time coming up with the perfect ending to your article - but if you reply to a specific reader 's comments ... it 's _that_ reply that will be remembered by that reader as the " ending " .
Which reminds me of a philosophy suggested once :
" Live every day as if it were your last .
And one day ... you 'll be right ! "
Posted by : omni | Aug 16 , 2006 11:11:00 PM
omni : you rock .
And I 'm not just saying that so it 'll be the thing you remember ; )
Now I am going to remember this :
" one trap to avoid when thinking of your killer ending is that the end is not necessarily where you think it is .
Just because you 're the one who gave the presentation , or you 're the one who wrote the blog entry , or you 're the one who delivered the stuff that enabled the user experience - do n't be lulled into thinking that you 're the one who gets to say where the ending is going to be . "
You certainly got MY brain spinning .
Hmmmm ... and what if we applied this to beginnings as well ?
( And of course our writing teachers always try to tell us that we should never begin at the beginning )
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Aug 16 , 2006 11:20:00 PM
Kathy ,
Thank you !
Very smooth ! ;-)
But that 's an excellent idea about beginings !
As an example :
I guess if you get it right , the chances are much higher that the word of mouth " marketing " power of a passionate user base is going to get to new people - begining the association - before your own marketing efforts kick in .
I guess the question that springs to mind is :
Is it possible to ( usefully ) take all of that into account when designing the stuff that our users will experience ?
Or is it counter - productive to try ?
Posted by : omni | Aug 17 , 2006 12:14:28 AM
In the beginning I give the benefit of doubt and pay extra attention .
Then by its own nature my mind wanders .
There is so much processing about right and wrong ( wrt my world view , prior knowledge , this and that )
When the end comes there is automatic realization about the wandering and again I pay extra attention .

Nicely done .
But not quite the complete picture .
Research by the likes of Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahnemann and Dan Arielly show quite clearly that people actually use three factors when evaluating how good an experience was .
One is obviously the ending .
The other two are the trend ( getting better vs. getting worse ) and the highest emotional point .
Interestingly , in most circumstances , the length of time is n't factored into the evaluation .
The best approach when designing an experience is obviously to gradually build up to a high point right at the end .
The ending alone is not enough to create a great evaluation .
Do n't take it from me .
Read it for yourself in Kahnemann 's 2002 Nobel Prize lecture at http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2002/kahnemann-lecture.pdf
Take care when designing experiences , not to design solely for the customer 's thinking brain .
Neurobiology research shows that 95 % of the evaluation of an experience is done through non-conscious evaluation of the emotions and associated feelings the experience evokes .

Great points as ever Kathy , but let 's not underplay the middle - yes it can sag and be flabby but if we 're disciplined it can also conform to Pescian logic and roll us through to the ending .
And not in the style of the middle of a David Gray concert where the prevalent emotion must surely be " will this ever end ? "
Posted by : John Dodds | Aug 17 , 2006 3:32:10 AM
It 's what I 've always called the big pink bow .
We naturally want everything neatly tied off , with nothing left unresolved .
I 'm like this about disagreements - I want resolution .
It drives my husband nuts because I can't let a thing go until we have achieved resolution , while he 's quite happy to put it behind him and move on .
On the subject of presentations , though , I provided training in presentation skills for many years and one of the things I found was that a presentation often worked better if the intended closing paragraph was brought to the beginning , the intended opening paragraph scrapped and a new ending written .
So yes , it always seemed the most tweaking needed to focus on the start and finish .

As a mountain biker racer , VP sales and Enthusiast Blogger for yourmtb.com , my entire thought process is the end game .
1. Winning the race
2. Closing the sale
3 . Writing a good blog people will remember
Your post clued me into a couple of ideas I should use when considering the ending :
1. Race with the end in mind .
Do n't worry about attacking out of the gate .
Stay calm and relax into the course .
Let the other riders burn out .
2 . The preliminary software sales work , i.e. marketing , promotion , conversation , etc. is nothing without the " sale " at the end .
Focus on getting the sale not on everything else .
3 . Write short and simple paragraphs with the ending in mind .
Do n't worry about the guts of the paragraph .
Keep it tight , yet end with a BANG !

What about cultural differences ?
One thing that comes to mind for me is the immense difference between a typical Hollywood movie vs. a typical Asian film .
To generalize , if it 's Asian , the hero is gonna die .
If it 's American , the hero rides into the sunset .
I realize I 'm generalizing here , but I have to wonder if the way you frame your endings should change based on whether you 're presenting to an audience from a different culture ?
Would giving a " big pink bow " to a conservative Japanese client be less satisfying than ... hmmm , now I can't think of a positive way to express killing off the hero .
" Sacrifice the product for the user ! " , maybe ?
Anyway , just wanted to point out that there are different cultural expectations of pacing , ending , and ( I can't wait for the " seduction " post ! ) beginnings .

The ironic part about this post is that it is LONG ( not unlike many of your posts ) .
I read the first couple of paragraphs , tuned out for the middle , and read the last paragraph or three .
This is n't intended to be a slam or critique , merely an observation of the intersection of your writing style , my reading style , and today 's post .
Posted by : jt | Aug 17 , 2006 10:43:21 AM
It 's a great point you make here .
As a public speaker , I see many times how a good ending is more important than most of what is said .
I think the beginning is a bit more important than the ending just because capturing attention is essentail to have people listening before the end .
One thing I would add about the middle .
Most people do n't think about the pace and timing of the middle .
If the middle is too long , then the user never makes it to the end .
They have checked out before then .
You can put sections in the middle to make it seem less long , but you still have to capture attention at each section to maintain interest .
It 's very formulaic , but the grade school rule of one intro paragraph , three body paragraphs and one concluding paragraph is an actually very useful tool in pacing and flow .

Castaway was a great movie , but its ending really sucked , in my opinion .
The last half - hour , or however long , is just a gradual decline , leading up to a final shot of Tom Hanks with a goofy smile .
The best ending I can think of is the original Super Mario Bros .
The game itself is very solid , and while the " ending " is rather short , it gives you exactly what you want : more gameplay !
You start the game over , but now it 's more challenging .
It 's too bad they did n't continue this in the later games .
On a similar note , Super Mario Bros. 2 has a decent ending , story - wise .
The game does n't really make sense ; none of the enemies are familiar and the method of killing them is kind of absurd .
When you finally beat the last guy , you find out that Mario was dreaming .
It 's kind of cliché , but it makes the entire game sort of make sense .
Years later , I discovered that SMB2 was really a different Japanese game but with different graphics , which explains the different game mechanics .

With regards to the ending of a shopping experience , I think CDBaby rocks above all others .
Here 's the e-mail they send to you after you 've made a purchase :
-- begin
Your CDs have been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination - free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow .
A team of 50 employees inspected your CDs and polished them to make sure they were in the best possible condition before mailing .
Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as he put your CDs into the finest gold - lined box that money can buy .
We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of Portland waved ' Bon Voyage ! ' to your package , on its way to you , in our private CD Baby jet on this day , Tuesday , August 15th .
I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby .
We sure did .
Your picture is on our wall as " Customer of the Year " .
We 're all exhausted but can't wait for you to come back to CDBABY .
COM !!
-- end
How 's _that_ for a rousing shopping experience ? =)
Kathy , I dig the bit about sound affecting one 's impression of a visual piece .
When I was younger I used to play a game called Fury 3 .
I could never get the sound to work though so I 'd make my own sound effects .
It was awesome ; I had so much fun with that game .

I may be wandering far afield here , but jumping off Graham Hill 's post about evaluating an experience by non-conscious emotional reactions and later comments on audio affecting the video , I 've seen one instance lately that might demonstrate the points .
It 's a commercial by a big aerospace contractor .
The music is soft and lilting , as if it belongs with footage of a picnic .
But the visuals are military aircraft and targeting systems .
( The company uses the same track more effectively in other commercials , for a campaign effect , I guess . )
The spot left me disturbed and confused , and it 's ending was only good because it meant the spot was over .
The power of music and audio quality to make or break an entire av experience , I think , is stronger than many realize .
Thanks for another thoughtful post , Kathy .
As usual , I feel momentarily smarter for having dropped by .

The ending is especially important when the recepient is likely to experience it .
That 's not always the case , you know .
If you make movies or teach , only very few people will actually leave during the show .
But if you are making content for the web or tv , you will probably find that the beginning is even more important than the end .
Because the most difficult part of your job is to make people slow down and read / view whatever you made .
Posted by : Per Esmann Jensen | Aug 18 , 2006 1:23:00 PM
Kathy ,
While I agree that endings are very important ( you 're always as good as your last show ) , and you want to send people off with something to remember , I also think it 's really critical to have a meaty middle that grabs and holds attention .
For example , I read your blog as often as I can , and I must say that each time I read it I feel like I 've just discovered something - a new thought , phrase , concept .
What I 've discoverd is introduced to me in the beginning and maybe punctuated at the end , but it 's the nuggets in that consistently great middle that I remember .
So , please do n't change your style !
As a software interface designer , I think that every task you try to get someone through has an ending - the most satisfying ending ( of course ) is for the user to have gotten there with no pain , feeling smart and pleased that they accomplished what they set out to do , and having the process be learnable and memorable so they want to do it again ( cause in most cases they have to ) .
And if what the user produces as a result of this task delights them , then that 's the Hollywood ending I 'd like .
Does n't happen enough though .
Beginnings ...
The beginning is making the access to the task recognizable , intuitive , and natural .
Middles ...
The middle is the hardest - those clues , both verbal and visual , that guide you through the journey of the task .
So how about after you write something about beginnings , you could consider those middles again .
Maybe you 'd have something more complimentary to say about them ?
Just a thought .

Points well taken and well considered .
But neither the post , nor any of the comments have covered the obvious advice that most expository writers , speakers , or presenters miss :
WRITE / DESIGN THE ENDING FIRST .
When you know where you 're going , first you can build towards it .
Second , it makes editing down much easier : everything that builds toward the ending stays , anything that does n't serve the experience of the ending , dele .
Dollars to donuts that advice given in advance would have saved Karyn ( above ) the trouble of moving endings to the beginning and designing a new ending .

Why are n't most blogging tools designed to encourage this strategy as well as desktop word processors or outliners ?

It is ironic that this will , after my death , probably be the one thing that anyone remembers from my writing .
I was just a punk when Common Lisp was standardized by a bunch of guys who'd been writing Lisp code for 10 years or more .
Although I contributed a few fixes and minor improvements to the Lisp Machine operating system , I was always more interested in application programs and put 99 percent of my effort into building some big computer - aided engineering systems .
So I definitely do n't belong in the pantheon of Lisp Gods .
I 'm an impatient pragmatist and hate to spend time working on tools .
When I start a project , I survey my friends who are experts to find out what the best tools are , and then run with it .
So when I was a nerdlet at MIT it was the MIT Lisp Machine .
When I was building my first large - scale multi-user Internet applications , it was Oracle .
-- Philip Greenspun , September 27 , 2003
Google posed a unique problem for the censors :
Because the company had no office at the time inside the country , the Chinese government had no legal authority over it -- no ability to demand that Google voluntarily withhold its search results from Chinese users .
And the firewall only half - worked in Google 's case : it could block sites that Google pointed to , but in some cases it would let slip through a list of search results that included banned sites .
So if you were in Shanghai and you searched for " human rights in China " on google.com , you would get a list of search results that included Human Rights in China ( hrichina.org ) , a New York - based organization whose Web site is banned by the Chinese government .
But if you tried to follow the link to hrichina.org , you would get nothing but an error message ; the firewall would block the page .
You could see that the banned sites existed , in other words , but you could n't reach them .
Government officials did n't like this situation -- Chinese citizens were receiving constant reminders that their leaders felt threatened by certain subjects -- but Google was popular enough that they were reluctant to block it entirely .
In 2002 , though , something changed , and the Chinese government decided to shut down all access to Google .
Why ?
Theories abound .
Sergey Brin , the co-founder of Google , whose responsibilities include government relations , told me that he suspects the block might have been at the instigation of a competitor -- one of its Chinese rivals .
Brin is too diplomatic to accuse anyone by name , but various American Internet executives told me they believe that Baidu has at times benefited from covert government intervention .
A young Chinese - American entrepreneur in Beijing told me that she had heard that the instigator of the Google blockade was Baidu , which in 2002 had less than 3 percent of the search market compared with Google 's 24 percent .
" Basically , some Baidu people sat down and did hundreds of searches for banned materials on Google , " she said .
( Like many Internet businesspeople I spoke with in China , she asked to remain anonymous , fearing retribution from the authorities . )
" Then they took all the results , printed them up and went to the government and said , ' Look at all this bad stuff you can find on Google ! '
That 's why the government took Google offline . "
Baidu strongly denies the charge , and when I spoke to Guo Liang , a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing , he dismissed the idea and argued that Baidu is simply a stronger competitor than Google , with a better grasp of Chinese desires .
Still , many Beijing high - tech insiders told me that it is common for domestic Internet firms to complain to the government about the illicit content of competitors , in the hope that their rivals will suffer the consequences .
In China , the censorship regime is not only a political tool ; it is also a competitive one -- a cudgel that private firms use to beat one another with .
Self - Discipline Awards
When I visited a dingy Internet cafe one November evening in Beijing , its 120 or so cubicles were crammed with teenagers .
( Because computers and home Internet connections are so expensive , many of China 's mostly young Internet users go online in these cafes , which charge mere pennies per hour and provide fast broadband -- and cold soft drinks . )
Everyone in the cafe looked to be settled in for a long evening of lightweight entertainment : young girls in pink and yellow Hello Kitty sweaters juggled multiple chat sessions , while upstairs a gang of young Chinese soldiers in olive - drab coats laughed as they crossed swords in the medieval fantasy game World of Warcraft .
On one wall , next to a faded kung - fu movie poster , was a yellow sign that said , in Chinese characters , " Do not go to pornographic or illegal Web sites . "
The warning seemed almost beside the point ; nobody here looked even remotely likely to be hunting for banned Tiananmen Square retrospectives .
I asked the cafe manager , a man with huge aviator glasses and graying hair , how often his clients try to view illegal content .
Not often , he said with a chuckle , and when they do , it 's usually pornography .
He said he figured it was the government 's job to keep banned materials inaccessible .
" If it 's not supposed to be seen , " he said , " it 's not supposed to be seen . "
One mistake Westerners frequently make about China is to assume that the government is furtive about its censorship .
On the contrary , the party is quite matter of fact about it -- proud , even .
One American businessman who would speak only anonymously told me the story of attending an award ceremony last year held by the Internet Society of China for Internet firms , including the major Internet service providers .
" I 'm sitting there in the audience for this thing , " he recounted , " and they say , ' And now it 's time to award our annual Self - Discipline Awards ! '
And they gave 10 companies an award .
They gave them a plaque .
They shook hands .
The minister was there ; he took his picture with each guy .
It was basically like Excellence in Self - Censorship -- and everybody in the audience is , like , clapping . "
Internet censorship in China , this businessman explained , is presented as a benevolent police function .
In January , the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau created two cuddly little anime - style cartoon " Internet Police " mascots named " Jingjing " and " Chacha " ; each cybercop has a blog and a chat window where Chinese citizens can talk to them .
As a Shenzhen official candidly told The Beijing Youth Daily , " The main function of Jingjing and Chacha is to intimidate . "
The article went on to explain that the characters are there " to publicly remind all Netizens to be conscious of safe and healthy use of the Internet , self - regulate their online behavior and maintain harmonious Internet order together . "
Intimidation and " self - regulation " are , in fact , critical to how the party communicates its censorship rules to private - sector Internet companies .
To be permitted to offer Internet services , a private company must sign a license agreeing not to circulate content on certain subjects , including material that " damages the honor or interests of the state " or " disturbs the public order or destroys public stability " or even " infringes upon national customs and habits . "
One prohibition specifically targets " evil cults or superstition , " a clear reference to Falun Gong .
But the language is , for the most part , intentionally vague .
It leaves wide discretion for any minor official in China 's dozens of regulatory agencies to demand that something he finds offensive be taken offline .
Government officials from the State Council Information Office convene weekly meetings with executives from the largest Internet service companies -- particularly major portals that run news stories and host blogs and discussion boards -- to discuss what new topics are likely to emerge that week that the party would prefer be censored .
" It 's known informally as the ' wind - blowing meeting ' -- in other words , which way is the wind blowing , " the American businessman told me .
The government officials provide warnings for the days ahead , he explained .
" They say : ' There 's this party conference going on this week .
There are some foreign dignitaries here on this trip . ' "
American Internet firms typically arrive in China expecting the government to hand them an official blacklist of sites and words they must censor .
They quickly discover that no master list exists .
Instead , the government simply insists the firms interpret the vague regulations themselves .
The companies must do a sort of political mind reading and intuit in advance what the government wo n't like .
Last year , a list circulated online purporting to be a blacklist of words the government gives to Chinese blogging firms , including " democracy " and " human rights . "
In reality , the list had been cobbled together by a young executive at a Chinese blog company .
Every time he received a request to take down a posting , he noted which phrase the government had objected to , and after a while he developed his own list simply to help his company avoid future hassles .

The real scandal of Tom DeLay
WASHINGTON , D.C. ( Creators Syndicate ) -- Forget the freebie trips across the Atlantic and the Pacific .
Forget the casinos and the allegedly illicit contributions -- they represent only degrees of avarice .
To grasp the moral bankruptcy of the public Tom DeLay , the House majority leader , you only have to know about Frank Murkowski and Saipan .
Today , Frank Murkowki is the governor of Alaska , but from 1980 to 2002 , he was a conservative Republican senator from Alaska .
How conservative ?
His voting record earned him zero ratings from organized labor 's AFL - CIO and the liberal Americans for Democratic Action , and perfect 100s from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Conservative Union .
But as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , Frank Murkowski became furious at the abusive sweatshop conditions endured by workers , overwhelmingly immigrants , in the U.S. territory of the Northern Mariana Islands , of which Saipan is the capital .
Because they were produced in a territory of the United States , garments traveled tariff - free and quota - free to the profitable U.S. market and were entitled to display the coveted " Made in the USA " label .
Among the manufacturers that had profited from the un - free labor market on the island were Tommy Hilfiger USA , Gap , Calvin Klein and Liz Claiborne .
Moved by the sworn testimony of U.S. officials and human - rights advocates that the 91 percent of the workforce who were immigrants -- from China , the Philippines , Sri Lanka and Bangladesh -- were being paid barely half the U.S. minimum hourly wage and were forced to live behind barbed wire in squalid shacks minus plumbing , work 12 hours a day , often seven days a week , without any of the legal protections U.S. workers are guaranteed , Murkowski wrote a bill to extend the protection of U.S. labor and minimum - wage laws to the workers in the U.S. territory of the Northern Marianas .
So compelling was the case for change the Alaska Republican marshaled that in early 2000 , the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Murkowski worker reform bill .
But one man primarily stopped the U.S.
House from even considering that worker - reform bill : then - House Republican Whip Tom DeLay .
According to law firm records recently made public , lobbyist Jack Abramoff , paid millions to stop reform and keep the status quo , met personally at least two dozen times with DeLay on the subject in one two - year period .
The DeLay staff was often in daily contact with Abramoff .
DeLay traveled with his family and staff over New Year 's of 1997 on an Abramoff scholarship endowed by his client , the government of the territory , to the Marianas , where golf and snorkeling were enjoyed .
DeLay fully approved of the working and living conditions .
The Texan 's salute to the owners and Abramoff 's government clients was recorded by ABC - TV News : " You are a shining light for what is happening to the Republican Party , and you represent everything that is good about what we are trying to do in America and leading the world in the free - market system "
Later , DeLay would tell The Washington Post 's Juliet Eilperin that the low - wage , anti-union conditions of the Marianas constituted " a perfect petri dish of capitalism .
It 's like my Galapagos Island . "
Contrast that with what then - Sen .
Murkowski told me in a 1998 interview : " The last time we heard a justification that economic advances would be jeopardized if workers were treated properly was shortly before Appomattox . "
The " Made in the USA " label means standards of quality and standards of conduct .
But more important than how a product is made is how the people who make that product are treated -- as human beings with innate dignity -- who are free to organize and entitled to a living wage .
Did somebody say something about moral values ?
“ Vice President Dick Cheney did n’t suffer for comfort on the cavernous cargo plane that he rode into Iraq and Afghanistan this week , ” Nedra Pickler writes for The Associated Press .
“ The Air Force loaded the plane with the ‘ silver bullet , ’ a mobile home in the sky strapped down in the middle of the belly .
The accommodations included sleeping and working quarters that protected him from the noise and cold of the cargo hold during a more than five - hour flight into Baghdad …
The rest of his traveling party was not so lucky .
Cheney ’s senior staff and junior aides were assigned to a cramped three rows of seats in front of the bullet , while reporters and Secret Service agents had to sit in jump seats along the side with a view of Cheney ’s stainless steel exterior walls …
Despite the noise and seating conditions on the C - 17 , Cheney ’s staff eventually was able to nod off after days of exhaustive travel .
Cheney emerged from his more spacious quarters at one point to pose for a picture standing in front of several rows of his dozing aides . ”
Pickler reports ,
“ The vice president is an iPod fan , and keeping it charged is a priority for his staff .
Normally that is n’t an issue , even when he ’s flying around the world .
Air Force II is equipped with outlets in each row of seats .
But when Dick Cheney was traveling home overnight Wednesday from his diplomatic mission , most of the outlets went on the fritz .
Working passengers began lining up their laptops to share the power from a couple of working outlets — particularly the reporters who urgently needed to prepare their articles to transmit during a quick refueling stop in England .
But when Cheney said his iPod needed to be recharged , it took precedent above all else and dominated one precious outlet for several hours .
The vice president ’s press staff intervened so a reporter could use the outlet for 15 minutes to charge a dead laptop , but then the digital music device was plugged back in .
That way , Cheney got his press coverage and his music , too . ”

[ Thanks to MacDailyNews reader “ iceforest ” for the heads up . ]
[ UPDATE : 10:39 am EST : fixed “ full article ” link . ]
Newsflash for Nedra :
That ’s right , honey , you ’re not as important as the Vice President of the United States of America .
If you want so badly to be the one who gets to ride in the “ silver bullet , ” quit writing wire stories for AP and go get elected .
As for Cheney ’s iPod recharge prohibiting mainstream reporters from filing their stories , we say , “ Go iPod ! ”
It ’s just too bad that Cheney ’s iPod could n’t have somehow stopped the publishing of the majority of Nitpickler ’s particularly meaningless pile of words ( we do appreciate the iPod stuff , but did n’t like having to wade through the whining about how the U.S. Vice President gets better accommodations aboard planes than do beat reporters ) .
Note :
We believe that politicians are nuts to be politicians nowadays .
Thanks to the media and the political climate today , politicians quickly become twisted caricatures that bear no resemblance to human beings .
Regardless of your political party , try to remember that they are actual people .
The politicians that you “ despise ” are almost always much nicer and warmer than you ’d want to believe and the ones you “ love ” almost always have many more flaws than you ’d ever want to admit .

- Huh ? . . .
Windows in Assembler ?
First off , Assembly Language can be beautiful and legible .
Here are two GIF images of my own code .
This is what I see when I am writing 100 % pure Assembly Language for Windows : Sample # 1 Sample # 2 .
Am I sick ?
Perhaps .
Am I a dinosaur destined for early extinction ?
Yeah , probably .
But I truly love programming .
It 's what I do .
It fulfills me and sustains me . . . and I 'm never in a hurry to " just be done with it . "
I can't stand sloppiness in my work , so for me that means writing the smallest , tightest , fastest , most economical computer programs possible .
And THAT means authoring Windows applications in Assembly Language .
Though the rest of the world may argue that they 're more " productive " ( when measured by hard disk space consumed per second ) , I stand by the principle that : " Small Is Beautiful " .
Small Is Beautiful ?
Sure , I think so .
Do n't you ?
When I began the development of the first Windows application I 'd ever created , ChromaZone , I was determined not to let the fact that I was writing for Windows keep me from creating really great software .
And frankly , I just do n't consider a utility program that 's 4 megabytes big , and contains all sorts of files that the author did n't create , to be " really great software " .
Do you ?
So I needed to figure out how to write Windows Applications in Assembly Language .
( Just as I had created SpinRite and all prior products in my life . )
Well , I did that , and ChromaZone became a testament to what one guy who really cares about quality can produce .
Please allow me to urge you to download and check out the FREE ChromaZone Demo ( 177k ) .
It 's a rather amazing Windows Screen Saver Construction
Set that I wrote in 100 % pure assembly language .
There 's NOTHING TO INSTALL since the ZIP file contains a single executable program that just runs .
The demo program contains 100 separate , customizable , amazing screen savers .
ChromaZone demonstrates , far better than any words could , what one determined guy working alone can produce .
ChromaZone is pretty much the last word in " display hardware palette animation " , so it will require you to temporarily drop your system down into 256 - color mode ... but if you will give it a whirl I know you 'll be quite amazed .
I am not trying to sell you a copy of ChromaZone .
Really , I 'm not .
It 's just a piece of work that I 'm so very proud of , that I 'd really like to share the demo with you if you 'll take a moment to check it out .
It runs on any Windows platform ( Win3/95/98 ) , except NT , since it depends upon the virtual timer vxd ( VTD ) that 's not present in NT .
Anyway ... ChromaZone is 16 - bit Windows Assembly Language Technology .
But before I had it completed the world had ( pretty much unnecessarily ) moved over to the " bigger must be better " 32 - bit world of Windows 95 . << sigh >>
So the next thing I did was to develop the technology to create modern state of the art 32 - bit Windows Applications in the same 100 % pure assembly language .
That 's where I am today .
Every scrap of code I 've written and offer on this web site was written in small , tight , lean and mean assembly language .
You really can feel the difference .
Here 's another example ...
The new ASPI_ME Title Page App :
This 13,824 byte Windows app sports a few good tricks !
For one thing , it 's only 13,824 bytes ! . . . which for any Windows app is a trick in itself !
Next , the " sliding block puzzle " which it presents and solves right before your eyes is generated on the fly and starts out with a different puzzle every time it runs .
And finally , the coolest thing is that ALL of the sound effects are synthesized in realtime , on the fly !
There are NO attached bloated .
WAV files !
That " grande finale " sound  reministent of the THX sound  is generated by a 36 - operator , 18 - voice , polyphonic , frequency modulation ( FM ) sound effects synthesizer that I created in software just for the purpose .
My plan is that future products will be " sound effect enabled " where they user can customize the " amount " of sound effects and the program will " re-synthesize " all of the effects , on the fly , to suit individual taste .
So , this little title page was my excuse for developing the technology . . .
It 's only 13,824 bytes so check it out !
Many visitors to this site have asked if I could provide them with some help getting started authoring 32 - bit Windows Applications in Assembly Language .
So I created the " Small Is Beautiful " Starter Kit containing everything you 'd need to assemble a full - function , state of the art 32 - bit Windows Application in assembly language . . .
The Small Is Beautiful Starter Kit :
The file is 20 k . . .
Sorry it 's so big , but I included all of the source code and header files , as well as a copy of the finished SIB.EXE so you could see the result even if you did n't have the other required assembly tools !
SIB.ZIP ( 20 k ) --
This zip file contains all of the files necessary to assemble a state of the art 32 - bit Windows Application ... written in nothing but assembly language ( it also contains the executable SIB.EXE app so that you can see what it looks like and browse the files even if you do n't own a copy of Microsoft's Macro Assembler , MASM , or Linker ) .
The App includes a toolbar with standard icons , tool tips , a status bar and common dialogs .
And ... of course ... full source code for the entire project .
Assembly Language Resources on the Web . . .
Even though Assembly Language programming seems to be a lost and dying art , the Web is chock full of interesting and useful resources .
Here are some of the better goodies I 've uncovered in my travels :
Hutch 's MASM pages
This site contains a wealth of information and great source code examples .
Be SURE to also check out Hutch 's links to other resources .
They 're great too !
Assembly Programming Journal ( WARNING !
This " freeservers " site will probably pop -up annoying browser windows ! )
This is a terrific resource for articles relating to assembly language programming .

OAKLAND -- Oakland police and a cadaver dog with the Alameda County sheriff 's office today are searching the home of a software developer whose estranged wife has n't been seen for 10 days , police said .
Law - enforcement officials received a warrant to search the home of Hans Reiser , 43 , on the 6900 block of Exeter Drive in the city 's Montclair District , police said .
Reiser 's wife , Nina " Nenasha " Reiser , 31 , was last seen at about 2 p.m. Sept. 3 at his home , where she dropped off their 6 - year - old son and 5 - year - old daughter .
A police bulletin issued Monday said the woman is " at risk " and could be a victim of foul play .
The children have been placed with Child Protective Services .
Hans Reiser has not been termed a suspect in her disappearance , and police have yet to speak to him , authorities said .
Hans Reiser was n't at home today , but his mother , Beverly Palmer , was present during the search and was being cooperative , said Oakland police Lt. Kevin Wiley .
" We have not spoken to him yet , " Wiley said of Reiser .
A cadaver dog searched a crawl space underneath the home , located on a winding street off Shepherd Canyon Road in a steep wooded canyon .
Also on scene was an agent with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
The Reisers frequently traveled to Russia .
Meanwhile , concerned friends , neighbors and teachers from the Reiser children 's former school , Grand Lake Montessori , have been posting flyers in the Lake Merritt area and other parts of the Montclair district .
On the day she disappeared , Nina Reiser was planning to go shopping at Berkeley Bowl before going to a friend 's house , said Anthony Zografos , her boyfriend .
She never showed up at the house .
Police said they found Reiser 's tan 2001 Honda Odyssey at an unspecified location , but no trace of her .
There were groceries inside the car , authorities said .
The couple married in 1999 and separated in 2004 .
Nina Reiser filed for divorce in 2004 , citing irreconcilable differences , according to Alameda County Superior Court records .
She was granted custody of the children .
The couple 's divorce was never finalized .
She said he was out of the country on business for his firm , Namesys , for nine months out of each year , records said .
Nina Reiser accused her husband of subjecting their son , then 4 , to violent video games and movies .
" This is an activity that Hans does almost obsessively to relax , " Nina Reiser wrote in her divorce filing .
" Hans believes a child should ' know the real world ' and sees nothing wrong with this behavior .
He does n't seem to grasp that children are not little adults . "
Hans Reiser , in turn , denied that movies were to blame and accused his wife of having an extramarital affair and of being mentally unstable and physically abusive to him , court records show .
Hans Reiser 's court filings touched on Sir Francis Bacon , Aristotle , Ralph Waldo Emerson and the scientific method .
He said his son played " more hours of educational games " than those depicting violence and told the court that he was being " scammed " by his wife .
He wrote of Nina Reiser , " She is a product of a KGB - dominated society and is the child of someone who works for the KGB . "
Nina Reiser was granted a temporary restraining order against her husband in December 2004 .
A year later , she agreed not to seek a permanent order .
But earlier this year , Hans Reiser allegedly failed to pay 50 percent medical expenses and child care expenses as ordered by Judge Ronni McLaren , records show .
He pleaded not guilty Aug. 25 on a civil contempt charge and is scheduled for trial in October .
" I would like to think -- and I hope -- that he had nothing to do with this , " Shelley Gordon , Nina 's Reiser 's divorce attorney , said today .
" This has been a very acrimonious divorce , and I 'm very fond of Nina and quite heartsick over her disappearance . "
Nina Reiser , who is trained as an obstetrician / gynecologist in Russia , has lived in the Temescal district in recent years , Zografos said .
Authorities describe Reiser , whose nickname is Nenasha , as 5 - foot - 5 and 114 pounds , with brown eyes , black hair and a fair complexion .
Oakland police homicide investigators have not been called in to assist officers with the missing person 's unit , authorities said .
Police want to look into the possibility that she could have left the country , said Oakland police Capt .
Jeff Loman .
" We do n't have any evidence of foul play , " Loman said Tuesday .
Police ask anyone with information about Reiser or who may have seen her van to call contact investigators at ( 510 ) 777-3333 .
Callers can also leave information on the Police Department 's tip line at ( 510 ) 637-0298 .
THE BIGGER - THAN -TV MOVIE --
Most digital still cameras today can also capture video big enough to fill a standard TV screen ( 640 by 480 pixels ) and smooth enough to simulate standard TV motion ( 30 frames a second ) .
But Canon 's PowerShot S80 model goes one step further : it can capture videos at even higher resolution ( 1024 x 768 pixels ) .
Why on earth would you need a video picture of higher resolution than the TV itself ?
Three reasons .
First , your videos will look better on high - definition sets .
Second , the videos fill much more of your computer screen when played there .
And finally , that 's so much resolution , you can isolate a single frame and grab it as a still photograph .
TV À LA CARTE --
It 's always seemed crazy that TV companies would spend $ 1 million an episode writing and producing a program that is shown only once .
Yet the obvious solution -- making past shows available for purchase on the Internet -- gave TV executives nightmares of teenage download pirates run amok .
It took Apple to persuade them to dip a little toe into the Internet waters .
ABC took the first plunge , offering iPod owners five shows ' worth of archives for a perfectly pitched price of $ 2 each -- and no commercials .
NBC came next with a broader menu of shows .
The concept was a hit , the floodgates have opened , and the era of downloadable , reasonably priced , lightly copy - protected TV episodes is finally upon us .
THE OUTER - BUTTON FLIP PHONE --
First came the cellphone with a hinge ( the flip phone ) .
Then came the flip phone with an external screen , so you could see who was calling .
Problem was , this arrangement deprived you of the option to dismiss the call or send it to voice mail .
If you opened the flip phone to get to the Ignore button , you 'd answer the call -- unless you 'd turned off the " opening phone answers the call " feature , in which case you lost one great convenience of having a flip phone to begin with .
The solution ?
Add buttons on the outside of the phone .
When a call comes in to the LG VX8100 , for example , its external screen identifies the caller -- and the small buttons just below it are labeled Ignore ( let it ring until voice mail picks up ) or Dismiss ( send it directly and immediately to voice mail ) .
You get the best of all cellular worlds , without ever having to open the phone .
THE FREE DOMAIN NAME --
A domain name is what comes before the " .com " in a Web address -- like NYTimes.com , verizonwireless.com or MarryMeBritney.com .
Getting your own personal dot - com name has its privileges -- for example , your e-mail address can be You@YourNameHere.com -- but it costs money and requires some expertise .

( Half of this post my response to Tomanbay ’s criticisms , the other half is the answer to the above question .
If you want the second part , just skip to bolded part that starts with “ Which brings us to the part . . ” )
Time to give my 2 cents …
I had very conflicted feelings towards Tomanbay ’s post about me to tell you the truth .
One part of me ( the reactionary part ) immediately saw it as an unprovoked and largely unexpected attack on me and wanted to respond in kind , one part was immediately flattered by the time and effort he took to convey a point he wanted me to realize , and another part was kind of mad because with his post he ruined what I hoped to achieve by writing my post on Paradise Now , or at least shifted the debate to a direction I did n’t want it to take , as I will explain .
But I would like to thank him for writing it anyway because it also brought my attention to something I was n’t aware of : a lot of people who read me do n’t really get or understand what I stand for and hope to achieve by writing this blog , so I am going to address his points and my critics in a way that hopefully will help shed more light on my reasoning and motivations - since a lot of people seem to be confused about that .
If there is one thing that I agreed with Tomanbay on though , it ’s that I am an extremist myself , and as extreme as some of the Wahabbi extremists , and you will see why I am this way , and why you should thank me for it , by the end of this post .
Ok ?
All right , but first things first , and my post on that movie will come first , or actually what I hoped to achieve with it , will come first .
Here we go :
Ok Tomanbay , here is a question I wanted to ask you :
How stupid do you think I am ?
Really ?
Have you not seen me present arguments before ?
Do n’t you think that I am smart enough to present such an argument as the one I presented here with such a huge chink on my argument armor , as repeating twice that I did n’t see that movie , but will criticize it anyway ?
Did n’t that strike you as weird at all ?
Just a little strange ?
Did n’t you think for a second that it was presented that way , because it was supposed to push people ’s buttons ?
Man , I wrote this post with 2 goals in mind : 1 ) To mock all the people in our media who keep praising the movie and talking about “ how the Jews are fighting it because it shows who they really are ” without actually seeing the damn movie .
I mean , you would think from the amount of support this movie was getting from all of those people who did n’t see it but were excited about it anyway that it would just make the rest of the world suddenly be ok with palestinains blowing themselves up , or understand how evil the Joooz really are .
They were defending and praising a movie they did n’t see , just on the principle of “ if the Jews are opposing it it must be good ” mind you , and nobody had a problem with that at all .
That , my friend , pissed the shit out of me and I was just trying to give people a taste of what that ’s like when it ’s reversed .
Just being an asshole as usual .
But that ’s not the main reason why I wrote it .
The second reason - or goal - was to provoke a reaction out of my readers , especially the Palestinians amongst them .
I fully expected the Palestinians who read this blog to take an issue with me on this post , since - as we all know - the movie does n’t really support suicide - bombing .
You see , part of the sandmonkey experiences is provoking people ; to put them on the defensive and to get them to explain themselves and what they stand for .
Writing this post in such a way will force every Palestinian out there that reads it to mention the positive message of the movie , decry suicide - bombing and the stereotyping of arabs .
I did it fully realizing that not everyone will think this way , and some might even cuss me for it , but that ’s ok , because it was n’t really about me this time .
Not really .
Think about it Tomanbay , who reads my comments section ?
Do n’t people always call my commenters “ right - wing nutjobs ” ?
Well , what will those “ right - wing nutjobs ” read in such a comments section then , other than Palestinians decrying suicide - bombing and violence , and criticizing stereotyping and ignorance ?
Can you imagine the effect of that ?
Do you think that ’s the view they usually get of palestinains , thanks to the asshole elements of the likes of Hamas ?
Of Course not .
And it was working too .
It was starting a dialogue until you wrote your piece and changed the debate from the movie and the image of palestinains to the " Sandmonkey is a bad extremist ” love - fest you had on there , which of course ruined the whole thing .
Oh well .
Such is life .
But besides what I intended to do , let me make something clear : I do have an issue with that movie , especially after what I heard of it , for the reason everyone states in its defense :
It does n’t condemn or condone suicide - bombing and that it leaves the viewer free to make their own conclusions .
For me , in the times we are living in , and with the debates being the way they are , and with the deadly trifecta elements of ignorance , poverty and oppression feeding the fire of extremism in Islamic youth , I am not sure leaving them to make their own conclusion , after what I am assuming to be an emotionally charged movie , to be a very wise thing .
I mean , does n’t it disturb you that every movie we have on the topic glorifies the act of suicide bombing as a heroic form of self sacrifice and never the opposite ?
I mean , most of our people will go to such a movie with their schooling and their films telling them that blowing themselves up in order to kill your enemy is ok , so , like , what kind of a conclusion do you think they will come out with ?
I mean , would it be bad for once to show a movie that says , that maybe , just maybe , that suicide - bombing is wrong and that it kills innocent people ?
Would it have killed the director to make that the message of the movie instead of being neutral on the subject ?
Is that really too much to ask ?
I mean , I get it that it shows that innocent people will die ( the scene with the little girl on the bus in the end and all ) and therefore the suicide - bombing is bad , but that ’s for people who will think about the movie and its message later on , and I do n’t know if a lot of people - from our side of the fence at least - will do that .
I mean , after all that ’s been happening lately , I am starting to doubt that our people think at all with their brains , and instead just follow their emotions .
I do n’t think I need to explain to you how dangerous that is ; I mean , anyone who has been watching the news lately can see that for themselves .
And then you have the idiots , like this lady that left this comment on your blog :
Thank you for this post .
It was right on !
I can't believe SM had the audacity to attack Pradise Now without watching it and REFUSING the simple idea of humanizing the suicide bomber .
Suicide bombers are not animals they are , surprise , surprise , humans !
Yes !
You have no idea what it takes to be willing to end your life like that .
Ok , I will say it slowly and hopefully you will get it : I do n’t think suicde - bombers are animals Sonia , because I respect animals .
I think suicde - bombers are monsters .
I think they are mass - murdering idiots and do n’t deserve an ounce of sympathy from me .
I do n’t know why that is :
Maybe it ’s because I was at the Hotel in Ras Shaitan in october of 2004 when one of them blew himself up not 400 meters away from where I was , and I saw the dead bodies , blood and carnage he committed in his efforts to kill - get this - tourists .
Not Israeli army officers , not the evil American occupiers of Iraq , but rather your simple innocent by - standing tourists , who I am sure had it coming because , ehh , why is that again ?
Can you tell me ?
I would like to know .
You see my friend , that ’s why I think they are monsters .
It ’s because I know they do n't give a damn or care or differentiate between their victims .
Those are the kinds of people who blow up school children buses , slaughtering 32 children , to kill one US soldier in Iraq .
They are murderous nutbags , plain and simple , and even if they would like to differentiate between their victims , their bombs would n't , and that 's the sad truth .
So here I am , an arab muslim egyptian male , and I am well aware of all the history and the injustices and all the other excuses we all know and are ready to spout on a second 's notice , and yet I can't seem to care about those people anymore .
For me , as far as I am concerned , they want me dead .
Not me personally , but if I die for being in the wrong place on the wrong time , they would n't really care .
And you know something ?
I am not really ready to die .
I do n't wanna die .
I want to live .
I have places to see , parties to go to , girls to sleep with and children to screw up raising .
And if it 's between me - or you for that matter - and 100 of those Koran thumbing allahu akbar shouting misogynistic racist jihadist assholes , it is no contest : I choose us .
They 've got to go .
It really is that simple .
Hope I made myself clear on that front , and now back to you Tomanbay , and your criticisms of me .
The first one , the port deals one , is stupid , because if you read the IMAO parody , you would understand that it was making fun of the people who were against the deal .
It was logically refuting every argument people were raising against the UAE taking over the ports , while making fun of the critics misconceptions of arabs as being “ all terrorists who want to kill them all ” .
In my opinion it did it brilliantly , which is why I was surpised to know that this is when you started “ questioning my motives ” .
I was like , come on Tomanbay , you are smarter than that .
You are the guy who would get this .
And then the second point you raise is about my praising of Deeyah and my ridicule of Samy Yusef .
First of all , I do n’t think the comparison is valid , mainly because I do n’t think Deeyah is exploiting Islam as some people claimed she was to gain fame and success .
That argument is so stupid that I can't believe some of the people who I know to be smart spouted it .
Yes , I am sure she did that , because the teen pop-music listening anti-islamic crowd is so huge and her albums would reach platinum easy , right ?
Not to mention , she would have the most sold - out concerts , cause I am sure her fans would n’t be afraid of some nutbag trying to blow himself up and kill her .
And I am sure she just does n’t care about the death threats she gets , or the fact that she has to surround herself with bodyguards all the time , because she must be making a ton of money from the anti-Islamic feminist pop-music crowd .
Yeah .
Sure .
Are you kidding me ?
No one , unless a true believer in the cause she is championing , would do what she is doing , because , let ’s face it , they do n’t want to die , not even for the supposed money she would get out of this ( How will she get this money again ?
Can you tell me ? ) .
Exploiting Islam to sell pop-music albums .
Yeah , that ’s the ticket .
That 's the untaped market .
The Islamic Defamation Foundation ( IDF , hehe ) must be supporting her as well , and it ’s all bankrolled by the Jews who want to destroy Islam .
And women in muslim countries are n’t oppressed at all .
Yeah , ok !
As for Samy Yusef , hey , I reserve the right to make fun of whomever I want , and let ’s face it , anything Islamic these days in our countries is commercially successful and people are noticing it ( Check the new Islamic songs of WAMA and Mostafa Kamar if you want an example ) .
So am I saying he is doing it for the money ?
Who knows ?
Maybe .
I am sure the money does n’t hurt .
And good for him for finding his niche .
I ai n’t hating on him for that .
I just did n’t like that song he made , especially with its hidden messages , and I chose to make fun of that one .
I mean , come on , him singing a song for veiled girls explaining to them what they should say about how the veil most of them are pressured and forced to wear makes them feel like ?
How can I not make fun of that ?
And let me be honest with you , I might respect him the day he starts singing against Islamic terrorism or even the subjugation of women , or any of the other real issues and problems we have in our culture .
He is n’t .
He does n’t even talk about it and brushes them off , like all of them do , and pretends that the real problem lies in the west not understanding Islamic culture .
No man , they do understand it , and they are starting to see the festering problems that we are ignoring .
The cracks in our wall .
That ’s our real problem .
Deeyah is addressing that problem , and therefore is not commercially successful and has death threats up the ass , while Samy is n’t at all , and that ’s why he is making money .
To me the dude is like the singer version of Amr Khaled :
He talks about the positives and ignores the problems that need addressing .
Fine , it ’s his right to do that .
It ’s my right not to like it .
This brings us to the part where we talk about my extremism .
And if you are still reading then you are a champ , so I am not going to disappoint you .
I will admit it .
I am as extremist in my beliefs as “ the radical , extremist , fanatical jihadiys ” .
In that you are right , but you also got to understand , it ’s not by my choice , I am forced to be this way , and I am doing it for YOUR own good .
Let me elaborate .
There is an ideological war going on in regards to Islam and in our societies I believe , and the Jihadis are winning .
There are 3 reasons why they are winning :
1 ) The reluctance of the moderates amongst us to admit there are problems that need addressing , thanks to our stupid belief that “ we should n’t air our dirty laundry ” ;
2 ) Because in any debate between the moderates and the extremists , if there is to be a compromise , it will always be in the extremists favor ; and 3 ) Because the extremists , if they face defeat , they will just threaten their ideological enemies , if not issue a takfir Fatwa on them , which will lead to a moron attempting to - if not succeeding in - killing them .
And because of those 3 reasons I am the extremist that I am today .
You see , we ca n’t fix our problems without addressing them , so I therefore make sure to point out the negatives all the time , because I believe that it is our duty to fix them , and that if we do fix them , then no one will be able to criticize or attack us .
And that , in the eyes of many , makes me an extremist and a self - hater .
Fine , whatever .
But someone has to do it , and since very few are stepping up to the plate , I guess it has to be me .
And that ’s the first reason why I am an extremist .
The second reason I am an extremist is the reaction to reason 2 of why they are winning :
The scales are n’t balanced .
You see , any consensus achieved between the moderates and the extremists will only mean one thing : they reached a compromise .
This would naturally mean that the extremists agreed to move closer to the moderates , but it also means that the moderates have to also move closer to the side of the extremists , and that ’s what ’s happening now in our societies .
And this is not what we want , or what we should strive for .
We want the society to remain moderate , but without extremists on the other side to balance the Islamic extremists , the society will always tilt in their favor .
What we need are secular extremists who will not give an inch to counter the Islamic extremists in order to balance the society and move everyone more towards the middle .
To make it a place where we all can live and co-exist .
But we do n’t have any Tomanbay , and that ’s why the moderates are losing ground .
Knowing the stakes , I stepped up , because as always , no one else is willing to do it .
I am not enough by a long shot , but I am a start , and hopefully more will join me and will help balancing the scales of our society .
That ’s why I am an extremist , and why I will not budge on certain issues .
The third and final reason lies in the nature of this ideological war , and how it unfairly favors the islamists , simply because they will not allow themselves to be defeated .
You see , they view themselves to be absolutely in the right ; the agents of God on earth so to speak .
So any dialogue with them will not be fair , because in their minds they are the right muslims and their oppositions are the ones who are misguided and who have to prove themselves .
Not to mention , if you manage to beat them in a debate - which is easy - they will not just concede defeat and accept your points .
They will view you as a threat to “ God ’s will ” and subsequently they will view it as their duty to get rid of your infidel Kafir Islam - hating ass .
This is why people are afraid of debating them or attacking them ; they fear for their lives and they do n’t want to get killed .
I say screw that .
I say fuck them .
I say if they have no problems killing those who oppose them or their ideology ( i.e. Us ) , then we have every right in the world to kill them back .
Hell , it would be self - defense .
And that ’s why I am an extremist ; because I would rather kill those who have no problem killing or threatening people ( i.e. YOU ) who do n’t conform to their views .
I value my and your life over those who preach death , and since I want to live and want you to live , I have no problem with the death preachers dying .
I say let ’s see how this debate will go when their Death Fatwa heads start getting killed back .
I say until they stop and abandon the method of killing those who oppose them , we should n’t have any moral qualms at all about killing them as well .
It ’s self - evident , yet hard to swallow , and probably too Manichean to the average person , but someone has to do it for all of our sake .
I get that , and that ’s why I am an extremist .
Now , do you think I like it ?
Do you think I like being this extremist ?
Do you think any of the people , who suddenly found themselves part of this war and reacted the same way I did , like this stupid " Clash of Civilizations " either ?
Man , I am 25 .
I come from a well - off family , I have a sweet job with a big pay and lots of friends .
I could be enjoying life like the rest of the useless idiots in my social class , talking about who got engaged to who , whose driving what car and who got photographed in what socialite magazine .
But the world is going to shit Tomanbay , and very few people are doing something about it , and I ca n’t just stand still and watch it slide to oblivion .
I ca n’t do that .
I do what I do because it needs to be done .
I am what I am because someone has to be .
This is not fun , man .
But I ca n’t just not do something .
I have to do what I do , because I am compelled to do it , and no one else will take the job .
This is why I will talk about the rights of Christians in Egypt when no one talked about it .
This is why I called the boycott thing retarded and started to remedy the situation even before anyone else said it .
This is why I was one of the people who tried to start anti-terrorism protest in Egypt after the Sharm - bombing , while the rest of the country debated how much of a discount they can probably get if they went to Sharm now .
I am waging an almost solitary battle to make the world understand that we are not all the crazy extremists violent assholes the extremists make us to be .
And I always have to be in the forefront of it all , because none of you so - called moderates will ever take the first step .
I always have to take it for you .
Do you understand how much that sucks ?
And do I even get a thank you from you guys ?
No .
I get criticized and attacked , and called an extremist .
Fine .
Thanks a lot .
Whatever .
I am not going to be bitter about it Tomanbay , or even get angry over it , because , honestly , I am so used to this reaction that I have come to expect it by now .
Not to mention , I made that choice to fight this battle , and as weary as I am , I wo n’t quit before I am 100 % sure that it ’s a lost battle , regardless of criticisms and attacks .
For the simple reason that someone has to do it , and nobody else will .
Because I value my life and yours , and the freedoms that we are all entitled to .
That ’s why I am called an extremist .
And if that ’s what an extremist is , then I am proud to be one .
PS : If you managed to read the whole thing , then you rock , and you should leave a comment so I can know who you are !
Sandmonkey out !
Western Union has been the conduit of a lot of fraud .
But since they ’re not the victim , they do n’t care much about security .
It ’s an externality to them .
It took a lawsuit to convince them to take security seriously .
Western Union , one of the world ’s most frequently used money transfer services , will begin warning its customers against possible fraud in their transactions .
Persuading consumers to send wire transfers , particularly to Canada , has been a popular method for con artists .
Recent scams include offering consumers counterfeit cashier ’s checks , advance - fee loans and phony lottery winnings .
More than $ 113 million was swindled in 2002 from U.S. residents through wire transfer fraud to Canada alone , according to a survey conducted by investigators in seven states .
Washington was one of 10 states that negotiated an $ 8.5 million settlement with Western Union .
Most of the settlement would fund a national program to counsel consumers against telemarketing fraud .
In addition to the money , the company has agreed to increase fraud awareness at more than 50,000 locations , develop a computer program that would spot likely fraud - induced transfers before they are completed and block transfers from specific consumers to specific recipients when the company receives fraud information from state authorities .
Companies are n't moving fast enough , the government says
The new coalition government in Oslo said it was considering introducing a law which would require 40 % of boardroom posts to be filled by women .
Norway 's previous government drew up the law , which it threatened to apply if companies failed voluntarily to meet minimum quotas by 1 July this year .
Only a fifth of Norway 's 590 publicly listed firms comply with the quotas .
" It 's not going fast enough , " said Karita Bekkemellem , Norway 's minister for family and children .
" I do n't want to wait 20 or 30 years until sufficiently intelligent men finally appoint women to the boardrooms . "
She added : " I wish to establish , from January 1 2006 , a system of sanctions which makes it possible to break up companies . "
Out of all proportion
For a woman to get in a man must get out - it is not difficult to find qualified women
Norwegian government
The cabinet of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg is due to examine the gender equity law which , once applied , would give companies two years to comply before being threatened with break - up .
Critics condemned the proposed law , arguing it could force some companies to relocate outside Norway .
" The closure of a company is a punishment out of all proportion to the offence , " said Sigrun Vaageng , who heads Norway 's employers ' association .
" In theory , the government can break up a company because it is missing a single woman . "
But a spokeswoman for Ms Bekkemellem said introducing the law could be the only way to of ensuring equality in the boardroom .
" It is a question of power , " the spokeswoman said , insisting that several surveys had found that companies where both sexes were strongly represented on the board were more profitable .
" For a woman to get in a man must get out .
It is not difficult to find qualified women . "
Many Mac owners , myself included , partition their machine such that the OS is isolated from User data .
Or so they can install two copies of the OS .
Or for any of a number of other reasons .
Of course , as the system and user ’s relationship to the system evolves , it often proves to be the case that the originally chosen partitioning scheme is , well , wrong .
Too much space for OS , not enough for Data .
Or , in the case of Boot Camp , a new technology is released that requires an additional partition on the system ’s drive .
With the 10.4.6 update , the diskutil command has gained the ability to resize partitions , including creating new partitions .
This is via the resizeVolume subcommand :
[ albbum : ~ ] bbum % diskutil resizeVolume Disk Utility Tool Usage : diskutil resizeVolume [ Mount Point| Disk Identifier | Device Node ] size < part1 format part1 Name part1 Size > < part2format part2 Name part2Size > ... Non-destructively resize a disk .
You may increase or decrease its size .
When decreasing size , you may optionally supply a list of new partitions to create .
Ownership of the affected disk is required .
Valid partition sizes are in the format of < number > < size > .
Valid sizes are B ( ytes ) , K( ilobytes ) , M( egabytes ) , G( igabytes ) , T( erabytes ) Example : 10G ( 10 gigabytes ) , 4.23T ( 4.23 terabytes ) , 5 M ( 5 megabytes ) resizeVolume is only supported on GPT media with a Journaled HFS + filesystem .
A size of " limits " will print the range of valid values for the current filesystem .
Example : diskutil resizeVolume disk1s3 10G JHFS +
HDX1 5G MS - DOS HDX2 5G Valid filesystems : " Case - sensitive HFS + " " Journaled HFS + " " Case - sensitive Journaled HFS + " " HFS + " " HFS " " MS - DOS FAT32 " " MS - DOS FAT16 " " MS - DOS " " MS - DOS FAT12 " " UFS " " Linux " " Swap " </size></number></part2format></part1format>
Boot camp requires an MS - DOS Partition for installation .
There can only be one MS - DOS partition in the first three partitions on the disk and it must be the last of the first three partitions ( you can have any number of additional partitions beyond 3 of any type ) .
The example in the above command is telling ; it would resize disk1s3 to 10 gigabytes while creating a new journaled HFS + partition of 5 gigs and an MS - DOS partition of 5 gigs .
Assuming that there is no disk1s0 or disk1s1 ( which happens ) , the end result would be an MS - DOS partition as the last of three partitions , ready for the installation of Windows .

Demolition Sculptures , or : Sandblasting Manhattan
Would you still be able to use those rooms ? , I wonder .
To work in them and go to sleep in them and take stairways up the legs between levels ?
All the while living inside this Empire Strikes Back / robotect sculpture ?
The head , for instance , could be rented out as a two - bedroom flat ...
" As each vacated building is subsequently recycled and transformed into a sculpture , "
What other sculptures of I - beams and rebarred floor plates exist within skyscrapers , from London to Chicago , LA to Beijing ?
A selective pruning of a high - rise 's insides , and a new skyline takes shape , pierced by breezes .
Which leads me to wonder if you could sandblast all the buildings of Manhattan into rounded landscape sculptures , rock , brick , glass , and steel ground down to geometric smoothness .
Aerodynamic .
Like a rock - tumbler , turning backyard gravel into perfect spheres , eggs , and ovals , could you polish the city down to a gleaming rock park of half - abraded office towers , adjoined buildings sanded one into the another like the lips of wooden bowls – just throw the whole island into a rock - tumbler ?
Sandblast new sculptures out of every brownstone .
Or could you declare war on a city not with bombs and missiles but with high - powered industrial abraders and sandblasting machines ?
Turn Manhattan into a smooth series of sandstone arches and contours , all of New York a hulking Utah - like world of " balanced rocks , fins and pinnacles ... highlighted by a striking environment of contrasting colors , landforms and textures " ?
It's
I just saw this at Tropolism , and was amazed : turning abandoned buildings – into sculptures .
Would you still be able to use those rooms ? , I wonder .
To work in them and go to sleep in them and take stairways up the legs between levels ?
All the while living inside this / robotect sculpture ?
The head , for instance , could be rented out as a two - bedroom flat ...
" As each vacated building is subsequently recycled and transformed into a sculpture , " the architects write , " abandonment and demolition is no longer viewed as a negative process but becomes a celebration for cultural creation , urban revitalization , and identity building .

Or could you declare war on a city not with bombs and missiles but with high - powered industrial abraders and sandblasting machines ?
Turn Manhattan into a smooth series of sandstone arches and contours , all of New York a hulking Utah - like world of " balanced rocks , fins and pinnacles ... highlighted by a striking environment of contrasting colors , landforms and textures " ?
It 's Arches National Park : Manhattan Branch .
All that bedrock , geology and form released – by the geotechnical avant - garde .
City sculptors .
Sandblasting the torqued ruins of Manhattan ; then moving back to re-colonize those polished canyons .

Black Hawk pilots on hero missions are given first priority to land at bases .
Once on the ground , soldiers from the dead soldier 's unit or base often escort each body from a Humvee or an ambulance to the helicopter , at times in the blackness of night , occasionally so soon after the incident that the soldiers who are escorting them are still bloody from the attack that killed their friend .
There , an entourage of soldiers often forms two lines at the helicopter door , and the body passes between them as they give a slow salute .
" The hardest part is when the helicopter takes off , " said Capt .
J.D. Moore , the 1 - 150th 's chaplain , who goes on every hero mission with his unit .
" The dust is swirling around those soldiers , and they 're just standing at attention . "
Mr. Johnston , who is from Carneys Point , N.J. , keeps a record of each soldier he transported : name , unit , hometown and cause of death .
He said he wanted those details so he could someday visit the soldier 's family and tell them he had cared for their loved one , in some small way , when they could not be there .
He often volunteers to transport the soldier 's or contractor 's belongings a few days later , a task called a hero effects mission .
One day in August , Mr. Johnston offered to pick up the personal effects of four soldiers killed in a roadside bombing , but he was told to wait for a general , whom he was transporting that day , to finish a meeting .
Mr. Johnston became more and more upset , insisting that picking up the soldiers ' belongings should be the priority .
" I 'm going to call the general about this , if I have to , " he told his battle captain .
Finally given the go - ahead by the general 's assistant , he flew as quickly as possible to Camp Speicher to pick up 16 black plastic footlockers , eight Army green duffel bags , two folding chairs and a guitar , all of which belonged to soldiers from the First Brigade Combat Team , Third Infantry Division of Fort Stewart , Ga .
Last names were stenciled on the ends of the duffel bags : BOUCHARD , DOYLE , FUHRMANN , SEAMANS .
But the guitar case , black and battered and taped shut with green duct tape , bothered Mr. Johnston the most .
On it was an America West Airlines luggage tag with Nathan Bouchard 's name and his parents ' address in Arizona written on it .
The accident happened in front of thousands of children
The accident occurred during a " test of strength " challenge to raise money for a hospital in Young , 380 km ( 235 miles ) west of the capital , Montevideo .
Contestants were pushing and pulling a train and two carriages when the vehicle gained speed and ran them over .
Local authorities have declared three days of mourning .
' State of shock '
Participants in the programme , called A Challenge to the Heart , raise funds for local charities by completing difficult tasks set by the network - in this case manoeuvring a train a certain distance down railway tracks .
The Associated Press news agency quoted Ana Portela as telling local radio station El Espectador that the train was moving when " somebody slipped and fell under the locomotive , and others were falling alongside it .
" There were shouts and somebody said ' my arm ! ' "
Ms Portela said .
" Everybody was in a state of shock . "
Graciela Baccino , a spokeswoman for Channel 10 television , said the tragedy was " deeply saddening " .
She said the TV network offered its " solidarity and support " to the families involved .
About 3,000 schoolchildren were at the recording and witnessed the accident .
So the word on the street is that Sun will open source Java , the news came out this week from JavaOne .
Sun has been pressed for quite some time to open source Java .
On the corporate side , we have IBM who likes to be portrayed as the paladin of open source by sending open letters asking for the opening of Java .
IBM , a big supporter of software patents ( a concept that goes against the very spirit of the open source crowd ) , managed to earn trust points by making these public demands .
The real motivation is probably related to the terms attached to IBM 's current license of Java from Sun .
The terms were probably acceptable when they originally entered into an agreement to license Java , back in the days of Java Applets , and the " WebRunner " that was going to take over the web .
Java over - engineered architecture failed strepitously as a Web platform , a place that has been taken over by the vastly simpler and actually useful Flash .
But IBM played an important role in turning Java into a programming language for server - side applications and now a big chunk of their revenues are tied to Java .
Java is not only over - engineered , but also has severe architectural limitations that no Java licensor has been able to address .
And this is the genius of Sun 's licensing of Java .
Sun , being a fairly poor as a software house , managed to slow down every single one of their competitors that adopted their Java technology .
Sun was able through this licensing to dictate the pace of innovation effectively slowing down everyone to a grinding halt .
And this poses a problem for companies like IBM with large revenue streams based on technology from a competing company .
Their honeymoon with Linux continues to grow as they can outcompete everyone else with their services business , and they would love nothing more than to be able to treat Java as a commodity .
Over the years , Sun has used a number of tactics to avoid third party implementations of Java to compete .
They introduced a certification suite that effectively requires folks to license their software , tune it for their platform and get Sun to rubber stamp it .
When the pressure mounted they created the Java Community Process .
The JCP addressed some of the community grievances and was also a moderately slow process that it would fit well with Sun 's software development practices .
In the last few years there have been a few trends that probably forced Sun to take some new steps .
Red Hat has been funding the development of another Java implementation for the past couple of years ( as pointed by Eugenia Loli ) and has managed to produce something that is not tied directly to Sun 's implementation .
On the other side of the open source spectrum ( yes , there is another end of the spectrum ) , the Apache foundation decided that they needed something with their own license and they would start everything from scratch .
This is was called the Apache 's Harmony project .
Apache 's Harmony project under normal circumstances would be another harmless project and an easy one to dismiss as a threat ( considering that nobody in that group had any coding skills and the group only managed to produce a lot of extra smtp traffic with grand visions of the ultimate Java Virtual Machine implementation ) finally got some code in the form of a large code dump from Intel .
Intel has been developing Java VMs for as long as the eye can see and they have released them in some form or another over the years , but this time they have decided to make their effort last and have dumped the code on the Harmony project .
Now , Harmony is composed mostly of idealists with no time or experience to code has on its hands a serious foundation to start with .
IBM was coincidentally , one of the original instigators to create Harmony and even volunteered to provide some code .
Whether their contractual Java obligations allowed them to is a completely different matter .
IBM has distinguished itself by staffing all their executives with drones who hate Microsoft , but hate Sun much more .
It is not unconceivable to think that IBM probably negotiated some kind of deal with Intel to get that code contributed to Apache .
And finally , a minor inconvenience to Sun is the existence of the Mono project , a .NET implementation for Linux that has been taking hold in the space and key applications are being written on it .
And for a company as proud as Sun , having a technology originally developed on Windows by Microsoft on its home turf its something that they are having problems stomaching .
Where does this leave us ?
Red
Hat most likely is sinking money into a project that will never materialize , but if this ultimately forces
Sun to open source a technology that , like IBM , its betting its future on it is money well spent .
Half a million dollars spent on a skunkworks efforts is peanut change for them .
The Sun announcement might be for real , like the OpenOffice and OpenSolaris announcements in the past , and they might deliver an open source implementation .
But the dynamics of Java are very different and they might be using this merely as a stalling technique to get both Harmony and GNU 's effort to slow down .
The Harmony mailing list is already showing some of these cracks .
I remain unconvinced , despite Sun 's track record in open sourcing those two technologies , they have also played English games to stall people , and have more than once claimed that they would open source a technology and deliver something completely different .
With OpenOffice and OpenSolaris they remained in charge and to this date they have not been out engineered .
Java presents a more threatening scenario , loosing control over it might mean that Sun becomes the laggard and is unable to keep up with changes done by forks of Java .
So far the only substance in this week 's JavaOne announcement is that they offer yet another license to distribute Java .
Stephen O'Grady's of Red Monk has the details
The announcement has every Sun employee , twitching with joy .
It seems to be a victory over a group of lawyers over at Sun , but it smells like a minor change ( Simon Phipps ) .
WASHINGTON , Jan. 18 ( UPI ) --
The prospect of a mushroom cloud rising from the Dasht - e - Lut , Iran 's Desert of Stones , may not be Tehran 's greatest threat to international stability .
A successful test of an Iranian nuclear weapon at some point in the next few years may prove less destabilizing than a simple free market economic measure that Iran is said to be planning for March of this year .
Tehran is preparing to open a bourse , a mercantile exchange and potentially a futures market , where traders can buy and sell oil and gas , along the lines of the International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) in London and the NYTMEX in New York .
Advertisement
The differences are first , that this one would price its energy in euros , not dollars , and second , that it would not use West Texas Intermediate or Brent Crude ( from the North Sea ) as its standard oil for pricing .
It would use a Persian Gulf - produced oil instead .
So what ?
This sounds like a minor change , and possibly even a useful one , broadening the choice among traders and consumers in the kind of way that Adam Smith , the 18th century father of modern capitalism , would have recommended .
Not so .
This could be a far more profoundly punishing blow to American interests than Iran 's ability to manufacture a crude atom bomb that would have little credibility until it became small and stable and reliable enough to be delivered on some putative target .

The relationship between the oil price and dollar is intimate and important , and very useful to the dollar 's highly profitable status as the world 's reserve currency .
The prospect of a rival bourse and futures market opens the intriguing possibility , beyond hedging the future oil price , of profitable arbitrage between the euro and the dollar .
And if oil and gas are to be denominated in more than just one currency , why not open the trade to others ?
Why not denominate the price of a barrel of oil in Japanese Yen , or in Chinese yuan , the currency of the world 's second biggest oil importer ?
Why not , in short , end the monopoly rule of the almighty dollar ?
Such a move would not be welcomed in Washington , which swiftly moved after the fall of Baghdad in 2003 to reverse Saddam Hussein 's impudent decision to start selling Iraqi oil for euros , rather than dollars .
After all , the great benefit of running the world 's reserve currency means that if all else fails , the United States Treasury can just print more and more of the stuff and pay for its oil imports that way .
There are , naturally , limits to the degree to which the United States can debase its currency , as the world found with the first great OPEC price rise of 1973 , when the price per barrel tripled .
This is usually attributed to the political decision by Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producers to punish the United States for its decisive support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War .
That is partly true , but the crucial OPEC decision was as a direct result of President Richard Nixon 's Aug. 15 decision to end the dollar 's link to the gold standard .
Advertisement
The dollar declined in value , which meant the OPEC producers received less value for their oil .
So at their Beirut meeting on Sept. 22 , OPEC adopted resolution XXV : 140 , which resolved to take " any necessary action ... to offset any adverse effects on the per barrel real income of member countries resulting from the international monetary developments as of Aug. 15 . "
That was also the time when Sheikh Zaki Yamani , the Saudi oil minister , first mentioned the possibility of deploying the ultimate weapon of an oil embargo .
Most of the financial world is currently awaiting another , similar devaluation of the dollar , in response to the monstrous scale of current deficit on the U.S. current account .
Writing in the Financial Times last week , Harvard Professor Marty Feldstein suggested that on the basis of the 1985 - 87 Louvre and Plaza devaluations , the dollar could fall as much as 40 percent or even more .
The markets simply do not know when .
But should it come after an Iranian bourse is up and running , some very tidy sums could be made by those playing a dollar - euro trade on Tehran 's energy futures market .
The Tehran bourse is listed as an objective for this year in Iran 's current five - year plan .
The Tehran Times reported July 26 that the final authorizations had been received for the bourse to go ahead .
Mohammad Javad Asemipour , the technocrat and former deputy petroleum minister who has been charged with launching the bourse , has made a number of discreet scouting trips to London , Frankfurt , Moscow and Paris .
Just after Christmas , he was quoted by the Iran Labor News Agency saying " transparency in oil transactions would be one of the advantages of having such an establishment " ( the bourse ) , and adding that this would " allow dealers access to related information and promote equal trade opportunities . "
Advertisement
Asemipour is an elusive type , but one who seems convinced that Iran can play off the European against the Americans , the euro against the dollar .
Just over a year ago , he was quoted in the quasi- official Iran Daily saying that the Europeans have played " a beautiful game " with the United States during the years of sanctions , when they actively participated in economic projects , particularly in the energy sector , across Iran .
" In this game , the Europeans have pretended to be siding with America , whereas they got involved in business here and developed a sort of competition with the Americans , " he said .
" But in practice , they ( the Europeans ) have pursued their own interests . "
There is no shortage of officials in the Bush administration who nurture such suspicions of the French and Germans , despite what seems at the moment to be a common concern about Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
The question now is whether the world 's traders will come to a Tehran Bourse if and when it opens , bearing in mind that a similar idea in Dubai failed to gain much traction .
But that was before oil prices reached $ 65 a barrel , and before the Dubai 's partners in the Gulf Cooperation Council decided it was time to stop glowering at Iran as a potential enemy , and started to invite Tehran to their meetings as an observer .
Before , that is , the Arab world began to judge that whatever the American intentions , Iran had become the real winner of the Iraq War .
The world could be about to change much faster than we think , whether or not Iran tests an atomic device .
There are other , possibly more devastating weapons available that could hit a financially vulnerable American where it hurts most .

What to remember when putting your kid to sleep
If you enjoy this post , make sure you subscribe to Be A Good Dad to receive new posts in your email or feed reader
After reading a couple blogs where people mention their childrens ’ bad sleeping habits , and after needing to get Pookie back to sleep after he decided to start reciting TV shows at 1 am last night , I decided that I should talk about how to get kids to sleep .
Here ’s a brief background .
Geetle and Pookie started sleeping through the night at about 10 weeks old .
12 hours a night .
Everynight .
We have had a couple of handfuls of nights where we needed to go help them in the middle of the night , but almost all of those have either been from sickness or wet beds .
Our kids are the best nighttime sleepers in the world .
How did they get that way ?
Here ’s my tips :
Sleeping is about sleeping .
You get to bond with your kid all day long .
When they are awake bond .
When they should be asleep , teach them how to sleep .
This means they need to be in their bed .
This means they should not have toys .
Stuffed animals and books are encouraged in our house .
Anything with batteries and flashing lights is not .
Sleeping is about routine .
We go upstairs at about 7 pm almost everynight .
We get dressed .
We brush teeth and wash faces .
Geetle and Pookie each pick out a story .
We sit on the reading spot ( currently a pile of pillows in the corner of their room ) and read the books .
Everybody hugs and kisses and we leave .
The last words our kids hear everynight are “ Goodnight Geetle .
Goodnight Pookie .
Goodnight all the things . ”
It is part of the routine .
Sleeping is about trusting mom and dad .
When the kids were little , we decided that we would teach them to sleep by comforting them if they needed it and as soon as they calmed down , we would leave .
The first couple nights we had to return every couple minutes , pick them up until they calmed down , and then leave .
They learned very quickly that if they needed us , we were there .
Sleeping is about not being too tired .
Napping is very important for young kids .
It is much more difficult to get an exhausted toddler to sleep then one who is just tired .
Even if they do not nap , a little bit of quiet time in their room in the afternoon can really recharge a little guy and make it much easier for them to sleep at night .
Sleeping is about filtering out the noise .
We vacuum at night .
We watch TV at night .
We talk at night .
Our kids quickly learned to filter out that noise .
When we have to go into the room to help one of them , the other one almost never wakes up .
Sleeping is about waking up .
Schedules are good for kids .
In addition to going to bed at a consistant time , we wake up at a consistant time , too .
I am normally up and out of the house between 5:30 and 6:00 .
The kids are normally awake between 6 and 7 .
Even on the weekends .
Every once in a while we will all sleep in until 9 on a Saturday , but it is definitely the exception .
Our kids ’ internal alarm clocks have become very precise .
Beagoodmom and I sometimes alternate sleeping in .
I will wake up with them on Saturday and she will on Sunday .
Sleeping is about remembering why you are there .
Last night , when Pookie had a little trouble falling asleep , I went in and told him that he had to stop talking .
I told him that it was time to go to sleep .
Each time he stopped talking , I left the room .
I did not talk in a way that would entertain him at all .
I did not pick him up .
I did not hug him .
I did not bring him something to drink .
I did not sing songs to him .
My entire mission was to remind him why he is in his room at 1 am .
He eventually went back to sleep without any fuss .
I do not claim to be a child sleep expert .
I do claim to be a father of two 3 1/ 2 year olds that both sleep well and have both slept well their entire lives .
A lot of the techniques that we use we learned and slightly modified from Tracy Hogg ’s book , Secrets of the Baby Whisperer .
I love this book .
We read it right around the time we brought the kids home from the hospital .
Her approach is different than a lot that I have read .
She advises that so much of the sleeping success is started long before you reach the bedroom .
She is a big advocate of getting into a daily routine .
Especially with infants .
Getting them used to the order of sleep , wake , eat , play helps them avoid confusion .
They learn the routine and are more involved with each phase because of it .
If you are having trouble getting your kid to sleep , go to the library , bookstore , Amazon , neighbor and pick up the book .
Fajax -- the fake alternative to ajax
March 29 , 2006
Put these two tags in the head of your html document :
< META http-equiv= " Page - Enter " content =" blendTrans ( Duration=0.2 ) " >
< META http-equiv= " Page - Exit " content = " blendTrans ( Duration=0.2 ) " >
That 's it .
You 've implemented Fajax : the fake alternative to ajax .
The blink that occurs on postback is no longer visible , most of the time .
Okay , it 's a dirty nasty trick .
Do n't flame me , troll me , spam me or DoS me .
I feel terrible as i write these words : blendtrans is a Microsoft function .
In non-ie browsers it will have no effect .
How does it work ?
When a page posts back ( for example when you click a button on a form ) , it normally causes a screen flicker as the page is redrawn .
In a lot of cases the screen that is redrawn is very similar to the previous screen , and the flicker is an annoyance , disrupting the user 's experience .
The Blendtrans function causes the old page to blend smoothly into the new one , rather than flickering .
A lot of the time , this gives an identical effect to an ajax style http request .
The page appears to have stood absolutely still as just one part of it is updated .
This simple trick alone gives you about 50 % of the benefit of ajax , with a 1 % of the effort .
Having said that , it 's absolutely limited to that one visual benefit , and limited to one browser .
To get the full benefits of ajax , you will of course need to use ajax , not fajax . ;-)
Note that these effects are best not overused .
My book " Choose Your First Product " is available now .
It gives you 4 easy steps to find and validate a humble product idea .

At the age of one , my daughter began suffering from severe cavities .
At the same time , my teeth where also infected with up to four cavities .
I know what it is like to feel stress from a child suffering from tooth decay , because I have experienced it first hand .
For my daughter , her teeth started to decay so rapidly , that one of them just disintegrated and chipped apart in a matter of about two weeks time .
Two years later , using the nutritional program I developed , my daughter has teeth that are now hard , and resilient , they no longer chip , she has abundant energy , and has remained pain and infection free .
1. November 2006 Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients - Early Childhood Caries
2. Summer 2006 Natural Parenting Australia - Early Childhood Caries
Update : I have since discovered that in addition the the below dietary recommendations , that a liberal supply of bone marrow ( from grassfed animals , or wild fish ) , say anywhere from 1 teaspoon - several tablespoons daily , helps the teeth stabilize , and also is supportive in creating a healthy child .
Tooth decay is a preventable , treatable , and usually a curable occurrence .
You will learn what its cause is , how to treat it , and what you need to be aware of for your and your child 's health .
Included on this page , is a part of a protocol to follow , that will significantly improve the health of your child 's teeth and gums , and it will very likely , slow down , the process of tooth decay .
I encourage you to purchase the print edition of my book , Available by November 1st , because I put in a special 25 page section on healing children 's tooth decay .
" In a group of children whose mothers had the special nutritional reinforcement during gestation and lactation and who had been provided with the same dietary adjuncts during the winter and spring months of infancy and early childhood , not a single carious cavity has developed .
A number of these children are now in public schools .
Their physical development is distinctly above that of the average children of their age , as is also their efficiency in school work . "
Source : Nutrition and Physical Degeneration by Weston Price
1 Re-enamelization ( teeth growing back ) of enamel requires several factors , including enough minerals such as calcium , phosphate , magnesium , and the variety of enzymes needed to regrow tooth enamel such as adenosine diphophatase .
2
Tooth decay begins many generations back .
“ The weakness of calcium deficiency is passed from parent to child .
By following the same paternal pattern of ‘ poor food selection , ’ each new crop of babies becomes weaker .
‘ The sins of the parents are passed on to the third and fourth generation . ’” 4
The weakness is caused not just by a lack of calcium , but by a lack of fat soluble & water soluble vitamins .
“ When Dr. Price analyzed the foods used by isolated primitive peoples he found that they provided at least four times the water soluble vitamins , calcium and other minerals , and at least TEN times the fat soluble vitamins from animal foods such as butter , fish eggs , shellfish and organ meats …
Many tribes required a period of premarital nutrition , and children were spaced to permit the mother to maintain her full health and strength , thus assuring subsequent offspring of physical excellence . ”
5 Many primitive groups Dr. Price studied had a tooth cavity rate close to 0 .
Weston Price also noticed in groups following their traditional diet that decayed teeth either fell out painlessly , or they covered themselves over with a hardened layer of enamel .
Weston Price treated many cases of cavities with a success rate of over 90 % .
At the end of this article is a copy of Dr. Price ’s tooth decay controlling diet for children .
Below on this page on my web site I ’ve scanned an x-ray image showing how Price ’s tooth decay controlling diet healed a girls teeth which had two cavities per tooth , which full dentures where recommended .
6
Not eating enough nutrients is n’t the only reason why teeth would decay .
They also could decay because the body has become too toxic .
We unknowingly ingest these toxins daily .
The most toxic substances are drugs , white sugar , breakfast cereals , cheap vegetable oils and hydrogenated oils .
There is a complete list of toxic elements below .
After years of this behavior , combined with smoking cigarettes , too many medications , and lack of exercise , the liver starts to become weak .
The liver is the bodies nutrient store house .
The toxic accumulations from cellular metabolism , as well as ingested food products inhibit the bodies ability for normal function .
It ’s very likely that there are deeper health problems than simply tooth decay .
Calcium & Childhood Tooth Decay
Teeth are made of calcium and phosphorus .
Would it surprise you to learn , that we are far below the standard for these minerals when compared to the intake of calcium and phosphorus of our ancestors ?
65.1 % of Women on average are below the Standard of 1 gram of calcium per day .
Only 3.7 % of women are at twice the standards , which means , that going into pregnancy , approximately 96 % of women are calcium deprived .

Introduction to Cause and Treatments of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay
For teeth to re mineralize , the surface of the tooth needs to be clean .
Any toothpaste which is pasty contains glycerin .
The glycerin takes about 27 washes with water to remove from the tooth ’s surface .
There are many alternative products such as tooth liquids , tooth powders , sea salt and baking soda , and herbs to clean and treat teeth .
The method for healing children 's teeth begins as follows .
Preferably your child is breastfeeding .
Since the cause of tooth decay , as we now know , is a deficiency in nutrients , caused by wrong diet choices prior to conception , during pregnancy and during the lactation phase , we heal tooth decay by providing a remedy to the nutrient loss .
The vehicle for these nutrients is breast milk .
So breastfeeding is extremely helpful , and that includes night feeding .
If your child is not breastfeeding , then you can modify the suggestions and still produce excellent results .
After the treatment protocol and some pictures , I have provided you with a list of foods you must avoid .
As the toxic conditions created in the bloodstream by these foods , is a substantial factor in your child 's tooth decay .
In trying these Treatments you will also find many other health improvements in your child , including increased alertness , intelligence , and a more positive mood .
While it is possible that your child 's teeth may still decay even on this protocol , you will find that the secondary dentine , the middle layer of the tooth , can regrow .
What happens on this protocol , is that there are enough nutrients , body building substances and proper body chemistry to ensure that the tooth pulp , the inner layer of the tooth does not get exposed .
When the pulp is protected , their will be no infection .
No infection , means no pain .
No pain , means you do not need to have a dangerous medical procedure done on your child !!!!!
My daughter 's one tooth crumbled away .
Now the stub of that tooth , is has hard as a diamond .
The butter oil , and the special dietary protocols we are following are the cause of it .
The Babies True Needs of Calcium and Phosphorus Probably the main cause of tooth decay , is a deficiency in Calcium and Phosphorus in the womb time , and in the breast milk .
Since the infant is growing at a rapid rate , it will exhaust the mother 's supply of bone building nutrients rapidly , so the supply must be replenished quickly .
Testimonial : " When my 4 year old daughter 's teeth began to have lots of tooth decay ( for her age ) , we visited a few dentists and all of them were blaming me that I did not brush her teeth enough .
But I did ...
Basically , they wanted to do dental anesthesia on her and repair all her cavities at once .
My husband and I talked and decided not to put her through this .
After all , she had no pain at all and her teeth did not bother her .
I decided to take the matter into my own hands .
I started researching about tooth decay , and stumbled upon Rami 's web site .
I even wrote to him , and he was very helpful .
A while later , when his book was published , I bought it .
I already knew about the diet from Rami's book , and I was implementing parts of it , but I guess that was not enough to protect my oldest daughter from tooth decay ....
This book gave me hope for my daughter 's teeth - and now I know that we are responsible for our health .
I have also forgiven the dentists that kept showing me how to brush her teeth , I mean , they do n't know better ... When I asked one of the dentists if my daughter does not have enough nutrients in the body , and that 's maybe why her teeth decay ( because the body takes all the essential nutrients from the teeth first ) , he disregarded it and said this could not be the case because all her teeth are formed very well .
I did not argue with him , because I knew he was not taught anything about diet in his medical school .
I just stopped going to dentists and now I try my best to follow the diet ( for my daughter and rest of family ) Rami outlines in his book .
If you are discouraged and do n't know what to do , get this book .
I was very worried and upset about my daughter 's teeth at first , but now I am actually very calm because I know I am doing the right thing . "

Making Corrections to the Breast Feeding Mother 's Diet
Step 0 .
Buy cure tooth decay and learn about healing children 's teeth naturally .
1. Increase Calcium and Phosphorous Intake -
For example , 4 cups or raw grass fed milk , and 5 ounces of a high quality hard cheese , will provide about 2.5 grams of calcium per day .
Phosphorus can be added in the form of meats and organ meats .
Milk must be from grass fed raw milk , and cheese or yogurt preferably from grass fed organic sources .
4 cups or raw milk , gives about 1.2 grams of calcium .
1 cups of yogurt is .3 grams of calcium .
3.5 ounces of high quality hard cheese is 1 gram of calcium .
Goat 's milk products are fine .
If you have problems with milk , consider yogurt and kefir , which are fermented .
Vegetable sources of calcium are Dark Leafy Greens and Broccoli , about 6 cups of chops greens gives you 1 gram of calcium .
3.75 ounces of sardines gives you .3 grams of calcium .
2.Take Butter Oil mixed with High Vitamin Cod Liver Oil .
There are several sources for cod liver oil , that will be listed below , and several methods for taking and making butter oil which will be listed below .
Mother can take anywhere from 1 /2 teaspoon to 2 teaspoons of the special cod liver oil daily , taken in small doses throughout the day with the butter oil .
Do not buy just regular cod liver oil from the store , it has synthetic vitamins and is likely toxic .
The amount of butter oil is anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon of the " X - Factor Gold " Butter oil .
To 2 - 6 tablespoons of clarified high vitamin butter .
( caution : it is possible to overdose on cod liver oil , trust your instincts with the amount , or consult your health care provider )
3 . Other high nutrient foods for mother .
Organ meats & Bone Marrow from Pasture Fed Animals like Liver , kidney ’s , and heart
Farm Raised Eggs , especially the yolks
Oily fish or Lard daily , like salmon , sardines , herring , mackerel and anchovies
Fish eggs ;

3. Consumption of dark leafy green vegetables , and carrots , cooked , along with bone broths made from beef , chicken or fish stock .
4 . Oily fish , or shellfish if appropriate .
( Limiting bananas and other sweet fruits will help )
Some of these mothering forums could be helpful .
How to Get the Butter Oil & Cod Liver Oil
Butter Oil , is a key ingredient to re-enameling teeth because it contains certain fats and activating substances that help bond the nutrients in the body to the bones .
The butter must be from cows or goats eating rapidly growing green grasses .
1. X - Factor Gold , pre-made product is purchasable Online , Let them know you heard about their product from my web site .
2. Pure Indian Foods Ghee , coupon Smile to save 5 %
3 . Use high quality yellow butter and eat lots of it .
To find Anchor Butter , contact New Zealand Milk ( america ) 1-888-869-6455
Another high quality butter is the brand Kerrygold from Ireland , another Jana Valley from New Zealand is okay sometimes .
4. Local Butter !
When local butter is from cows that have been grazing on freshly growing green grass , it will have a yellow color .
Buy loads of this butter and freeze it , eat lots of it throughout the year .
Cod Liver Oil
Almost every brand of cod liver oil has synthetic vitamins added .
Their benefit is questionable , and their toxic burdens likely high .
In the stores you can find the Garden of Life Icelandic Cod Liver oil , which contains no toxic additives .
Online you can order from these three companies a high quality cod liver oil , with the natural vitamins added back .
The Best kinds are fermented liver oils .

Ideally we would prevent tooth decay before it started .
How do we do this ?
Tooth decay begins from an inherited weakness .
The primary weakness is not usually genetic heritage , but from nutritional heritage .
A lack of nutrients and body building substances during pregnancy , from a mother who is nutrient deficient , is the main origin of tooth decay in young children .
Ideally , mother 's could follow the nutritional protocols listed on this web site , during pregnancy , to help prevent tooth decay .
Of particular importance during pregnancy is the consumption of the butter and cod liver oil mixture .
I have a web site dedicated to pre-conception health .
Toxic Foods To Avoid !
Sugar – White Sugar , Brown Sugar , Organic Sugar , Evaporated Cane Juice , Corn Syrup , Commercial Jams
Flour & Grain Products – White Flour , Wheat Flour , Organic Flour , any unsoaked grain products .
Examples : bread , crackers , cookies , doughnuts , breakfast cereals , muffins , pastries , tortillas , bagels , and sandwiches ( most store bought flour products even from the health food store need to be avoided ) .

For most people , choosing which digital camera to buy can be like exercising :
You know it 's the right thing to do , but the process can be so painful !
I hope that the following summary and in - depth article will help improve your understanding of the technical terms and jargon associated with digital cameras .
My goal is to help you understand the most important criteria so that you can find the right digital camera for you .
No digital camera is perfect for everyone , but considering the variety of choices available today , you should be able to find a digital camera that 's close to perfect for you -- and you should be extremely happy with your choice .
If you want a digital camera that 's easy to use , one you can put in your purse or pocket , a digital camera to quickly take pictures of friends and family , then you want a point - and - shoot digital camera -- or what may be more commonly called compact or ultra-compact digital cameras .
In the Photobird Digital Camera Buyer 's Guide , they are referred to as compact and tiny digital cameras , respectively .
Luckily , most of the point - and - shoot digital cameras are in the $ 200 - $ 400 range .
You should be able to get a digital camera that takes excellent photos at that price -- photos that are at least as good as consumer film - based cameras .
Checking the actual , real - life size of the digital camera you are interested in and even " test driving " the digital camera in person is extremely important .
Be sure to visit a physical store that sells the digital cameras you are interested in , or , if you like your friend 's digital camera , ask to borrow it for a while to see if it fits you .
Finding an easy - to - use digital camera is important because you wo n't use it if it 's too hard to take pictures .
For the most part , point - and - shoot digital cameras are easy to use : Turn it on , and start clicking the shutter button to take pictures .
You do n't want to spend a lot of time looking for accessories for your digital camera , or trying to find help to answer a question or resolve a problem with your digital camera .
Therefore , it 's a good idea to purchase a digital camera that is relatively popular .
Of course , be sure to get the features you want and need .
This area is where digital cameras offer the most differences between manufacturers and even different models by the same manufacturer .
You wo n't be able to find a digital camera with every feature you want , however , so you 'll need to prioritize your needs and make some trade - offs .
Regardless of the digital camera you get , you need to make sure you have enough battery power at all times .
It 's always best to have fully - charged , extra batteries with you in case you need them .
You do n't want to miss any shots .
If you 're buying a new digital camera , it really does n't matter which memory card type your digital camera uses .
Focus more on which digital camera features you want , as listed above in item # 6 .
Keep in mind though that the various memory cards are not interchangeable .
For example , you cannot use a Sony Memory Stick in a digital camera that uses CompactFlash , and you cannot use Compact Flash cards in a Secure Digital device .
The number of megapixels your digital camera has does n't necessarily mean that you will get better pictures .
When using the highest resolution settings on a 3 - megapixel digital camera , you will get very good prints at the smallest print sizes all the way up to 8 " x10 " , and sometimes larger .
The photos on the left were taken with a 3 - megapixel digital camera and were printed at 11 " x14 " by an online photo print service .
When printed at their highest resolution , most people can't tell if the photos were taken with a digital camera or a film camera .
Picture quality is last on the list because it's one of the few things you need to worry about when purchasing a point - and - shoot digital camera .
Most , if not all , of the digital cameras available today meet a minimum level of picture quality that is suitable for the average consumer .
I ’ve always been weirdly obsessed with the question of how life on earth would have evolved differently if there had been no moon .
So I was delighted to stumble across this fragment of an essay by Isamov from the early seventies called The Triple Triumph of the Moon .
His most provocative conclusion : land - based life might have never have evolved without the moon :
Life spread outward into the rims of the ocean , where the
sea water rose up against the continental slopes and then fell
back twice each day .
And thousands of species of seaweed
and worms and crustaceans and molluscs and fish rose and
fell with those tides .
Some were exposed on shore as the sea
retreated , and of those a very few survived , because they
happened , for some reason , to be the best able to withstand
the nightmare of land existence until the healing , life - giving
water returned .
Species adapted to the temporary endurance of dry land
developed , and the continuing pressure of competitor saw
to it that there was survival value to be gained in developing
the capacity to withstand dry - land conditions for longer and
ever - longer periods .
Eventually species developed that could remain on land
indefinitely …
And of course the tides are the product of the Moon .
The
Sun , to be sure , also produces tides , nearly half the size of
those produced by the Moon today , but that smaller to - and - fro
wash of salt water would represent a smaller drive towards
land and might have led to the colonisation of the
continents much later in time , if at all .
SAN FRANCISCO , Oct. 26 - A team of Stanford electrical engineers has discovered how to modulate , or switch on and off , a beam of laser light up to a 100 billion times a second with materials that are widely used in the semiconductor industry .
The group used a standard chip - making process to design a key component of optical networking gear potentially more than 10 times faster than the highest - performance commercial products available today .
The team reported its discovery in the current issue of Nature , which was published on Wednesday .
Such an advance could have broad applications both in accelerating the already declining cost of optical networking and in potentially transforming computers in the future by making it possible to interconnect computer chips at extremely high data rates .
Currently , the communications industry uses costly equipment to transmit data over optical fibers at up to 10 billion bits per second .
However , researchers are already experimenting with optically linked computers in which components may be located on different sides of the globe .
Cheap optical switches will also make it possible to create data superhighways inside computers , making it possible to reorganize them for better performance .
The GTA series is one of the world 's most popular games
The scenes in Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas , the best - selling game of 2004 , were unlocked by a fan who created software called Hot Coffee .
Installing Hot Coffee allowed people to play an explicit " mini game " .
As a result , the US Entertainment Software Rating Board ( ESRB ) changed the rating to Adults Only .
The change meant , however , that many shops were forced to stop stocking it as they have a policy of not selling adult - rated content .
In Australia , the game was stripped of its official classification , meaning that shops could no longer sell the title .
" The Hot Coffee scenes were not intended to be part of the Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas experience , " read a statement from the Rockstar , the game 's developer .
" If your copy of Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas for the PC has been altered by the unauthorised Hot Coffee download circulating on the internet , or you wish to prevent your version from being so altered , download and install the patch for your version of the game . "
From the start
Before the ESRB 's investigation , the game had an M for mature rating that meant it could be sold to those aged 17 and above .
GTA : San Andreas has sold millions worldwide
It later admitted it had created the secret scenes , following the ESRB investigation .
The storm of protest over the game even attracted the attention of US senator Hillary Clinton .
She called for an investigation into who was responsible for including the scenes in the game .
In the UK , the game was originally granted an 18 age rating and that rating remains the same .
She 's far too thin .
Everybody says so .
In those shrunken hot pants and skinny red vest she looked positively ravenous , like an urchin from Oliver Twist - albeit one with this season 's Prada handbag and hair extensions .
But just how skinny is Victoria Beckham ?
How would it feel if she sat on your lap ?
Would she be heavier than a kitten ?
If you hugged her would she break ?
We do know that she wears jeans with a minuscule 23 - inch waist - the size , apparently , of a seven - year - old child ( it is also , as it happens , the precise circumference of my head ) .
VB is not alone , of course , but merely the leading exponent of a New Look which has come to dominate our lives .
Other exemplars include Lindsay Lohan , Mischa Barton , Nicole Richie , Kate Bosworth , Amy Winehouse - women relatively new on the celebrity radar who skitter across the pages of magazines , coat hangers furnished with tennis - ball boobs and expensive shoes , not a shred of fat to share among them .
You might not give a tossed salad how much these bony birds weigh .
You might even agree with Kate Hudson ( who recently won a libel action against the UK National Enquirer magazine for implying she had an eating disorder ) that it is none of our business .
But it is .
It matters because hyper - thin has somehow become today 's celebrity standard and , as a result - almost without us noticing - the goalposts have moved for us all .
With every image of Nicole Richie 's feeble wrists or Posh Spice 's concave thighs - which seem to shy away from each other as if they 've never been properly introduced - with every shot , an inch or an ounce is shaved off the notional ideal female form which governs our relationship with our bodies and with the world .
Images of Lindsay Lohan 's chest bones , desperately reaching out to greet strangers , or Keira Knightley 's xylophone of vertebrae , countable at 30 paces , have burned themselves into our consciousness so that uber - thin no longer looks odd .
It no longer shocks .
But it does make you look at your own soft , warm body in a hard new light .
It 's almost as if , in the course of a generation , we 've overturned the age - old feminine ideal - maternal , curvaceous , zaftig .
Looking now at pictures of Linda Evangelista in her supermodel prime , or Elizabeth Hurley in her safety - pin Versace frock , they look - unbelievably - a bit on the heavy side , even though at the time they seemed radiantly slim .
To achieve this mental switcheroo , something seismic has happened , enough to make a body mass index of 10 ( the BMA recommends something in the region of 22 ) look nearly normal to our rewired brains .
When you rub your eyes , though , and snap yourself out of the reverie , you realise that this is n't glamorous .
It 's cadaverously , dangerously thin .
I have seen this kind of thin before .
It resided in the endocrinology department at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead , where a member of my own family was treated for anorexia throughout her teens .
Little could I have known that , in the intervening two decades , the morbidly hungry body type I saw there would become celebrated , a glory to which women of all ages might aspire .
And they do .
We do .
If we are truthful , it 's not just anorexics who pedestal the thin ; we all do , to one extent or another .
After all , the mantra of our age is that thin gets you noticed .
It gets you a contract as a TV presenter or a model or a singer in a girl band .
Thin fast - tracks you with far more alacrity than a degree in history .
More than that , as a society , we tend to cast a forgiving eye upon the very thin , while castigating the repugnantly fat .
Here on my desk , I have a copy of TeenNow magazine , a junior version of the best - selling gossip title .
' What Celebrities Really Weigh ' is its scream - green cover - line .
Victoria Beckham , FYI , weighs 7st 10lb ; Lindsay Lohan is 7st 8 lb ; Hilary Duff weighs in at 7st 7lb , the same as Nadine Coyle from Girls Aloud ( ' My legs are always going to be skinny , ' she says .
' There 's nothing I can do about that . '
Oh yes there is , Nadine !
Try chocolate fudge cake .
Works for me every time . )
Mischa Barton , meanwhile , is 7st 5 lb .
Even Katie Price , with her heavyweight frontage , only tips the scales at eight stone .
Nicole Richie , though , is the runt in the bunch , weighing a painful 6st 9lb .
' I know I 'm too thin , ' she is quoted as saying .
' I would n't want any young girl looking at me wanting to be like me .
I 'm not happy with the way I look right now . '
Why then are TeenNow readers getting a Technicolor gawp at her ?
She 's not there , surely , as a warning , but as a temptation .
Editor Jeremy Mark seems affronted by the suggestion .
' When we do weight covers , we are scrupulously careful not to suggest that skinniness should be an aim for our readers ; we always offer professional advice about healthy eating .
It 's a touchy subject , particularly among teens , so everything is checked by lawyers and doctors .
We certainly have a responsibility to show balance in the images that we choose - which is why we also show Charlotte Church , Joss Stone , Kelly Clarkson , Scarlett Johansson , Beyoncé or Colleen - women with a more rounded shape as a reassurance to our readers . '
Come on , Jeremy , I say .
You know thin sells .
That 's why heat magazine ran ' She 's sooo Skinny ! ' cover lines for a dozen consecutive weeks and smashed their sales figures in the process .
Mark eventually concedes that , ' Yes , it 's a common belief that you must be thin to be beautiful ; there 's so much pressure on celebrities to look that way .
It 's all about ad deals , sponsorship , winning contracts .
Pepsi are n't going to book you if you 're a size 16 , are they ?
They 'll book Cheryl Tweedy instead . '
At the Rhodes Farm Clinic for Eating Disorders in north London , Dr Dee Dawson has noticed a startling jump in the numbers of very young children suffering from anorexia and bulimia .
' We see lots of 10 - year - olds , ' she says with a sigh .
' The link with celebrity cannot be overstated ; though anorexics talk of family problems , the pressure of school or not wanting to grow up , we 're now seeing girls who openly say they want to look like Victoria Beckham .
Thinness is valued .
Among my patients , she is one of the top icons : as far as they can see , she gets invited everywhere , she 's got plenty of money , a handsome husband .
It 's not surprising that they associate her body shape with glamour and success . '
ChildLine too reports an increased number of calls from children , some as young as 10 , seeking help with eating disorders .
The figure rose from 1,000 in 2001 to 1,500 last year .
In a culture which venerates thin , ChildLine reports that it's not unusual for children as young as seven to believe they are fat .
Here 's a chat - room post from Rachael , age 12 : ' I have always hated the way I look .
I try to look in the mirror as little as possible .
I am curvy in all the wrong places , and if I see someone really slim and pretty it makes me want to cry .
But seeing all of the celebs in tight skinny outfits does make me want to lose weight !
I 've done it before and I 'm going to do it again !'
In the darker recesses of the internet , where teenagers increasingly reside , Victoria Beckham has become a macabre pin-up among subscribers to the web 's many pro-ana websites .
Here , anorexics exchange tips on how to starve themselves effectively ( ' Smoking burns calories , ' offers one contributor ; ' If your stomach grumbles , hit it , ' suggests another ) , together with ' thinspirational ' images of their favourite celebrities .
' I envy her thin legs and chest , ' writes one Posh fan .
' She has beautiful bones sticking out of her chest . '
Beautiful bones ?
Hardly , says Dr Dee Dawson .
' With a body like that , she 'll be osteoporotic very early , she 's unlikely to be menstruating , her muscles are being eaten from within - even her heart will have wasted away . '
Furthermore , what these girls are admiring is something that does n't exist in nature - a random handful of body parts held together with eyelash glue .
Says Dawson , with unapologetic ire , ' You can count every single one of her ribs , and then you come to those domes of bosoms that there 's no way she could produce herself .
If she had the right breasts to go with that frame , she 'd have nipples and nothing else !'
Yet that weightless , curiously proportioned body is idolised - by all of us , whether we should know better or not .
Look at Nicole Kidman , Jennifer Aniston , Keira Knightley , Christina Ricci , Teri Hatcher , Eva Herzigova , any model on any catwalk anywhere in the world - I 've got handbags that weigh more than they do .
I could fold Eva Longoria up and pop her in my pocket .
In this looking - glass world , a 100 - pounder is a heavyweight .
Size 00 - a logical impossibility when you pause to consider it - is now Hollywood 's dress - size of choice .
True perspective can be gained when you consider that the pin-up of the 1890s was Lillian Russell , all 200 pounds of her .
We do n't even have to mention Jayne Mansfield , Marilyn Monroe , Sophia Loren - none of whom would get the job today - to know that something 's up .
Studies have shown that , while 25 years ago the average model weighed eight per cent less than the average American woman ( and , yes , Twiggy was abnormally petite in her day ) , today 's model weighs 23 per cent below the national average .
This points up the fascinating paradox that , while we are desperate to keep up with our ever - shrinking celebrities , the average woman is actually getting bulkier .
We 're round like melons and fat like sausages , despite obsessing about our lardy arses every day .
Fat lot of good it does us .
While our icons are running the distinct risk of slipping between the cracks in the pavement , we 're turning into bollards .
Thirty - eight per cent of British women are now classified as overweight , and one in five is obese .
If we resemble anyone , it 's not Posh Spice .
It 's Elton John .
As long ago as 2000 , the BMA , in its report ' Eating Disorders , Body Image and the Media ' , noted that the extreme thinness of celebrities was ' both unachievable and biologically inappropriate ' , observing that the gap between the media ideal and the reality appeared to be making eating disorders worse .
' At present , certain sections of the media provide images of extremely thin or underweight women in contexts which suggest that these weights are healthy or desirable , ' it stated , recommending that normal women in the upper reaches of a healthy weight should be ' more in evidence on television as role models for young women ' .
Television producers and those in advertising should review their employment of very thin women , and the Independent Television Commission should review its advertising policy , the report recommended .
Six years on , the converse has happened .
To maintain their ' biologically inappropriate ' body shape , our celebrities - those brave enough to step up to the plate and admit it - are permanently hungry .
Elizabeth Hurley has confessed as much .
Marcia Cross , who plays Bree in Desperate Housewives , recently admitted that staying thin was ' a living hell ' , and that she felt she had been banned from eating since joining the show .
Actresses , models , singers , presenters - all are subject to the tyranny of thin enforced by the minders , moulders and producers who know very well what sells .
We know it happened to All Saints , to Girls Aloud .
I know that it happens to hopeful young girls from the moment that first crumby Polaroid is taken in the reception of the modelling agency .
Myleene Klass , a winner of the Popstars talent contest , was a size 12 /14 until her then record company advised her to watch herself on video to see how fat she was .
She was assigned a personal trainer , and told to become a size eight .
Fast .
For years now the dreaded ' thin issue ' has plagued the fashion press , who stand accused of promoting a singular and unachievable body shape with every androgynous little sparrow to grace their glossy pages .
Every now and then , we see a flutter of concern - when Omega pulled its ads from Vogue in a 1997 protest , for instance , or when the industry 's prime movers were called to a meeting at Downing Street in 2000 to grapple with the issue .
What tends to emerge after the dust has died down is a whole lot of nothing .
There are occasional forays into the fat zone - a 1997 Nick Knight shoot in Vogue called ' Modern Curves ' featured plus - size model Sara Morrison ; in the same year , The Body Shop ran a series of ads with the tag line , ' There are three billion women who do n't look like supermodels , and only eight who do ' .
Set against the vast portfolio of ' thimages ' which make up the wallpaper of our lives , these trifling efforts have about as much impact as a bubble on the wind .
As Dr Dee Dawson notes , ' I 've sat on endless discussion groups and panels with magazine editors , and they always say they 're trying for balance , that they 're going to change .
It never happens . '
It did happen , once at least in my experience .
When I worked at Vogue a decade ago , one of the editors produced a beach - shoot featuring a size - 14 model .
When they arrived in the office , the photos looked great ; the model was statuesque , not overweight .
But later , on the published page , tucked in between other shoots and ads featuring the starving Barbaras that are the usual glossy fodder , this lovely woman looked huge , as if she 'd been inflated with a bicycle pump .
No wonder the experiment was n't repeated .
No wonder Sophie Dahl shrank the moment she made it as a model .
Given the choice , we 'll take thin , thanks .
Following the Downing Street initiative , Premier , a top model agency , argued convincingly that women who bought fashion magazines were as much to blame as the editors and advertisers who used them .
' It is a supply - and - demand thing - advertisers , magazines and agencies supply the image that consumers want to see .
Statistics show that if you stick a beautiful skinny girl on the cover of a magazine you sell more copies . '
Vogue 's editor Alexandra Shulman might well agree , though she 's too polite to say so .
Until lately , she has rather shirked the issue by saying , ' All we are doing is showing images of women we regard as interesting or beautiful or fashionable .
But we are not actually saying you have to be like this . '
Last year , though , Shulman was more candid : ' I really wish that models were a bit bigger because then I would n't have to deal with this the whole time , ' she said in one newspaper interview .
' There is pressure on them to stay thin , and I 'm always talking to the designers about it , asking why they can't just be a bit closer to a real woman 's physique in terms of their ideal , but they 're not going to do it .
Clothes look better to all of our eyes on people who are thinner . '
Boom .
The bottom line .
Clothes .
Put bluntly , clothes look better on a slim frame .
' Being skinny does n't mean you 've automatically got a good body , not at all , ' confides one wafer - thin friend .
' Thin definitely does n't give you good legs , just thinner legs .
But it does , by and large , mean you 'll look all right in clothes . '
And do n't we all of us want that ?
In my experience , there 's a constant jockeying for position on the weight front among women , a competitive , low - grade bitchery ( rarely expressed , but captured , often , on the cover of heat or Now ) which reveres the dropping of a dress size and stigmatises the gaining of a kilo .
Of course , if you 're bright and grown - up and plugged into the issues of the day , you tend not to let on that you 're fascinated by other women 's bottoms .
But you are .
We are .
We look .
We compare .
In our image - saturated , overweight universe , we 're hypercritical of our peers and our paragons .
It 's nothing to do with men ( heaven knows , few men actually fancy the perilously thin females glorified by women ; most would swap five Posh Spices for a Jennifer Lopez any day ) , and everything to do with competition between females .
' Women are duplicitous on this issue , ' says Leeds Medical School psychologist Dr Andrew Hill .
' Much of the pressure about appearance and weight is applied by other women .
In the face of nutritional abundance , women are showing their status by eating poorly - much as a corpulent belly historically indicated status in times of privation .
It 's perverse , but a reverse snobbery now informs our relationship with weight ; being thin in an overeating society is a sign of control .
It takes enormous will to stay so thin .
' Nationally , we 're getting fatter by a percentage point each year - so people who are trying to lose weight , which means most of us , are in awe of the high achievers in the field .
We 're also intimately involved in celebrity lives in a way we never used to be .
We 're encouraged to have an opinion by an invasive media . '
The web makes it easier still .
Last year , FeedLindsay.com amassed more than 30,000 signatures petitioning scrappy little Lohan to gain weight .
Last February , Nicole Richie was weighed ' live ' on the prime - time Howard Stern Show , a grotesque freak fair for the modern age .
( Since you ask , she was 92 pounds , though observers speculate that she has slimmed down since then ; besides , she was wearing jewellery at the time . )
With every diet tip and photo shoot offered by the famous , the more we are invited to take a seat at their table and judge and , says Dr Hill , the more self - critical we become as a society .
As a result , he says , ' Weight control has become the ambition of a generation . '
For all but the very disciplined - or very disturbed - the kind of hyper - thin portrayed by the stars is an impossible goal , which is why so many Western women are in a constant state of food anxiety .
Four in 10 of us are on a permanent diet .
Ninety - eight per cent of us hate our bodies .
We nurse our own little rituals , weight - management tics that were once the preserve of the Hurleys and Paltrows of this world , carefully tailored to suit our needs .
We know how much bread we ate for lunch and whether we can , therefore , have half a potato for supper .
We 're living under a siege of our own making , bedevilled by a sickening guilt as we lick the last chocolate smear from a Magnum lolly .
Some , of course , are more passionate in their pursuit of thin than others .
My wafer - thin friend is adamant that she is well within the bell - curve of normal when she describes her ' couture - eating disorder ' thus :
' It may vary from writing down fat grams and cals consumed in a single day on the backs of envelopes , which is done as thoughtlessly as doodling , to the constant bits of fat - avoiding snippets we exchange , to ' snacking ' on coffee because it take the edge off hunger to having a glass of water or Diet Coke very close to hand if you ever decide to have a teeny bit of chocolate , so that you can wash away the taste immediately and stop yourself wanting more ...'
And this from an intelligent individual , who knows very well that the game of Thin Quest is the last word in banal .
So , why ?
Why , after emancipation , feminism , after - ha ha - Girl Power - should pouring yourself into a very small frock be such a stellar achievement ?
Is n't it embarrassingly shallow and meaningless ?
We persist , says Dr Hill , because weight has come to signify all that is desirable , because ' judgment of character is increasingly based on superficial appearance .
We objectify celebrities , inferring all sorts of things from their physical appearance .
Image colours everything , simply because , in a world overloaded with information , we cling to what is most obvious : and that 's how things look . '
The recent influx of what Dr Hill calls ' talentless self - seeking bimbettes ' into the fame game has only concentrated attention more fully on looks alone ; that 's all that remains now that silly old talent appears to have been excised from the equation .
In Victoria Beckham 's case , her ' thimage ' has become a life raft for a sinking career .
As one of her friends pointed out recently , ' Her figure is her career and with the spotlight constantly on her , she says she has to watch her weight very carefully .
She does n't care if some people think she 's gone too far . '
If anything , she has come out fighting : ' I have n't got an eating disorder , ' she snapped the other day , ' I 'm just disciplined about what I eat . '
But my , what discipline !
Really , it 's hard not to be impressed .
Most of us would buckle after 10 minutes on her punishing regime .
She chews for ages .
She quizzes waiters to have them remove butter , oil and salad dressings from her plate .
She does n't eat portions that can't fit into the palm of her hand , 'as that 's the same size as her stomach ' .
She only eats fruit till 3 pm and then limits her intake to 500 calories for the rest of the day .
It 's possible - as Dr Dee Dawson points out - that Posh does n't have an eating disorder in the medical sense ; anorexia and bulimia are , after all , psychiatric conditions characterised by a host of pathological behaviours and beliefs way beyond the normal range .
While she displays plenty of these , she also has enough control and awareness to calibrate her food intake when she wants a child and then rein her appetite back in when she wants to dump the baby fat .
According to the friend , ' Victoria knows that she 'll have to start eating carbs if she has any hope of conceiving [ a fourth baby ] . '
Could you ask for a more revealing take on modern life ?
While Victoria admits she has ' come close ' to an eating disorder , other celebrities are more candid .
Here 's just a handful who have recently disclosed their own anorexia or bulimia ( though they usually distance themselves from its grim reality by using the past tense ) : Mary Kate Olsen , Christina Ricci , Portia de Rossi , Calista Flockhart , Karen Elson , Tracy Shaw , Kate Beckinsale , Geri Halliwell , Melanie Chisholm ...
Not that it stops us wanting to look like them ; we just choose to concentrate on their lovely slim arms and nutty buttocks rather than the fact that they have possibly just chucked up their lunch .
Funny how a brain can curtain off unpalatable truths and feed happily on the garnish .
But perhaps we should look harder - at Victoria 's sad little bod , at her desperate little jeans .
Perhaps we should train ourselves to see the perma - hunger of the hyper - thin .
Strip away the gloss , starve their lovely bones of the oxygen of publicity .
In the final analysis , does n't the responsibility lie not with them , but with us ?
Heard the one about the two Irishmen who say they can produce limitless amounts of clean , free energy ?
Plenty of scientists have - but few are taking them seriously .
Steve Boggan investigates
Do you remember that awful feeling as a child on Christmas Day when Santa left you the toy you wanted . . . without any batteries ?
This feeling comes to me as I meet Sean McCarthy and Richard Walshe , two men making the claim that they are about to change the world - for ever .
These dynamic and personable businessmen from Dublin insist that they have found a way of producing free , clean and limitless energy out of thin air .
And they are so confident that they have thrown down the gauntlet to the scientific community in a bid to prove that they have rewritten the laws of physics .
Last week , frustrated that they could n't persuade scientists to take their work seriously , McCarthy , Walshe and the other 28 shareholders of Steorn , a privately owned technology research company , took out a full - page advertisement in the Economist .
In it , they called upon scientists to form a 12 - member jury to decide whether their free - energy system is real , hoaxed , imagined or incorrectly well - intentioned .
So , as they prepare to demonstrate this wonder of science to me at their modest offices near the Liffey , I feel all the excitement of Christmas Day .
There is a test rig with wheels and cogs and four magnets meticulously aligned so as to create the maximum tension between their fields and one other magnet fixed to a point opposite .
A motor rotates the wheel bearing the magnets and a computer takes 28,000 measurements a second .
The magnets , naturally , act upon one another .
And when it is all over , the computer tells us that almost three times the amount of energy has come out of the system as went in .
In fact , this piece of equipment is 285 % efficient .
That 's a lot of " free energy " and , supposedly , a slap in the face for one of physics ' most basic laws , the principle of conservation of energy : in an isolated system ( the planet , say ) , energy can be neither created nor destroyed ; it can only be converted from one form into another .
" We could n't believe it at first , either , " says McCarthy , chief executive of the company .
He is a 40 - year - old engineer born in Birmingham but brought up in Dublin .
After a couple of decades in the oil industry , McCarthy , Walshe and two others set up Steorn as a technology and intellectual - property development company .
" We did difficult things .
If someone had an idea that they wanted to make work , we 'd work on it with them , help them recruit staff and get them through to their first product . "
Then , by chance , came their " discovery " .
They were called upon by the police to help gain forensic evidence against " skimmers " who cloned the cards of people using ATMs .
Subsequently , when banks approached asking how they could prevent such fraud , Steorn advised that the best way was to catch the small number of people committing most of the crime .
They came up with a system of 16 tiny CCTV cameras that could guarantee recording the identities of the perpetrators .
" We wanted the cameras to be independently powered , so we tried out small solar and ambient wind generators , " says McCarthy .
" We wanted to improve the performance of the wind generators - they were only about 60 - 70 % efficient - so we experimented with certain generator configurations and then one day one of our guys [ co - founder Mike Daly ] came in and said : ' We have a problem .
We appear to be getting out more than we 're putting in . ' "
That was three years ago .
Since then , McCarthy says , the company has spent £ 2.7 m developing the technology .
Steorn has also gone into partnership with a European micro-generator company to develop prototypes .
In Steorn 's theory , fixed magnets could act upon a moving magnet in such a way as to make it a virtual perpetual motion generator .
In an electrical appliance - a computer , kettle , mobile phone or toy - that would provide all the power for its lifetime .
Of course , free - energy cars , power plants and water - pumping systems could follow .
A better world indeed .
But then that Christmas Day feeling kicks in ; doubts about the power source .
According to McCarthy and Walshe , the marketing manager , there have been no fewer than eight independent validations of their work conducted by electrical engineers and academics " with multiple PhDs " from world - class universities .
But none of them will talk to me , even off the record .
I am promised a diagram explaining how the system works , but then Steorn holds it back , saying its lawyers are concerned about intellectual property rights .
And that European partner , the one with the moving , almost perpetual , prototypes ?
It wo n't talk to me either and Steorn has undertaken not to name it .
" It 's the Pons - Fleischmann factor , " says McCarthy , and he and Walshe look at each other darkly .
Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann were the last experts to excite the scientific community with free - energy claims when , in 1989 , they reported producing a nuclear - fusion reaction at room temperature - what happens in the sun at millions of degrees centigrade .
The subsequent controversy resulted in the scientists being pilloried , even though the scientific community remains divided to this day over claims of " low - energy nuclear reactions " .
" No one in the scientific community wants to become embroiled in the kind of controversy that Pons and Fleishmann faced , " says McCarthy .
" With our challenge , we 're hoping to provide a respectable public platform for serious evaluation of the technology .
Then , perhaps , scientists will feel confident enough to challenge the conventional view . "
Certainly , the Steorn team seems genuine and well - intentioned .
Walshe says that if the technology is accepted it will be licensed to manufacturers , but given away to electrical and water projects in developing countries .
And , until their claims have been assessed by the jury , McCarthy says they wo n't be accepting any investor offers .
So if this is a hoax , it would appear not to be a money - making scheme ; Walshe says the Economist ad alone cost £ 75,000 .
" Before we went public , we realised that if we 're wrong it could have a very adverse effect on our business , so we 're not doing this lightly , " says McCarthy .
" We expected stick , and we 're getting it already .
We 've had a lot of abusive emails and telephone calls - people telling us to watch our backs , that sort of thing .
Someone even published my home address on a website . "
The conspiracy theorists are , indeed , having a field day in a forum section set up by the company on its website , www.steorn.com.
" We 've been accused of being a publicity stunt for the next Microsoft Xbox gaming system because some of the artwork on our website was similar to theirs , " says Walshe .
" Some people have said our offices do n't exist and one accused us of simply being a call centre in Australia because one of our telephonists has an Australian accent .
My favourite is the one that says we are a CIA or oil - industry front intended to discredit research into free and clean energy .
In other words , our claims are deliberately false and when they are found out to be , it will be a blow for all free and clean research . "
Steorn says it has seven patents pending on its technology , though it is difficult to see what can be patented ; magnets already exist and so do the 360 degrees of a circle .
Yet it is the positioning of the magnets that seems to be at the heart of this " new " energy .
And , as McCarthy points out , the Patent Office rejects inventions that fly in the face of such fundamental principles as , say , the conservation of energy .
Nevertheless , as of yesterday , almost 3,000 people claiming to be scientists had expressed an interest in sitting on the Steorn jury .
The 12 best will be chosen at the end of the month and then testing will begin .
" We 've been advised it could take between a week and 10 years , " says McCarthy .
" We do n't have any doubts .
We 've conducted meticulous research and we 're getting such phenomenal results - up to 400 % efficiency - that small glitches and errors in testing can be ruled out .
We really believe we 've found something that can change the world . "
The rest of us can only wait and see .
In the meantime , I ask Martin Fleischmann , the cold - fusion scientist , now 79 and retired , what he thought of the Steorn project .
" I am actually a conventional scientist , " he says , " but I do accept that the existing [ quantum electro - dynamic ] paradigm is not adequate .
If what these men are saying turns out to be true , that would be proof that the paradigm was inadequate and we would have to come up with some new theory .
But I do n't think their claims are credible .
No , I can not see how the position of magnetic fields allows one to create energy . "
With great charm , Dr Fleischmann wishes the Steorn team luck .
And if their " free " energy can light up a developing - world village or the eyes of a child with a toy , then perhaps we all should .
June 15 , 2005  -- " Denerding " is n't yet a word recognized by New York Times editors , even for use in its crossword puzzle , but it might become one after " Wordplay " hits theaters .
While you might not find any of the crossword champs with pocket protectors , many of the top puzzlers featured in " Wordplay " live up to the popular image of the bookish know - it - all who wants to show off , work in pen rather than pencil , and solve the Times ' Monday puzzle in less than three minutes .
But if there 's still a stigma attached to puzzlers , the documentary , opening Friday , blows it apart , with a close look at the Times puzzle editor , Will Shortz .
As many as 50 million American puzzlers are Shortz fans .
They 're as Republican as Bob Dole , as Democratic as Bill Clinton , and as hip as Amy Ray and Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls , who 've been known to ask in concert " Did anyone get 6 - Down today ? "
Of course , many of the top puzzlers seem lost in their own wordy world .
" I 've always been fascinated by the letter ' Q ' , " says Trip Payne , one of the grandmasters at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament .
Crossword as Sport : ' Bring It On ! '
Another crossword gladiator likens his prowess to the athletic excellence of Barry Bonds , and when he does , filmmaker Patrick Creadon cuts to the mighty slugger swinging through a third - strike pitch .
Call it revenge of the nerds , because the mighty Bonds has been struck out by another prominent and accomplished crossword puzzler , New York Yankee ace hurler Mike Mussina .
" If you can handle the puzzle in the Times , you can handle any puzzle they throw at you , " Mussina says .
On a Saturday afternoon a few seasons ago , while Mussina was tossing one of his gems , Yankee announcer Michael Kay described how the pitcher was at his locker room completing a puzzle before his pregame warm -up .
As if sensing the typical baseball fan would n't notice the significance of this feat , Kay felt compelled to elaborate .
" The Times makes the toughest crosswords , and if you can do it on Monday , you should be proud of yourself .
But by Tuesday and Wednesday , they keep getting harder , " he said , noting that the man on the mound graduated from Stanford University .
" If you can do the puzzle by Saturday , you 're something special .
And that 's why you wo n't see what Mussina was doing in a major league locker room too often . "
The Errol Flynn of Crosswords
It 's apparently not that unusual to call puzzling a sport .
" Bring it on , Shortz ! " shouts Comedy Central 's Jon Stewart as he works a puzzle from his desk in gym clothes .
" I am a Times puzzle fan , " Stewart says .
" I will solve the USA Today puzzle [ when traveling ] , but I do n't feel good about myself . "
Shortz is indeed a legend .
Known to millions as the " Puzzle Master " on National Public Radio's " Weekend Edition , " he took over the mantle of Times crossword editor in 1993 , becoming only the fourth person since 1942 to assume what many consider the ultimate dream job .
" When you imagine a ' crossword guy , ' you imagine he 's 13 or 14 inches tall … someone who does n't care to go more than 5 feet without his inhaler , " says Stewart .
" And yet he 's a giant man .
He 's the Errol Flynn of crossword puzzling . "
Shortz , a 53 - year - old Indiana University graduate , is said to be the only person in the world to hold a degree in enigmatology ( the study of words ) , a curriculum he designed under the university 's general studies program .
In 1978 , Shortz helped organize the first American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford , Conn. , which the local Marriott 's marketing department conceived to beef up wintertime revenues .
The event has taken on a life of its own , with more than 500 fierce competitors .
At times , " Wordplay " seems like the wildly successful 2002 documentary " Spellbound , " which offered a glimpse into the cutthroat world of spelling competitions .
But crossword competitors are adults .
And while geek tormentors may say otherwise , they indeed have lives .
Top players include Ellen Ripstein of Manhattan , also known as the Susan Lucci of Crossword for finishing near the top for 18 years but not winning .
" Wordplay " also examines the lives of those evil geniuses known as professional crossword constructors .
Shortz works with a stable of these experts who 've found the perfect outlet for their bizarre gift with the language .
But writing a tantalizing crossword clue takes more than verbal skills .
It takes an astute knowledge of popular culture .
While explaining his profession , Merl Reagle passes a Dunkin ' Donuts .
He stops midsentence , eyes lighting up , and says , " You know , if you take the first letter of " Dunkin " and move it to the end , it becomes ' Unkind Donuts . "
In '96 , Times Puzzle Declares Clinton and Dole Winners
Bill Clinton 's famous ability to connect with everyday Americans might come , in part , from his puzzling prowess .
" Half the time I do these things just to see what people are thinking about , " he says .
While many see crosswords as a boredom beater , the former president says they 're not bad as preparation for the Oval Office .
" Sometimes you have to go at a problem the way I go at a complicated crossword puzzle , " Clinton says .
" You start with what you know the answer to , and then you build on it .
A lot of complex problems are like that .
You have to find some aspect of it you understand and build on it until you can unravel the mystery that you 're trying to solve . "
Crossword puzzles might get a bad rap as nothing more than boredom beaters for folks with way too much time on their hands .
But even if you 're not a fan , this documentary explores the art of the puzzle .
Shortz edited the famed " Election Day Puzzle " ( created by Jeremiah Farrell ) , which included a clue that asked puzzlers to come up with a 14 - letter headline for tomorrow 's paper .
" Clinton Elected " or " Bob Dole Elected " both fit .
And miraculously , both responses worked .
Even Dole says he was impressed .
Unfortunately for him , the Electoral College proved to be one puzzle he could n't solve .
Spending too Much the Wrong Way on the Wrong Things
First , I would like to thank John Mueller for his provocative essay .
In the current political context , it is refreshing to read challenging ideas on such a sensitive topic as homeland security and terrorism threats .
Since September 11th , Congress has appropriated nearly $ 271.5 billion to protect the American homeland from terrorism — roughly $ 545 per American household .
Not surprisingly , outlays have jumped since 9/11 — there has been a 246 percent increase from $ 16.9 billion in FY2001 to at least $ 58.2 billion in FY2007 .
Despite this spectacular increase in spending , the common message on the Hill and from the Administration is that we are not spending enough on homeland security .
This view , for instance , is championed here by Clark Kent Ervin , who wrote “ the threat of terrorism here at home is not taken seriously and as a result , we are doing far less than we should be doing to combat it . ”
I hold a contrary opinion , and agree with John Mueller that as a whole the risk of terrorism has largely been overblown .
It is a fact that there are many threats — like driving off the road , falling , drowning or being shot by law enforcement — far more likely to kill an American than any terrorist .
I also agree with a statement he made in a recent Reason magazine interview where he explained that “ the true costs [ of the 9/11 attacks ] come mostly from overreaction , not from bombs or deaths themselves . [ 1 ]
In other words , we are feeling less safe than we probably should be and as a consequence we are over - investing in homeland security .
But that does n’t tell the whole story .
Not only are we over - investing in homeland security , but most times we spend too much money in the wrong way and on the wrong things .
Homeland security is a strategic problem , and like any strategic problem it requires a strategic solution .
In matters of strategy , efficient expenditures concentrate limited resources on the most cost - effective initiatives .
Not every need is worth funding — or can be funded in a world of limited resources — and the greatest priorities and risks should be addressed first .
Unfortunately , today , the logic behind some federal involvement in security seems to be that the mere existence of vulnerability in any given industry or a given area merits funding .
That makes it seem that , because all transportation systems , infrastructures , and economic sector have inherent weaknesses , federal intervention must be required everywhere .
In fact , it is perfectly reasonable and even responsible to refuse to implement a specific anti-terrorism measure , not because it has no conceivable benefit , but because the costs are too high compared to the potential benefits .
For instance , locking up every Arab - looking person would reduce the potential for terrorism perpetrated by Islamic fundamentalists , but no reasonable person would suggest this approach because the costs ( both pecuniary and moral ) are too high .
U.S. airline security measures provide a good example of the federal government ’s approach to balancing risk .
The likelihood of an attack similar to those we suffered on 9/11 has been reduced to roughly zero with simple cockpit barricades , which the airline industry installed at relatively low cost .
Yet since then we have spent $ 34 billion on a system for screening every bag belonging to every airline passenger .
If you add to that cost the aggregate opportunity cost , likely in the billions , incurred by passengers for the extra hours at the airport , you end up with a huge bill for an agency which measures its success by having “ intercepted seven million prohibited items at airport checkpoints , including just over 600 firearms . ”
In other words , 99.992 percent of intercepted items are tweezers , breath fresheners and lighters .
Our main problem with security is caused by the unwillingness of lawmakers , law enforcement agencies and security experts to tell the public that sometimes there are no easy answers and that just throwing money at a problem wo n’t achieve anything .
Maybe more importantly , it is their unwillingness to recognize that sometimes we are , on the whole , better off doing nothing than implementing measures that are ineffective .
So what should we do ?
Or not do ?
We all agree — or at least should agree — that there is no way to protect everything from every possible mode of attack .
In the United States , as with all stationary targets , the attacker has a natural advantage because he gets to choose where and when to strike .
The German thrust into Western Europe in World War II is a natural analog :
The Wehrmacht simply side - stepped the impressive Maginot Line defenses built by the French .
Similarly , terrorists will attack wherever the defenses are weakest .
In this case , as John argues , the cost - effective thing to do might be : instead of trying to protect hundreds of targets , save the money , and then if something happens , use it to fix things .
Then we could go after the people who actually did the crime .
Unfortunately I doubt this policy could see the daylight in our current political context .
Intelligence gathering and counter - intelligence is definitely the next most cost - effective defense .
The idea is to thwart the attackers before the attack is even launched or deploy personnel and equipment exactly where the attack is anticipated .
I would argue that , at the federal level , any other form of security measure is a waste of money .
For instance , we know that one of the biggest failures that led to September 11th is the lack of information - sharing between the different levels of government .
An important counter - terrorism goal should have been to set in place an efficient system so that such an oversight never happens again .
Five years later , scant progress has been made in this area .
And the lack of funding is not the issue .
Since 9/11 the federal government has sent over $ 27 billion to state and local governments in the form of grants for preparedness and response which were swiftly invested in everything from hazmat suits to gym memberships .
Returning to the issue of airline security , we know that the main threat to planes today is explosives brought aboard by suicide bombers .
We also know that few carry - on bags or passengers are checked for explosives .
Yet even if we could check for explosives in carry - on luggage with perfect accuracy , it would n’t necessarily be a good idea because of the astonishing cost associated with such a scheme .
Instead of spending massive amounts of money to keep bad objects off planes , a more effective measure would try to keep bad people off planes .
Again , intelligence is the solution , not prohibiting toothpaste and nail polish in planes .
In the end , I agree with John Mueller that we are probably overestimating the risks we face and that as a consequence we are over - investing in homeland security measures .
Yet , I would like to go even further .
Bad security is often worse than no security at all .
By trying , and failing , to make ourselves more secure , we make ourselves less secure .
We make poor tradeoffs , and we are asked to give up a lot in terms of money and freedom in exchange for little or no real benefit .
Surely the misplaced perception of security is n’t worth that .
Dr. Bernstein cannot say which was more jarring : the news or the way it arrived .
Numb , he kept his composure for 25 minutes , he said .
The administrators explained that the hospital was running a deficit .
The diabetes program was not helping matters .
" It was really not about the medicine but the business , " Dr. Fink said recently about the meeting .
" That did n't make it any easier to deliver the news , especially since I had been one of the main advocates behind getting the center started . "
After the meeting , as Dr. Bernstein walked back to his office , he wondered where he would direct the program 's 300 or so patients .
Still , he remained sympathetic to the hospital 's plight .
" I was not of the belief that we should save the center only to end up losing the hospital , " he said .
For many of the patients , the news was a second strike of lightning .
They had come to Dr. Bernstein only after being cut loose by the closing of the St Luke 's diabetes center earlier that year .
Now they were being cut loose again , to drift back to a life of limited care options : understaffed and overwhelmed clinics ; general practitioners with too little time ; a city with about 100 overbooked diabetes educators surrounded by 800,000 patients ; and a shortage of endocrinologists , the specialists who are often critical providers of diabetes care .
Since endocrinology is one of the lower - paying specialties , there is a national shortage of such doctors .
In New York , with its armies of diabetics , patients must often wait months for an appointment with one of fewer than 200 endocrinologists .
The poorest patients face the biggest problem , as only a fraction of the specialists accept Medicaid .
Once the center had closed , Dr. Bernstein continued to teach at Beth Israel , but he began to devote more and more time to a side project .
He was working on an inhaler that delivers insulin in the form of a mist .
The product is being developed by Generex , and it is designed to appeal to patients who are reluctant to use insulin because they do not like the idea of injections or needles .
A new study of 21 different nations has found that the male dominance of computer science at university level is pandemic .
At first glance the study looks to be yet more confirmation of what we already know .
However , it gets more interesting .
Differences between the countries indicate that women might not be genetically predisposed to shun all things high tech , and that there might be other factors at work .
The study , co-authored by Maria Charles , professor of sociology at the University of California and Karen Bradley of Western Washington University , found that men are over - represented among computer science graduates everywhere , but the degree of over - representation varies by as much as a factor of three .
So what is behind the variation ?
Turns out , it is not what you might expect .
Girls ' higher achievement in maths or science did not seem to be related to the number of graduates , nor was cultural support for equal opportunities a good predictor of which countries had the most women Comp Sci graduates .
In Turkey , for instance , for every woman Comp Sci graduate there are 1.79 men , while at the other end of the scale , in the Czech republic men graduates outnumber women by 6.42 to one [ perhaps they 're all working as super - models and will return to their computing education at a later stage - Ed ] .
South Korea and Ireland also have more relatively high numbers of women graduating from computer science courses , but , like Turkey , neither of these nations is especially renowned for taking a hard line on sex equality .
Instead , it seems that restricting the choices available to adolescents , and making it mandatory for all pupils to study maths and science subjects throughout their secondary education , correlates with a higher proportion of women going on to study computer science at university .
" The principle of being free to pursue your preferences is compatible and coexists quite comfortably with a belief in essential gender differences .
This essentialist notion , which helps to create what it seeks to explain , affects girls ’ views of what they 're good at and can shape what they like , " said Charles .
She goes on to say that the implications for policy are clear : rather that letting kids discard subjects too soon , governments should insist on more maths and science for everyone , for longer .
" As other research has repeatedly shown , choices made during adolescence are more likely to be made on the basis of gender stereotypes , so we should push off choice until later , " she concludes . ®
Think of it as the dilemma of 24 .
In the TV thriller , hero Jack Bauer has 24 hours to avert a catastrophe - say , to prevent terrorists detonating a nuclear bomb over Los Angeles .
Over the course of 24 hour - long episodes we urge Bauer , from the edge of our seats , to do whatever it takes to stop the killers .
As we watch , our nerves taut , there is no ethical corner we do n't want Bauer to cut , if that 's what he has to do to prevent murder and mayhem .
In one series , our man cuts off the head of a villain with a hacksaw - and we 're glad he 's done it .
That 's fiction , but it seems a version of Jack Bauer syndrome operates in real life too .
Almost three - quarters of us are happy to give up civil liberties in order to make us safer from terrorist attack , according to Monday 's Guardian / ICM poll .
Having seen the all - too - real threat of the July bombings , 73 % are ready to pay the price , ready to let our protectors do whatever has to be done .
That will bring cheer to Tony Blair , whose parting words before he left for his Barbados holiday were a declaration that " the rules of the game are changing " , accompanied by an aggressive 12 - step programme for combating terror .
Since then the government has been consulting on some of those steps and later this week , perhaps tomorrow , Charles Clarke will announce what action he plans .
If our poll is right , and Jack Bauer syndrome really does apply , he will face little public resistance .
But perhaps he should .
For the trouble with a 24 approach to policy - making is that it relies too heavily on the gut - and too little on the head .
Start with Blair 's first step , the deportation of the small number of foreign nationals deemed to be fostering hatred or advocating political violence .
Some of these " preachers of hate " - the men who praise the killers of 9/11 and 7/7 as " magnificent " - would be kicked out of the country , never to return .
Good riddance , says the 24 viewer in each of us .
Then we think practically for a moment .
Given that terrorism is a global business , are we that much safer if a hatemonger is moved abroad rather than here ?
Would n't it be better if he were out of circulation altogether and behind bars ?
Deportation simply relocates the problem ; it does not solve it .
The principled objection centres on the nature of the countries in which these extremists would be dumped : Jordan , Egypt , Algeria , Morocco and Tunisia , places where the newly arrived expellee from Britain could expect to be greeted by the torturers of the local secret police .
Who cares , says Bauer .
Maybe a little pressure on the bad guys will get them to talk .
But most of us , on reflection , do not really believe that .
We draw the line somewhere - and that somewhere is state - sanctioned torture .
Our own Human Rights
Act bars us from sending anyone to face such a fate .
The government has got round that by asking receiving countries to sign " memoranda of understanding " , promising to respect the human rights of any deportees .
Clarke says we can rely on those promises just as we trust the US when it says it wo n't execute people it extradites from Britain .
To see any difference between , say , Egypt and the US is , insists Clarke , " latter - day imperialism " .
But Liberty , the human rights advocacy group , points out a key difference .
The US admits it implements the death penalty ; its policy is entirely in the open .
None of the countries on Blair 's list admits it practises torture ; so what value is a commitment from a foreign government to refrain from doing something it denies in the first place ?
Blair also wants action on homegrown " preachers of hate " , those who can not be deported .
They will be put under control orders - facing curfews , wearing electronic tags , their use of telephones and the internet restricted and their right to meet others curbed .
Given what some of these hardliners believe , my heart will hardly bleed if they now find it a bit harder to log on to killallwesterners.com .
But whether I sympathise with such people is not the issue .
The trouble with control orders is that they are too harsh on the innocent and too soft on the guilty .
For the former , they count as a form of punishment without trial .
For the latter , a control order can only slow down a determined terrorist from doing his worst .
The solution is obvious .
If the authorities suspect someone is involved with terrorism , that person should be prosecuted and jailed .
Too tricky , says the government ; we can't get the evidence .
But if that 's the problem , then we need to change the rules on what counts as admissible evidence - allowing wiretap transcripts , for example , as most other countries already do .
If the suspect has not yet done anything wrong , but it 's feared he might , then stalk his every move .
Put him under 24 - hour surveillance until we know what he 's planning - and then charge him .
But that costs big money , says the government .
No problem , take the money out of the black hole that is identity cards .
The key point here , and it applies to almost all of Blair 's 12 - step programme , is that while these new plans might give us a brief , Bauer - style rush of blood , they are either misguided or unnecessary .
If they 're not wrong in principle , they 're wrong practically , or where they 're right , their objectives could be met just as well by laws we already have .
So Blair wants to crack down on those guilty of " justifying or glorifying terrorism " .
That will be tricky - unless he plans on prosecuting his wife for saying Palestinian suicide bombers had " no choice but " to kill Israeli civilians .
Or perhaps he fancies the prospect of a show trial starring George Galloway .
What Blair surely wants to get at is incitement to terrorist acts - and that 's already against the law .
Blair 's programme includes a ban on hardcore Islamist organisations such as Hizb - ut Tahrir and al - Muhajiroun .
I oppose everything that these groups stand for - but I feel the same way about the BNP , and no one is calling for it to be banned .
Democracy forces you to accept that even the most repulsive opinions have a right to be aired somewhere .
Besides , what quicker way to turn these fringe extremists into heroes than by declaring them off limits ?
Closing down mosques deemed hotbeds of extremism is similarly wrong - headed .
That will alienate the very Muslim community whose cooperation the police and intelligence agencies need so badly .
The sight of a dawn raid on a house of worship , police armed with padlocks , will confirm every lurid extremist claim about a state war on Islam .
Again , anyone guilty of incitement can be charged under existing law .
Almost all of the Blair proposals are like that - superficially appealing , but on closer inspection either flawed or unnecessary .
This is a minefield , one we all need to step through carefully .
This is not TV , this is real life - and it's much more dangerous .

Back when we cooked up XML in 1996 - 97 , there were good reasons to have that ugly upper -case gibberish at the top of your XML documents .
That was almost ten years ago ; now it ’s time to do away with it , and also time to have a spec for Doctype - free XML .
Why DTDs ? · The Doctype declaration is supposed to do three different things for you :
Say what the root element of your document is supposed to be .
Point to your DTD , so you can check if the document is valid .
Define entities .
These are used as names for boilerplate strings , for special characters , and ( in theory ) to include external documents .
The first two are are not only unnecessary but actively harmful .
First of all , we have better technology than DTDs for doing syntax validation .
Second , it ’s usually a bad idea for a document to express an opinion as to what its own schema is .
Most useful languages have more than one schema , and it ’s the absolute right of someone receiving a document to decide whether it meets their definition of “ valid ” before they use it , so they ’re going to make their own decisions as to which schema ( if any ) is appropriate .
Entities as names for strings are handy but not essential .
Their use as names for non-ASCII characters will be missed ; people who write mathematics in a plain - text buffer have become used to typing δ for “ Δ ” , ∞ for “ ∞ ” , and so on .
But I ’m sitting here typing this document in a text editor and if I want to write Δ or ∞ or チムブレー , there are a bunch of ways I can do it without requiring any entities .
The problem only bites you when , first of all , you ’re hand - authoring your document without any help from the editor , and second , you ’re on an operating system that does n’t let you enter those characters .
This problem space is getting smaller every year .
The use of entities to include external documents has never really caught on , although in principle it sounds useful .
I suspect that at the end of the day , the encoding layer is just the wrong place to stick hyperlinking and document composition functions .
Actively Harmful · A lot of XML is used in network protocols , and in network protocols , <! DOCTYPE > is actively harmful .
Receiving software in principle might have to go and fetch an external DTD , or failing that , be prepared to deal with the voodoo around standalone = " yes / no " in the XML declaration .
For this reason , popular network applications of XML like SOAP simply forbid the Doctype declaration .
But this is kind of bad behavior , as RFC 3470 ( AKA BCP 70 ) points out , if you ’re going to use XML , it ’s best to just say “ Use XML ” and not get into subsetting the syntax .
So the take - away is , it would be nice to have an actual single spec for this kind of XML that leaves out all the complexity and black magic that falls out of the Doctype declaration .
We already have proposals .
Proposals · The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work is Norm Walsh ’s XMLK proposal from 2003 , which makes only one change to the XML specification : no <! DOCTYPE > .
Norm later on got a bit more ambitious and cooked up an XML 2.0 proposal , which not only nuked the Doctype but had clever proposals for new namespace and entity syntax .
Then there ’s my own XML - SW , which actually substantially rewrites the XML spec , removing the Doctype and at the same time weaving in the Namespaces and Infoset specifications , giving you one place to go to read about all the basic can ’t - live - without - ’em XML technologies .
The Future · I suspect that nothing will happen ; we ’ll go forward indefinitely into the future , with XML implementors required to read the XML spec , learn to ignore all the Doctype stuff , then go read the Namespaces and Infoset specs , and synthesize all that in their heads .
After doing polyphasic sleep for about 5 - 1/ 2 months , I finally decided to switch back to monophasic .
I made the decision about 10 days ago and have already returned to Bearsville .
I went back to my previous pattern of being an early riser .
So now I sleep about 6.5 hours a night and wake up with an alarm at 5 am every morning .
Why the return to monophasic sleep ?
First off , this definitely was n’t a clear - cut decision either way .
I could just as easily have kept going .
As previously noted in my extensive log entries , there were many things I really liked about polyphasic sleep .
Obviously the extra waking time was great .
But there are some drawbacks to polyphasic sleep that ultimately led me to decide to discontinue this pattern .
The drawbacks should be easy to understand even if you do n’t try it personally , so I do n’t think any of these will surprise you .
First off , let me say that I did n’t decide to stop for health reasons .
To my recollection I did n’t get sick even once while sleeping polyphasically , not even a cold .
My energy and alertness were excellent once I made it through the adaptation period .
A lot of people asked me about weight training and exercise — I did n’t have any problems there either .
My recovery after workouts was just fine .
Perhaps the post - workout nap had a positive effect .
I also did n’t decide to stop because of the general weirdness of polyphasic sleep .
It took me many weeks to psychologically adapt to this pattern of sleeping , but I did eventually adapt .
It gave me a whole new perspective on the passage of time .
I saw time as passing continuously rather than being chunked into individual days .
That was such an interesting experience .
The # 1 reason I decided to call it quits is simply that the rest of the world is monophasic .
If most of the world was polyphasic , I probably would have stuck with it .
Obviously when you go polyphasic , you fall out of sync with the way other people live .
You ’re awake most of the night while everyone is asleep .
If you sleep like most people , then the hours you ’ll gain from polyphasic sleep will come in the middle of the night .
And as I gradually learned , nighttime hours are not the same as daytime hours when you live in a monophasic world .
At first I rather liked the novelty of this new way of living .
I enjoyed having all that alone time .
It was great for writing , since I ’d never be interrupted .
But after several months , it began to wear on me .
Although I gained those nighttime hours , I also lost about 90 minutes during the daytime because of my naps .
So that meant less time to interact with people while they were awake .
There were times when that was n’t such a desirable trade - off .
At first it was fun doing things at night .
Las Vegas is a decent place to be polyphasic .
I played poker late at night a few times , and that was fun for a while .
But even though this is a 24 - hour city , most businesses still close at night , and most of the available nighttime activities do n’t interest me .
My family and friends are all asleep at night , and I do n’t know anyone locally who ’s up all night and is n’t working .
And I already spend enough time on the Internet .
So ultimately I was left with many hours of alone time .
Working at night was OK , but I like bouncing ideas off my wife during the day , and that was n’t an option at night .
Also , if I worked at night , I did n’t want to work during the daytime too .
I tried that and quickly grew weary of 20 - hour workdays .
Working at night meant being out of sync with people who worked during the day , like missing business calls and such .
Also , I really enjoy working with sunlight coming in through my window as opposed to using artificial light .
Another challenge was that I had to take my naps fairly regularly , every 4 hours on average .
I could stretch the time between naps every once in a while , but if I did that I ’d have to make up for it later with more frequent naps .
Suppose I want to begin working on a project , but I have a nap coming up in an hour .
I did n’t want to start the project knowing that I could only work an hour before having to nap .
So I tried to shuffle my work around to coincide with my short waking cycles .
That became somewhat annoying because I used to enjoy working 5 - 6 hours without a break .
I did n’t like chopping all of my work into 3.5 - hour blocks , and I often found the naps were getting in the way of my flow state .
This was n’t a very resilient pattern because if something unexpected came up , it would throw off my schedule , and I ’d have to take naps while I was in the middle of a task like writing an article , which broke my train of thought .
Whenever I wanted to do anything socially , I had to bracket those outings with naps on both ends .
I got a bit tired of having to do this .
I could never just up and leave .
I always had to nap first unless I was only going to be out a short time .
Also , I ’d often be both hungry and sleepy when I returned unless I ate while I was out .
My outings often took the form : nap - outing - nap - eat .
I like being spontaneous at times , but you ca n’t be too spontaneous on polyphasic sleep without negative consequences .
That really cramped my style .
I also missed sleeping with my wife .
However , she really liked having the bed all to herself at night .
She said she never slept better .
She actually did n’t want me to go back to monophasic .
But what I really missed was having 90 minutes less with her while she was awake .
Our time together was often interrupted by my naps , especially the one at 9 pm .
For example , we could n’t start watching a movie together at 8 pm without it being interrupted by a nap intermission .
So really it was the combination of all these niggling factors that led me to decide to return to monophasic sleep .
There are some things I really loved about polyphasic sleep , and there are some things I found very annoying .
But now that I ’ve adapted back to monophasic , I have to say that it ’s still not clear who the winner is .
I ca n’t say that I ’ll never return to polyphasic sleep if my circumstances change .
But for right now , for the kind of lifestyle I want to have , monophasic sleep is just a little bit better .
So it ’s back to hibernation mode for me . 🙂
What was it like switching back to monophasic ?
I was n’t sure what to expect when I decided to switch back to monophasic .
It ended up taking me several days to re-adapt .
I started out by going to bed with my wife one night and trying to sleep until morning .
I only managed to sleep a few hours .
I kept waking up , but when I could n’t sleep I just quietly meditated instead .
It was a long , slow night .
The next day I tried to skip naps , but I was n’t very successful .
I still got sleepy at my usual nap times and took three naps .
The second night was slightly better — I was able to sleep longer , maybe 4 - 5 hours total .
Each day / night saw more adaptation , and over the next few days , I reduced my daytime naps from 3 to 2 to 1 .
Eventually I was able to go the whole day with no naps .
I ’m not quite 100 % re-adapted yet , since I still need a daytime nap sometimes , but it ’s close enough .
I may actually keep the early afternoon nap , since I still find it very refreshing .
I am sleeping a good 6.5 hours at night now , although I still wake up once in the middle of each night .
Last night was sort of funny because I actually fell asleep twice while my wife was talking to me .
🙂
I ’m sure some people would rather see me continue with polyphasic sleep — I was amazed at how popular it ’s become and how many people have wanted to try it .
Although I opted to blog about this experiment publicly , it was something I chose to do for personal reasons .
So try not to be upset that I wo n’t be continuing as your friendly neighborhood polyphasic guinea pig .
As I stated at the outset , my main reason for trying this was curiosity .
I wanted to know what it was like .
Now I do . 🙂
Hopefully I ’ve shared enough detail throughout this experiment that anyone else who wants to try it will find the archives very helpful .
Even so , this was an individual experiment , and as such its applicability to other people may be limited .
I ’m not particularly close to the average in many areas ( vegan , left - handed , colorblind , ENTJ , guy who thought Bush was an idiot before he was elected , etc ) .
Polyphasic sleep was one of the weirdest things I ’ve ever done but also one of the best growth experiences of my life .
I ’m really glad I did it .
I ’m sure there will be more wacky experiments yet to come … all in the name of personal growth .
It ’s going to be hard to find something as exciting as this though .
I ’m open to suggestions ( unless you happen to be pissed off that I ’m no longer polyphasic , in which case you should seek counseling or perhaps eat some carrots ) .
So would this be a good time to tell you that the whole polphasic sleep thing was just a big joke ?
April Fools and all that ?
Remember that if you ’re polyphasic , it ’s still the same “ day ” as April 1st , right ?
Do n’t worry — I would n’t do that to you .
While I do appreciate a good joke now and then , this is n’t a joke , although many people seemed to have a hard time believing it at first .
Edit 4/14/06 : For your convenience , here are links to all of my polyphasic sleep log entries in order ( each link will open in a new window ) .
This is a treasure trove of free information for anyone interested in learning about my trial of polyphasic sleep .
To my knowledge these are the most detailed polyphasic sleep logs you ’ll be able to find anywhere on the web .
Sleep well !
It 's all fun and games , till somebody loses a lawsuit .
That 's what has happened to the creators of a piece of gaming software called BnetD , and their defeat suggests hard times ahead for well - meaning technology innovators who go too far .

Countdown covered Brian Williams interview with Bush last night .
Download - WMV Download - QT
For someone who does not like how the public perceives him , Bush does not help his case any in this interview .
Take this little exchange :
WILLIAMS : When you take a tour of the world , a lot of Americans e-mail me with their fears that , some days they just wake up and it just feels like the end of the world is near .
And you go from North Korea to Iran , to Iraq , to Afghanistan , and you look at how things have changed , how Americans are viewed overseas , if that is important to you .
Do you have any moments of doubt that we fought a wrong war ?
Or that there 's something wrong with the perception of America overseas ?
BUSH : Well those are two different questions , did we fight the wrong war , and absolutely -- I have no doubt -- the war came to our shores , remember that .
We had a foreign policy that basically said , let 's hope calm works .
And we were attacked .
Last week Bush said that he never implied any connection between Iraq and 9/11 , yet both Iraq and the War on Terror have again been lumped together and Bush says that the war " came to our shores " .
Sure the war with terrorism did , but the war with Iraq did not come to our shores .
Is it any wonder why people say the White House has tried to link Saddam and 9/11 ?
Throughout the interview , Bush tries to keep up his " good ole ' boy " appearance , which comes off more as the incompetence appearance .
The best part comes at the end :
WILLIAMS : How have you been read wrong ?
BUSH : I do n’t know .
I frankly do n't pay that much attention .
I do n’t want to hurt people ’s feelings , but …
WILLIAMS : Still not watching television , huh ?
BUSH : I watched a good baseball game .
If Bush would have decided to watch television last August and turn it to any of the news channels out there ( including FOX ) , then perhaps aide would have gotten to the Gulf Coast quicker .
Remember the report that White House aides had to make a DVD of the coverage and were arguing over who had to give it to Bush and ultimately break the news to him that America had just lost an entire city ?
I would still love to see that DVD and how hacked the coverage of Katrina actually was .

OTTAWA , March 3 Â
The prospect of a shutdown of BlackBerry wireless e-mail service in the United States evaporated today as the two companies in the patent dispute reached a $ 612.5 million settlement .
While more costly than an attempt last March to settle the case for $ 450 million , today 's deal gives Research in Motion , the BlackBerry 's Canadian maker , an unconditional right to use patents held by NTP Inc. , a closely held intellectual property holding company in McLean , Va .
BlackBerry customers had faced the prospect of installing new software that Research in Motion promised would avoid NTP 's patent claims .
But that process was likely to be costly , and it faced legal uncertainties .
" There 's been a collective sigh of relief , " said Ellen Dailey , an analyst with Forrester Research .
" R.I.M . knew that by not settling , they were going to put tremendous pressure on their customers . "
Summary : Research spanning 20 years proves PDFs are problematic for online reading .
Yet they ’re still prevalent and users continue to get lost in them .
They ’re unpleasant to read and navigate and remain unfit for digital - content display .
Jakob Nielsen first wrote about how PDF files should never be read online in 1996 — only three years after PDFs were invented .
Over 20 years later , our research continues to prove that PDFs are just as problematic for users .
Despite the evidence , they ’re still used far too often to present content online .
PDFs are typically large masses of text and images .
The format is intended and optimized for print .
It ’s inherently inaccessible , unpleasant to read , and cumbersome to navigate online .
Neither time nor changes in user behavior have softened our evidence - based stance on this subject .
Even 20 years later , PDFs are still unfit for human consumption in the digital space .
Do not use PDFs to present digital content that could and should otherwise be a web page .
PDF Usability Issues
The usability problems that PDF files cause on websites or intranets are plentiful :
1. Linear and limiting .
PDF files are typically converted from documents that were planned for print or created in print - focused software platforms .
When creating PDFs in these tools , it ’s unlikely that authors will follow proper guidelines for web writing or accessibility .
If they knew these , they ’d probably just create a web page in the first - place , not a PDF .
As a result , users get stuck with a long , noninclusive mass of text and images that takes up many screens , is unusable for finding a quick answer , and boring to read .
There ’s more work involved in creating a well - written , accessible PDF than simply exporting it straight from a word processing or presentation platform .
Factors such as the use of color , contrast , document structure , tags , and much more must be intentionally addressed .
2. Jarring user experience .
PDFs look completely different from typical web pages .
They take users out of a familiar context and into one that is outdated and clunky .
Even if your PDF looks slick and you think users will be able to navigate with shortcuts like Control or Command +
F to find information , think again .
The most polished PDFs still look out of place in a web browser and not all users know keyboard shortcuts .
We ’ve repeatedly observed advanced users get stuck in PDFs and fail to find information this way .
3 . Slow to load .
While the risk of crashing a user ’s browser or computer by serving up a PDF is lower than in years past , PDFs can be excruciatingly slow to load both on desktop and mobile .
In one recent study , a cafeteria menu housed in a PDF on an intranet took almost 3 minutes to download .
Before giving up on the task , the user said ,
“ And we ’re waiting … we ’re waiting …
At about this time I ’d say , I really do n’t care what ’s for lunch . ”
Additionally , if users are forced to download a hefty PDF using cellular data instead of WiFi , they wo n’t be happy if they incur extra charges , as a result .
4. Stuffed with fluff .
PDFs tend to lack real substance , compared to regular web pages .
When you ’re building out a web page , you can visibly see how long it ’s getting and how far users will have to scroll to consume the content .
Methods of structuring and formatting digital content such as chunking , using bullets , subheadlines , anchor links , and accordions help users efficiently skim and scan sections that may contain the answers they seek amid long - form copy .
However , in PDFs , those techniques are n’t always used and content creators tend to favor quantity of content over quality and formatting .
This leads to overwhelmingly long and inane PDFs .
5. Cause disorientation .
Because PDFs are n’t web pages , they do n’t show a standard navigation like a website would .
Users often struggle to stay oriented with where they are , and how to get back to where they were before .
If PDFs open in a new browser tab or window , and users do n’t notice , they ’ll wonder why the browser ’s back button does n’t work and how to get back .
Or , if the PDF opens in the same browser window or tab and the user does n’t notice , they close the window or tab assuming it did in fact open in a new one .
They ’ll then have to start their session all over again .
On mobile this problem is exacerbated , as it ’s much more cumbersome to close a browser window to get back to the previous screen you were on .
The best case scenario for opening a new tab or window is that the user notices and closes out of the window , or moves to the other tab to get back .
The best case scenario for keeping users in the same tab or window is that they notice the back button remains active , and use it to get back to the previous page .
Since we ca n’t rely on best case scenarios , it ’s best to not take users to a PDF within a browser at all .
If you must , do contextual research to understand if your users get stuck in PDFs or separate applications when new tabs or windows open .
6. Unnavigable content masses .
Most PDF files have no internal navigation ; their mini IA is completely hidden and people have no quick way of ( 1 ) understanding the type of content available in the PDF ; and ( 2 ) getting to the interesting bits without scrolling through everything that comes before them .
Many proponents of posting PDFs instead of creating web pages , think that a clickable table of contents will solve this issue , but it does n’t .
Users have to spend much time and effort scanning the table of contents for those keywords that match their task or information need .
Even if users find a promising word , it may be misleading .
We ’ve observed users jump to a section of a PDF , only to find it does n’t contain the information they needed or they miss the answer in all the fluff .
The users are then forced to scroll 75 - pages back to the table of contents to try again .
7 . Sized for paper , not screens .
PDF layouts are often optimized for a printed sheet of paper , which never aligns with the size and scale of the user 's browser window .
Regardless of whether they ’re viewing the PDF on desktop or mobile , users can say “ so long ” to smooth scrolling and hello to tiny , unreadable fonts .
Not to mention having to pinch , zoom , squint , and scroll around out of context to navigate a PDF on mobile .
Users also demonstrate trial - and - error behavior with PDFs in browser windows .
They try to click on items that look clickable , only to disappointedly find out they ’re not .
Users Strongly Dislike PDFs
Burying information in PDFs means that most people wo n’t read it .
Participants in several of our recent usability studies on corporate websites and intranets did not appreciate PDFs and skipped right over them .
They complained woefully whenever they encountered PDF files and many who opened PDFs quickly abandoned them .
Following are behaviors and quotes from business professionals testing the About Us areas of corporate websites .
One user looking for information on the Small Business Administration ’s website got stuck in a PDF .
While she was trying to figure out what exactly the administration did , she said ,
“ I expect it to talk more about what they can do for me .
If the print was bigger , that would be really helpful .
Now , I ’m stuck in a PDF . ”
Another user was looking for information about where Wells Fargo was headquartered and got stuck in a PDF .
He said , “ I expected to see it at the bottom of the contact us page ; it ’s not there . ”
The user proceeded to use site search to try to find the headquarters location .
After typing in headquarters , he was taken to the history section of the website .
He clicked on a link that said , Wells Fargo Today , and said ,
“ Maybe it ’s in Wells Fargo today .
All of a sudden that downloads a PDF , ew !
At this point , I would just Google it . ”
The following user quotes are from several employees testing different intranets :
“ I ca n’t stand that the PDFs open in a different window .
It should open in the same browser . ”
“ Every time you click , it opens a new window or PDF .
I am frustrated because nurses always click the Back button and we want to go back to the previous web page . ”
“ Information is outdated in those PDFs .
So you ’re getting stuff that is n’t current .
They just have n’t taken those links off . ”
“ I do n’t know if they [ a PDF with email - signature templates ] are updated .
I ca n’t confidently share it .
Sometimes there are multiple versions of PDFs . ”
“ All of the PDFs are horrible .
There are so many old forms and version control is so difficult .
We ’re starting to move them into a database but first have to audit them and track down people to ask them if they still need the form .
We ’re taking the top-used forms and tackling those first . ”
“ Again , it seems to be taking me to a lot of PDF documents ... I was hoping the info would just be at the top of the search results . ”
“ I was overwhelmed by the 41 - page PDF of policy procedures . ”
“ It ’s a SharePoint PDF .
I would much rather see all of this in a regular webpage format . ”
“ I do n’t know if it ’s common , but when I ’m looking for content , I find it hidden in a PDF .
I prefer to see that on a web page itself rather than going into PDFs .
It ’s the way I prefer the content rather than switching mediums . ”
“ I did n’t think it would be a PDF document .
Oh , oh , goodness . ”
“ We ’ve come across problems with PDF forms .
Others have to download the form in order to use it the way we want them to use it .
You have to download it to get the features to work , so we always have to specify at the top of our documents that our partners are using these and they might not have the latest PDF readers . ”
“ For our documentation , we use PDFs , but people need a searchable page or an article .
We ’ve been doing PDFs for 10 years and now we ’re wondering how we can make this information more usable and searchable on the site .
We get questions every day about documentation and 99 % of the time , we have the answer , but it ’s buried in a PDF and people do n’t want to have to look for it in there .
Or , if they search for something we have , it does n’t come up in search results because it ’s in a PDF . ”
We 've had similar reactions from users in many other studies , including tests of B2B and ecommerce websites where users complained about sites that presented product specs or customer success stories in PDF instead of on web pages .
Here 's a quote from a customer who shunned the parts of the site that were in PDF :
" It looks like I 'm going to have to go to PDF , which I 'm dreading . "
Use HTML Gateway Pages Instead of PDFs
Given PDFs poor usability for online reading , user - experience designers should either avoid using PDFs altogether in favor of presenting content on web pages , or , in cases where a printable PDF is needed , use an HTML gateway page .
Gateway pages are web pages that summarize the key points and critical information from a PDF , and then they offer users the option to download the full PDF without having to open it in a browser window , where it ’s unfit for consumption .
The PDF file size should be as small as possible to preserve quality , while allowing it to download quickly .
Site search and public - facing search engines should index and link to the gateway page , never the PDF directly .
Unfortunately , through our continued research and content work with clients , it ’s become clear that HTML gateway pages still are n’t used nearly enough to help users avoid or circumvent the issues caused by PDFs .
Findings From Earlier Studies in 2001 and 2010 Still Hold True
Jakob ’s Alertbox article from June 2001 , Avoid PDF for On - Screen Reading , provides an earlier analysis of PDFs based on the studies we did almost 20 years ago , as does our original 2003 assessment that PDF is unfit for human consumption .
Surprisingly , the difference between then and now is not much .

From now on smokers will have to use the street
It is being hailed as a step forward for health but critics say it will cost jobs and infringe human rights .
More than a fifth of smokers questioned in Scotland plan to flout the ban , which came into effect overnight , a poll by BBC Five Live suggests .
The impact will be watched closely in England , Wales and Northern Ireland , where bans have also been planned .
Last month MPs voted in favour of a total ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces in England , which is due to come into effect in the summer of 2007 .
Northern Ireland is introducing a ban in April next year , while no date has been set yet in Wales .
BBC Radio's Five Live programme discovered that about 21 % of smokers surveyed in Scotland planned to ignore the ban .

A total of 1,000 adults throughout the country were questioned by researchers earlier this month .
Of the non-smokers involved in the survey , 37 % said they would be more likely to visit pubs and restaurants once the smoking ban was in place .
Responding to the poll , First Minister Jack McConnell said : " We have to be realistic about this .
There are going to be people who will be inconvenienced by the ban .
" I think that while we will see some people resisting over the early days of the ban , the vast majority of Scots do n't smoke .
" The vast majority of Scots who do smoke want to give up . "
The ban will give a warm glow to those who enjoy telling others what to do
Neil Rafferty
Pro-smoking group Forest
Mr McConnell said this was Scotland 's " largest single step to improve its health for generations " and a day of pride for the nation .
Health Minister Andy Kerr also acknowledged the significance of Sunday 's action .
He said : " As a smoke - free nation Scotland can look forward to a healthier future .
" A future where Scots live longer , families stay together longer and our young people are fitter and better prepared to make the most of their ambitions . "
Dr Peter Terry , chairman of BMA Scotland , said the day would be remembered as " the time Scotland took a bold and politically courageous step " .
He added : " On behalf of doctors across Scotland , I thank the Scottish Parliament for introducing this legislation that will help save lives which , for too long , have been cut short by the deadly weed that is tobacco . "
SCOTLAND'S SMOKING BAN
Smoking in an enclosed public place - £ 50 fine Operators of premises face fines of £ 200 for allowing others to smoke or failing to display warnings Enforced by environmental health officers
No smoking signs will carry a named person to whom a complaint can be made Complaints can also be logged by calling 0845 130 7250 Ban covers most indoor places and workplaces , not homes Smoking allowed in shelters which comply with regulations
The smokers ' lobby group Forest , however , has condemned the Scottish Executive , accusing ministers of misleading the public over the health impact and economic costs of the ban .
The group 's Scottish spokesman , Neil Rafferty , said : " The ban will do nothing to improve the health of the nation , but it will give a warm glow to those who enjoy telling others what to do .
" The anti-smoking fanatics will use the ban to victimise and stigmatise smokers even further .
" They have used abusive and dishonest methods to make smokers feel bad about themselves , even comparing smokers to heroin addicts . "
Research conducted for Five Live by Scottish Opinion suggests 21 % of smokers plan to ignore the ban .
Those in their teenage years or early 20s were most likely to do so , the poll of 1,000 adults found .
Smokers who defy the ban face a fixed penalty of £ 50
The Scottish Licensed Trade Association , which had called for a partial ban , fears 140 pubs could close and 2,500 jobs may be lost .
Exemptions from the ban include designated rooms in some workplaces , including in adult care homes , hospices , offshore installations and submarines .
Smoking will also be allowed in police detention or interview rooms and in designated hotel bedrooms .
Almost 300 business across Scotland have lodged planning applications this year alone for shelters , canopies or beer gardens to make last - minute alterations in the run-up to the ban .
Individuals who flout the legislation face a fixed penalty of £ 50 .
The manager or person in control of any no-smoking premises can be fined a fixed penalty of £ 200 for either allowing others to smoke there , or failing to display warning notices .
Refusal or failure to pay the fine may result in prosecution and a fine of up to £ 2,500 .
Good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used .
~ William Shakespeare ( 1564 — 1616 ) , Othello , II . iii. ( 315 )
The best use of bad wine is to drive away poor relations .
~ French proverb
Wine and subjectivist economics go hand in glove .
What does this mean ?
Well , subjectivist economics " … is based on the theory that the value of goods is not inherent in the goods themselves but is in the minds of acting men ; that economic value is a matter of individual judgment which may vary from person to person and for the same person from time to time . "
In the case of wine , individual judgment can be impaired by intimidation ( i.e. , lack of knowledge ) and ill - conceived notions .
Certainly , you have heard statements such as " I do n’t drink white wines " or " red wines are just too dry for me . "
As wine enthusiasts , it is our objective to push you out of your comfort zone , encourage you to try something new , and explore the glorious world of wine .
Since about the 1980s , wine has been marketed to the masses like never before .
There are zillions of affordable — or just plain cheap — wines available , whether from California , Brazil , Australia , Italy , South Africa , Chile , New Zealand , or even France .
What ’s more , states such as Oregon , Washington , Michigan , and Ohio are emerging as places known for having some pretty decent wines .
In fact , a barrage of competition from foreign wine makers has caused the US wine market to mature , giving consumers more choices and better quality wine at lower prices .
This has allowed the middle class to partake in the experimental stages of wine enthusiasm by starting out with cheaper , mass - produced wines before moving on to a more all - embracing wine hobby .
California , as we all know , is a magnificent place that has emerged as one of the world ’s finest wine regions .
Just prior to the emergence of the mass - producing wine era , the Judgment of Paris ( or the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976 ) pulled the red carpet out from underneath France as the world ’s undisputed top wine producer .
This is when California wines were granted the highest scores — gasp ! — from top wine - tasting experts .
Government and Plonk
California wine , however , has had its dark days .
As a matter of fact , government policy was responsible for transforming consumer demand for wine and altering the US wine industry through its Prohibition swindle .
Napa valley had already established itself as having some of the world ’s finest wines , and indeed , Napa was making wines that were taking Paris by storm .
Then along with Pierce ’s Disease and Phylloxera came Prohibition , and the abandonment of some of California ’s finest vineyards .
Pre-Prohibition California included some 700 + wineries , while after the repeal less than 200 of these wineries were left .
Some wineries stayed in business during the government ’s purge by making legal wines — those used for religious ceremonies — or table grapes and grape juice .
These products were a far cry from the fine wines that formerly had been produced in California ’s vineyards .
In addition , during Prohibition , a head of household was legally allowed to produce 200 gallons of wine a year for personal use , and this served to increase demand for the poor quality grape used for home wine - making .
Thus it was inevitable that California saw the displacement of old vines producing quality grapes , as low - quality grapes came to replace them .
As Prohibition ended , and California was left with significantly altered vineyards , the wine purge had not only left California with inferior and / or abandoned vineyards , but also , the average American ’s taste in wine had considerably shifted .
Instead of demanding dry , superior wines produced by old , quality vines , wine consumers demanded sweet , high - alcohol wines — hence the cheap , jug wine and the era of fortified wines .
Thus the dark days of wine were with us until the age of baby boomers and economic prosperity brought with it a new generation of wine lovers who re-fueled the demand for non-fortified , fine wine .
Consequently , let ’s fast - forward to the modern world of wine and all its splendor .
Not all wine is noteworthy .
In fact , mass production and the use of low - quality grapes have brought forth a new class of wine known as " plonk . "
Plonk is a low - quality wine , usually made for the non-discriminating masses .
Stores everywhere are loaded with tasteless wines — both domestic and foreign — that offer no distinction in taste between grapes or brands .
In fact , whether these wines cost $ 5.99 or $ 18.99 , they barely differ from one another as regards quality .
Wines like Kendall - Jackson and Sutter Home have managed to achieve mass - market appeal through marketing genius .
Kendall - Jackson sells its Shiraz , Merlot , Cabernet Sauvignon , and Pinot Noir for $ 15 — $ 20 a bottle , and for the most part , it ’s no better than wine that sells for half the price .
But somehow , it ’s deemed by the masses to be " above the norm . "
Pure marketing !
Not that we shall criticize the mass marketing of wine , since it ’s actually wonderful to see the glorious grape replace the dreadful rice beer , Budweiser , as the household staple for adult beverage intake .
As to , say , Kendall - Jackson , there are far better wines out there for slightly more , or even less .
Windsor wines , at a few dollars more per bottle , are far superior , and actually have a distinctive taste as opposed to Kendall - Jackson ’s everyday plonk .
The Windsor Zinfandel , at less than $ 30 per bottle , is perhaps one of the finer Zins in its price range .
Or for a really fantastic bargain , there is France ’s Barton & Guestier .
Its Beaujolais , Merlot , and Cabernet wines can be had for $ 5.99 on sale , making it perhaps the best bang for the buck in the world of wine .
Even at its everyday price — a couple dollars more — it ’s a very decent wine at a ridiculous price .
The authors of this piece find the Barton & Guestier Beaujolais to be one of the best " everyday wine " values on the market .
Oftentimes , new brands offer up cutesy names , colorful bottles , and / or and robust labels to attract the younger , less sophisticated , beer - type crowd to its product .
Wine brand names such as Red Bicyclette , The Little Penguin , Urbane , Big House , Toad Hollow , Yellow Tail , Gnarley Head , Goats do Roam ( South Africa ) , Dog House ( California ) , Funky Llama ( Argentina ) , Monkey Bay ( New Zealand ) , and even Fat Bastard are meant to entice , entertain , and win over the normally non-wine consumer .
Again , most of it is merely homogenous plonk in terms of taste , however , in the long - term , such strategy is admirable for its attempt to persuade the consumer that wine is a promising alternative .
For that , we salute the Wal - Mart World of Wines .
Anything but Chardonnay
When going to the grocery store , it is inescapable to see shelves upon shelves full of Chardonnay .
Unfortunately , this is one of the most abused grapes in the world of wine .
There is so much poor product available , it is a shame .
In our opinion , a key issue is that many Chardonnays tend to be over - oaked — which is like taking a mallet to the palate .
Who really wants to drink overly - flabby plonk ?
Thankfully , lightly - oaked and , even better , unoaked Chardonnays are gaining in popularity .
However , when perusing the store shelves , we would like to direct you away from Chardonnay and try other white wines — we ’ll get to reds later .
May we start by saying " hooray for Viognier ! "
This terrific white wine is complex , layered , and opens up beautifully .
It is an aromatic wine best know for its apricot , peach , and spice flavors .
Serve this wine chilled and sip on it slowly .
As time passes , you will note that different flavors emerge as it approaches room temperature — an evolution of flavor may go from apricot to buttery almond .
It nicely accompanies spicy Asian foods .
Three of our favorites are produced by EXP , Ironstone Vineyards , and McCrea Cellars .
A white wine that is typically misunderstood is Gewürztraminer .
Unfortunately , it is often pigeonholed strictly as a dessert wine .
Nothing could be further from the truth !
The German word gewürz means “ spiced , ” and these wines are known for their crisp and spicy attributes .
Arguably , the world ’s finest Gewürztraminers come from the Alsace region of France — located in the northeast and on the German border .
A wonderful quality of this grape is that it produces a wine which is sweet and spicy yet " big " enough to stand up to a steak — as long as it is a high quality Gewürztraminer such as those produced by Domaine Zind Humbrecht .
However , an absolute favorite involves pairing Gewürztraminer and Indian food .
To be sure , this wine pairs well with spicy Chinese , Thai , Mexican , and Korean foods .
For a great everyday Alsatian Gewürztraminer , we recommend Trimbach .
Oh , and by the way , Gewürztraminer does make for an excellent dessert wine .
Just look for a late harvest Gewürztraminer and you wo n’t be disappointed .
In the 1970s , Chenin Blanc was one of the most popular white wines in America .
Sadly , it was over - produced , and forgettable wines became the order of the day — sounds a bit like today ’s Chardonnay story .
Hence , what comes to mind are generally bland and uninspiring wines .
Fortunately , with careful viticultural practices , this grape can produce terrific wines with a floral - honeyed character and a zesty acidity that is satisfying to the palate .
It pairs quite nicely with barbecued chicken .
A favorite of ours is Barton & Gustier ’s Vouvray .
This nice French Chenin Blanc is readily found in supermarkets — at , typically , less than $ 10 a bottle .
A bargain , to be sure .
Another suggestion would be to try Windsor Vineyards ’ multiple gold - medal winning 2005 Chenin Blanc — which may only be purchased directly from the vineyard .
Now , for something truly off the beaten track , have you ever heard of symphony wine ?
" The Symphony grape was developed in 1948 at the University of California , Davis by Dr. James Olmo from crossing the Muscat of Alexandria with Grenache Gris .
A delicate Muscat flavor and aroma characterize the wine .
Symphony wines show unusual resistance to oxidation and maintain their light color , flavor and bouquet for ten or more years in the bottle at cellar temperature . "
Three wineries that produce this obscure wine are Volcano Winery , Maple Creek Winery , and the aforementioned Ironstone Vineyards .
At $ 8 a bottle , Ironstone ’s " Obsession " symphony wine is a bargain .
However , Maple Creek Winery ’s 2005 Artevino Estate Symphony wine is well worth the $ 22 price tag — a wine described as : “ Fresh , crisp and delicious , with tropical floral notes of pineapple , mango and banana .
Off dry and perfect for hot days and spicy foods ! "
Get some before summer is over .
Admittedly , we were both members of the " ABC " ( Anything but Chardonnay ) club .
As wine enthusiasts , this really is n’t a logical position to adopt , even though the Chardonnay grape is the most abused grape in the world .
After all , there are so many talented winemakers in the world , there are bound to be fine Chardonnays available .
And , oh boy , did we find one .
Kistler Vineyards produces world - renowned Chardonnays .
The Kistler 1999 Chardonnay produced from grapes grown in the McCrea Vineyard located in Sonoma County , California is spectacular .
Kistler ages its Chardonnays in French oak barrels for periods of between 11 and 18 months .
What we found is that chardonnay and oak - barrel aging can be a match made in Heaven .
One of us decided to take a bottle of this wine with us for an evening of fine dining .
The waitress opened the bottle for the group , and we waited for the main course to be served before trying this Kistler Chardonnay .
The first sip was stunning !
This wine is voluptuous , elegant , and complex .
The balance of citrus flavors , minerality , and crisp acidity was unlike any other white wine anyone at the table had ever experienced .
Although many may find this difficult to believe , this white wine was " bigger " than almost any red wine .
This Kistler Chardonnay is so memorable , it can still be tasted to this very day .
The Big Red Ones
Now on to the medicinal wine — reds !
Let ’s face it , red wine is just plain good for you .
It fights off bad cholesterol , protects against colds , and brings good health and longevity to your ticker .
And it makes you happy to savor it .
There is so much to explore in the red realm , but first off , let ’s look at Zinfandel .
The creation of White Zinfandel is perhaps one of the greatest crimes against humanity .
The red grape that makes
White Zinfandel is disrespected , flogged , and betrayed in order to achieve its proletariat status in the world of wines .
Here ’s Scott Gunerman on White Zin :
Zinfandel is the ultimate Rodney Dangerfield ( No Respect ! ) grape because of its association with that awful tasting ( sorry ladies ) yet highly profitable wine known as White Zinfandel .
White Zin is a “ pink ” wine made from Zinfandel grapes left in contact with the grape ’s skin for just a short time .
Bob Trinchero from Sutter Home Winery started this fad in the early 1970 ’s and made this wine into a HUGE commercial success .
Many wineries make the lion ’s share of their profits from their White Zin sales .
The winning formula ?
Simple : cheap grapes + huge yields + broad California designation ( ever heard of a single vineyard White Zin ? ! ) = gigantic money .
Too bad you did n’t think of that first — you ’d have enough cash to fill an Olympic size swimming pool .
I ’m willing to bet that the majority of White Zinfandel consumers have no idea that Zinfandel is a red grape and capable of making monster wines that can knock your socks off .
Do n’t believe me ?
Go to a Zinfandel tasting , and see for yourself !
Nothing is more dreadful than a glass of White Zin — yet people rip it off the store shelves like it is penny candy .
It ’s the most popular wine in America — yikes !!
As the old joke goes : " If she drinks White Zinfandel she is easy , thinks she is classy and sophisticated , and actually has no clue .
If he drinks White Zinfandel , he is gay . "
All White Zinfandel should be taken out behind the barn to be shot .
Now onward .
The real stuff is not of the " white " variety .
Zinfandel is a red - skinned grape that produces intensely flavorful wines that are unique in flavor .
Zinfandel off of the " old vines " is akin to a reserve and tends to be richer and more flavorful due to the age and quality of the vines from which it came .
Windsor , yet again , makes a smashingly great Zin , as does Ironstone .
Neither brand is expensive , and Ironstone can be had for about $ 10 per bottle , or under $ 30 for the Old Vine variety .
Francis Coppola
Zin is also a tasty bargain at less than $ 13 per bottle .
These wines — Zin , that is — are typically of a far better quality than the mainstream Merlots and Cabs that are in the same price range .
So why wait to try them ?
In fact , many red wines are oftentimes pure plonk .
Unfortunately , the ultra- mainstream , mass - marketed brands such as Woodbridge , Rosemont , Jacob ’s Creek , Blackstone , Fetzer , Gallo , and even some of the Beringer wines , are virtually homogenous in taste and quality throughout the $ 6 - $ 20 price range .
So why pay $ 20 for mass - produced plonk when you can get Australian plonk for about $ 6 - $ 10 .
Or , if you ’re smart , you can buy a Barton & Guestier , French red — Merlot , Cabernet , Beaujolais — for the same price as the Aussie stuff .
Now make no mistake about it — forget anything encouraging you may have heard about Two - Buck Chuck , that awful stuff offered up by Trader Joe’s .
As Slate ’s wine man Mike Steinberger said , " It sucks . " u2018 Nuff said .
And Port wine — what about that ?
Port is a staple as a desert wine ; it originated in Portugal .
" Officially , " Port only comes from Portugal like Champagne comes only from the Champagne region of France ( all others are sparkling wine ) , and bourbon comes only from Kentucky .
Port is higher in alcohol , and , in its vintage form , can be aged for decades .
Once again , Windsor Vineyards makes a Rare California
Port that we think challenges many of the fine Portuguese Ports in regards to quality .
It ’s sweet — as is the nature of Port — and makes for great after - meal enjoyment .
With respect to red wines , cabernet sauvignon is the kingpin .
A misnomer regarding cabernet sauvignon pertains to the belief that it is an ancient variety of grape .
Genetic studies , performed at U.C. Davis , have determined that cabernet sauvignon is actually the hybrid offspring of sauvignon blanc and cabernet franc .
Nonetheless , this terrific varietal produces some of the world ’s finest red wines .
To continue with our mission , however , we want to guide you to try something a bit different .
Yet , before moving on , we would be remiss to not pass on two recommendations for excellent cabernet sauvignons that are excellent values in spite of appearing to be somewhat expensive — these are better than many cabernets that have triple - digit prices .
Hence , if you are willing to spend a bit more money , definitely try the Dutch Henry 2001 Napa Valley Estate Cabernet Sauvignon ( $ 58 ) and / or the Salvestrin 2003 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon ( $ 49 ) .
There is a wonderful winery in Yorkville , CA , ( Mendocino County ) that epitomizes being off the beaten track .
Yorkville Cellars produces some delicious wines using varietals typically thought of as blending grapes .
For example , Yorkville Cellars produces an intensely flavorful wine made of petit verdot .
As stated on their website : " It is unique and seldom seen .
There are only 895 bearing acres ( compared to 71,536 of Cabernet Sauvignon ) of it out of a total vineyard acreage of 440,296 in California . "
This deeply intense reddish - purple wine has raspberry and red-cherry flavors and can cellar for decades .
Such a big wine pairs well with Cajun - blackened steak and zesty barbecued pork ribs .
Another grape , considered to be mostly a blending grape , is cabernet franc .
Well , Yorkville Cellars comes to the rescue again .
Their 2003 vintage is 79 % cabernet franc and 21 % cabernet sauvignon .
In their own words : " Rich and full - bodied with lots of Bing cherry and blueberry fruit .
Hints of licorice , toasted spice and herbs on the nose with a touch of burnt sugar or maple syrup .
Good structure with moderate tannins , light herbal note mid-palate and a hint of violets to finish .
Try serving with pork chops , lamb kabobs or sausage with peppers . "
For $ 18 , this wine is a bargain .
A great price for the " other cabernet . "
Have you ever tried a Bordeaux - style wine ?
Yorkville Cellars produces one using all five classic red varietals : Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot , Cabernet Franc , Malbec and Petit Verdot .
It has a magnificent name " Richard the Lion - Heart . "
Here again , in Yorkville Cellars ’ words : " Our Richard is always deceptively soft , yet complex and features a long , smooth finish .
Wine critics typically compare it favorably to wines at twice the price and even more , so it represents great Mendocino u2018 bang for the buck . ’"
At $ 30 a bottle ( for the 2001 ) , this may be one of the finest values on the market .
For one winery to produce such unusual and wonderful wines makes it simple for you to experience lesser - known red wines — all at reasonable prices .
And , by the way , all of Yorkville Cellars ’ wines are crafted using certified organic estate grown grapes .
Talk about being off the beaten track .
This winery truly goes the extra mile .
Within the economic way of thinking , wine is something that can cater to both high and low time preferences .
The June 30 , 2006 issue of Wine Spectator notes , " The top wines are built for aging .
But their opulence should please consumers with less patience .
They are wines for a generation that enjoys instant gratification as well as long - term pleasure . "
There are some things that are just meant to be enjoyed in the here - and - now , and the heck with later .
Luckily , wines are now drinkable while young , especially those in the modest price ranges .
Hence , no need to wait around before raising a glass .
Of course , the mass production of wine has triggered shelves full of appalling plonk with Budweiser appeal .
Then again , mass production and mainstream popularity has also brought forth an amazing array of wines — bringing to the market a new sense of variety , affordability , and creativity that only entrepreneurship , competition , and inspired marketing can provide .
From Boone ’s Farm to Beringer to Kistler , fortunately , there ’s a little something for all of us .

Iranians have responded angrily to US pressure
The report said traces of bomb - grade uranium in Iran 's nuclear facilities came from contaminated Pakistani equipment , not Iranian activities .
But the US said there were other ways Iran could be building nuclear weapons .
Iran has always maintained the traces of enriched uranium found two years ago came from contaminated equipment .
The BBC's Pam O'Toole in Tehran says Iran will see the report 's findings as a vindication of its position .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful and that US pressure over its nuclear programme is part of a wider effort to change the regime in Tehran .
However , a US state department spokesman said the report did nothing to reduce their concern at Iran 's nuclear programme .
He listed a series of what he called " unresolved concerns " , which included Iran 's alleged dealings with clandestine nuclear procurement networks and the Bush administration 's strong belief that Iran was developing and pursuing a nuclear weapon .
Talks scrapped
The independent report , published on Tuesday by the International Atomic Energy Agency , concluded that traces of uranium found in Iran two years ago came from contaminated equipment imported from Pakistan .
The discovery of the uranium had angered the Bush administration , which accused Iran of developing nuclear weapons in secret .
But the report backed Iran 's long - standing claim that the uranium traces came from equipment bought several years ago from Pakistan .
France , Britain and Germany have called off talks with Iran that had been scheduled for 31 August after Tehran resumed uranium conversion .
The French foreign ministry said Iran 's decision was in breach of a 2004 agreement to suspend nuclear activity .
If the stand - off continues , the US and the EU might bring the case before the UN Security Council to seek sanctions .
Offer rebuffed
Earlier this month , the EU offered a wide - ranging deal to Iran , including economic , political and technological incentives , in return for the complete suspension of research related to nuclear fuel production .
Iran 's chief negotiator says the EU offer was not good enough
French foreign ministry spokesman Jean - Baptiste Mattei said the decision to call off the meeting did not mean " that there will not be any contacts with the Iranians " .
But senior Iranian negotiator Hossein Moussavian criticised the move , saying the EU that had failed to recognise Iran 's right to peaceful atomic research .
" In Geneva we told the three European ministers clearly that if Europe 's proposal did not contain Iran 's right to uranium enrichment , it would be rejected and Isfahan ( plant ) would be restarted , " Iran 's Mehr news agency quoted him as saying .
The US voiced its support for the European countries ' decision to cancel the talks .

先日 のRails勉強会でetoさんにPathnameというパスやファイル名のすごい便利なライブラリを教えて貰った。で、早速使ってみたところめっちゃ便利でいま書いてるアプリケーションじゃほとんどのファイル名の操作に使ってるという。
使い方はめっちゃ簡単でパスやファイル名を引数としてオブジェクトを作るだけ。
require ' pathname ' file = ' / tmp / foo ' path = Pathname.new file
で、これの何が便利っていうとリファレンスマニュアルのメソッドを眺めて貰うと解るんだけど、ファイル関係の操作が何でもできてしまう。通常だとFileオブジェクトを作るには実体が無いとダメなんだけど無くてももちろん作れるため
str = IO.read ( file ) if FileTest.file ?( file )
が
str = path . read if path . file ?
と書ける。シンプルだしOOっぽい！
とかも思った通りに動く。もちろんPathnameと云うだけあってpath操作も充実。
path + ' bar ' => /tmp/ foo/bar path + '..' => /tmp path + '.././../tmp/./foo/bar' =>
" /tmp/./../tmp/./foo/bar " ( path + '.././../tmp/./foo/bar').cleanpath => " /tmp/foo/bar " path.join ' bar ' =>
/tmp/foo/bar
便利だー。いままでファイル名の文字列が '/'
で終わってるかどうか解らないときとか + '/ bar ' とかしてたんだ け どPathname使うようになってからはいちいち考えなくてすむし。
etoさん はPathname依存症らしくStringにメソッド追加して
class String def to_path Pathname.new self end end path = filename .
to_path
みたいにして使ってるみたい。たしかにString#to_pathが欲しくなるぐらいPathname便利だわぁ。

" WE DON'T NEED NO STINKIN ' CDs "
Dare Obesanjo of Microsoft had a particularly salient post on the recent Web 2.0 Conference .
He asks :
" I pointed out that all through the conference I had n't heard mention of the kind of Web apps that excite the younger generation .
I had n't heard MySpace mentioned once , and the only times instant messaging came up was in the context of Skype being sold to eBay for $ 4 billion .
The Web 2.0 conference seemed dedicated to applications mostly of interest to the twenty five and over crowd . "
He then summarizes a panel where five teens were questioned about their web - surfing habits and attitudes :
" Three out of five of the teenagers used MySpace .
One of them said he spends all his free times waiting for comments to his space .
Another teenager said she had stopped using MySpace when she went to college because it was too " high school " and now she used Facebook which was more college oriented .
One of the teenagers said he spent up to $ 50 a month on ring tones .
Four of them had iPods and all of them rarely [ if ever ] paid for music .
It seemed thy had all tried the iTunes Music Store at one time or the other but eventually succumbed to the lure of file sharing networks .
They all used AOL Instant Messenger and one other IM client .
Two used MSN Messenger mainly because they had friends outside the US ( Mexico & Brazil ) and MSN Messenger is very popular outside the US .
One or two used Yahoo !
Messenger .
None of them used Skype and in fact they sounded like they had never heard of it .
They did n't seem interested
They all used Google for search .
Two of them had used eBay but worried about being ripped off online .
When asked what kind of applications they 'd like to see on the Web .
They asked for " more free stuff " and " get rid of spyware " .
The most amusing part of the session was when Safa was trying to find out what eCommerce sites they 'd visit .
He first asked where they 'd buy a cellular phone and each kid said they'd go to the website of their current cellular service provider .
Then Safa tried another tack and asked where they 'd buy a CD player online and the first kid went " CD Player ? " with the same tone of voice and expression on his face I 'd have if asked where I could buy a record player online . "

" I am starting to get into rough times financially .
My
mortgage is going up an extra 900 a month leaving my
mortgage to $ 3400 a month .
My bills monthly with
everything food , gas , utilities , etc. total to almost
6800 a month .
credit card bills are 800 a month .
My
husband and my income total together is only 4500 a

We made bad decisions by refinancing alot in
the last two years and the closing cost , prepayment
penalty fees ate up alot of our equity .
I paid off our
cards and unfortunately have run them up again to get
cash to pay bills and stuff .
We will now just be
concentrating on paying our mortgage and some bills
and I have been trying to get an extra job with no
success .
So my credit card bills will be behind in a
couple of months and unless a miracle happens , it will
be delinquent .
I want to know what I should do .
If I
should just pay what I can monthly or claim
bankruptcy ?
Total CC bills is 30,000 .
Please advice . "
In my travels , the group that wants to know the most about marketing , and seems to know the most about marketing ( except , of course , for marketers ) is engineers .
Software engineers and programmers , to be specific .
Why ?
I think it ’s because online marketing is particularly interesting and often allied with programming techniques .
That and the fact that programmers toil long and hard and get bitter pretty quickly when some marketing dork screws up their efforts .
So , if there are ten things I ’d tell you , Professor Engineer Software person , it would be this :
George W. Bush gave one of the worst speeches of his life yesterday , especially given the level of national distress and the need for words of consolation and wisdom .
In what seems to be a ritual in this administration , the president appeared a day later than he was needed .
He then read an address of a quality more appropriate for an Arbor Day celebration : a long laundry list of pounds of ice , generators and blankets delivered to the stricken Gulf Coast .
He advised the public that anybody who wanted to help should send cash , grinned , and promised that everything would work out in the end .
We will , of course , endure , and the city of New Orleans must come back .
But looking at the pictures on television yesterday of a place abandoned to the forces of flood , fire and looting , it was hard not to wonder exactly how that is going to come to pass .
Right now , hundreds of thousands of American refugees need our national concern and care .
Thousands of people still need to be rescued from imminent peril .
Public health threats must be controlled in New Orleans and throughout southern Mississippi .
Drivers must be given confidence that gasoline will be available , and profiteering must be brought under control at a moment when television has been showing long lines at some pumps and spot prices approaching $ 4 a gallon have been reported .
Sacrifices may be necessary to make sure that all these things happen in an orderly , efficient way .
But this administration has never been one to counsel sacrifice .
And nothing about the president 's demeanor yesterday -- which seemed casual to the point of carelessness -- suggested that he understood the depth of the current crisis .
While our attention must now be on the Gulf Coast 's most immediate needs , the nation will soon ask why New Orleans 's levees remained so inadequate .
Publications from the local newspaper to National Geographic have fulminated about the bad state of flood protection in this beloved city , which is below sea level .
Why were developers permitted to destroy wetlands and barrier islands that could have held back the hurricane 's surge ?
Why was Congress , before it wandered off to vacation , engaged in slashing the budget for correcting some of the gaping holes in the area 's flood protection ?
U.S. SPOTS IRANIAN MISSILES U.S. SPOTS IRANIAN MISSILES
Trained eye can see right through box of weapons WASHINGTON 
In the closed world of spy satellite photo analysis , it 's called " crate - ology " : the science of identifying a weapon or some other key component by the size and shape of its box .
The technique came into play last month when a U.S. spy satellite , looking down on an Iranian air base , captured images of military crews loading what U.S. intelligence analysts concluded were eight C - 802 Noor anti-ship cruise missiles on board a transport plane , according to intelligence officials .
The episode was detailed by one U.S. intelligence official who saw a report on the incident .
It was confirmed by a U.S. official from a second intelligence agency and by a diplomat with a foreign government .
They did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the incident .
The ability of U.S. analysts to say with confidence what was in the boxes set off a chain of events that blocked the shipment to Syria , the U.S. intelligence officials said .
They said the weapons were to be forwarded to Hezbollah guerrillas fighting Israeli forces in Lebanon .
The C - 802 is " the size of a small truck , " says Robert Hewson , a missile expert with Jane 's , an authoritative military reference service .
Information about the crate , proximity to the place of manufacture and shipping route would enable an analyst to identify it with near certainty as a C - 802 , he says .
Hewson said there is an entire discipline in intelligence on the technique of identifying weapons based on their containers .
Dino Brugioni helped develop the technique during a career that spanned four decades in increasingly senior positions as a U.S. imagery intelligence analyst .
Brugioni , who in retirement has been a consultant to U.S. intelligence agencies , said analysts use large catalogs with detailed information on weapons crates .
The boxes are distinctive , he said .
An analyst can quickly tell the type of ammunition or artillery shells by the box used to ship them , he said .
Brugioni said other indicators — for example , a crew taking precautions by loading explosives on a plane far from any buildings — tell analysts that boxes are not empty .
After war broke out between Israel and Hezbollah on July 12 , U.S. intelligence analysts began looking for evidence that Iran would try to resupply missiles to the group , the U.S. officials said .
The effectiveness of earlier Hezbollah missile attacks , the belief that it had only a handful of the anti-ship missiles at the war 's start and Iran 's role as the group 's principal source of weapons fed this concern , they said .
On July 14 , Hezbollah fired at least three C - 802 missiles , one of which damaged an Israeli warship off Lebanon and killed four sailors , Israeli 's military said .
The use of the C - 802s in these attacks helped solidify claims by Israel and the Bush administration that Iran was arming Hezbollah .
Iran also trained Hezbollah fighters in the operation of the missile system and sent advisers to Lebanon to assist in the missiles ' use , according to John Bolton , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .
At a Senate hearing July 27 , Bolton said Iran provides Hezbollah an estimated $ 100 million per year in weapons and aid .
" They 're the paymasters , and they 're calling the tune , " he said .
Brugioni said that during crises , U.S. satellites regularly photograph air bases of countries involved , because shipping weapons by air is often the option of choice in a rapidly developing conflict .
Iran bought 60 of the missiles , sometimes mislabeled " Silkworms , " between the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and 1997 , when protests by the Clinton administration led China to suspend sales .
Since then , under license from China , Iran has been manufacturing the C - 802 missiles on its own , Hewson said .
… What would it look like ?

* It was very late and everyone had left the hall except an old man who sat in the shadows the leaves of the old Mallorn made against the moonlight .
The two elves inside the hall knew that the old man was a little drunk , and while he usually was quiet and kept to himself they knew that if he became too drunk he would start setting things on fire , so they kept watch on him .
“ He ’s drunk , ” one elf said .
“ What do you care ? ”
“ He ’s muttering about the secret fire . ”
“ Leave him alone .
He used to carry a ring . ”
“ He ’ll stay all night .
He should never have been rebodied . ”
The old man rapped on the table with his goblet .
The younger elf went over to him .
“ What do you want ? ”
The old man looked at him .
“ Another miruvor . ”
“ You ’ll be drunk , ” the elf said .
The old man looked at him .
The elf went away .
“ Look at his bushy eyebrows , ” he said to his colleague .
“ There is nothing as nasty as an old Man .
He ’ll stay all night and I ’ll never get any sleep . ”
The elf took the bottle of miruvor from the counter inside the hall and marched to the old man ’s table .
He poured the goblet full .
“ You should never have been rebodied , ” he said to the old man . *

FOREWORD :
In this book a number of dialects are used , to wit : the Quenya Elvish dialect ; the extremest form of the Rhovanion dialect ; the ordinary Sindarin dialect ; and four modified varieties of this last .
The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion , or by guesswork ; but painstakingly , and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech .
I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding .

CHAPTER 1
You do n’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Red Book of Westmarch ; but that ai n’t no matter .
That book was made by Mr. Frodo Baggins and his Uncle Bilbo , and they told the truth , mainly .
There was things which they stretched , but mostly they told the truth .
That is nothing .
I never seen anybody but lied one time or another , without it was the Lady Galadriel , or Elrond , or maybe Gandalf .
The Lady Galadriel – the Lady of Lothlorien , she is – and Elrond , and the wizard Gandalf is all told about in that book , which is mostly a true book , with some stretchers , as I said before . *
Heh , anybody have any others ?

There ’s a debate going on now among U.S. computer science researchers and educators , about whether the U.S. as a nation is serious about maintaining its lead in computer science .
We have been the envy of the world , drawing most of the worlds ’ best and brightest in the field to our country , and laying the foundations of a huge industry that has fostered wealth and national power .
But there is a growing sense within the field that all of this may be changing .
This sense of malaise is a common topic around faculty water coolers across the country , and in speeches by industry figures like Bill Gates and Vint Cerf .
Whatever the cause – and more on that below – there two main symptoms .
First is a sharp decrease in funding for computer science research , especially in strategic areas such as cybersecurity .
For example , DARPA , the Defense Department research agency that funded the early Internet and other breakthroughs , has cut its support for university computer science research by more than 40 % in the last three years , and has redirected the remaining funding toward short - term advanced development efforts .
Corporate research is not picking up the slack .
The second symptom , which in my view is more worrisome , is the sharp decrease in the number of students majoring in computer science .
One reputable survey found a 60 % drop in the last four years .
One would have expected a drop after the dotcom crash – computer science enrollments have historically tracked industry business cycles – but this is a big drop !
( At Princeton , we ’ve been working hard to make our program more compelling , so we have seen a much smaller decrease . )
All this despite fundamentals that seem sound .
Our research ideas seem as strong as ever ( though research is inherently a hit - and - miss affair ) , and the job market for our graduates is still very strong , though not as overheated as a few years ago .
Our curricula are n’t perfect but are better than ever .
So what ’s the problem ?
The consensus seems to be that computer science has gotten a bad rap as a haven for antisocial , twinkie - fed nerds who spend their nights alone in cubicles wordlessly writing code , and their days snoring and drooling on office couches .
Who would want to be one of them ?
Those of us in the field know that this stereotype is silly ; that computer scientists do many things beyond coding ; that we work in groups and like to have fun ; and that nowadays computer science plays a role in almost every field of human endeavor .
Proposed remedies abound , most of them attempts to show people who computer scientists really are and what we really do .
Stereotypes take a long time to overcome , but there ’s no better time than the present to get started .
UPDATE ( July 28 ) : My colleagues Sanjeev Arora and Bernard Chazelle have a thoughtful essay on this issue in the August issue of Communications of the ACM .
When I was a kid , John Wayne war movies gave us the message that America was the good guy , the white hat that fought the villain .
Alas , today the U.S. and its last remaining non-coerced ally , Israel , are almost universally regarded as the bad guys over whom John Wayne would triumph .
Today , the U.S. and Israel are seen throughout the world as war - criminal states .
On Aug. 23 , the BBC reported that Amnesty International has brought war crimes charges against Israel for deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure as an " integral part " of Israel ’s strategy in its recent invasion of Lebanon .
Israel claims that its aggression was " self - defense " to dislodge Hezbollah from southern Lebanon .
Yet , Israel bombed residential communities all over Lebanon , even Christian communities in the north in which no Hezbollah could possibly have been present .
United Nations spokesman Jean Fabre reported that Israel ’s attack on civilian infrastructure annihilated Lebanon ’s development : " Fifteen years of work have been wiped out in a month . "
Israel maintains that this massive destruction was unintended " collateral damage . "
President Bush maintains that Israel has " a right to protect itself " by destroying Lebanon .
Bush blocked the attempt to stop Israel ’s aggression and is , thereby , equally responsible for the war crimes .
Indeed , a number of reports claim that Bush instigated the Israeli aggression against Lebanon .
Bush has other war crime problems .
Benjamin Ferencz , a chief prosecutor of Nazi war crimes at Nuremberg , recently said that President Bush should be tried as a war criminal side - by - side with Saddam Hussein for starting aggressive wars , Hussein for his 1990 invasion of Kuwait and Bush for his 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Under the Nuremberg standard , Bush is definitely a war criminal .
The U.S. Supreme Court also exposed Bush to war crimes charges under both the U.S. War Crimes Act of 1996 and the Geneva Conventions when the Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld against the Bush administration ’s military tribunals and inhumane treatment of detainees .
President Bush and his attorney general agree that under existing laws and treaties Bush is a war criminal together with many members of his government .
To make his war crimes legal after the fact , Bush has instructed the Justice ( sic ) Department to draft changes to the War Crimes Act and to U.S. treaty obligations under the Geneva Conventions .
One of Bush ’s changes would deny protection of the Geneva Conventions to anyone in any American court .
Bush ’s other change would protect from prosecution any U.S. government official or military personnel guilty of violating Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions .
Article 3 prohibits " at any time and in any place whatsoever outrages upon personal dignity , in particular , humiliating and degrading treatment . "
As civil libertarian Nat Hentoff observes , this change would also undo Sen. John McCain ’s amendment against torture .
Eugene Fidell , president of the National Institute of Military Justice , says that Bush ’s changes " immunize past crimes . "
Under the U.S. Constitution and U.S. legal tradition , retroactive law is impermissible .
What do Americans think of their president ’s attempts to immunize himself , his government , CIA operatives , military personnel , and civilian contractors from war crimes ?
Apparently , the self - righteous , morally superior American " Christian " public could care less .
The Republican - controlled House and Senate , which long ago traded integrity for power , are working to pass Bush ’s changes prior to the midterm elections in the event the Republicans fail to steal three elections in a row and Democrats win control of the House or Senate .
Meanwhile , the illegal war in Iraq , based entirely on Bush administration lies , grinds on , murdering and maiming ever more people .
According to the latest administration estimate , the pointless killing will go on for another 10 - 15 years .
Trouble is , there are no U.S. troops to carry on the war .
The lack of cannon fodder forces the Bush administration to resort to ever more desperate measures .
The latest is the involuntary recall of thousands of Marines from the inactive reserves to active duty .
Many attentive people regard this desperate measure as a sign that the military draft will be reinstated .
According to President Bush , the U.S. will lose the " war on terror " unless the U.S. succeeds in defeating " the Iraqi terrorists " by establishing " democracy in Iraq . "
Of course , insurgents resisting occupation are not terrorists , and there were no insurgents or terrorists in Iraq until Bush invaded .
Bush ’s unjustified invasion of Iraq and his support for Israeli aggression have done more to create terrorism in the Muslim world than Osama bin Laden could hope for .
The longer Bush occupies Iraq and the more he tries to extend U.S. / Israeli hegemony in the Middle East , the more terrorism the world will suffer .
Bush and the neocon ideology that holds him captive are the greatest 21st - century threats to peace and stability .
The neoconized Bush regime invented the war on terror , lost it , and now is bringing terror home to the American people .
January 14 , 2006 — jao
Back in the old days i was a macho C++ programmer , one of those sneering at Java or any other language but C , willing to manage my memory and pointers and mystified by the complexity of the template syntax ( it was difficult and cumbersome , ergo it had to be good ) .
Everyone has a past .
Things began to change when i decided to add Guile extensibility to GNU MDK .
I was using the project as an excuse to learn everything one has to learn to write free software , from parsers with flex and bison , to documentation generators like texinfo and doxygen or localisation via gettext .
Next thing was scriptability , and those days Scheme was still the way to extend your GNU programs ( last time i checked , GNOME was full of XML , a windows - like registry and , oh my , C# … no Scheme ( or good taste ) to be seen ) .
So , when i first encountered Scheme i was high on static type checking , object oriented programming in its narrow C++ flavour , and all that jazz .
I did n’t understand immediately what was so cool about having an interpreter , and defining functions without the compiler checking their signature at every single call made me feel uneasy .
I was told that i still had strong type checking in Lisp , but that it is deferred to run time , instead of at the apparently safer compile phase .
I did n’t get it .
Thanks god , SICP was so fun that i kept on learning , and i kept wondering for a while what was so great about interpreters and dynamic typing .
Problem was , i was writing C programs in Scheme .
In a compiled language ( a la C ) and , to some degree , in any statically typed one , your code is dead .
You write pages and pages of inert code .
You compile it .
Still dead .
Only when you launch that binary does it come to life , only that it lives elsewhere , beyond your reach .
Admittedly , i’m exaggerating : you can reach it in a convoluted way via a debugger .
But still .
A debugger is an awkward beast , and it will only work with the whole lot : all your program compiled , linked and whatnot .
Enter a dynamic language .
Enter its REPL .
When you have a , say , Lisp interpreter at your disposal you do n’t write your code first and load it later ( that ’s what i was doing at first ) .
You enter your code piecewise , function by function , variable by variable at that innocent looking prompt .
You develop incrementally , and , at every single moment , your objects and functions are alive : you can access them , inspect them , modify them .
Your code becomes an organic creature , plastic .
Its almost not programming , but experimenting .
Maybe you ’re raising a skeptical eyebrow .
Maybe you have one of those modern visual - something debugger that lets you modify your compiled code on the fly and continue running your code using the new definitions and you think that ’s what i’m talking about …
Well , no , sorry , that ’s only part of what i’m talking about .
To begin with , you continue executing your program .
I can do whatever i want .
But that ’s not all .
We are talking about a dynamically typed language .
That means that me and my little REPL have much more leeway to modify the living code , and thus much more margin to grow up and evolve the code .
At the end of the day , dynamically typed languages give me freedom .
Programming is a creative process and greatly benefits from that freedom .
At first , abandoning the safety net provided by static typing was a little bit scary , but as i grew up as a programmer i felt more and more confident , and gradually the initially uneasy feeling morphed into joy .
The joy of REPL .
Richard P. Gabriel has made a far better job in beautifully conveying what i’m trying to express in his excellent introduction to David Lamkins ’ book Successful Lisp , entitled The Art of Lisp and Writing .
Unfortunately , i have n’t found it online — you can read the first few pages in amazon.com ’s “ look inside this book ” section for this book .
And also in his essay Do Programmers Need Seat Belts ?.
Paul Graham has famously argued in favour of bottom - up development in many of his essays , and specially in Programming Bottom - Up :
It ’s worth emphasizing that bottom - up design does n’t mean just writing the same program in a different order .
When you work bottom - up , you usually end up with a different program .
Instead of a single , monolithic program , you will get a larger language with more abstract operators , and a smaller program written in it .
Instead of a lintel , you ’ll get an arch .
Finally , please note that i’m well aware that the static vs. dynamic typing debate is still open , and that decent type systems like those in Haskell and ML have , arguably , much to offer in the way to solid software engineering .
Type theory has also a powerful and beautiful mathematical foundation .
The above is just my gut feeling and current position on these issues , and i do n’t pretend to have backed it with solid technical argumentation .
Nor was it my goal .
I ’m more interested here in programming as a creative activity than as engineering .

Press Release of Senator DeWine DEWINE , GRAHAM , HAGEL & SNOWE INTRODUCE THE TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE ACT OF 2006
Contact : Mike Dawson
Thursday , March 16 , 2006
Today , Senators Mike DeWine ( R - OH ) , Lindsey Graham ( R- SC ) , Chuck Hagel ( R-NE ) , and Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) introduced the Terrorist Surveillance
Act of 2006 , a measure that would provide a statutory framework , with congressional and judicial oversight for the President to conduct electronic surveillance on the international communications of suspected terrorists , while protecting the rights and liberties of American citizens .
" As the President has said , when terrorists call the United States , we want to know who they 're talking to .
This bill gives the President the limited authority to do just that , " said Senator DeWine , a member of both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" It does not , however , give the President a blank check .
The Terrorist Surveillance
Act authorizes a limited , but necessary , program .
It requires the President to go to court as soon as possible .
And , it establishes an unprecedented Subcommittee with the power to oversee this program and protect the rights and liberties of American citizens . "
" My goal is to ensure the spying program , which has been effective and vital to our national security , is able to continue by ensuring we have the appropriate checks and balances in place , " said Senator Graham .
" I believe our legislation strikes that balance and will allow us to continue monitoring the enemy while protecting the rights of American citizens . "
" As communications technology and the terrorist threat evolve , we must ensure the security of the nation by updating our laws .
This legislation creates a 21st century law to address 21st century threats , " said Senator Hagel , a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence .
" We can not lose our focus on national security .
But we must not forget the critical roll that the legislative and judicial branches play in the governance of this nation .
This bill ensures substantive Congressional oversight and reinforces the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court . "
" Today , I join with my colleagues -- Senators DeWine , Graham and Hagel -- in introducing legislation to bring the NSA 's surveillance program out of the shadows by reasserting the necessary constitutional checks and balances that both the legislative and judicial branches government have over the Executive .
Information is the bedrock of this legislation .
The more we learn about the NSA program , the better we are able to adopt measures necessary to protect our treasured constitutional rights without sacrificing our safety as a nation .
This legislation is the first of many steps , but one that is critical to safeguarding our security and freedom , " said Senator Snowe .
Under the Terrorist Surveillance Act , the President is given the limited authority to conduct surveillance of the international communications of terrorists for 45 days .
To engage in such surveillance , the President must have probable cause to believe that the target of surveillance is a member of or affiliated with a terrorist organization .
And , he must believe that the surveillance is necessary to protect the United States from a terrorist attack .
Under the bill , the President is permitted to reauthorize the Terrorist Surveillance Program every 45 days .
To ensure that the President does not overstep his limited authority , the Terrorist Surveillance
Act adds important safeguards to current law to protect the rights and liberties of ordinary Americans .
--
The bill mandates that the President obtain a warrant for surveillance on a suspected terrorist once he has sufficient evidence to do so .
--
For those unusual cases where the President does not have sufficient evidence to obtain a court order , but still wishes to conduct surveillance on a suspect , the bill requires that the Attorney General certify , under oath , that continued surveillance is necessary to protect the United States .
-- Finally , the bill establishes a Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittee within the Senate Intelligence Committee with the exclusive jurisdiction to oversee and monitor the details of the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
That Subcommittee is empowered to obtain any and all information about the surveillance of any individual in order to ensure that the President is not abusing the rights of law - abiding Americans .
[ BILL EXPLANATION ATTACHED--SEE BELOW ]
Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 DeWine , Graham , Hagel , Snowe
The Terrorist Surveillance
Act provides limited statutory authority to the President to conduct electronic surveillance of suspected terrorists in the United States , greatly enhances Congressional oversight of the Terrorist Surveillance Program , and requires that electronic surveillance be conducted under FISA when the President has sufficient evidence to do so .
** Authorizes the President to conduct an electronic surveillance program , without court order , for up to 45 days , provided that --
-- The President determines that the surveillance is necessary to protect the United States , its citizens , or its interests ; -- Protections are in place to ensure that the program is reasonably designed to acquire only international communications ; --
There is probable cause to believe that at least one party to a communication is a member of , affiliated with , or working in support of a terrorist organization .
The President must submit a list of designated terrorist organizations at least annually ; and -- Minimization procedures are in place to limit the acquisition , retention and use of non-public information about U.S. persons .
** Requires Program Review and Reauthorization Every 45 Days
-- Every 45 days , the Attorney General must review the program and certify in writing and under oath whether the program meets the requirements set forth by Congress ; --
The President may then reauthorize the program for another 45 day period , but only if he determines that the program remains necessary to protect the United States , its citizens , or its interests .
--
The Attorney General must provide notice of the decision to continue or terminate the program to the congressional intelligence committees within 72 hours .
** Requires Review of Surveillance of Individual Targets Every 45 Days
-- Every 45 days , the Attorney General must also review the surveillance of any individual targets under the program . --
If , at any time , the Attorney General determines that he has sufficient evidence to obtain a FISA warrant , he must seek a FISA warrant to continue surveillance on that target .
--
If the Attorney General determines that he does not have sufficient evidence to obtain a FISA warrant , but nonetheless wants to continue surveillance , then he must certify in writing and under oath to the Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittees the following four things : 1 ) that all previous surveillance complied with this Act ; 2 ) that there is insufficient evidence to obtain a warrant under FISA ; 3 ) that the President has determined that continued surveillance of the target without a court order is necessary to protect the United States , its citizens , or its interests ; and 4 ) that continued surveillance is being undertaken in a good faith belief that it will result in the acquisition of foreign intelligence information .
No target may be subject to surveillance beyond the 45 - day reauthorization period unless the Attorney General obtains a FISA warrant or files a certification , in writing and under oath , with the Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittees .
** Regular , Ongoing , and Vigorous Oversight of Terrorist Surveillance Program
-- The Act calls for the creation of Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittees within both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees . --
To ensure confidentiality of the Terrorist Surveillance Program , these Subcommittees , along with bipartisan congressional leadership , will have sole oversight responsibilities of this program .
--
The President must submit information on the management and operational details of the Terrorist Surveillance Program generally and any specific surveillance conducted by this program whenever requested by the Subcommittees .

This provision does not apply to journalists .
But over the past few years , that has changed .
It has been 30 years since an ice dance team from the United States has won an Olympic medal .
Colleen O'Connor and Jim Millns won a bronze medal in 1976 , the year the ice dancing made its debut at the Games .
But here , there is one couple , Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto , that can break that drought .
When they skate , they sizzle .
Maybe it is because Belbin did not become a United States citizen until Dec. 31 , just in time to be eligible for the Olympics .
Whatever the reason , she and Agosto have a good chance of winning a medal .
Last year , they won silver at the world championships , the highest finish by a United States dance team since 1975 .
In the compulsory dance Friday , they finished sixth but are only 1.42 points out of first place .
In the United States , ballroom dancing has taken off in recent years , particularly with the popularity of television shows like " Dancing With the Stars " and movies like " Mad Hot Ballroom , " a film that follows 11 - year - olds from three New York City public schools as they prepare for and compete in a citywide ballroom dancing contest .
On the film 's Web site , the motto is , " Anyone can make it if they learn how to shake it . "
" When we first started , it was kind of discouraging that only our family and friends came to watch , but now there is a crowd there , " Belbin said of ice dance events in the United States .
She added that people seemed to be flocking to her sport because they could relate to it .
" I think at home , everyone dances around in their underwear , " she said .
On Sunday , fans at the Palavela will see exactly which ice dancers have learned how to shake it , this time to Latin music .
James
Bond does not make an appearance until Part Two of what is perhaps his most polished adventure , From Russia with Love .
And when he has been briefed by M and outfitted by Q , and told what is expected of him , he suffers a mild mid-life crisis .
What , he asks as the plane takes him towards the Golden Horn , would his younger self think of the man now so " tarnished with years of treachery and ruthlessness and fear " , sent off " to pimp for England " ?
Eventually dismissing this as an idle or feeble mood , he reflects further :
" What - might - have - been was a waste of time .
Follow your fate and be satisfied with it , and be glad not to be a second - hand motor salesman , or a yellow - press journalist , pickled in gin and nicotine , or a cripple - or dead . "
Yes , well , that seems to put the profession nicely in its place , and indeed in its context .
I read those words when I was a schoolboy in Cambridge in the early 1960s and had already decided that only journalism would do .
Not long afterwards , I was strolling along Tenison Road and saw , I swear , a wheezing second - or even third - hand motor belching towards me .
Behind its wheel sat a man of impossibly fly - blown and lugubrious appearance ; his skin sallow and wrinkled , an unfiltered cigarette in his mouth ; his eyes like piss - holes in the snow .
Only one detail was required to complete the scene , and at first my disordered senses almost refused to register it .
Stuck in the corner of his windscreen was a faint and tattered card that read " PRESS " .
It was yellow all right .
It might as well have been stuck in the band of his hat .
Christ knows where he had been - perhaps to a bad day at the Newmarket races - but it took little imagination to see where he was bound .
And this was not a Giles cartoon but a glimpse of the future I thought I wanted .
I cheered up immensely .
Clichés and caricatures are there to be overcome , after all .
And I had my Orwell books to go back to .
Not much later , I came across Orwell 's essay " Confessions of a Book Reviewer " .
It opens thus , in case you may have forgotten :
" In a cold but stuffy bed - sitting room littered with cigarette ends and half - empty cups of tea , a man in a moth - eaten dressing - gown sits at a rickety table , trying to find room for his typewriter among the piles of dusty papers that surround it .
He cannot throw the papers away because the wastepaper basket is already overflowing , and besides , somewhere among the unanswered letters and unpaid bills it is possible that there is a cheque for two guineas which he is nearly certain he forgot to pay into the bank ...
He is a man of thirty - five , but looks fifty .
He is bald , has varicose veins and wears spectacles , or would wear them if his only pair were not chronically lost .
If things are normal with him he will be suffering from malnutrition , but if he has recently had a lucky streak he will be suffering from a hangover . "
Orwell of course could be discouragingly pessimistic at times .
But for light relief there was always Evelyn Waugh , who in his Decline and Fall had taught me that even original sin could have its lighter side .
What could be funnier than the school sports - day at Dr Fagan 's awful Molesworth - like establishment at Llanabba ?
The arrangements are being made :
" Admirable !
And then there is the Press .
We must ring up the Flint and Denbigh Herald and get them to send a photographer .
That means whisky .
Will you see to that , Philbrick ?
I remember at one of our sports I omitted to offer whisky to the Press , and the result was a most unfortunate photograph .
" Boys do get into such indelicate positions during the obstacle race , do n't they ? "
A picture appeared to be emerging here .
In the opening pages of Scoop , as William Boot is still in the train from Somerset to London and as yet has no idea what awaits him at the offices of the Daily Beast , he recalls that :
" He had once seen in Taunton a barely intelligible film about newspaper life in New York where neurotic men in shirt - sleeves and eye - shades had rushed from telephone to tape - machines , insulting and betraying one another in circumstances of unredeemed squalor . "
Could this squalor ever be redeemed ?
Perhaps not by one of my other favourite standbys , Graham Greene , who sent Hale of the Daily Messenger down to Brighton for the day , there to pass his time in hucksterism and fatuity , " drinking gins and tonics wherever his programme allowed " :
" For he had to stick closely to a programme : from ten till eleven Queen 's Road and Castle Square , from eleven till twelve the Aquarium and Palace Pier , twelve till one the front between the Old Ship and West Pier , back for lunch between one and two in any restaurant he chose round the Castle square , and after that he had to make his way all down the parade to the West pier and then to the station by the Hove streets .
These were the limits of his absurd and well - advertised sentry - go . "
( And so much of journalism is the " sentry go " : the stake - out , the hand - out , the lobby correspondents attending on their " source " who knows as well as they do when the deadline is coming .
Hale and the Daily Messenger are doomed to miss the only real story of the day , which is Hale murdered in broad daylight by having a stick of hard rock jammed down his throat : an apposite revenge upon the idle and the spoon - fed . )
Enough , perhaps , of the Catholic school of fiction .
I graduated to the cool and elegant universe of Anthony Powell , in whose world the influence of the newspapers is relatively minimal .
In fact , as it now seems to me , the absence of this influence is a limitation on his claim to have been describing English social reality .
Surely Sir Magnus Donners , that tycoon of 1930s tycoons , should have been the ambitious and manipulative proprietor of at least one Fleet Street title ?
When Powell gets round to it , though , as he does in the 10th of his 12 - novel cycle , he does not stint .
Here is the port - soaked " Books " Bagshaw , in Books Do Furnish a Room :
" He possessed that opportune facility for turning out several thousand words on any subject whatever at the shortest possible notice : politics : sport : books : finance : science : art : fashion - as he himself said , " War , Famine , Pestilence or Death on a Pale Horse " .
All were equal when it came to Bagshaw 's typewriter .
He would take on anything , and - to be fair - what he produced , even off the cuff , was no worse than what was to be read most of the time .
You never wondered how on earth the stuff had ever managed to be printed . "
Bagshaw 's gift for non-specialisation is further emphasised a little later on , when he hears a saloon - bar criticism of the Woman 's Page from an irate X Trapnel :
" Do n't breathe a word against the Woman 's Page , Trappy .
Many a time I 've proffered advice on it myself under a female pseudonym . "
And this only sent me back to Evelyn Waugh and The Loved One , in which the repulsive Jake Slump , wreathed in the fumes of a bar - fly and chain - smoker , is a veteran of the agony advice column " Aunt Lydia 's Post Bag " .
A few themes seem to be emerging from the way in which our novelists have treated our journalists : copious gin ( or whisky , or port , or what you will ) , mediocrity , cynicism , sloth , and meanness of spirit .
This is to say nothing of the greatest of all les déformations professionelles : shameless and indeed boastful fabrication .
And I entirely forgot to mention the fiddling of expenses .
All professions are deformed by this , of course , but only journalism has made a code out of it :
" Mr Salter saw he was not making his point clear .
" Take a single example , " he said .
" Supposing you want to have dinner .
Well , you go to a restaurant and do yourself proud , best of everything .
Bill perhaps may be two pounds .
Well , you put down five pounds for entertainment on your expenses .
You 've had a slap - up dinner , you 're three pounds to the good , and everyone is satisfied . "
( Evelyn Waugh : Scoop ) .
" Various members of the staff emerged from Hand and Ball Passage during the last dark hour of the morning , walked with an air of sober responsibility towards the main entrance , greeted the commissionaire and vanished upstairs in the lift to telephone their friends and draw their expenses before going out again to have lunch . "
( Michael Frayn : Towards the End of the Morning ) .
An absolutely brilliant dead - pan account of the expenses racket is also given in Philip Norman 's marvellous novel of the Sunday Times in the late 60s : Everyone 's Gone to the Moon .
This is the only rival to Frayn since Waugh .
Frayn's Towards the End of the Morning , first published in 1967 , used to have the status of a cult book among the hacks ( as we all agree to call ourselves ) .
It does have more or less everything : the white - haired and burned - out old soak who can only reminisce about forgotten , bibulous trips with forgotten , bibulous stars of old Fleet Street : the bullying , self - loathing pictures editor who insists on how self - made he is ; the dreamy assistant scribe who only wants to write book reviews for the New Statesman on the side ( that dates it a bit : in those days the NS had a literary editor and was literate ) ; the neurotic deputy editor who can't keep up the supply of pre-digested columns entitled " In Years Gone By " , or hold his rural clergymen contributors to their deadlines .
( In the latter respect , there is something of a lift from William Boot 's " Lush Places " countryman column in Scoop . )
There was always , also , an interest in guessing whether Frayn had " set " it all at either the Observer or the Guardian , which in those days were separate institutions .
( Malcolm Muggeridge 's journalism novel Picture Palace had been too transparent in this regard , enraging his employers , the then - Manchester Guardian management , who obtained an injunction preventing its publication . )
In the introduction to the new edition , Frayn says that it was a touch of both .
The paper is never given a name , but it 's in any case obviously not the Observer because it comes out every day .
A possible clue , for addicts and cognoscenti , is contained on the very cover of the new edition which drops an entire word out of the title of the novel , and rather metaphysically offers it as Towards the End of Morning .
The Guardian is no longer so celebrated for its misprints but there will always be those of us who are nostalgic for the days when it was , and when the opera critic Phillip Hope Wallace , for example , could wake up to find that he had reviewed last night 's Covent Garden performance of Doris Godunov .
Admirers of Frayn 's second novel are sneered at by those of us who are in the know , and who appreciate that it is his first novel about journalism that really demonstrates his genius .
In The Tin Men , published in 1965 , there are some boozers and louts and misfits , to be sure .
But the brilliance of the thing lay in its attempt to reduce the business of hackery to an exact formula .
At a demented research institute named for William Morris , eager eyes gaze at a computer that can handle UHL , or " Unit Headline Language " .
A survey is conducted , in which people are shown the random headlines :
ROW HOPE MOVE FLOP
LEAK DASH SHOCK
HATE BAN BID PROBE
A total of 86.4 % of those responding say that they understand the headlines , though of this total a depressing number cannot quite say why .
Thus the search must go on .
Would people like to read about air - crashes with children 's toys in the wreckage , or without children 's toys in the wreckage ?
In the case of a murder of a woman , should the victim be naked or partially clad ?
Frayn re-summons the tones of old Fleet Street into this laboratory of shame , when the questing researcher Goldwasser is brusquely accosted by his vile assistant Nobbs : " ' Do you prefer a female corpse to be naked , or to be clad in underclothes ? ' he repeated to Goldwasser .
' That 's what I call a good question , mate .
That 's what I call a good question . ' "
How shall we know the cultural mayhem wrought by thinking in headlines ?
Philip Roth 's Portnoy does it all the time , as he guiltily imagines how his foulness would be rendered on the front page .
When a Wasp girl will not administer him a blow - job for fear of suffocation , for example : JEW SMOTHERS DEB WITH COCK : Vassar Grad Georgetown Strangulation Victim ; Mocky Lawyer Held .
The habit breaks out fairly mildly in Scoop , where all the genius goes into the reporter 's cables that are now a thing of the past ( " LOVELY SPRING WEATHER BUBONIC PLAGUE RAGING " ) .
In Decline and Fall , a lazy journalist comes to interview the mad architect Dr Silenus at Margot Beste - Chetwynde 's country home , and " happily " visualises as he talks : " Peer 's Sister - in - Law Mansion Builder On Future of Architecture . "
In Brideshead Revisited , for that matter , debutantes shriek at the headline " Marquis 's Son Unused to Wine . "
In one movie version of Hecht and MacArthur 's The Front Page , Walther Matthau sees the condemned man 's distraught girlfriend launch herself from a window and barely breaks off to mutter : " Shady Lady Leaps for Love , " thus anticipating the New York Post 's " Headless Body in Topless Bar " by some two decades .
But in Frayn's Tin Men the examples are barely even satirical , or self - satirising .
" Child Told Dress Unsuitable By Teacher " ; " Paralysed Girl Determined to Dance Again " .
And since the demure days in which he was originally writing , further defences against satire have been erected at the lower end of the business .
( Just try adding " bonk " to the list of four - letter headline words listed earlier , and begin your computer simulation . )
Martin Amis's Yellow
Dog does its level best at parody ( as can be proven by the mild name of his fictional rag , the Morning Lark , which is far less grotesque than the Daily Beast or Daily Brute and could very easily be imagined on a newsstand right now ) .
And yellow is the light in the newsroom , and in the eyes of the hacks , and in so many of the bodily - fluids that they tirelessly seek to make their readers emit .
The new modern skill is that of wildly overdone photocaption - writing , where no groan - making multiple - entendre is off - limits , and again I was n't absolutely sure that part of the yellowing Clint Smoker 's effort , about royalty in a Chinese restaurant , could n't have been at least partly stolen :
" But sweet turned to sour when photographers had the sauce to storm their private room .
Wan tun a bit of privacy , the couple fled with the lads in hot pursuit - we 'll cashew ! "
( " That bit was good , " said a hard - bitten old Fleet - Streeter of my acquaintance , " but the bit about how we discuss the readers at editorial meetings was bloody uncanny . " )
In Kingsley Amis 's Girl , 20 , which is the second funniest of his novels and the only one I can call to mind that features journalism - though I suppose Jim Dixon in a low moment does briefly impersonate a newspaper reporter on the telephone - the description of the editor Harold Meers is so thoroughly and worryingly accurate that I have met people who are certain that they must know who the bastard was . ( " ' It 's the way he keeps thinking up new ways of being a shit that you can't help taking your hat off to him for , ' said Coates . "
Albert Coates , incidentally , exactly resembles Jake Slump in the tartarean depths of his smoker 's cough - " Coates drew at his cigarette and coughed terribly .
He seemed unaware of any link between these two actions " - while the hero of Girl , 20 joins Slump , Boot , and the awful Reg Mounce of Towards the End of the Morning , in the notorious newspaper - industry bind of the hack who has been fired without knowing it . )
The Amises are the only ones of the authors I have mentioned who did n't serve time on a national newspaper .
Fleming was a foreign editor for Kemsley when that family owned the Sunday Times , Waugh was a correspondent and Greene had been a subeditor as well .
Powell toiled at the Daily Telegraph , and Frayn we all know about .
They mostly did quite well out of it .
Orwell never had a steady job , but he haunted Fleet Street in search of work and knew the argot .
Yet they all unite in employing the figure of the journalist , or the setting of a newspaper , as the very pattern and mould of every type of squalor and venality .
The sole exception I can call to mind is PG Wodehouse , who started out as a penny - a - liner on the Globe and seems to have found journalism to be innocent fun .
Bertie Wooster never misses a chance to mention his article on " What The Well - Dressed Man Is Wearing " , which appeared in his Aunt Dahlia 's own magazine Milady 's Boudoir , and to which he deprecatingly refers as " my ' piece ' , as we journalists call it " .
Psmith , in Psmith Journalist , takes over a small magazine of domesticity in New York , named Cosy Moments , and transforms it briefly into a campaigning , reforming and crime - fighting organ .
His slogan when confronted by those who would intimidate him is : " Cosy Moments can not be muzzled . "
This motto has been inscribed on the wall above my keyboard for many years .
Probably nothing is as boring as the reminiscences of an old Fleet Street hand , but I shall have to say that I pity those now in the trade who wo n't remember the atmosphere of that little enclave between Ludgate Circus and the Strand , with its byways and courts and alleys .
Yes , the smell of printer 's ink , the thunder of the presses like the engine - room of the Titanic .
Yes , the lights blazing in the black - glass palace of the old Daily Express , and the vans swinging out on their way to catch the overnight trains with the first edition .
Yes , the fog around Blackfriars Station .
Yes , the exorbitant padding of the night - shift by printers with names like M Mouse .
Yes , the suicidal imbibing in the King and Keys , or the Punch , or El Vino .
Yes , the demented whims of the latest proprietor .
Yes , the overflowing ashtrays and the pounding of ancient upright typewriters .
Yes , the callousness and gallows humour .
( " Shumble , Whelper and Pigge knew Corker , " as Waugh describes a hacks ' reunion in Scoop .
" They had loitered of old on many a doorstep and forced an entry into many a stricken home . " )
And yes , it 's true that the most celebrated opening line of any Fleet Street war correspondent was that of the hack in the Congo who yelled : " Anyone here been raped and speaks English ? "
The palm goes to Frayn , in the end , because well before it happened he could see that closing time was coming , to those pubs and those hot - metal presses both .
Hackery and Grub Street had of course been lampooned before , from Pope to Gissing , but the real " age " of newspapers begins roughly with the Northcliffe press - " written by office - boys for office - boys " , as someone loftily said - and the era of mass literacy .
In other words , it opened with the 20th century and may have closed with it .
In Frayn's two novels in the sixth decade of that century , the lure of television is already beginning to exert its anti-magic .
The mindlessness of the opinion poll and the reader - survey is coming to replace news and analysis .
The reporters and editors are beginning to think about mortgages and pensions .
The editor is a cipher .
I do not think that there will again be a major novel , flattering or unflattering , in which a reporter is the protagonist .
Or if there is , he or she will be a blogger or some other species of cyber- artist , working from home and conjuring the big story from the vastness of electronic space .
In any case , the literature of old Fleet Street was to a very considerable extent written by journalists and for journalists .
Most reporters I know regard Scoop as a work of pitiless realism rather than antic fantasy .
The cap fitted , and they wore it , and with a lop - sided grin of pride , at that .
Perhaps this assists us in answering the age - old question : why does the profession of journalism have such a low reputation ?
The answer : because it has such a bad press .

CALIFORNIA is America 's most populous state and , if independent , would boast the world 's eighth - biggest economy .
It is also often seen as a trailblazer , both within America and beyond .
So on August 31st , when California 's lawmakers approved a measure to cut emissions of the gases that cause global warming , the decision reverberated far beyond the state 's borders .
America has long been a laggard in the fight against global warming .
Soon after becoming president in 2001 , George Bush renounced the Kyoto Protocol , a treaty backed by the United Nations that aims to reduce emissions of the offending greenhouse gases .
Seven north - eastern states are setting up a system to cap and then reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas , from power stations .
But before California 's move , no American state had a broad mandatory scheme , of the kind currently operating within the European Union .
Californians have plenty of reasons to fear global warming .
Already , snow is melting earlier in the year in its mountains , causing problems not only for skiers but also for the farmers who rely on steady supplies of melt - water to irrigate their crops .
Some scientists foresee more droughts and forest fires , and higher , stormier and more acidic seas along California 's long coastline .
The state 's voters are a green lot and their representatives have led the country in tightening restrictions on all manner of pollutants , including greenhouse gases .
In 2002 , for example , they passed a law that calls for a gradual reduction in carbon - dioxide emissions from vehicles .
The new law requires a similar phased reduction in emissions from big industrial polluters starting in 2012 .
Firms will have to cut their own emissions , or buy the rights to cuts made by other firms .
By 2020 emissions should be back to the level of 1990 — a less exacting target and timetable than that demanded by the Kyoto Protocol .
The politicians are leaving all the details , including who will do the cutting , how the trading mechanism will work and what the penalties for failure will be , up to the agency that enforces the state 's existing air - pollution standards .
Business lobbyists , who argue that the law will simply prompt gas - belching industries to relocate to more accommodating jurisdictions , and so cost the state jobs and tax revenue , will almost certainly challenge it in court — as they have the law on vehicles .
Even if the law succeeds in reducing emissions as planned , however , it will have little practical effect on global warming .
California , after all , only accounts for about 2 % of the world 's output of greenhouse gases .
The rest of America , and other big sources of emissions , such as China , will remain free to pollute as they please .
But the law 's supporters argue that other places will inevitably regulate greenhouse gases as global warming begins to bite and that Californian businesses will benefit from being in the vanguard of this trend .
California 's politicians certainly hope to benefit from being ahead of the crowd .
They rushed the law through ahead of November 's elections , doubtless in order to campaign on their green credentials .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , California 's governor , who is up for re-election this year , backed the measure despite objections from his fellow Republicans , presumably in the hopes of appealing to the state 's largely Democratic electorate .
Meanwhile , Mr Bush , another embattled Republican , continues to insist that he opposes mandatory emissions - reduction schemes .
But pundits are beginning to wonder whether the same logic that appealed to Mr Schwarzenegger might also convince him .
How better to distract attention from other thornier issues and steal some of the Democrats ' thunder than by unveiling a big environmental initiative ?

HIV is a major problem in the developing world
World Health Organisation figures reveal just one million people are receiving life saving treatment .
Senior WHO figures say that is double the number who were on drugs when the target was set in December 2003 .
But 40 million people are infected with HIV globally , with around six million in the developing world seriously ill .
The challenges in providing sustainable care in resource - poor settings are enormous
Lee Jong - Wook
When the WHO announced the " three by five " target in December 2003 - giving Aids drugs to three million people in the developing world by the end of 2005 - it knew that achieving it would be tough .
At the time just 400,000 people were receiving the drugs .
But with six months to go until the deadline expires , WHO officials are clearly disappointed that more progress has not been made .
They argue that in the past few months there has been a huge escalation in efforts to get medicines to those who need them .
Barriers to access
But obstacles remain .
There are not enough single pill versions of drugs , there are very few aids medicines for children and technical problems with supplies persist .
Many countries also lack a co-ordinated strategy to get drugs out and sufficient staff to monitor patients on the treatment .
There has also been a spiralling demand for anti-retorivirals - as more people receive these potentially life - saving drugs , more and more are coming forward for HIV testing .
With the G8 meeting in Gleneagles next week , the WHO is hoping that the $ 27bn pledged globally for HIV treatment for the period 2005 - 2007 will be converted into hard cash .
However , aid agencies have warned that only half the money needed to fund HIV treatment this year has been handed over .
And a WHO progress report says an additional $ 18bn above what has already been pledged will be required , to finance the drugs rollout over the next three years .
WHO Director - general Lee Jong - Wook said : " This is the first time that complex therapy for a chronic condition has been introduced at anything approaching this scale in the developing world .
" The challenges in providing sustainable care in resource - poor settings are enormous , as we expected them to be .
" But every day demonstrates that this type of care can and must be provided . "
UK position
The British government has already pledged to ensure there is universal access to treatment by 2010 .
That would mean delivering drugs to 6 million people - double the WHO target .
Gareth Thomas , a minister at the Department for International Development said the UK had played a leading role in rolling out treatments that had probably resulted in 500,000 deaths being averted this year alone .
" As the WHO acknowledge , substantial progress is being made in expanding access to treatment .
" However , we have introduced these treatments from a standing start in many countries that lack facilities and staff .
" We have been urging donors across the world to take a comprehensive response on Aids .
" One that invests in wider health systems , in order to get the medical staff and facilities that makes it possible to prevent and treat Aids .
" We need the drugs but we also need the staff to diagnose patients ; test people for drug resistance and undertake extensive prevention work . "
The X in XML stands for “ Extensible ” ; one big selling point is that you can invent your own XML languages to help you solve your own problems .
But I ’ve become convinced , over the last couple of years , that you should n’t .
Unless you really have to .
This piece explains why .
And , there ’s a companion piece entitled On XML Language Design , in case you do really have to .
Even though I ’ve spent time recently helping invent an XML language , please lay off the cries of hypocrisy .
I ’m not chiefly a language designer , and if I can lay claim to any special expertise , it ’s primarily as the user of a whole bunch of different XML languages .
Too many , in fact ; that ’s the point .
Neither Easy Nor Fun · Designing XML Languages is hard .
It ’s boring , political , time - consuming , unglamorous , irritating work .
It always takes longer than you think it will , and when you ’re finished , there ’s always this feeling that you could have done more or should have done less or got some detail essentially wrong .
Pass / Fail Ratio · At Robin Cover ’s invaluable XML Cover Pages , he ’s assembled a helpful list of known XML languages , which currently has about 600 members .
I ’m sure Robin would n’t claim the list is comprehensive , these are the just the ones that have crossed his radar .
Looking at the list , I have a question : How many of them matter ?
Have a look at the list ; what do you think ?
I think it ’s a lot less than 600 .
Let ’s rephrase that question :
How many achieved their designers ’ objectives ?
Same answer , I think .
The conclusion is obvious ; if you embark on designing a new XML language , there ’s a substantial probability that your effort will not be rewarded with success .
[ Sidebar :
Of course , to mitigate that risk , when you ’ve finished designing your language , you have to take your show on the road and sell that sucker .
You can no more hope to succeed without marketing than can any other technology .
Some of us like marketing and selling , so for us this is not a big downside .
But it will be for others . ]
So right there is a good reason not to embark on this kind of thing : it ’s really hard , really time - consuming , and there ’s an excellent chance that it wo n’t produce the results you were hoping for .
In this life it ’s generally a good idea to stay away from projects which are difficult , unpleasant , and have a high chance of failure .
And so far I ’ve just talked about the personal expenditure of time .
Software Pain ·
If you ’re going to design a new language , you ’re committing to a major investment in software development .
First , you ’ll need a validator .
Do n’t kid yourself that writing a schema will do the trick ; any nontrivial language will have a whole lot of constraints that you ca n’t check in a schema language , and any nontrivial language needs an automated validator if you ’re going to get software to interoperate .
Second , if you ’re designing a language that will be human - authored , you ’re going to have to arrange for there to be authoring software .
This either means writing an authoring package from scratch ( we ’re talking huge money and time and pain ) , or customizing one of the generalized XML - authoring tools , which is only moderately - less - huge time and money and pain .
Finally , there ’s the payload software ; you would n’t be designing a language if you did n’t want to do something with it , other than author and validate it .
Someone ’s going to have to write that software .
Software is expensive .
But there are other , more important reasons not to invent languages , starting with the network effect .
Restating Metcalfe · Bob Metcalfe , that is , who invented Ethernet and is a really smart guy and will probably be known to history mostly as the originator of Metcalfe ’s Law :
The value of a network is proportional approximately to the square of the number of nodes .
Here ’s a related law :
The value of a markup language is proportional approximately to the square of the number of different software implementations that can process it .
I could argue this from theory but would prefer to do so by example : HTML .
RSS .
PDF .
( And , I ’m betting on Atom and XMPP and ODF pretty soon ) .
Convinced yet ?
HTML can be used by robotic link followers as well as human - oriented rendering engines .
RSS / Atom feeds can be used by event trackers as well as desktop news aggregators .
Apple can build a PDF reader that ’s better than Adobe’s .
In case it is n’t already obvious , this is why I ’m such a hardcore partisan of ODF and so irritated by Microsoft ’s refusal to get behind this particular network effect .
Opportunity Cost · I ’ve already mentioned that developing an XML language is time - consuming ( I ’ve never seen it done in less than a year ) , and then you get to start writing the software that ’s going to do whatever it is you need done with that language .
But presumably you need that whatever - it - is done right now , or you would n’t be working on that problem .
Are you prepared to live with the multi-year cost of developing the language and then implementing the software around it ?
The Big Five · Suppose you ’ve got an application where a markup language would be handy , and you ’re wisely resisting the temptation to build your own .
What are you going to do , then ?
The smartest thing to do would be to find a way to use one of the perfectly good markup languages that have been designed and debugged and have validators and authoring software and parsers and generators and all that other good stuff .
Here ’s a radical idea : do n’t even think of making your own language until you ’re sure that you ca n’t do the job using one of the Big Five : XHTML , DocBook , ODF , UBL , and Atom .
XHTML + Microformats ·
If you ’re delivering information to humans over the Web , even if you do n’t think of it as “ Web Pages ” , it ’s almost certainly insane not to use XHTML .
Yes , XHTML is semantically weak and does n’t really grok hierarchy and has a bunch of other problems .
That ’s OK , because it has a general - purpose class attribute and ignores markup it does n’t know about and you can bastardize it eight ways from center without anything breaking .
The Kool Kids call this “ Microformats ” and in fact I accidentally invented one on ongoing last November ; look at that template and its class attributes .
And of course , if you use XHTML you can feed it to the browsers that are already there on a few hundred million desktops and humans can read it , and if they want to know how to do what it ’s doing , they can “ View Source ” — these are powerful arguments .
DocBook · Suppose you ’re building something that needs to go bigger and deeper and richer than XHTML is comfy with , and you want to repurpose it for print and electronic and voice , and you need chapters and sections and appendices and bibliographies and footnotes and so on .
DocBook is what you need .
It ’s got everything you could possibly begin to imagine already built - in , and there are lots of good tools out there to do useful things with it .
ODF · Suppose you ’re working with material that ’s going to have a lot of workflow around it , and be complex , visually if not structurally , and maybe some day will be printed out and have signatures at the bottom .
ODF is what you want .
Not the most Web - oriented approach , but on the other hand the authoring tools are more human - friendly than anything else on this list .
UBL ·
If you ’re working with invoices and purchase orders and that kind of stuff ( and who is n’t ? ) , do not even think of inventing anything .
A whole bunch of smart people have put hundreds of person - years into pulling together the basics , and they did a good job , and it ’s ready to go today .
Look no further .
Atom · Suppose you think of your data as a list of , well , anything : stock prices or workflow steps or cake ingredients or sports statistics .
Atom might be for you .
Suppose the things in the list ought to have human - readable labels and have to carry a timestamp and might be re-aggregated into other lists .
Atom is almost certainly what you need .
And for a data format that did n’t exist a year ago , there ’s a whole great big butt - load of software that understands it .
To the Managers Out There ·
The next time one of your technical superstars comes into the room and says “ We gotta design an XML vocabulary for X ” , make them prove they ca n’t do it with one of the Big Five .
And if they can prove it , sigh deeply and budget a couple of years ’ delay , and a few thousand more engineering hours .
OTTAWA , Oct. 7 - A court decision Friday renewed the possibility that service to BlackBerry wireless e-mail devices might be cut off for most users in the United States .
The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington rejected a request by Research in Motion , the Canadian company that makes the BlackBerry , to rehear its appeal of a patent infringement case brought by NTP Inc. , the patent holder .
A three - judge panel of the court ruled in August that Research in Motion had violated seven of NTP 's patents .
As part of that litigation , NTP , whose only assets are wireless e-mail related patents , had been granted an injunction banning the sale of BlackBerry devices in the United States and forcing Research in Motion to stop providing e-mail services to all American customers except government account holders .
While the court declined Research in Motion 's request for a complete rehearing by all 12 of its judges , it did order the panel of three judges to review some aspects of NTP 's patent claims .
先日登場し た11月23日付の WCAG 2.0 草案に、文字色と背景色のコントラストを評価するための新しい方法が組み込まれたので、色の組み合わせチェックにも試験的に採用してみた。このアルゴリズムは、ガンマ補正を踏まえたHDTVの輝度信号の算出式を応用しているらしいことは分かったものの、今ひとつ基準値などの根拠が判然としなかったのだが、どうやらこれはWCAG2.0のエディタの一人である、Gregg Vanderheidenらが考案したものらしい。
Gez Lemonの記事 Luminosity Contrast Ratio Algorithm によると 、Gregg らTrace R&D Centerのメンバーが、従来のWCAG草案でも参考として示していた
AERT の「色の差」によるコントラスト評価法に代わる方法としてこの
LCR を案出したということだ。AERTはYIQのYを「明るさ」（brightness）とよび、LCRはYP r P b の Yを 「 輝度」（luminosity）としているが、いずれも色の輝度成分を抽出しようというもので、本質的には同じ（「明度」というとまた話が違ってきて、特に日本語でいう「明度」はいろんな使われ方があってややこしい）。違いは、前者が「差」を取っているのに対し、後者は「比」を基準にしようというところにある。
コントラストの尺度として「差 」と「比」のどちらがいいのかは俄には決めがたいが、たとえば標識などの識別のための基準が「輝度比2.0以上」といわれるように、比率を用いた基準が多いように見受けられる。また、人間の感じる明るさは、輝度（明度？）の1/3乗に比例するという説や、明度（輝度？）の段階は対数で表すべきだという説も見かける。「差」による評価よりは、「比」の方が洗練されていることになるのか。
とはいうものの、実際にAERTとLCRによるチェック結果を比べてみると、LCRの方が優れているという実感はあまりない。両者で評価が分かれる組み合わせをいくつか挙げてみよう。
色の組み合わせ LCR 評価 AERT 明るさ AERT 色差 文字色#033 ; 背景色#999 5.15 117（×） 357（×） 文字色#f0f ; 背景色#303 5.747 84（× ） 408（×） 文字色#fff ; 背景色#f00 3.998（×） 179 510 文字色#090 ; 背景色#fff 3.717（×） 165 612 文字色#090 ; 背景色#000 5.649 90（×） 153（×）
※ LCRは比率が5 以上な らLevel 2、10 以上な らLevel 3の基準を満たすとされる （Level 1基準はない）
Gezの記事は、 《 AERT における「 色の差」も含めて比較すると、AERTでは中間色（#666～#999）と組み合わせて基準を満たす色がないのに対し、LCRでは使える色がある》ことを利点としてあげているが、その組み合わせは実際には読みやすいとは言い難いように思える。逆に、赤と白のような普通に使われる組合せは、AERTならOKだが、LCRでは基準を満たさないことになってしまう。
もちろん 、WCAG2.0はまだ草案段階であり、このアルゴリズムがそのまま採用されるとは限らないわけで、これから手直しされていくとは思われる。今後どんな展開を見せるか、要注目というところだ。
〔追記〕真っ暗なところでは僅かな光でも明るく感じ、明るいところではライトをつけても明るさの感じはあまり変わらないように、光の
“ 強さ ” に対する感覚は、「差」よりも「比」もしくは指数的な指標の方が適当。ただし、単純な比にすると分母が0（黒）になると無限になるし、背景が黒っぽければ文字色はごく僅かに明度を高めるだけでも大きな比率が得られてしまうので、LCRでは分母、分子にそれぞれ0.05を加えるという操作をしている。このオフセットの扱いや、
“ 強さ” ではな く “ 明るさ ” の場合はどうかといったあたりが、検討の余地ありか。
Bezos Expeditions invests in 37signals Jason 152 comments Latest by Movies
Today we have a very special announcement to make : Bezos Expeditions , a personal investment company of Jeff Bezos , has made a minority private equity investment in 37signals .
Here ’s some background on the decision .
Over the past two and a half years we ’ve accomplished a lot on our own .
We ’ve released 5 products ( Basecamp , Backpack , Campfire , Tadalist , and Writeboard ) which over 500,000 people have signed up for so far , wrote Getting Real which has sold nearly 20,000 copies in less than six months , changed the web development world by writing and open sourcing the Ruby on Rails framework , presented at conferences around the world , and more .
We ’re proud of what we ’ve been able to do without outside help .
But we think we can do even better with the right kind of help .
And we ’re picky .
Since we launched Basecamp we ’ve been contacted by nearly 30 different VC firms .
We ’ve never been interested in the typical traditional VC deal .
With a few exceptions , all the VCs could offer us was cash and connections .
We ’re fine on both of those fronts .
We do n’t need their money to run the business and our little black book is full .
We ’re looking for something else .
What we ’ve been looking for is the wisdom of a very special entrepreneur who ’s been through what we ’re going through .
Someone who sees things a little differently and makes us feel right at home .
Someone with a long term outlook , not a build - to - flip mentality .
We found a perfect match in Jeff .
Jeff is our kinda guy .
It will be great learning from Jeff as we build 37 signals into one the great companies of the next 20 years .
Daniel Burnham , the great visionary architect of Chicago , said , “ Make no little plans ; they have no magic to stir men ’s blood and probably will themselves not be realized . ”
We agree .
We hope this boost of ambition , and Jeff ’s personal vote of confidence , will help us achieve our big plans .
So here we go .
Grokster has vowed to return with a legal downloading service
Under the deal , Grokster is permanently banned from taking part in the spread of copyrighted music and movie files .
It agreed to stop activity that leads to copyright infringement , as well as paying $ 50 m ( £ 28.7 m ) in damages .
Grokster 's decision has been seen as a victory for the entertainment industry 's fight against online piracy .
Grokster 's website was changed on Monday and now says its existing peer - to - peer ( P2P ) service was illegal .
" The United States Supreme Court unanimously confirmed that using this service to trade copyrighted material is illegal , " a statement on its website said .
This settlement brings to a close an incredibly significant chapter in the story of digital music
Mitch Bainwol , Recording Industry Association of America
" Copying copyrighted motion picture and music files using unauthorised peer - to - peer services is illegal and is prosecuted by copyright owners , " it added .
Piracy charges
The decision comes four months after a US Supreme Court ruling that file - sharing services can be held liable for actions of their users .
In June , justices ruled that the entertainment industry could file piracy lawsuits against technology companies caught encouraging customers to steal music and films over the internet .
" This settlement brings to a close an incredibly significant chapter in the story of digital music , " Mitch Bainwol , head of the Recording Industry Association of America , said in a statement .
" This is a chapter that ends on a high note for the recording industry , the tech community and music fans and consumers everywhere . "
Brand survival
However the settlement , submitted at a Los Angeles court , will not mean an end to illegal file - sharing using Grokster software .
Grokster users will still be able to copy music , movies and software directly from each others ' hard drives , as the decentralised nature of most peer - to - peer software makes it impossible to control once it is released on the internet .
And the sharing of copyrighted material shows few signs of slowing down .
An average of 9.2 million users were logged on to peer - to - peer networks in October , up from 6.3 million a year ago , according to online analysts BigChampagne .
Its co-defendant in the long - running case - Streamcast Networks - has also vowed to continue fighting the lawsuit launched by major US record companies , film studios and music publishers .
The Grokster brand is expected to survive .
A statement on its site says it " hopes to have a safe and legal service available soon " .
Reports suggest the group is in the process of being sold to legal downloading site Mashboxx , and a legal fee- charging Grokster service could be available within 60 days .
Mashboxx , which signed a licensing deal with music giant Sony BMG in June , is partly headed by former Grokster president Wayne Rosso .
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Gasoline prices , reversing a two - month slide , are again approaching records and at least one expert thinks they could hit $ 3 a gallon soon in the United States .
" We 'll see it within a year , " T. Boone Pickens , head of the billion - dollar hedge fund BP Capital Management , said on CNN's " In The Money " over the weekend .
Pickens noted the discrepancy between $ 2 a gallon gas in the US and $ 5 a gallon gas in Europe .
" The energy situation is global , " he said .
" I know there are taxes involved in the pricing ... but eventually it 's going to have to move up . "
Gasoline prices mounted a renewed surge last month , with regular self serve rising 8 cents to average $ 2.21 a gallon , according to a survey released Sunday .
That 's just 7 cents below the all - time high set April 8 .
Pickens said a shortage of oil is the main reason behind the price increase and did n't see how the world could produce more than the current 84 to 85 million barrels a day that currently comes out of the ground .
" We 're coming up on a brick wall , " he said .
" The fourth quarter this year is going to maybe be the most interesting quarter I 've ever experienced in my 50 years in the oil industry . "
The fourth quarter typically sees the highest demand for oil as northern countries stock up on heating oil for the winter months .
Oil prices closed at a new record high Friday , with current quarter U.S. crude settling at $ 59.84 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
U.S. crude was trading above $ 60 a barrel Monday .
While $ 60 oil is a record in nominal terms , adjusted for inflation , oil would have traded at over $ 80 a barrel during the late 1970s .
Pickens said the economy is less dependent on oil today than it was in the 1970s and that it can apparently handle oil in the $ 50 range , but was unsure what effect $ 60 or $ 70 oil would have on future economic growth .
Where is all that oil money going ?

It was the site of America 's first black - owned daily paper and first black radio station .
It was here Martin Luther King was born .
It was here King preached freedom from the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church .
In the 1960s , as the civil rights struggle raged , Sweet Auburn was wealthy and middle - class .
Its businesses prospered , its nightclubs boomed .
Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin played at the Top Hat Club and partied at the Palamat Motor Lodge opposite .
As American blacks freed themselves from oppression , Sweet Auburn stood ready to reap the benefits .
It never happened .
Sweet Auburn is not very sweet today .
The Palamat is overgrown with weeds .
Auburn 's sidewalks line abandoned lots and shuttered buildings .
Homeless men ( all black ) cluster on street corners .
Freed from segregation , Auburn became an impoverished ghetto .
Perhaps nothing else so encapsulates the endless paradoxes of being black in America .
Never have blacks had so much legal freedom , yet there are record numbers in jail .
Traditional black neighbourhoods have collapsed into drug - ridden crime strongholds , even as the black middle class is the biggest in history .
It is now 40 years since the Voting Rights Act that secured the black vote .
It is 10 years since hundreds of thousands of blacks came to Washington in the Million Man March to demand a way out of poverty .
It is a single month since Hurricane Katrina exposed the racial faultlines that fracture the big cities .
Almost four decades after King was killed , there are still two Americas .
One is largely white and wealthy , one largely black and poor .
They live cheek by jowl in the same country yet in separate worlds .
The shocking thing about the TV pictures from New Orleans was not black poverty , it was the reaction of whites .
' Most whites were shocked about the amount of poverty in New Orleans , but black media have talked about poverty for the past 20 years , ' said David Canton , professor of history at Connecticut College .
Bare statistics tell the story .
Black life expectancy is six years shorter than that of whites .
Black unemployment is twice as high .
Blacks are twice as likely as whites to die from disease , accident or murder at every stage of their lives .
About 24 per cent of black families live below the poverty line , compared with 8 per cent of the white population .
Yet nothing about race in America is that simple .
In the Savoy Bar of Atlanta 's Georgian Terrace Hotel , young blacks sip Martinis and flirt , dressed up to the nines .
Outside , crowds spill out of the Fox Theatre dressed for an evening out .
They are all black .
' It is great to be black in Atlanta , ' said Monique Williams , a pretty 26 - year - old legal clerk at the bar .
' This is our city . '
Certainly Atlanta , unofficial capital of the New South , can sum up the best of black America .
It has a majority black population , a black mayor and an economy that is home to some of the biggest businesses in the world , including Coca - Cola and CNN .
It has wealthy black suburbs , black universities and offers every opportunity for aspiring young blacks .
It is a long way from the city of Gone With the Wind , where the only blacks were maids and slaves .
Mayor Shirley Franklin seems to sum up this hopeful city , often hailed as a beacon for black Americans .
As Atlanta 's first black woman mayor , she has won a national profile after a term aimed at rejuvenating a rundown downtown .
She is hard - working , putting in 12 - hour days and seven - day weeks , and has ended a series of corruption scandals that plagued previous administrations .
She is likely to win re-election next month , backed by black voters and white business .
But Atlanta 's politics are defined by race .
A new law , backed by Franklin , made begging illegal in the downtown area last month .
The move triggered a race row , with some politicians saying the law targeted young black men .
When it finally passed , emotions ran so high that police arrested seven people , including a clergyman and a former city councillor .
At every level of US politics race is never far away .
King , were he alive , would have rejoiced at the fact that successive Secretaries of State , Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice , have been black .
He would also have been impressed that one of the hottest Democratic tips for the White House , and a possible running mate of Hillary Clinton in 2008 , is Barack Obama , who is black .
But those stories have twists .
Powell and Rice sprang from solid middle - class backgrounds .
They have risen by playing down race .
They have also emerged in the Republican Party , not the traditional home of black support .
Moreover , Obama 's blackness does not come from America .
It is a legacy of a Kenyan father .
He was born in Hawaii and his mother is a white woman from Kansas .
In the world of race in America in 2005 nothing is ever as simple as black or white .
Yet the racial line often seems starkly clear .
Nowhere more so than in New Haven , Connecticut : home both to Yale University and one of America 's poorest black communities .
The border is well known and obvious .
It is where Elm Street , lined with Oxbridge - style student cloisters , suddenly changes to Dixwell Avenue , main thoroughfare of the black ghetto .
On one side is the world of the elite , where Ivy League students bustle from lecture halls to cafes .
On the other side is north - west New Haven , where Dixwell 's shops struggle to make ends meet , houses are in decay and drugs and crime are rife .
One world is mostly white , the other almost all black .
As he sits on New Haven 's famous green , surrounded by the trappings of Yale 's wealth , there is no doubt on which side of the divide Nelson Brown falls .
Black , poor and homeless , he pushes a shopping cart full of metal cans he picks up to recycle .
The cart is draped with a faded and dirty US flag .
' It 's all I can do to survive , ' he said of his latest haul of soft drink cast - offs .
New Haven is the reality of America 's urban black poor .
' People like the Katrina victims are living in every American city .
We just ignore it , ' said Robert Brown , a political scientist at Atlanta 's Emory University .
It is this world Katrina exposed to a white America that barely knew it existed outside of gangsta rap videos on MTV .
This is the world abandoned by America in the post - civil rights era .
It is a black underclass that failed to leave the inner city as whites fled to the suburbs , gutting cities of cash and jobs .
But there are other issues at work too .
The divide of black and white masks another chasm just as deep : the gulf between poor and rich blacks .
In fact , this divide is even more unbalanced than the racial one .
The wealth of black America is far more concentrated in its top few per cent than white America .
Poor urban blacks have been abandoned by wealthy black Americans who move into the suburbs and mainstream America as fast as they can .
The underclass they leave behind is a grim place and getting worse .
In 1940 the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 19 per cent ; today it is 70 per cent .
Only 30 to 40 per cent of black men graduate from high school .
That fact has prompted a bout of soul searching by middle - class blacks .
Some have condemned what they see as self - perpetuating joblessness , poor education and a culture that worships crime .
Others have appealed for more help , an increase in the affirmative action which has done apparently little to end black poverty .
The argument was crystallised in a spat between the black comedian Bill Cosby and the black author Mike Dyson .
Cosby began it with a public excoriation of bad ( and single ) parenting , slang English , unplanned pregnancies , dropping out of education , and high crime .
He even slammed black names ' like Shaniqua , Shaligua , Mohammed and all that crap ' .
Cosby then went on tour holding town hall - style ' call - outs ' in black communities .
It was an argument Dyson had little time for .
He dubbed Cosby 's roadtrip the ' Blame the Poor Tour ' and wrote a book called Is Bill Cosby Right ?
Or Has the Black Middle Class Lost Its Mind ?
Dyson said poor blacks could not be blamed for a society geared up to see them fail and which had stacked the odds against them before they were born .
Many leading blacks have joined the fight against Cosby .
' He unerringly and wrongly blames the poor .
He seems to think that if they would only change their minds , all their problems would go away , ' said Ronald Walters , director of the African American Leadership Institute at the University of Maryland .
There is one thing both sides agree on : the black experience of America has been unique .
Other immigrant groups have followed a familiar pattern of four stages .
They arrived poor , suffered prejudice , assimilated , then prospered .
So it went for the Irish , Italians , Asians and many others .
In fact , Asians are now more successful than white Americans .
They are more educated and get better jobs .
But much of black America is stuck at stage two , as it has been for generations .
Unless one believes in racist theories , the answer must lie within black America 's own historical experience .
They were the only ethnic group brought to America involuntarily .
For 250 years they were kept as slaves .
Until the late 1960s blacks in the South were denied the vote , forced to eat in separate restaurants and segregated from society .
Lynchings were still happening in the 1960s as the Beatles played in Liverpool and Bobby Moore lifted the World Cup in London .
The exhibits of the Martin Luther King museum on Auburn Avenue are most shocking for showing how recently an apartheid system was the norm in swaths of America .
That history lies heavy on black America 's back .
It is not a burden to be unshouldered in a generation or two .
Certainly that racist past is still alive for Robert Howard , a black civil rights worker in rural Georgia .
He remembers vividly the days when white people in and around his home in Walton County could beat - or even kill - black people with little fear from the law .
It was a time of segregation and deference , of living in fear when the word ' nigger ' came from the lips of white people and not rap artists .
A tall , thin , graceful man , Howard exudes a calm when talking about race relations now versus then .
' Things are better .
Of course they are .
But you'd be amazed by how much is still to change , ' he said .
Howard has worked tirelessly for a memorial to a Walton County lynching from 1946 when four local blacks were butchered by their white neighbours .
It has earned him both praise and insult .
' There 's some black people here right now who are still scared , ' he declared .
But things have changed .
Walton , like so many southern counties , used to be cotton country .
No longer .
The cotton fields have surrendered to strip malls or to forestry .
It used to be strictly segregated .
No more .
That everyday racism is long gone too .
Blacks have political power here , as they do now even in the deepest parts of the Deep South .
Where segregation still exists , it is largely voluntary and economic , and not a matter of law .
But therein lies the problem .
Even as the old racism lies dead , its legacy endures in the American economy .
As the black middle class grows and black politicians rise to the pinnacle of power , wealthy America - both black and white - has still not come to grips with the problems of its millions of poor black citizens .
' We are grappling with that .
Protest will not win these issues .
All the old racist laws have been stricken from the books .
Now it 's economics , ' said Brown .
It is a problem that can not be ignored for ever .
Martin Luther King 's most famous words summed up the optimism of the 1960s ' civil rights struggle with : ' I have a dream . '
Now the poet Langston Hughes best describes black America at the start of the 21st century .
' What happens to a dream deferred ? ' he wrote .
' Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun ?
Or fester like a sore - And then run ? '
Two worlds
In 2005 black unemployment in the US was 10.8 per cent , compared to 4.7 per cent for whites .
More than 70 per cent of whites own their homes .
Fewer than 50 per cent of blacks do .
Blacks are twice as likely as whites to die from disease , accident or murder .
Black life expectancy is six years less than white life expectancy .
Blacks are three times as likely as whites to be jailed and their sentences are often six months longer .
Net worth of a black household is 10 times less than a white one .
Back in July , it seemed certain that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were headed for divorce .

The government wants to encourage inter caste marriages
Many Indian states already pay money to those who marry Hindus from the lowest castes who are also called dalits .
But the amount differs from state to state - in Gujarat a couple gets the full $ 1,100 ( 50,000 rupees ) - whereas in West Bengal state the amount is $ 45 .
The government says it now wants the sum to be the same throughout India .
Break barriers
The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment , which bears half the cost of the payment , has written to all the states asking them to standardise the minimum amount to $ 1,100 .
" I am very keen on this and I have asked all the state governments to back to me , " Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Meira Kumar told the BBC .
This is not the only way to end the caste discrimination , but one has to start somewhere
Social Justice Minister Meira Kumar
Ministry officials say encouraging such marriages will ultimately break down caste barriers .
They have organised a two - day conference of the state social welfare secretaries in Delhi to discuss the issue .
" In our caste - ridden society if someone breaks out of the mould and marries outside of the caste , we want to give them this money as a token of our appreciation .
We want to make an example of them so that others will follow them , " Ms Kumar said .
She said that inter -caste marriages do happen around the country , but " we want it to grow so much that one day no can say what caste they belong to " .
' Material incentives '
Many say such a proposal is easy to suggest but hard to implement .
Caste is deeply rooted in Indian society and those marrying outside their caste are often ostracised by their family and the wider community .
Low caste Hindus complain of frequent discrimination
Delhi - based sociologist Radhika Chopra said that while $ 1,100 is not a huge amount , it may help a couple to set up a house .
She said that the government has always intervened to determine the shape and structure of the family .
" They have a rather simplistic view that material incentives always work and there is evidence that monetary incentives have worked in the past in reducing female foeticide or persuading people to adopt family planning measures , " Ms Chopra said .
Ministry officials hope the same incentives will work in reducing caste barriers too .
" We do n't know how many people marry across caste .
Only a fraction of all marriages are registered and this exercise will give us an opportunity to document the number of inter - caste marriages taking place in the country , " a senior official said .
Long ago , software companies enforced copy protection by requiring that the original product CD be inserted with each usage .
When copying CDs in their entirety became commonplace , the software giants turned to other methods , mostly centered around internet - based authentication .
However , when I installed several games for my son on our new computer , I found that the old practice still persisted .
Several games made by different manufacturers all required that the CD be inserted to run them .
Since he is too young to be handling CDs , I was motivated to find a solution to this problem .
My solution employs all free software components .
The first is called ISO Recorder .
Depending on which version of Windows XP you have , you have to download either version 1 or 2 of this program .
When installed , ISO Recorder adds a context menu to your real CD drives , so that when you right - click the CD under My Computer , it gives you the option of “ Create image from CD ” and “ Copy CD - to - CD ” .
Place the CD you want to “ clone ” in your drive , open up “ My Computer ” , and right - click on the CD .
Choose “ Create image from CD ” and specify a location for the file .
If you have installed the program already , it may make sense to put the image file in the program directory ( generally under “ C: \Program Files \software company \software title ” ) .
That way if you un-install the program , when it deletes the program directory , the image file will be deleted with it .
If , however , you want to re-install the program later , you can place it elsewhere , and use the ISO image to re-install the program instead of the product CD .
To put your ISO image to use , you need a program called Virtual CloneDrive .
In the installation options , make sure “ .iso ” is checked under file associations .
After installation , if you navigate to the folder your CD image is located in , you will notice that its icon has been replaced by a sheep ( a.k.a .
Dolly , the famous cloned sheep ) .
When you click on this icon , Virtual CloneDrive will “ mount ” this image to the first available drive letter .
For all intents and purposes , it will appear as if you have placed the actual CD into a new CD drive on your computer .
If you have autoplay enabled on your computer , it will autoplay the virtual CD , in most cases starting the program contained on it .
You can also browse the files on the CD .
Virtual CloneDrive defaults to mounting just one drive concurrently although it can support up to eight .
In most cases , one drive is the best configuration , since the type of programs that require the product CD typically would only be used one - at - a - time .
Each time you select a new ISO file , the drive letter being used by Virtual CloneDrive is replaced with the virtual CD for the new file , as if you took the last CD out and put a new one in .
However , if you do need to run more than one of these programs at a time , you can change this option by running CloneDrive from Start -> Programs and selecting the settings tab .
The last step to automating the process of mounting the images to the virtual CD drive is to change your normal program shortcuts to point to the ISO images instead of the normal applications .
Then , when you click to start the programs , instead of saying “ please insert CD ” it will start , just as it should !
In order to do this , find the shortcut , either on your desktop or under Start -> Programs ( or both ) and right - click it .
Change the filename under the “ Target ” field to the name of your image file , with the “ ISO ” extension .
Once you have done this with all the games or other programs on your computer that require CDs , file the original CDs away somewhere , and know that your all your programs are now only one click away , no CDs necessary .
The July 7 attacks in London were not an individual act of terrorism but one episode in a worldwide conflict , say researchers at Oxford University .
Philip Ball reports
The third world war has already started .
It is not George Bush 's rhetorical " war on terror " , but terrorism itself .
In other words , terrorism is the new war .
Journalistic cliche ?
Apparently not .
A recent analysis of the casualty statistics of global terrorism shows they follow the pattern previously observed for conventional conflicts ranging from small local skirmishes to the second world war .
In at least two continuing conflicts not generally regarded as terrorist in nature - in Iraq and Colombia - the statistics are converging on the form seen for global terrorism , perhaps indicating that governments need to deal with wars differently .
According to Neil Johnson , a physicist at Oxford University and one of the team that studied the figures , the findings raise the possibility that both conflicts " are a part of one big ongoing global war - a mother of all wars " .
If that is so , London is embroiled in it , too .
The casualty figures for the July 7 bombings " absolutely fall in line " with what the analysis of terrorism statistics predict , says Johnson .
But how can a single , simple ( if gruesome ) statistic such as the number of people killed in attacks tell us anything meaningful about events and conflicts conducted in completely different places for what seem to be totally different reasons ?
Is n't this like expecting to understand a country 's culture by counting its population ?
That depends on what you are looking for .
When he first studied the statistics of " deadly quarrels " 80 years ago , the British physicist Lewis Fry Richardson wanted to understand why wars happen .
Richardson , a Quaker who served as an ambulance driver in the first world war , hoped that such insight could promote world peace .
He decided first to find out how wars were distributed according to their size .
In the 1920s , Richardson plotted the fatality statistics for 82 wars fought since 1820 on a graph showing the size of the conflicts on one axis and the number of conflicts of that size on the other .
He found that the data fitted onto a smooth curve which , when the numbers were plotted as logarithms , became a straight line .
This sort of mathematical relationship is known as a power law .
The line slopes " downwards " because there are progressively fewer conflicts of ever greater size : little wars are common ; big ones rare .
The power law continued to hold as the data embraced conflicts such as the second world war and Vietnam .
Richardson 's discovery of power - law statistics of conflicts has been followed subsequently by the recognition that power laws govern all sorts of " social " statistics , from the sizes of towns to the fluctuations of economic markets and the network structure of the world wide web .
Power - law statistics of event sizes are also found for natural phenomena that occur close to points of instability , such as earthquakes and avalanches .
This suggests that social systems prone to power - law statistics , such as economic markets and international relations , also operate on the brink of instability .
Earlier this year , computer scientists Aaron Clauset and Maxwell Young at the University of New Mexico showed that the fatalities from acts of terrorism since 1968 also follow a power law .
" We were very surprised , " Clauset says .
" It made us think that there may be some deep , underlying connection between terrorism and wars . "
But they found that not all terrorism is the same .
There are two different power laws - one that fits the figures for terrorist attacks in industrialised ( G8 ) nations ; and another for attacks in the rest of the world .
The slope of the straight - line plot was steeper in the latter case , indicating that attacks in industrialised nations are more rare but more severe when they do occur .
The attacks of September 11 indicate precisely that , as do the London bombings .
Johnson has teamed up with economist Mike Spagat at Royal Holloway College in London , a specialist in the Colombian conflict , and researchers in Bogotá , Colombia , to apply the same kind of analysis to this continuing struggle between the government and several left - and rightwing insurgent groups .
The conflict has been going on since the 1980s , and at face value it resembles neither a terrorist - style confrontation nor a conventional war .
But the researchers found that the fatality statistics for individual attacks since 1989 also follow a power law .
More strikingly still , the slope of the power law has been decreasing steadily over time and appears to be converging on precisely the value that Clauset and Young found for global ( non - G8 ) terrorism .
The Colombian " war " may have started out as something unique , but it seems now to have mutated into a conflict with the fingerprint of terrorism .
And the team found the same trend for the statistics in Iraq since the coalition invasion in March , 2003 .
Here , the slope of the power law initially had much the same value as that seen by Richardson for conventional wars .
But it has crept up steadily since 2003 , and now it , too , is equal to that for global terrorism .
Johnson argues that , while the conventional approach of political analysts is to look for micro-explanations of the course of a conflict in terms of the motivations of the groups concerned , that statistical analysis suggests that the outcomes are much more to do with " the mechanics of how people now do war " .
" It 's like looking at different markets , " he says .
" We now know that a lot of the fluctuations are universal , irrespective of whether you 're looking at trading in New York or Shanghai . "
With that in mind , he and his colleagues have developed a simple mathematical model of how insurgent forces are organised into small groups that are continually coalescing and fragmenting .
Assuming that the destructive capacity of a group depends on its size and resources , this model predicts the value of the power - law slope found for global terrorism .
The team 's conclusion supports the assertion of Mary Kaldor , a political scientist at the London School of Economics , that " the ongoing war in Iraq is a new type of war " .
Kaldor says that US military action in Iraq has been predicated on the assumption that they are fighting an " old war " .
" This is immensely dangerous , " Kaldor says .
That , it seems , must also be the message for any global " war on terror " - it is not one that can be won by military might , but by new strategies .
In " new wars " , says Kaldor , military forces should be deployed for law enforcement , and " forces are needed that combine soldiers , police and civilians with the capacity to undertake humanitarian and legal activities " .
But if , as Johnson 's work suggests , these conflicts have indeed turned into a form of terrorism , they will not be over soon .
According to Clauset , the power - law statistics of terrorism show that it " is an endemic feature of the modern world and is likely not something that can be completely eradicated .
Instead , it should be considered in a similar way to other endemic problems , such as crime and natural disasters . "

I 'm Professor Emeritus ( as of 2001 Jan 1 ) of Computer Science at Stanford University and here 's more about me including addresses .
What 's new ?
It occurs to me that those who have already looked at this web page might not want to slog through all of it on the chance that something newly installed might interest them .
If you 've looked at the page before , then look at this dated list .
Dates start in 1995 July .
I sometimes miss one or two .
THE ROBOT AND THE BABY is a science fiction story .
Maybe I 'll try to publish it conventionally .
Do you think I should ?
I have decided to make some comment from time to time on world , national and scientific affairs .
I do n't have time to make this into a proper blog .
My goal is get all my papers and many of my notes into a form reachable from this page .
Slides for most of my lectures are here .
If any of the papers here are listed as references , I would be grateful if the URLs were given along with the printed references .

The Sustainability of Human Progress
Many people , including many scientists , mistakenly believe that human progress , in the form it has taken in the last few hundred years , is unsustainable .
The sustainabililty page and its subsidiaries attempt to summarize the scientific basis for technological optimism .
There is also a section discussing related ideological phenomena and the advocacy politics to which ideologies have given rise .
The sustainability pages are essentially done , although I plan to improve them and respond to inadequacies people find .
Having done my best to show that material progress is sustainable , I can turn my attention to the future and present ideas about what progress people will want and what can be achieved .
The emphasis is on opportunities rather than on inevitability .

PAPERS ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and their Computation by Machine ( Part I ) .
This was the original paper on LISP .
It is copied with minor notational changes from CACM , April 1960 .
If you want the exact typography , look there .
A few typographical changes have been made , but the notation has not been modernized .
There are also some new explanatory footnotes .
Part II , which never appeared , was to have had some Lisp programs for algebraic computation .
LISP --- NOTES ON ITS PAST AND FUTURE ---1980 was published in 1980 .
I put it up since it mostly represents my present opinions .
There are some 1999 footnotes .
Elephant 2000 - 1992
This unpublished draft is a proposal for a new programming language , but it includes the mathematical theory of computation proposal for distinguishing input - output and accomplishment specifications , characterizes input and output statements as speech acts and allows reference to the past in programs .
PUBLISHED PAPERS ON MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF COMPUTATION
Towards a Mathematical Science of Computation , IFIPS 1962 extends the results of the previous paper .
I think it is the first mention and use of abstract syntax .
Correctness of a Compiler for Arithmetic Expressions by John McCarthy and James Painter may have been the first proof of correctness of a compiler .

Inversion of Functions Defined by Turing Machines was included in Automata Studies edited by Claude Shannon and myself and published by Princeton University Press in 1956 .
It introduced the notion of well - defined problem , but I became convinced that inverting computable functions in general is not a feasible way of doing AI .
Programs with Common Sense was probably the first paper on logical AI , i.e .
AI in which logic is the method of representing information in computer memory and not just the subject matter of the program .
The paper was given in the Teddington Conference on the Mechanization of Thought Processes in December 1958 and printed in the proceedings of that conference .
It may also be the first paper to propose common sense reasoning ability as the key to AI .
Some Philosophical Problems from the Standpoint of Artificial Intelligence by John McCarthy and Pat Hayes was published in 1969 in Machine Intelligence 4 .
It is the basic paper on situation calculus .
My 1964 Stanford AI Memo A Tough Nut for Proof Procedures has aroused increased interest lately .
The present version has some recent comments .
It is to prove that a checkerboard with two diagonally opposite squares removed cannot be covered by dominoes that cover two adjacent squares .
The Mutilated Checkerboard in Set Theory was presented at the QED meeting in Warsaw in 1995 July .
It is a proof in set theory that I think an interactive prover for heavy duty set theory should be able to accept .
It uses for a different purpose the same problem as the previous paper .
Circumscription - A Form of Nonmonotonic Reasoning was published in Artificial Intelligence in 1980 .
Applications of Circumscription to Formalizing Common Sense Knowledge was published in Artificial Intelligence in 1986 .
It gives a better formulation of circumscription and emphasizes making certain functions and predicates variable .
Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machines concerns what it means for a machine to have beliefs .
This started the dispute about whether thermostats could be considered to have beliefs .
It was published in 1979 in an obscure collection and reprinted in my 1990 book Formalizing Common Sense .
First Order Theories of Individual Concepts and Propositions was first published in Machine Intelligence 9 in 1979 .
Artificial Intelligence , Logic and Formalizing Common Sense
in Philosophical Logic and Artificial Intelligence edited by Richmond Thomason ( Dordrecht ; Kluwer Academic , c1989 ) .
This contains a reasonably up - to - date ( even as of 1994 ) point of view of logical AI .
It does n't cover what I do n't know or have forgotten .
Notes on Formalizing Context
Appeared in Proceedings of IJCAI - 1993 .
This version has an improvement in the way lifting above - theory is treated .
Formalizing Context ( Expanded Notes ) contains expanded material on context .
It is joint work with Sasa Buvac .
Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy was given at Aaron Sloman 's Symposium on philosophy and AI at IJCAI - 95 .
The present version is somewhat improved .
A LOGICAL AI APPROACH TO CONTEXT responds to a request for a note on our approach to formalizing context in mathematical logic that can be compared with John Perry 's situation semantics based approach to context .
It will appear ( presumably appeared ) in a CSLI ( Center for Studies in Linguistics and Information ) publication .
Making Robots Conscious of their Mental States was given at Machine Intelligence 15 , 1995 August in Oxford .
It 's in the Proceedings of that workshop .
The idea is that many tasks will require the computer programs examine their own computational structures in ways like those involved in human consciousness and indeed self - consciousness .
The present version is much improved .
Some Expert Systems Need Common Sense was published in 1984 .
Some people are re-defining AI in such a way that common sense and therefore human level AI are precluded .
They do this inadvertently ( presumably ) by assuming that some human limits what phenomena are to be taken into account in defining the AI system .
Coloring Maps and the Kowalski Doctrine was a 1982 Stanford report .
More is known about realizing the Kempe heuristic by making a Prolog that can run in an introspective mode , and I 'll put in a note about it when I get a chance .
The Little Thoughts of Thinking Machines is a popular article that appeared in Psychology Today in 1983 .
Epistemological Problems of Artificial Intelligence summarized the epistemological problems I saw at that time .
It was an invited talk at IJCAI - 77 .
Many of the problems mentioned in this paper were treated later in more detail by myself and other people .
Generality in Artificial Intelligence relates to my ACM Turing Award lecture given in 1971 .
However , the ideas did n't jell sufficiently at that time to be written up .
In 1987 ACM asked for a summary to include in a volume of Turing Award lectures .
Instead I wrote this complete paper .
Its actual relation to the 1971 lecture is hard to say , since I did n't remember what I said in 1971 .
On the Model Theory of Knowledge by myself , M. Sato , T. Hayashi and S. Igarashi was written in the late 1970s .
Creative Solutions to Problems was given at the AISB Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Creativity , 1999 April 8 and 9 .
Combining Narratives is by John McCarthy and Tom Costello .
It was presented at KR - 98 in Trento , Italy .
A major feature of this paper is that sentences describing two independent narratives can be combined just by conjoining the sentences .
Sentences can be added later to establish relations between them .
Useful Counterfactuals by Tom Costello and John McCarthy is published in the ETAI ( Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence ) , Vol 3 ( 1999 ) , Section A .
Counterfactual conditional sentences can be useful in artificial intelligence .
In particular , they allow reasoners to learn from experiences that they did not quite have .
The truth of a counterfactual and the conclusions that can be drawn from a counterfactual are theory dependent , and different theories are useful in different circumstances .
A simple class of useful counterfactuals involves a change of one component of a point in a space provided with a cartesian product structure .
We call these cartesian counterfactuals .
Cartesian counterfactuals can be modeled by assignment and contents functions as in program semantics .
We also study the more general tree - structured counterfactuals .
Free Will - Even for Robots will appear in a special issue of the Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence devoted to philosophical questions .
Robots will need to consider their own choices in a manner similar to that in which a human contemplates his own free will .
DETERMINISTIC FREE WILL is a shorter paper than Free Will - Even for Robots .
I think it gets to the essence of free will and incorporates it in a situation calculus formula .
AI needs to deal with objects and predicates that do n't admit if - and - only - if definitions .
It also needs approximate theories and needs to study the relation between entities at different levels of approximation .
Approximate objects and approximate theories is in the Proceedings of KR - 2000 .
ACTIONS AND OTHER EVENTS IN SITUATION CALCULUS
This is a new ( 2001 August ) article on situation calculus .
It differs from previous approaches in three ways .
It distinguishes internal events that happen spontaneously from external events ( actions ) .
It also treats processes , e.g. a buzzer , that do not settle down .
The non-monotonic reasoning is circumscription done situation by situation .
It is in the Proceedings of KR - 2002 .
Notes on AI
An Example for Natural Language Understanding and the AI Problems it Raisestry .
- 1976 .
Apparently these problems have n't been solved and the recently popular statistical methods do n't even try .
Overcoming unexpected obstacles is a note written in 1992 and 1993 describing an important kind of elaboration tolerance .
A plan is shown to work by reasoning involving circumscribing a predicate occurs ( e , s ) asserting that the event e occurs in situation s.
If a sentence is added asserting the occurrence of an event that defeats the plan and the circumscription is done again , the plan can no longer be shown to work .
In our example , a revised plan including an action that overcomes the obstacle can be shown to work .
There is a bug in handling the circumscription that I have not fixed , and this accounts for the long delay in posting this note .
Formalization of two Puzzles Involving Knowledge involves formalization of facts about knowledge including both knowing what and knowing that , how to assume and prove non-knowledge , joint knowledge and the effect of learning a fact on the set of facts then known .
It uses the Kripke possible worlds formalism directly .
What is AI ? is intended to answer questions I get in email from people uninformed about AI .
Suggestions for improving it are welcome , and anyone who has a use for it is welcome to link to it or copy it .

Over the last two years , more than 30 people died awaiting liver transplants at UCI Medical Center in Orange as the hospital turned down scores of organs that might have saved them , according to a federal report .
More than 100 UCI patients still are waiting for transplants , and 28 have joined the roster this year alone -- despite a staffing shortage that dampens their prospects for a transplant .
Although patients may not know it , the UC Irvine medical center has not had a full - time liver transplant surgeon since July 2004 .
The center has performed just five liver transplants this year and has consistently fallen below the minimum number required by the federal government to maintain funding , according to the report from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .
Advertisement
The low number of surgeries was not for lack of offers .
Between August 2004 and July 2005 , the hospital received 122 liver offers , most of them from the regional organ procurement agency , which coordinates donations and offers in Southern California .
But only 12 were transplanted , including two that went to the same patient because the first one failed , according to the Aug. 5 federal report , obtained by The Times under the Freedom of Information Act .
Even when patients did get transplants , the report says , they did not fare as well as they should have .
Only 68.6 % of patients who received liver transplants at UCI from January 2002 to June 2004 survived at least a year -- well below the 77 % survival rate required for federal certification .
Research has shown that surgical success rates at hospitals are linked to the number of procedures performed .
The report suggests that UCI ’s problems existed for years .
The review was prompted by a complaint from a former UCI patient who had languished on the list from 1998 to 2002 .
The woman , who ultimately received a transplant at another hospital , discovered only through a lawsuit that UCI had turned down more than 90 organs offered for her .

In refusing organs over the last year , the center often cited their poor quality .
But most of the livers turned down by UCI this year were subsequently accepted by other hospitals and transplanted into their patients , said Thomas Mone , chief executive officer of OneLegacy , the organ procurement group in Southern California .
On its website , the UCI program projects professionalism and stability .
The site includes a brief biography of its chief of transplantation , Dr. Marquis Hart .
It makes no mention that Hart spends most of his time as a transplant surgeon at UC San Diego .
UCI ’s other liver transplant surgeon , Dr. Ajai Khanna , also is on staff at UC San Diego , 90 miles away .
Federal standards require that a surgeon be constantly available .

When federal inspectors visited UCI on July 19 and 20 , a liver transplant surgeon “ was nowhere in the immediate vicinity of the hospital , ” according to the report .
On the 19th , staff at the hospital told inspectors , the on - call surgeon was operating on patients all day at another hospital -- apparently UC San Diego .
The following day , the same “ covering ” physician was out of state and unavailable .
All the while , one of the hospital ’s patients was “ on the highest priority list for transplantation should a liver be available , ” the report says .
A UCI official on Wednesday did not address the specific allegations in the federal report , saying only that the medical center was making improvements to its liver program .
Dr. David Imagawa , who since July has overseen the liver transplant program , said the hospital had recruited a full - time transplant surgeon who would start early next year .
Until then , part - timers will continue providing coverage .

“ We agree that there were some problems , and we ’re moving forward to change them , ” said Imagawa , who founded UCI ’s liver transplant program in 1994 , left in 2002 and only recently returned .
The medical center has been shaken by two other major healthcare scandals in recent years .
In an internationally publicized case , fertility doctors in the mid-1990s stole the eggs of patients , implanting them in infertile women who in some instances gave birth .
The university paid out nearly $ 20 million to settle legal claims .
And in 1999 , UC Irvine fired Christopher Brown , the director of its donated cadaver program , amid suspicion that he had improperly sold spines to an Arizona research program .
The buyers paid $ 5,000 to a company owned by a business associate of Brown .
Brown was not prosecuted .

In the case of the liver program , patients apparently had no idea that UCI was passing up livers on their behalf .
When a potential donor is near death , the regional organ procurement agency looks for the sickest patient at the hospitals within its region and moves down the list until a hospital accepts the organ .
Patients generally are told only of the offers that are accepted .
Elodie Irvine , 51 , whose case gave rise to the federal inspection , went on the waiting list in 1998 with polycystic kidney and liver disease , a condition in which her organs developed large cysts .
Her liver eventually swelled to five times its normal size .
In 1999 , Imagawa wrote to the national organ oversight agency pleading Irvine ’s case .
Advertisement
“ We believe that due to the mass of her liver if she is not transplanted ... within the next year , she will become too malnourished to survive this operation . ”
She moved up the list .
By 2002 , UCI had turned down 38 livers and 57 kidneys offered on her behalf , according to a log from the national organ network that she obtained during her subsequent lawsuit against UCI .
The liver offers stopped coming in February 2002 , after the hospital failed to submit critical information on Irvine ’s condition to the national group overseeing organ transplants , which caused her to drop to the bottom of the list for a transplant .
Doctors “ kept saying , ‘ You ’re on top .
You ’re on top . ’
They led me to believe that there were no offers ....
They left me to die . ”
Advertisement
Irvine did not die , though .
One of her doctors outside UCI encouraged her to transfer to Cedars - Sinai Medical Center , telling her she had a better chance of getting a transplant there .
Indeed , within two months of transferring , she received her transplant , in December 2002 .
Irvine settled her case earlier this year , a decision she regrets because she believes she received bad legal advice .
Her attorney said her settlement was fair .
Federal officials , in their report , faulted UCI ’s handling of her case .
Imagawa acknowledged that the hospital had made some errors but said the organs offered on her behalf were of poor quality and “ not suitable for someone without life - threatening emergency . ”

In a separate case cited by regulators , miscommunication between the liver program and the cardiac unit delayed a patient ’s placement on the transplant waiting list for at least eight months this year .
There was no indication that the patient had ever been told about the reason for the delay , the federal report said .
The people who oversee liver transplantation have long known about what was going on at UCI .
Mone of OneLegacy said Wednesday that his staff noticed that UCI turned down an increasingly large number of organs after Imagawa stopped performing transplants in late 2001 .
Mone said his agency did not have authority to take action against the program and that all he could do was report the numbers to the national overseer of transplantation , the United Network for Organ Sharing .

The network , which controls a massive database of transplant information , renewed its accreditation of UCI ’s liver program in December despite the fact that it failed to meet federal requirements in a number of areas .
UC Irvine failed , for instance , to meet the federal requirement of 12 liver transplants in each of the past three years .
In 2002 - 04 , only eight transplants were performed each year .
