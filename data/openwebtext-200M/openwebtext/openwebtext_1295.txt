Carlos Correa takes aim at Astros haters after playoff win : ' What are they going to say now ? '
Harvard materials scientists have come up with what they believe is a new way to model the formation of glasses , a type of amorphous solid that includes common window glass .
Glasses form through the process of vitrification , in which a glass - forming liquid cools and slowly becomes a solid whose molecules , though they 've stopped moving , are not permanently locked into a crystal structure .
Instead , they 're more like a liquid that has merely stopped flowing , though they can continue to move over long stretches of time .
" A glass is permanent , but only over a certain time scale .
It 's a liquid that just stopped moving , stopped flowing , " said David Weitz , Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Harvard 's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ( SEAS ) and the Department of Physics .
" A crystal has a very unique structure , a very ordered structure that repeats itself over and over .
A glass never repeats itself .
It wants to be a crystal but something is preventing it from being a crystal . "
Other than window glass , made from silica or silicon dioxide , Weitz said many sugars are glasses .
Honey , for example , is not a glass at room temperature , but as it cools down and solidifies , it becomes a glass .
Scientists like Weitz use models to understand the properties of glasses .
Weitz and members of his research group , together with colleagues at Columbia University and the University of North Texas , report in this week 's Nature a new wrinkle on an old model that seems to improve how well it mimics the behavior of glass .
The model is a colloidial fluid , a liquid with tiny particles , or colloids , suspended evenly in it .
Milk , for example , is a familiar colloidial fluid .
Scientists model solidifying glasses using colloids by adding more particles to the fluid .
This increases the particles ' concentration , making the fluid thicker , and making it flow more slowly .
The advantage of this approach to studying glasses directly is size , Weitz said .
The colloid particles are 1,000 times bigger than a molecule of a glass and can be observed with a microscope .
" They 're big ; they 're slow .
They get slower and slower and slower and slower , " Weitz said .
" They do n't behave like a fluid .
They do n't behave like a crystal .
They behave in many ways like a glass . "
The problem with traditional colloids used in these models , however , is that they often rapidly solidify past a certain point , unlike most glasses , which continue to flow ever more slowly as they gradually solidify .
Weitz and colleagues created a colloid that behaves more like a glass in that way by using soft , compressible particles in the colloid instead of hard ones .
This makes the particles squeeze together as more particles are added , making them flow more slowly , but delaying the point at which it solidifies , giving it a more glasslike behavior .
By varying the colloidal particles ' stiffness , researchers can vary the colloidal behavior and improve the model 's faithfulness to various glasses .
" There 's this wealth of behavior in molecular glass and we never saw this wealth of behavior in colloid particles , " Weitz said .
" The fact you can visualize things gives you tremendous insight you can't get with molecular glass . "
Weitz 's co-authors are Johan Mattsson , Hans M. Wyss , and Alberto Fernandez - Nieves of Harvard 's Department of Physics and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ; Kunimasa Miyazaki and David R. Reichman of Columbia University ; and Zhibing Hu of the University of North Texas .

Citing an argument that hallmarked the Bush years , Obama administration attorneys have asked a San Francisco court to drop all charges against Berkeley law professor John Yoo , who authored legal opinions that permitted the torture of prisoners .
An amicus curiae brief [ PDF link ] filed by the Department of Justice with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday essentially argues that because he was giving advice to the president on a national security matter , Yoo should not be held accountable for his actions as it would have a chilling effect on advice provided to future presidents .
ADVERTISEMENT
In other words , the DoJ explained , accusations of torture in this case present “ special factors ” that the court should not address “ in the absence of congressional action . ”
“ Yoo ’s new attorney , Miguel Estrada , argued for dismissal in a filing last month , saying the case interfered with presidential war - making authority and threatened to “ open the floodgates to politically motivated lawsuits ” against government officials , ” noted Bob Egelko , writing for The San Francisco Chronicle .
The DoJ ’s argument was not so broad , as it also noted that the Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating Yoo and a number of other Bush administration attorneys .
Their report was due out at the end of November but its release has been delayed and is expected “ soon , ” according to a recent report .
In June , Yoo was ordered to testify in a suit filed by attorneys representing Jose Padilla , an American citizen who was held for more than three years and allegedly tortured while in U.S. military custody .
Padilla was convicted in January , 2008 of conspiracy to aid terrorism and sentenced to 17 years , four months in prison .
At his trial , the judge noted the government had not presented enough evidence to convict him for attempting to detonate a “ dirty bomb ” in the United States , of which he was originally accused .
The judge also noted the American citizen ’s imprisonment and subsequent “ harsh ” interrogations , saying it would be weighed in Padilla ’s sentencing .

Yoo , while at the Office of Legal Council in 2002 , authored a majority of the department ’s opinions on torture along with Jay Bybee , who now serves as a judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , and Steven Bradbury , the former OLC chief who now practices law in Washington , D.C .
Adjective
Children born with an extra chromosome 21 are healthy , conspicuously happy and destined to live for many years .
But they are not considered , in that pejorative word , ' normal ' .
— Matt Ridley , Genome ,
The word barbarian was used by the Greeks , to designate an alien , and therefore , by definition , someone inferior in culture to a Hellene .
The Romans applied this in the pejorative sense to the people who came to live along the Rhine - Danube frontier .
— Norman F. Cantor , The Civilization of the Middle Ages ,
On occasion they expressed a preference for the terms Latino or Hispanic if that would assist them in escaping from the term Puerto Rican , which became , at times , almost pejorative . — John Hope Franklin , " The Land of Room Enough , " , in Race and History ,
a word with pejorative connotations
the reviewer used the pejorative word “ versifier ” to refer to the writer , whose poems had struck a responsive chord with the general public
As noted previously , the Climategate letters and documents show Jones and the Team using the peer review process to prevent publication of adverse papers , while giving softball reviews to friends and associates in situations fraught with conflict of interest .
Today I ’ll report on the spectacle of Jones reviewing a submission by Mann et al .
Let ’s recall some of the reviews of articles daring to criticize CRU or dendro :
I am really sorry but I have to nag about that review – Confidentially I now need a hard and if required extensive case for rejecting ( Briffa to Cook )
…
If published as is , this paper could really do some damage .
It is also an ugly paper to review because it is rather mathematical , with a lot of Box - Jenkins stuff in it .
It wo n’t be easy to dismiss out of hand as the math appears to be correct theoretically , ( Cook to Briffa )
…
Recently rejected two papers ( one for JGR and for GRL ) from people saying CRU has it wrong over Siberia .
Went to town in both reviews , hopefully successfully .
( Jones to Mann )
Previously we also looked at Jones ’ soft review of Schmidt ( 2009 ) and looked at his attempts to keep Michaels and McKitrick ( 2004 ) out of IJC and IPCC AR4 .
Here is Jones ’ review of Mann et al dated November 1 , 2008 ( I ca n’t tell if this refers to an article in print or not – the review mentions pages ranging from 85 to 247 which seems to be too long for any Mann papers published since Nov 1 , 2008 . )
The paper is generally well written .
I recommend acceptance subject to minor revisions .
I will leave it to the editor to check that most of my comments have been responded to .
Minor Comments
… [ 17 “ minor comments ” referring passim to pages ranging from 85 to 247 ]
That ’s it .
No “ going to town ” .
Lucky , I guess , that there was apparently none of that “ math stuff ” to worry about .
Lucky that they did n’t have to worry about a paper that might do “ damage ” .
Or about how to reject a paper that might do “ damage ” when the math was “ correct theoretically ” .
Lucky that no editor wrote to Jones asking him to provide a “ hard and if required extensive case for rejecting ” .
Nope , none of that .
Between the Team , a few words sufficed :
The paper is generally well written .
I recommend acceptance subject to minor revisions .
I will leave it to the editor to check that most of my comments have been responded to .
Readers need to take care neither to overstate nor understate what these reviews show .
Obviously there ’s something fundamentally wrong with the behavior evidenced in these reviews – something that most readers of the Climategate Letters understand .
( The only people who seem not to be troubled are the majority of climate scientists . )
To go beyond that requires some reflection on what the purposes of “ peer review ” are .
Because I ’ve encountering journal peer review systems rather late in my life , I tend to view journal peer review merely as a form of due diligence ( realizing that there are other forms of due diligence ) ; I sometimes feel a bit like an anthropologist studying a tribe ( of academics ) who do not realize that their customs ( for due diligence ) are only customs .
Behaviour
Elephants are highly social animals with a complex range of behaviours .
Scroll down to find out more or click on a link to jump straight to :
Family groups
Adult males and females live separately in differently structured societies .
The basic family unit , known as a breeding herd , is a group of related females consisting of a mother and young with her grown daughters and their offspring .
The activity of the group and their movements are set by the ' matriarch ' , recognizable as the largest cow in the herd .
She normally walks at the front of the herd , with another large female taking up the rear .
If disturbed , the elephants will gather around the matriarch and follow her lead .
Herds can range from 2 to 24 animals but when the number of elephants in a group exceeds around 10 , it tends to split into two .
The two families will continue to associate closely , spending between 35 to 70 % of their time together .
Before young cows have their own calves they will take care of other animals in the herd .
Known as " allmothers " they will rush to protect or assist any calf in trouble .
Related cows will also suckle one another 's calves .
Calves commonly play with one another .
Play activities appear to help them gain experience with objects , develop locomotive skills and assess the abilities of other calves .
Solitary bulls
From 12 - 15 years of age up to 20 , young bulls will spend over 50 % of their time away from the family unit , finally leaving entirely .
Despite their solitary nature bulls also have a complex form of social organization .
After becoming independent they may walk alone or form small temporary bachelor groups of 2 - 14 animals .
Bulls wander more widely than cows and , during periods of musth , will venture away from their home range in search of mating opportunities .
Very old bulls will often be found far away from the main herds , in marshy areas .
As their last tooth wear 's down , they need to be close to soft vegetation which requires minimal chewing .
Communication
Elephants communicate through gestures , touch , smell and sounds .
When encountering another individual , a kind of ' greeting ceremony ' takes place where one animal inserts the tip of its trunk in the other 's mouth .
Elephants use their trunks , ears and movements of the head to indicate aggression .
Vocally , elephants are able to rumble , bellow , growl and trumpet .
Most rumbling noises are below the frequency range of human hearing and are thought to travel several kilometres .
This means elephants can tell where other animals are and can take steps to join , or avoid , one other .
Growls tend to be used in greetings or as an expression or anger .
Bellows indicate fear .
Trumpeting can be used as an alarm , within threat displays or simply to express anger or excitement .
Aggressive behaviour
Elephants are usually peaceful animals .
Females may , however , be aggressive when young calves are present and bulls can be exceptionally aggressive during musth .
All elephants may become aggressive when sick , injured or harassed .
Elephants react to threats or challenges in three different ways .
Dominance or threat displays are designed to demonstrate the superior strength and social position of the individual .
They may look towards the threat , spreading their ears out .
' Standing tall ' , they raise their head and tusks high .
Head - shaking and trunk - swishing can also be seen .
Elephants may run at the threat in a demonstration or real charge .
Most charges are mock charges which are broken off before the target is reached .
However if an attack is followed through , an elephant is quite capable of killing another elephant , other animals ( including humans ) or wrecking cars .
Defensive or submissive actions highlight an elephant 's fear or indecision .
They include avoidance , agitated curling trunk movements , throwing of dust , foot - swinging and exaggerated feeding behaviour ( loudly breaking off branches , pulling up grass etc ) .
Fights
If the threat persists , elephants can get involved in very aggressive fights .
Wounds can be fatal or may become infected , leading to death .
This punctured skull was found in the Shangoni section in the north of Kruger National Park .
Judging by the angle of entry of the tusk , the victim must have been down on his knees in front of his attacker .
The force of the impact between these two young bulls caused one of their tusks to be broken ( the circles show pieces of ivory flying through the air )
Mr. Rudi Sippel , a park employee , witnessed a fatal elephant encounter along the Olifants River in KNP :
" An older bull must have lost the fight and was attempting to flee from the younger conqueror .
The latter was stabbing him from behind .
The older bull protected his vulnerable flanks by turning his rear towards the younger bull .
Exhausted , he could no longer manage this and the younger bull succeeded in stabbing him in the neck .
When the tusk broke through the skin it sounded like a gunshot and the older bull bellowed in agony .
The wounded bull went down on his knees and was repeatedly stabbed in the neck and ribcage before he collapsed .
The younger bull walked some distance away , then came back to turn the stricken bull over and urinate on its head .
He returned time after time to push and prod the fallen animal .
Ranger Ben Pretorius mercifully shot the old bull .
The shot frightened the younger bull away but he returned again that night to push the carcass around .
Some of the stab wounds were found to be 50 cm deep . "

On properly heating your pan [ Houseboat Eats ]
The EU's new foreign relations chief , Catherine Ashton , criticised Israel in her first speech on the Middle East and unveiled plans to visit the region in the New Year .
Described recently by one Israeli lobbyist as a " tabula rasa " who will be easy to influence because of her lack of foreign policy experience , Ms Ashton came down hard on the Israeli government in an address to MEPs in Strasbourg on Tuesday ( 15 December ) .
" East Jerusalem is occupied territory together with the West Bank .
The EU is opposed to the destruction of homes , the eviction of Arab residents and the construction of the separation barrier , " she said on Israeli activity in the city , which is holy to both Jews and Muslims .
Ms Ashton called Israel 's recent decision to temporarily freeze settlement growth outside Jerusalem a " first step , " in a cooler tone than EU foreign ministers who last week took " positive note " of the move .
In November , defence minister Ehud Barak ordered a freeze order while at the same time permitted the construction of 28 new public buildings in settlements .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu subsequently declared that settlement construction would resume at the end of a 10 - month period .
" We 're deeply concerned about the daily living conditions of people in Gaza , " she added on Israel 's blockade of aid shipments to the strip .
" Israel should reopen the crossings without delay . "
Her speech was also significant for what it left out :
Ms Ashton did not say that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East , that it faces a security threat from Palestinian " terrorists " or that Palestinians should immediately return to formal peace talks - the classic arguments of Israeli supporters .
The EU's new foreign relations chief had a dig at the Quartet 's special envoy to the region , Tony Blair , who has been markedly sllent while in the job .
" The Quartet [ a special group set up by the US , EU , UN and Russia ] must demonstrate that it is worth the money , that it is capable of being reinvigorated .
I have talked about this with both sides in Jerusalem , to Mr Blair and the [ US ] secretary of state , " she said .
Ms Ashton 's office said that she plans to travel to the Middle East to meet leaders in late January or early February , with Bosnia , Afghanistan and Iran also high on her agenda .
The MEPs ' debate saw a number of deputies from the left and liberal side of the house call for punitive measures against Israel , ranging from a suspension of the EU's Association Agreement to trade penalties against exports originating in settlements .
Irish centre - left member Proinsias De Rossa , who visited the West Bank last week , called Israeli treatment of Arabs in the occupied territories a form of " apartheid . "
Meanwhile , Dutch right - wing deputy Bastiaan Belder , who chairs the parliament 's Israel delegation , said that his contacts in Congress in the US think the EU is " mad " to interfere in the Middle East 's internal discussions on the future status of East Jerusalem .
Ms Ashton side - stepped the calls for anti-Israeli sanctions but picked up on an institutional question of whether she will sit in the EU commission 's benches or next to the EU rotating presidency in future Strasbourg briefings .
" You 'll have to build me a seat equidistant to both because I am sure I 'll get into trouble with someone wherever I sit , " she said , on the subject of her divided loyalties in Brussels .

Work has begun on Egypt 's northern border to dig the foundations for what reports say will be a vast underground metal wall in the latest effort to prevent weapons smuggling into the Gaza Strip .
Egyptian security officials have said they are digging steel tubes into the ground on their side of the border and are paving a road that will have devices along its route to monitor smuggling .
The US Army Corps of Engineers , which is reportedly involved , has worked with the Egyptians on preventing smuggling along this border for at least two years .
Palestinian smugglers in Gaza have built dozens , perhaps hundreds , of underground tunnels through the sand to bring a wide range of goods into the small territory , from food to fuel to cattle , to skirt Israel 's economic blockade .
Armed groups , notably Hamas , also operate more secret tunnels to bring in weapons and these are often targeted by Israeli jets .
After Israel 's three - week war in Gaza last January the US said it would provide technical and intelligence assistance to Egypt to stop weapons smuggling into the strip .
Egypt 's new wall will be about six miles long and " impossible to cut or melt " , the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz said .
It said construction had already begun and that large slates of steel would eventually be buried into the ground .
Joint Egyptian - American patrols had been seen on the Egyptian side of the border , it said .
Other reports said it would take 18 months to build .
But Egyptian officials have not spoken publicly about the plan , saying they can do enough to halt smuggling without a wall .
Since Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005 , Egypt has been allowed to deploy 750 lightly armed border guards in the northern Sinai to patrol the Gaza border .
But since Hamas won Palestinian elections in early 2006 Israel has tightened an economic blockade on the strip that has now spawned a vast smuggling industry .
The tunnels are dug deep and reinforced by wooden batons .
Their entrances , under large tents , can be seen dotted along the Gazan side of the border .
Hamas , which controls Gaza , effectively licenses the tunnels , providing electricity , taking a tax on smuggled goods and banning the import of drugs , alcohol and cigarettes .
Egypt is reluctant to take on full responsibility for Gaza 's future and is under US and Israeli pressure to halt weapons smuggling .
Shortly after Barack Obama was inaugurated in January , just after the Gaza war , he promised help to Egypt to stop smuggling .
In early 2008 the US gave $ 23 m in military aid to the Egyptians to stop the tunnels , sending in a team from the engineer corps to advise and train in several techniques , including ground - penetrating radar .
Another plan was to build a deep canal along the border to prevent tunnelling .

In the words of experts who understand more about this stuff than " OMG so pretty ! " :
The massive , young stellar grouping , called R136 , is only a few million years old and resides in the 30 Doradus Nebula , a turbulent star - birth region in the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) , a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way .
There is no known star - forming region in our galaxy as large or as prolific as 30 Doradus .
Many of the diamond - like icy blue stars are among the most massive stars known .
Several of them are over 100 times more massive than our Sun .
These hefty stars are destined to pop off , like a string of firecrackers , as supernovas in a few million years .

This shot ( full , massive size can be found here ) were taken between October 20th and 27th of this year by Hubble 's Wide Field Camera 3 .
The blue lights are from the hottest , biggest stars , while the green is oxygen and the red is hydrogen .
Whoa , you guys .
Whoa .

CLEVELAND 
After the third police station in a row refused to take a missing - person report about her niece two years ago , Sandy Drain took matters into her own hands .
She organized search parties to comb abandoned houses .
She got neighborhood children to help post fliers on light poles .
She recruited a national advocacy group for missing persons to host a rally .
She even hired a psychic to look for clues in her niece ’s apartment .
“ It was pretty obvious the police were n’t going to help us , ” said Ms. Drain , 65 , who added that the police began seriously investigating the case of her niece , Gloria Walker , only after Ms. Drain ’s initial efforts prompted the news media to begin asking questions .
“ If you ’re from this neighborhood , you come to expect that , ” Ms. Drain said .
Her desperation and anger have grown here on Cleveland ’s gritty east side since the police last week arrested Anthony Sowell , a convicted sex offender who has been charged with multiple counts of murder after 11 decomposing bodies were discovered in his house and backyard .
Ridiculous KJV Bible Corrections :
Christmas Trees
by John Hinton , Ph.D .
jhinton@post.harvard.edu
Note :
The author realizes that many sincere Bible - believing Christians due to family pressures , or due to being unaware of the truth behind Christmas , observe at least some of the customs of the holiday , such as gift giving , and do so with the intent of keeping Jesus in mind .
This is not intended as a critique against Christians who have not abandoned every aspect of Christmas .
This is a critique of those who mistranslate the Bible , or use mistranslated Bibles , for the purpose of promoting paganism as expressed in the rituals of Christmas .
Jeremiah 10:2 KJV
Thus saith the LORD , Learn not the way of the heathen , and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven ; for the heathen are dismayed at them .
3 * For the customs of the people are vain : for one cutteth a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman , with the axe .
4 * They deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it move not .
5
They are upright as the palm tree , but speak not : they must needs be borne , because they can not go .
Be not afraid of them ; for they cannot do evil , neither also is it in them to do good .
There was a time when the pagan holiday known as Christmas had actual Christian overtones .
This is no longer the case .
The modern holiday no longer had anything at all to do with Jesus .
Today it is a time for racking up large credit card debts , lying to children about Santa Clause , teaching them commercialism and materialism , singing songs about glow - in - the - dark reindeers , and for gouging at one 's neighbor while fighting the Christmas crowds and traffic .
One can go through a drug store card rack and not find a single Christmas card that even mentions our Lord , and manger scenes are being outlawed .
Christmas originated as a way to celebrate a pagan holiday by disguising it as a Christian one .
Now Satan Clause , flying reindeer , mistletoe , and Christmas trees are all methods to remove Christ entirely from the holiday and return it to its pure pagan roots .
This verse from Jeremiah is one of the most prophetic verses in the Bible in regard to modern times .
It is a clear and glaring warning against this pagan holiday and the wicked time of commercialism and materialism that it has become .
The Christmas tree is a blatant affront to God , but many , if not most , professed Christians put one up .
Most that do not , do not because it is inconvenient , not because they are convicted by the Bible .
The modern perversions hide this warning by perverting this passage by disguising the adorned tree as an ordinary idol .
I have seen many Christmas trees through the windows of churches all across America , even Baptist churches .
This is as strong a statement that they could make about what kind of church they are , and should be a warning to all with any spiritual discernment at all .
The International Children 's Bible does not want poor little Christian children of being involved with the fun of celebrating the pagan holiday like their non-Christian classmates , so they presented it this way :
" The customs of other people are worth nothing .
Their idols are nothing but wood from the forest .
They are made by a worker with his chisel ... "
In order to force this obscuration of the verse they deceive their readers by translating " matsad " , meaning axe , as chisel .
A wooden idol may be chiseled , but not cut down with an axe as a tree is .
What conniving snakes !
NIV : ... they cut a tree out of the forest , and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel .
This pornographers who own the NIV obscure the verse even worse .
Here the tree is cut down and then it is carved as an idol .
This requires an axe and a chisel both when there is only one tool in the verse .
It is bad enough to lie about the chisel , but to interject both adds a level of incompetence that is mind boggling .
The ever silly Living Bible perverts the verse even more .
" They cut down a tree and carve an idol ... "
The Amplified Bible finds a different way to use deceit to obscure the significance of the verse :
" ... it is but a tree which one cuts out of the forest [ to make for himself a god ] , the work of the craftsman with the ax or other tool "
Or other tool ?
Make a god ?
Where is any of that in the Hebrew ?
The NLT has the following display of foolishness :
" ... They cut down a tree and carved an idol . "
The word that is translated as tree is " ets " , which does also mean wood , so scholars falsely so called can linguistically argue the translation of wood , but the Bible is spiritually discerned , which leaves such scholars in the dark .
The decision to translate it as wood , while inserting references to idols , was made , undoubtedly , by the apostate translators of the new versions in order to disguise and justify this pagan practice that has become so popular .
It should be noted that Christmas trees were not sold commercially in the U.S.A. until 1851 and became popularized gradually .
Before that its history in Europe began with the Druids and Vikings and eventually spread to Germany .
It is the Germans that brought it to America , not the British .
Christmas trees eventually did become popular in England , but not during the Era of the King James Bible .
The first Christmas tree at Windsor Castle was not until the time of Prince Albert and Queen Victoria in 1841 .
My point is that the KJV translators did not translate ets as tree that was adorned in this passage in order to make a statement against the practice of erecting Christmas trees , because they had no reason to at that time .
They translated it that way because they were divinely guided and God ensured that future generations be warned about Christmas .
Of course , they also translated it that way because they were competent translators who knew what the Hebrew says .
It should be added that legend attributes the German practice of erecting Christmas trees to Martin Luther .
It should be noted that Luther 's Bible translates the Jeremiah verse virtually word for word like the KJV , so this legend is highly unlikely .
Luther would have not missed the significance of the Jeremiah verse .
I will never forget listening to a preacher on the radio defend both Christmas trees and Santa Clause fables .
This same preacher , Pete Peters , a member of the New Age cult called " Christian " Identity , had just a few weeks later preached against the KJV while promoting the NIV , NASV , and others ( unfortunately , I never recognize his voice and sometimes listen to him for several minutes until he says something really blasphemous ) .
The connection is a common one .
The perverted modern churches will still use these counterfeit verses to excuse their anti-Christian paganism , but the use of these Bibles still make for a poor excuse .
Even if Jeremiah 10 were completely missing from our Bible it would still be very obvious that these trees are a way to distract people from the Christian elements that have formed around Christmas , in spite of it being a pagan - originated holiday .
In other words , such church - goers are without excuse .
Also note that the ASV , RSV , and a few other modern versions actually translated it more or less correctly .
Those Bible hoppers like Peters who shop around in various versions looking for one that suits their own hearts instead of God 's will are still going to be warned against erecting Christmas trees .
They will have to hop on over to the NIV or another perversion in order to disregard the warning .
If you see a Christmas tree displayed in a church , chances are that that church also promotes false Bibles , immodest dress , rock and roll , entertaining over preaching , and other sins of the modern church .
Bible believing Christians who stray into such places should be grateful to be given the warning .
The preceeding is part of a series of examples of KJV verses that arrogant would - be scholars have tried to correct and showed themselves to be fools .
These examples are for the benefit of those who would like more ammunition to defend God 's Word against the attacks of the arrogant Bible " correcting " modernists .
I hope that some of you find them useful .
Your servant in Christ ,

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2009 December 31
Explanation : Dust makes this cosmic eye look red .
The eerie Spitzer Space Telescope image shows infrared radiation from the well - studied Helix Nebula ( NGC 7293 ) a mere 700 light - years away in the constellation Aquarius .
The two light - year diameter shroud of dust and gas around a central white dwarf has long been considered an excellent example of a planetary nebula , representing the final stages in the evolution of a sun- like star .
But the Spitzer data show the nebula 's central star itself is immersed in a surprisingly bright infrared glow .
Models suggest the glow is produced by a dust debris disk .
Even though the nebular material was ejected from the star many thousands of years ago , the close - in dust could be generated by collisions in a reservoir of objects analogous to our own solar system 's Kuiper Belt or cometary Oort cloud .
Formed in the distant planetary system , the comet - like bodies would have otherwise survived even the dramatic late stages of the star 's evolution .
There 's a spectre haunting Internet service providers — the spectre of the " bandwidth hog . "
But does the mythical beast really exist ?
One telecom analyst is dubious , and he 's calling out the ISPs .
Benoit Felten is a Yankee Group analyst who covers fiber to the home issues from Paris , but his " bandwidth hog " challenge is a product of his personal blog , fiberevolution .
Felten is a knowledgeable voice on fiber issues , and his blog reliably makes for an interesting read , but it rarely takes the adversarial tone it struck today .
Hunting the mythical bandwidth hog
Felten 's basic critique concerns bandwidth caps — not because they exist , but because he sees them as disingenuous .
Carriers can use them as a way to control bandwidth and wean people away from what the marketing department implicitly promises : all - you - can - surf Internet access for one monthly fee .
The caps are sold as cutting off " bandwidth hogs " who use " more than their fair share , " but Felten 's take is that ISPs really have no idea if these people are causing any sort of actual congestion at all .
ISPs " claim that bandwidth hogs steal all the bandwidth and cause network congestion , and therefore their behavior harms all the other regular and peaceful law - abiding users , " he writes .
" And to add insult to injury , they pay the same price as the others !
No , policing and rationing must be applied by the benevolent telco to protect the innocent .
Unfortunately , to the best of our knowledge , the way that telcos identify the Bandwidth Hogs is not by monitoring if they cause unfair traffic congestion for other users .
No , they just measure the total data downloaded per user , list the top 5 percent and call them hogs . "
That is , ISPs are going after " heavy users " simply for being " heavy users , " not necessarily because their usage causes problems for anyone .
Imagine that some of these crazed downloaders are BitTorrent fiends ( not a real brain - stretcher , that idea ) and that they have their client set to do most of its downloading in the wee hours .
At the end of the month , they may end up in the top tier of ISP subscribers even without causing problems for anyone .
So why cap based on total monthly data transfer , rather than capping or throttling based on actual congestion problems ?
Felten does n't get into the answer to this question in great detail , though he does say it 's " actually an admission that telcos are uncomfortable with the ' all you can eat ' broadband schemes that they themselves introduced on the market to get people to subscribe . "
One might also suspect that some companies ( * cough * Time Warner Cable * cough * ) may see low caps as a way to extract more cash from subscribers .
( For ISPs like Comcast , with decent 250 GB caps that are n't exceeded by more than a tiny fraction of the company 's subscriber base , this does n't currently seem to be a motivator for the caps . )
In any event , Felten wants to see data showing that caps actually relieve congestion , not just punish heavy users .
So he throws down a gauntlet to ISPs .
" Here 's a challenge for them : in the next few days , I will specify on this blog a standard dataset that would enable me to do an in - depth data analysis into network usage by individual users .
Any telco willing to actually understand what 's happening there and to answer the question on the existence of hogs once and for all can extract that data and send it over to me , I will analyse it for free , on my spare time .
All I ask is that they let me publish the results of said research ( even though their names need not be mentioned if they do n't wish it to be ) .
Of course , if I find myself to be wrong and if indeed I manage to identify users that systematically degrade the experience for other users , I will say so publicly .
If , as I suspect , there are no such users , I will also say so publicly .
The data will back either of these assertions . "
If Felten is right , then the " bandwidth hog " is an imaginary creature for the digital age , a sort of postindustrial unicorn .
Unlike the unicorn , however , bandwidth hog makes terrific eating ; its bacon is the single tastiest kind of bacon imaginable , shot through with the flavors of 4 chan , the essence of Twitter , and a small pinch of TechCrunch ( warning : it 's pretty pungent ) .
If Felten does slay the mythical beast , Internet hipsters everywhere can rejoice then slap crispy strips of bandwidth hog bacon into their vodka and ice cream .
TOKYO , Nov. 11 ( UPI ) -- A Japanese lingerie maker said its latest bra caters to women seeking to golf on the go with the capability to unroll into a 5 - foot - long putting mat .
Triumph said the Nice Cup in a Bra can be removed and unrolled into a putting mat that says " Nice shot " through a speaker when a ball sinks into the cup , The Daily Telegraph reported Wednesday .

The bra , which contains pockets for extra golf balls and tees , comes with a skirt bearing the words " Be Quiet " on the rear , the British newspaper said .
Triumph releases novelty bras in Japan twice a year to highlight social trends .
Previous releases include a chopstick bra and a mail carrier bra with pockets for letters .
Playing With Records
Haskell has an existing record syntax that works for some purposes , and does n’t work very well for some others .
For this blog entry today , I ’ll try to build a better alternative as a library within the language .
It will have some advantages ( mainly in flexibility ) , and some disadvantages ( mainly in difficulty of type checking , and in having poorer syntactic niceties ) .
I ’m also about 100 % certain that this is n’t the first time someone has done these things ; but perhaps it ’s the first time someone has described them in this way , or perhaps you can discuss existing systems in the comments .
The Current System
Here ’s an example of the existing record system :
data Employee = Employee { name :: String , salary :: Double }
That defines a new type for employees , and two named fields called name and salary , each of which has a different type .
I can define an employee in one of two ways :
chris = Employee " Chris " 0.01 bob = Employee { name = " Bob " , salary = 1000000 }
The first one uses positional values , and the second uses named values .
Both define exactly the same sort of value , and I can use the field names to access their properties
name chris {-
The result is " Chris " -} salary bob {-
The result is 1000000 -}
The property names can also be used to set values .
For example , I can double my salary .
chris ' = chris { salary = 0.02 }
The important thing to note here is that currently , the field names for a record are used in two ways : first , they operate as labels in the syntax that uses braces ; and second , they work as functions to get the value of a field .
Building the Alternative
We ’ll get started with a few language extensions :
{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} {-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-}
To start , we ’ll need some data type to represent a property of a record .
The type will depend on the types of the record , and the field .
A property consists of a way to retrieve the value , and a way to change the value .
data Property rec a = Property { set :: a -> rec -> rec , get :: rec -> a }
Yes , I ’m aware of the irony of using the existing record syntax to define a replacement !
At least for backward compatibility purposes , I ’d like to retain the ability to use the property name alone as the getter function .
I ’ll present this in the order I thought when I wrote it , so hopefully the thought process can be duplicated .
I started with an example .
data Employee = Employee {- name :: -} String {- salary :: -} Double
First , I know that I want a type class , because that ’s the only way that one name can stand for both a function and a named data type like Property .
That type class needs to encode the type of the record , and the type of the field , and also needs a type for the property name to map to .
name :: Accessor Employee String prop => prop salary :: Accessor Employee Double prop => prop
When I use one of those variables , I want it to possibly represent a value of the appropriate Property type , or possibly a value of the getter function type .
To define them , though , I want to just start with the property .
So the purpose of this type class is to convert from a Property to either itself , or else a getter function .
Then , as is often needed with multi- parameter type classes , I need some functional dependencies to help the type checker .
class Accessor rec a prop | prop -> rec , prop -> a where fromProperty :: Property rec a -> prop instance Accessor rec a ( Property rec a ) where fromProperty = id instance Accessor rec a ( rec -> a ) where fromProperty = get
I can now define the variables I declared types for earlier .
name = fromProperty $ Property setter getter where setter n' ( Employee n s ) = Employee n' s getter ( Employee n s ) = n salary = fromProperty $ Property setter getter where setter s' ( Employee n s ) = Employee n s' getter ( Employee n s ) = s
Using the New Records
Using the new record types starts to look somewhat similar to the old ones .
I can either use “ get ” , or I can just use the field name as an accessor function .
name chris {-
The result is " Chris " -} salary bob {-
The result is 1000000 -} get name chris {-
The result is also " Chris " -} get salary bob {-
The result is also 1000000 -}
Setting a value is a little different .
chris ' = set salary 0.02 chris
Not too bad .
This also has the advantage , versus the current record syntax , that it can be partially applied ; in other words , it ’s a first class function .
rewardLoyalty = set salary 1000000
If I want to set multiple fields at once , though , it gets a little uglier .
bobette = set name " Bobette " ( set salary 2000000 bob )
Hmm , definitely not pretty .
Fortunately , since properties are a first - class value , we can fix this now .
I ’ll exploit the very convenient fact that := is a constructor in Haskell .
I ’ll also need existential types to contain the variation in types between different properties of an object .
data NameValuePair rec = forall a .
Property rec a := a setAll :: [ NameValuePair rec ] -> rec -> rec setAll pairs r = foldl setOne r pairs where setOne r ( p := v ) = set p v r
and now the earlier example looks much nicer .
bobette = setAll [ name := " Bobette " , salary := 20000 ] bob
It ’s a nice property that we were able to solve the problem within the language just by virtue of having a first - class representation of the record in the language .
Definition of a new record type is a tad more complex .
The code above to do so for Employee was very ugly , to say the least .
However , this is the one area where we ’d simply expect some kind of language support to help out .
We could build such a thing using Template Haskell .
In fact , it would very nearly not cause any kind of incompatibility if the existing record syntax were just modified so that instead of producing the field names as functions , it produced them as polymorphic Accessor types as described above .
Limitations
This is certainly not perfect , as record systems go .
The Accessor type class requires all manner of type system extensions ( namely , MPTCs , fundeps , and flexible instances and contexts ) , and even so , I ca n’t currently convince it to fully realize all of the types .
For example , take this exchange with GHCi :
* Main > :t name chris name chris :: ( Accessor Employee String ( Employee -> t ) ) => t
Even though the only type that could possibly be used there is String , GHCi fails to recognize this , and gives us a long type involving the Accessor type class .
Hopefully , there ’s a way around this within the type system , which I ’ve merely missed .
Without caution , though , the code above could lead to lots of unintended polymorphism that could result in a serious performance hit .
In fact , there ’s perhaps quite a strong argument to be made that if a new record system is being defined , perhaps one ought to eschew backward compatibility , or treat it as deprecated and eventually to be removed … and instead require that everyone write “ get name ” instead of merely “ name ” .
This eliminates most of the really weird type stuff that ’s going on here , and thereby improves the error messages considerably .
On the other hand , it feels a but unusual to write verbs like that in a functional programming language .
Pattern matching is another very serious limitation .
Since the individual values in a record ca n’t be accessed except by evaluating functions , they ca n’t be referred to in a pattern matching definition of a function .
While I tend to never do this with the existing record syntax anyway , it remains a serious limitation .
It ’s worth mentioning , though , that view patterns alleviate this difficulty when pattern matching on just one field value .
With multiple field values , view patterns can be used in conjunction with &&& from the Control .
Arrow module to accomplish the same thing ; it ’s just ugly .
It would be nice to see a minimal extension of the view pattern feature to get around this by allowing multiple views to be applied side - by - side to the same parameter .
Perhaps something like ( and no , I have n’t checked what this does to grammar conflicts ) :
displayName :: Employee ->
String displayName ( name -> n ; salary -> s ) | s > 100000 = map toUpper n | otherwise = map toLower n
GHC also provides language extensions for treating record field names as unambiguous in places where the intended field can be determined by the types of values in pattern matching .
Indeed , there have been other proposals for type - directed resolution of ambiguous types ; but I ’ve always seen it mixed in with dot - record syntax .
This would need to be a language extension still .
Record punning and wildcards , similarly , do n’t look to be definable within a library .
Whether they are worth recovering is a different discussion on which I know people have varying opinions .
Perhaps , though , punning at least could be viewed as a feature of view patterns rather than of records .
More Fun With the Property Type
There are two more interesting things we can do with the Property type defined earlier .
One of the features of record syntax in Haskell is that data types with multiple data constructors can still be records , and different constructors can provide fields by the same names .
It ’s not hard to see that the same can happen here .
data Person = Customer {- name :: -} String {- , creditRating :: -} Double | Employee {- name :: -} String {- , salary :: -} Double name = fromProperty $ Property setter getter where setter n' ( Customer n c ) = Customer n' c setter n' ( Employee n s ) = Employee n' s getter ( Customer n c ) = n getter ( Employee n s ) = n creditRating = fromProperty $ Property getter setter where setter c' ( Customer n c ) = Customer n c' getter ( Customer n c ) = c salary = fromProperty $ Property getter setter where setter s' ( Employee n s ) = Employee n s' getter ( Employee n s ) = s
This behaves the same way as the corresponding instance would in normal Haskell record syntax .
The treatment of properties as first - class language - definable values , though , opens up additional possibilities .
For example , take this definition of a complex number :
data MyComplex = MyComplex {- real :: -} Double {- , imag :: -} Double real = fromProperty $ Property setter getter where setter r' ( MyComplex r i ) = MyComplex r' i getter ( MyComplex r i ) = r imag = fromProperty $ Property setter getter where setter i' ( MyComplex r i ) = MyComplex r i' getter ( MyComplex r i ) = i
That ’s all the same so far … but , one can also manipulate the magnitude and argument of a complex number as properties .
magnitude = fromProperty $ Property setter getter where setter m c = let a = get argument c in MyComplex ( m * cos a ) ( m * sin a ) getter ( MyComplex r i ) = sqrt ( r^2 + i ^2 ) argument = fromProperty $ Property setter getter where setter a c = let m = get magnitude c in MyComplex ( m * cos a ) ( m * sin a ) getter ( MyComplex r i ) = atan2 i r
We ’ve now defined virtual properties of this record type .
( Yes , it seems silly to do it this way , but mainly just because it ’s silly to define complex numbers as a record type to begin with . )
Typically Mr. Chhantyal , to avoid complications from one - way streets , would park and wait for Mr. Sherpa on busy Broadway , which comes to life early with cabs and service vehicles headed toward Manhattan .
But on this morning , Mr. Sherpa saw that his partner had parked on deserted , residential 62nd Street .
As usual , Mr. Chhantyal stepped out to give Mr. Sherpa the driver ’s seat .
But , strangely , he let the door close and lock .
As Mr. Sherpa fished for his duplicate key , he recalled , he felt the first blow .
“ I could not understand what was happening , ” Mr. Sherpa said .
“ This man , my partner from my own country , he ’s trying to kill me .
He was a crazy man , like he did n’t know me .
He said nothing  he just kept chopping me . ”
The two men had shared little of their personal lives , but Mr. Sherpa had never seen his partner excited or unhinged , not even the one time Mr. Chhantyal visited his home .
He came with a mutual friend , stayed late and left drunk on the homemade rice wine that Nepalis call chhaang , Mr. Sherpa said .
Mostly , they exchanged pleasantries for a few minutes twice daily ; each Wednesday , they went together to Woodside Management on Roosevelt Avenue , passing $ 700 apiece under the bulletproof glass to Sabur , the dispatcher .
The two were from different sectors of Nepali society .
But both came from big families whose political affiliations had made life difficult amid the country ’s current civil strife .
And both left small villages in the country ’s midsection to seek political asylum in the United States .
They were most comfortable speaking different dialects but would chat in Nepali while handing off the cab each dusk and dawn .
As Mr. Sherpa ’s name implies , he belongs to the renowned tribe of mountain people who have helped many a foreign adventurer up Mount Everest .
The Sherpas ’ reputation for being trustworthy and tireless guides translates well to the profession of ferrying people around the more flat  but perhaps equally daunting  streets of New York .
Mr. Sherpa grew up in the Sindhupalchok District , in the Bagmati Zone , not far from Katmandu .
He arrived in New York in 2001 and had been driving cabs pretty much since .
He and his wife and baby live with his sister - in - law and nephew , paying $ 1,500 a month for a two - bedroom apartment on 62nd Street furnished with a small sofa and two junior mattresses on the floor covered with faux tiger - skin quilts ; idealized illustrations of the Manhattan skyline hang on the walls .
Mr. Chhantyal was a member of the Chhantyal caste , which boasts its own proud heritage of valorous copper miners and mythical origins .
He came from a village in the Myagdi District .
Romulus , Michigan ( CNN ) --
A passenger on an international flight bound for the United States Friday ignited a small explosive device shortly before landing in a move the White House called an attempted terrorist attack , a senior administration official said .
Another passenger on the Northwest flight from Amsterdam , Netherlands , to Detroit , Michigan , quickly helped subdue and isolate the young male suspect with the aid of the cabin crew , passenger Syed Jafry said .
The suspect , identified by a U.S. government official as 23 - year - old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , was placed in custody and is being treated for second - and third - degree burns on his thighs , according to federal law enforcement and airline security sources .
The sources said the suspect flew into Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam on a KLM flight from Lagos , Nigeria , and is not believed to be on any " no fly " list , although his name does appear in a U.S. database of people with suspect connections .
He did not undergo secondary security screening in Amsterdam , the administration official said .
The administration official said there was no evidence that Abdulmatallab was a hard - core , trained member of al - Qaeda .
The suspect , identified as a Nigerian national , claimed to have extremist ties and said the explosive device " was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used , " said a federal security bulletin obtained by CNN .
The FBI is investigating , bureau spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold said .
The remains of the device used are being sent to an FBI explosives lab in Quantico , Virginia , for analysis , the sources said .
President Obama , who is spending the holidays in his home state of Hawaii , was briefed on the incident during a secure phone call with aides , and instructed in a subsequent discussion with security advisers " that all appropriate measures be taken to increase security for air travel , " said White House spokesman Bill Burton .
The president made no changes to his schedule , Burton said .
The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement Friday saying that air passengers " may notice additional screening measures put into place to ensure the safety of the traveling public on domestic and international flights . "
Passengers described the brief moments of panic on board as screams erupted and flight attendants ran for fire extinguishers .
Jafry , who was sitting in seat 16G , said the plane was just beginning to descend when passengers heard a pop .
" Everybody got a little bit startled , " he said .
" After a few seconds or so ... there was ... kind of a flamish light and there was fire " and people around the immediate area began to panic .
One woman told CNN affiliate WDIV that a man threw a blanket over the suspect 's legs to help put out the small fire .
" It was terrifying , " Richelle Keepman said .
" I think we all thought we were n't going to land , we were n't going to make it . "
Passenger Elias Fawaz told WDIV that the explosion sounded " like a balloon being popped " and said he could smell smoke .
WDIV coverage of plane incident
Jafry said the incident was under control within minutes , crediting the crew and nearby passengers for the rapid response .
One person was taken to the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor , hospital spokeswoman Tracy Justice said .
" All passengers have deplaned and out of an abundance of caution , the plane was moved to a remote area , " where the plane and baggage were rescreened , the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement .
Passengers were interviewed by law enforcement authorities before being allowed to leave the airport .
No other suspicious materials were found on the plane or in luggage , the law enforcement and airline security sources said .
No other suspicious materials were found on the plane or in luggage , the law enforcement and airline security sources said .
The suspect had only carry - on luggage .
Another passenger on the Northwest flight transferred from the same KLM flight in Amsterdam but officials found no connection between the two , the sources said .
The plane , an Airbus 330 , landed shortly before noon .
It was carrying 278 passengers .
Delta is the parent company of Northwest .

When Sony introduced its new handheld , the company presented it as a step into the future .
By abandoning the UMD cartridge and relying solely on the digital distribution of the PlayStation Network , the PSP
Go was made even more of a handheld platform by trimming some weight and emphasizing mobility .
There were some downsides to this , of course , but this was Sony 's final conclusion and it must have been a well - thought one , since it went along with it .
Still , a lot of fans complained about the lack of UMD compatibility , as the major thing that the PSP
Go buyers lost was access to their previously purchased games .
All the titles collected by fans along the years were rendered useless for the Go , and everything had to be repurchased .
But rumors have it that the UMD cartridge may be back for the PSP Go .
Apparently , an anonymous source told CVG that Logitech might be working on a UMD drive add - on for the console .
When asked about the possibility , Logitech UK stated that it had no knowledge of such a project , but added that it could be something that the US branch was working on .
Of course , when Logitech US will be approached with the question , it 'll probably say that it 's something it is unaware of as well .
The anonymous tipster concluded that , " The only problem is that it 'll make the PSP a little bulky . "
This would n't be even close to the only problem , as going back to the old design will most likely frustrate as many PSP
Go buyers as those it will please .
The reintroduction of the UMD possibility for Sony 's latest handheld would reintroduce all the UMD games back into the console 's library and it would make it the best of both worlds , but the price would be most likely very steep .
PSP
Go buyers have already paid the full price for the console , and a hefty one at that , and now they'd have to once again dig deep in their pockets to pay for a feature that is available in the older , cheaper model .

The Strasbourg ruling caused outrage in the Italian media The Greek Orthodox Church is urging Christians across Europe to unite in an appeal against a ban on crucifixes in classrooms in Italy .
The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled last week that the presence of crucifixes violated a child 's right to freedom of religion .
Greece 's Orthodox Church fears the Italian case will set a precedent .
It has called an emergency Holy Synod meeting for next week to devise an action plan .
Although the Greek Orthodox Church has been at odds with Roman Catholicism for 1,000 years , the judicial threat to Christian symbols has acted as a unifying force .
The European Court of Human Rights found that the compulsory display of crucifixes violated parents ' rights to educate their children as they saw fit and restricted the right of children to believe or not to believe .
' Worthy symbols '
The head of the Greek Church , Archbishop Ieronymos , shares Catholic complaints that the court is ignoring the role of Christianity in forming Europe 's identity .
It is not only minorities that have rights but majorities as well , said the archbishop .
One of his subordinates , Bishop Nicholas from central Greece , lamented that at this rate youngsters will not have any worthy symbols at all to inspire and protect them .
The mayor of one Italian town displayed a 2 m high crucifix in protest Football and pop idols are very poor substitutes , he said .
The Greek Church has ostensibly intervened in this case in response to an appeal by a Greek mother whose son is studying in Italy .
But without doubt it is concerned that its omnipotence in Greece is under threat .
A human rights group called Helsinki Monitor is seeking to use the Italian case as a precedent .
It has demanded that Greek courts remove icons of Jesus Christ from above the judge 's bench and that the gospel no longer be used for swearing oaths in the witness box .
Helsinki Monitor is urging trade unions to challenge the presence of religious symbols in Greek schools .
The socialist government here is also considering imposing new taxes on the Church 's vast fortune , but at the same time is urging it to do more to help immigrants and poor Greeks .

President Obama 's Secret : Only 100 al Qaeda Now in Afghanistan New Surge : 1,000 U.S. soldiers and $ 300 M for every one al Qaeda fighter .
Dec. 2 , 2009  --
As he justified sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan at a cost of $ 30 billion a year , President Barack Obama 's description Tuesday of the al Qaeda " cancer " in that country left out one key fact : U.S. intelligence officials have concluded there are only about 100 al Qaeda fighters in the entire country .
A senior U.S. intelligence official told ABCNews.com the approximate estimate of 100 al Qaeda members left in Afghanistan reflects the conclusion of American intelligence agencies and the Defense Department .
The relatively small number was part of the intelligence passed on to the White House as President Obama conducted his deliberations .
President Obama made only a vague reference to the size of the al Qaeda presence in his speech at West Point , when he said , " al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same number as before 9/11 , but they retain their safe havens along the border . "
A spokesperson at the White House 's National Security Council , Chris Hensman , said he could not comment on intelligence matters .
Obama 's National Security Adviser , Gen. James Jones , put the number at " fewer than a hundred " in an October interview with CNN .
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , D - N.H. , referred to the number at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee in October , saying " intelligence says about a hundred al Qaeda in Afghanistan . "
As the President acknowledged , al Qaeda now operates from Pakistan where U.S. troops are prohibited from operating .
" We 're in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country , " he said .
An Obama administration official said the additional troops were needed in Afghanistan to " sandwich " al Qaeda between Pakistan and Afghanistan and prevent them from re-establishing a safe haven in Afghanistan .
" Pakistan has been stepping up its efforts , " the official said .
" So the real question is will Pakistan do enough , " said former White House counter - terrorism official Richard Clarke , an ABC News consultant .
" What if they take all the money we given them but do n't really follow through ?
What the strategy then ? " said Clarke .
With 100,000 troops in Afghanistan at an estimated yearly cost of $ 30 billion , it means that for every one al Qaeda fighter , the U.S. will commit 1,000 troops and $ 300 million a year .
al Qaeda 's Ideological Influence
Other counter - terror analysts say the actual number of al Qaeda in Afghanistan is less important than their ability to train others in the Taliban and have ideological influence .
" A hundred ' no foolin ' al Qaeda operatives operating in a safe haven can do a hell of a lot of damage , " said one former intelligence official with significant past experience in the region .
At a Senate hearing , the former CIA Pakistan station chief , Bob Grenier , testified al Qaeda had already been defeated in Afghanistan .
" So in terms of ' in Afghanistan , ' " asked Sen. John Kerry , D - Mass. , " they have been disrupted and dismantled and defeated .
They 're not in Afghanistan , correct ? "
" That 's true , " replied Grenier .

How Terrorism Has Changed Air Travel and Security Terrorist attacks and attempts prompt authorities to adjust airline security .
Dec. 27 , 2009  --
The security routine has become just another part of flying these days :
We take off our shoes , remove our belts and empty our pockets .
The TSA inspects our toiletries .
Now , thanks to the latest apparent very close call aboard a Northwest Airlines flight on Christmas day , there 's more to come .
Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the Northwest Airlines bombing suspect , allegedly had explosives sewn into his underwear powerful enough to bring down the aircraft .
The materials went undetected by airport security , and it's only because of a failed detonator that the passengers and crew survived .
So they did n't check his underwear .
Well , obviously .
They do n't check anybody 's underwear .
At least not the way they check , say , shoes .
Even for those many thousands of us who are made to assume the position for random body scan , the TSA inquiry does n't go fully private .
For which all of us , no doubt , are relieved .
Or , at least , we were .
Because what if that guy succeeded ?
Somewhere , right now , someone in authority has got to be considering yet another adjustment to the screening process .
In fact , they already have .
Expect more security pat - downs and scrutiny before reaching the plane 's gate .
International travelers will be confined to their seats for the last hour of flights .
They 're even going to limit personal items that can be in passengers ' laps .
Everyone seems to know about it from the movies and television , but there probably are n't many passengers left anymore who actually experienced air travel when men wore ties and the encumbrances of security were completely non-existent .
" Please fasten your seat belt . "
That 's as intrusive as it got -- until the hijacking era , when terrorists began leading us through a series of lessons on where the holes are , and we followed .
On Sept. 6 , 1970 , Palestinian hijackers attempted to take control of three airplanes and land them in the desert in Jordan .
Days later , during a tense standoff , the hijackers blew up the aircraft after removing the passengers .
The burned plane was the visual culmination of nearly a decade of gunmen commandeering aircraft as bargaining chips or simply to get somewhere .
This is why metal detectors came in to wide use for good .
Security Measures Chase Terrorists ' Imaginations
The 1980s brought another change to air travel .
Pan -Am Flight 103 exploded over Scotland after leaving Heathrow Airport en route to New York .
A bomb hidden inside a radio in a piece of checked baggage brought down the plane .
Since then , all baggage has been electronically screened , and it's why you take your laptop out of your bag before it goes through the scanner .
And then there was Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The hijackers were able to gain control of the planes because they were able to access the cockpit and kill the pilots , flying the planes into the World Trade Center towers , the Pentagon and a field in rural Pennsylvania .
It was the most devastating terrorist attack on U.S. soil .
Now , all cockpits have reinforced doors .
Thank Richard Reid when you take your shoes off in the airport security line .
In December 2001 , he a concealed a bomb in his shoes that was packed with enough explosives to blow a hole in the plane .
Fellow passengers on American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami witnessed his failed attempt to ignite a fuse poking out of his shoe and subdued him .
In 2006 , an undercover British agent thwarted the plans of a terror group to blow up planes bound for the U.S. from Britain .
The terrorists intended to mix a sports drink with a gel - like substance that could explode when ignited by a cell phone or mp3 player .
So now they take the drink bottles away from all of us , and there 's the maximum - three - ounces - of - liquid rule .
But bombs sewn into clothing -- bombs sewn into undergarments , of all things ?
How far can they take the process of going over the rest of us ?
Kip Hawley , head of the TSA during the Bush administration sees only one solution .
" The long term answers -- I do n't see any way around it -- are the body scans that will detect whatever you have beneath your clothes , " he said .
The worrying thing is being always one step behind .
But that 's what happens when you 're chasing the imagination of terrorists , which always are looking for the holes and finding them often before we do .
Only a few hours left to Double your gift
I ’ve been wading through hate mail for the last week after referring to the governor of Utah ’s “ raging ignorance ” on climate science in an AP news story .
The mail does n’t come from defenders of the governor , ( he ’s denying climate science in a state known for , and economically supported by , some of the best powder west of Aspen ) but from the climate denial community .
One of the common themes in the hate mail has been that solving climate change is a plot by East Coast liberal elites to stay employed , push their agenda , etc .
The subtext is that to understand climate science , you have to be educated .
And if you ’re educated , you ’re an elitist .
And that does n’t square with the Palin - populist worldview that running this country requires no advanced training , education , or experience .
Running a family gives you all the skills you might need .
( My response is that solving climate IS about the little guy , it ’s about the common man and woman , because they are going to get pounded by this problem .
Think about the people of low - lying Bangladesh … and lots of Americans of all backgrounds . )
But in effect , the old Buchanan / Gingrich culture wars have , after going somewhat dormant during the last election , spilled over into the climate battle , and it ’s a perfect fit .
The climate denier community is precisely what the Palin - right is today : fundamentally anti-intellectual .
The less educated you are , the more common , the more “ real ” you are .
What you think might be true IS true , because you can back it up with the internet .
And the notion that science has some level of truth or a role in the governing of the country is the arrogance of a secular , white collar , lotioned and collar - popped elite .
It ’s odd that our country has gone from revering education ( my father , who grew up poor in the Depression , thought it was the holy grail and came from a culture that skipped kids through grades to get to college at 16 or sooner ; my Grandfather , a Republican born in 1901 in Fargo , insisted that his grandkids go to college … )
These bootstrappers , who used to represent the core of conservative values , have fallen out of style .
Now , to be a “ real ” person , you do n’t educate yourself , you go into the trades .
Nothing wrong with the trades , mind you .
It ’s just too bad that people who go the white collar route are villified as un-American — because my Dad and Grandpa Joe were about as real as it gets , and about as American as it comes .

Becky Griggs 200 Pound Weight Loss ( PHOTOS , VIDEO )
Becky Griggs is a 43 - year - old fitness trainer from Oregon City , Oregon who used to weight 352 pounds .
That was six years ago and today she is 200 pounds lighter than she used to be and has improved her health significantly in the process .
Griggs competed in a body - building contest this year at a weight of 139 pounds , but admits she is most comfortable maintaining her weight at 150 pounds .
See photos below .
How did she drop all of that weight ?
Becky reports that her weight loss plan was and still is really quite simple .
She eats five small meals a day , focusing on protein , fruits and vegetables .
She totally eliminated sugar and flour until she hit her weight loss goal and now allows herself an occasional cheat as long as she plans ahead and counteracts the moments of ill - advised food choices .
She took it a step further when she decided to become a fitness trainer .
She needed a way to stay connected to a fitness routine and realized the new career choice would keep her in the gym .
Griggs ' story is a major motivation to her clients .
She believes that it is critical for those embarking on a weight - loss program to really believe that they can improve their health with positive mind images .
She also recommends finding a like - minded friend to share positive feedback and provide support during the rough and rocky journey .
Her biggest piece of advice during the holiday season is to beware of the food pushers , especially well - meaning family members .
She cautions her clients to keep a positive self - images close at hand in order to respond with a gracious and heartfelt ' No , thank you . '

Canonical hosted its biannual Ubuntu Developer Summit ( UDS ) last week in Dallas , Texas .
I was one of many open source software developers who attended the event and participated in the collaborative process of planning Ubuntu 10.04 , the next version of the popular Linux distribution .
An important part of the 10.04 roadmap that emerged during UDS is a tentative plan to remove the GIMP , the GNU Image Manipulation Tool , from the default Ubuntu installation .
Although this decision is viewed by some as controversial , the reasoning behind it is valid .
The removal of a niche professional graphics editing tool reflects Ubuntu 's growing maturity as a mainstream platform for regular users .
How UDS works
Ubuntu adheres to a six - month development cycle that follows the GNOME release schedule .
At the start of each cycle , Canonical hosts a developer summit that brings together its own team , a multitude of community contributors , and upstream developers from prominent open - source software projects .
The event primarily consists of planning sessions that address specific features or technical issues .
Proposed changes to the platform are described in " blueprint " pages on the Launchpad development site .
During each session , participants flesh out the blueprint and take notes in a shared document that is written with Gobby , a collaborative text editor .
Remote participants who are not in the actual room can still be involved in the process by accessing the Gobby document , connecting to an IRC channel for the session , and listening to a live audio stream of the discussion .
To understand how many Ubuntu development decisions are made at UDS , it 's important to recognize that the process is extremely inclusive and transparent .
The event is open to everyone who wants to be involved .
The decision to remove the GIMP was made during a morning session last Wednesday called " Application selection in the default install . "
The session itself was videotaped , so you can actually watch the discussion for yourself .
I was there in person , along with a few upstream GNOME developers and many members of the Ubuntu community .
There were also several people who took part in the discussion remotely through the IRC channel .
The reasons for removing the GIMP
The GIMP is an impressive software application and is arguably one of the most profound achievements of the Linux desktop ecosystem .
In our past coverage of the GIMP here at Ars , we have highlighted its increasingly viable status as a serious contender in the field of professional graphic editing .
The GIMP 's strengths are precisely what make it unsuitable as a default component of a mainstream operating system .
Its expansive assortment of rich features necessitate a complicated user interface that is intimidating to inexperienced users .
It is also saddled with a lengthy startup time due to its large collection of plugins .
As one would expect of a high - end graphic editing tool , it also uses a lot of disk space .
Its size footprint is especially problematic for Ubuntu , because the distribution ships as a CD image and has a very limited amount of space .
Providing professional - grade editing capabilities is a goal that is mutually exclusive with Ubuntu 's requirement of a lightweight and intuitive tool for simple editing tasks .
There is no practical way for the GIMP to serve both uses cases .
Trying to adapt it to make it serve as a mainstream tool would only impede its ability to advance towards its goal of providing a top - notch tool for professionals .
The GIMP developers who have expressed views on the subject seem to agree with Ubuntu 's plan .
Sven Neumann , a respected GIMP developer and the author of the GIMP Pocket Reference , voiced approval on the GIMP developer mailing list .
" That is pretty much in - line with our product vision .
GIMP is a high - end application for professionals .
It is not the tool that you would advise every user to use for their casual photo editing , " he wrote .
Even though I personally run the GIMP on a very regular basis to create images for my articles , I only use and understand a slim fraction of its capabilities .
I suspect that this is common among regular users .
There is a clear need for a lighter editing program that will start faster and eschew features that are unnecessary for a majority of users .
F - Spot for editing
Consensus emerged very quickly during the UDS session that GIMP does not belong in the default Ubuntu installation .
The important question , however , is what to offer as a replacement for the most frequently used features of the GIMP .
There does n't seem to be an abundance of lightweight alternatives .
The F - Spot photo manager has been identified as the most likely path to a viable solution .
F - Spot , which is already included in Ubuntu , has basic editing features such as cropping and color adjustment .
It also has popular photo fix - up capabilities like support for red - eye reduction .
The downside of using F - Spot as the primary image editor is that its management mode , where the editing features are accessible , is a bit too heavy for users who just want to do quick in - place editing of a single image .
F - Spot has a special view mode that allows it to be used without the overhead of its iPhoto - like management tools .
The editing features , however , were not previously accessible in this mode .
Fortunately , the F - Spot community has already stepped up and done the work .
After learning of Ubuntu 's plans for 10.04 , F - Spot contributor Stephane Delcroix made it work in only an hour and a half of coding .
He demonstrated the change in a blog entry published yesterday .
" I plugged the main F - Spot editors inside the single view mode .
And that worked quite well , " he wrote .
" Of course , F - Spot editors are nowhere close to Gimp's , and do n't even aim to .
But they cover 90 % of your daily usage and are ( probably ) simpler to use than Gimp .
And even more , you can write ( read contribute ) some additional ones in very few lines of code . "
Delcroix has made it possible to use the editing features directly from the lightweight viewing mode , making F - Spot into an ideal mainstream alternative to the GIMP for basic editing tasks .
There are still a handful of important features — such as support for resizing , simple painting , and text annotation — that still need to be added , but the system itself is pretty solid and appears to be easy to extend .
If they can improve it to the point where it is an effective tool to make lolcats , then I think that will indicate that it is good enough to support most mainstream use cases .
Still easy to get the GIMP
Some of the people who are criticizing the decision to remove the GIMP from the default installation seem to be confused about what that actually means .
It 's important to understand that the GIMP will still be in Ubuntu 's repositories where it will be easily accessible to users who want to install it through the package management system .
Although it wo n't be installed automatically on every new Ubuntu system , it will still be available through Ubuntu 's Software Center .
It 's also important to note that it wo n't be removed during software upgrades .
Users who have Ubuntu installed today and eventually move to 10.04 by using the software upgrade process will still have the GIMP installed .
There are also some ways that it can be made more visible to users who might benefit from its capabilities .
For example , it would still likely be shipped with Ubuntu Studio , a derivative that focuses on multimedia capabilities .
There was also some discussion about making a special area of the new Software Center to promote good and popular applications that are n't installed by default , including the GIMP .
Decisions
A number of other things were discussed during the session in relation to the GIMP removal issue .
Participants talked about alternate image viewing and editing tools that could possibly be adopted to replace F - Spot , including Shotwell and GThumb .
We also contemplated the possibility of dropping the EOG viewing tool and using F - Spot for that too .
We determined that F - Spot is the most comprehensive photo management tool , but EOG is still a better stand - alone image viewer .
EOG will continue to be used by default as the image viewer , but it will supply a menu option that will launch F - Spot 's viewer to be used for editing .
In addition to image decisions , we also evaluated a number of other applications for potential inclusion .
The Ubuntu community wants the distro to ship with a lightweight video editor , which led to a discussion about Pitivi , which has been tentatively tapped for inclusion .
There are some concerns about Pitivi 's maturity and suitability , but it 's generally a pretty good application .
Developer Edward Hervey has responded to some of those concerns in a blog entry this week .
There seem to be some people who think that Ubuntu is " swapping " GIMP for Pitivi .
It 's important to understand that the decisions are largely unrelated .
The goal is to offer a diverse set of basic applications to fulfill mainstream usage requirements .
Adding Pitivi to the mix certainly contributes to that as handheld flip cams are becoming more popular .
Games to include by default were discussed extensively , but there have n't been any major decisions made in that area yet .
There is strong consensus in favor of games that have support for collaboration and network multiplayer functionality .
My own program — an open source microblogging client called Gwibber — has been tentatively approved , though it will need some serious bugfixing to meet the high standards of robustness that are implied by an LTS release .
For more details about the default application decisions , I encourage interested community members to read the blueprint notes and check out the video of the session .
I think that when people take a step back and objectively assess the implications of removing the GIMP from the default installation , they will see that it is really the right decision .
I also think that the decision was made in a very open and constructive way .

QUEENSLAND police have launched an internal investigation after officers drove over a woman sleeping in a Townsville park .
Their vehicle was driving off - road in Central Park on Dean Street when it ran over a 40 - year - old indigenous woman who was lying on the ground about 2.55 pm AEST yesterday .
A police spokeswoman said at the time the officers were responding to a call when their vehicle accidentally struck the woman .
The officers administered first aid on the woman , who is understood to have suffered leg injuries , before she was taken to Townsville General Hospital .
The driver of the police vehicle was breath tested and returned a negative blood alcohol reading .
An officer from the QPS Ethical Standards Command is on his way Townsville , and the Crime and Misconduct Commission has been informed of the incident .
I ’ve just read a fascinating study in the journal Traffic Injury Prevention ( yes ladies , I got it going on ) that looked at which characteristics predicted the number of traffic deaths in particular American states .
The single biggest predictor was not statewide alcohol problems , safety belt use , number of older drivers or wealth , but the murder rate .
The researcher , psychologist Michael Sivak , argues that this is not because people are using cars as murder weapons , but because the murder rate is a proxy for aggression and “ the same aggressive tendencies that contribute to homicides also demonstrate themselves , to a certain degree , in interpersonal behaviors on the road ” .
In other words , driving style is a way of relating to other road users and traffic accidents are as much a social problem as a problem with road layout , driving competence or mechanical safety .

Only recently have researchers begun to examine how these predispositions , in combination with childhood and later life experiences , shape political behavior .
Dr. Lindon J. Eaves , a professor of human genetics and psychiatry at Virginia Commonwealth University , said the new research did not add much to this .
Dr. Eaves was not involved in the study but allowed the researchers to analyze data from a study of twins that he is leading .
Still , he said the findings were plausible , " and the real significance here is that this paper brings genetics to the attention to a whole new field and gives it a new way of thinking about social , cultural and political questions . "
In the study , three political scientists -- Dr. John Hibbing of the University of Nebraska , Dr. John R. Alford of Rice University and Dr. Carolyn L. Funk of Virginia Commonwealth -- combed survey data from two large continuing studies including more than 8,000 sets of twins .
From an extensive battery of surveys on personality traits , religious beliefs and other psychological factors , the researchers selected 28 questions most relevant to political behavior .
The questions asked people " to please indicate whether or not you agree with each topic , " or are uncertain on issues like property taxes , capitalism , unions and X - rated movies .
Most of the twins had a mixture of conservative and progressive views .
But over all , they leaned slightly one way or the other .
The researchers then compared dizygotic or fraternal twins , who , like any biological siblings , share 50 percent of their genes , with monozygotic , or identical , twins , who share 100 percent of their genes .
Calculating how often identical twins agree on an issue and subtracting the rate at which fraternal twins agree on the same item provides a rough measure of genes ' influence on that attitude .
A shared family environment for twins reared together is assumed .
PackageKit policy : background and plans

Subject : PackageKit policy : background and plans
Date : Thu , 19 Nov 2009 21:29:19 - 0500
I wanted to provide an update to the list on the current thinking about the PackageKit policy issue from the perspective of the people working on the core desktop packages and on the desktop user experience .
There was informal meeting earlier today with Richard Hughes , and myself , and a couple of people who could provide help with big- picture Fedora issues like Bill Nottingham and Jesse Keating , to try and figure out if there were obvious steps to take in the short term .
Obviously there are lots and lots of people who care deeply about this , and there are discussions that need to continue , but with the delay in getting packages built , tested , and pushed out , we thought there were advantages to jump - starting things .
If there was something obvious , then it made sense for the package maintainer ( Richard ) to just do it .
I 'm writing this mail somewhat by default : the people who really matter are the maintainers of the relevant packages , but Richard has gone to bed , and David Zeuthen and Matthias Clasen are on vacation this week .
I 'll try to reflect what they would say ; much of it is certainly my own personal take on things instead .
- Owen
Where the Fedora 12 policy came from ====================================
In Fedora 9 , 10 , and 11 , the first time a user tried to install a package from the Fedora repositories , they would be prompted for a root password , with a checkbox to remember that permission for the future .
( Before Fedora 9 , you had to enter the root password every time . )
We were n't really fully happy with this ; this was basically asking the user to construct their own security policy .
And not only that , but do it dialog - by - dialog , permission - by - permission as they tried to set up their Fedora system and get on with their life .
> From a more general perspective , the end effect of putting up a lot of dialogs :
+-------------------------------+ | | | < A complicated explanation > | | | | Root password [ ] | | | | [ OK ] | +-------------------------------+
is that you are training users to blindly enter the root password and hit OK , * not * something that enhances the overall security of the system .
There is an obvious better way to do this , which is to figure out what the appropriate roles are for the system : adminstrative users , non-adminstrative users , etc. , and let the person maintaining system decide who gets what role .
So , David Zeuthen did a major redesign of Policy Kit to move it from the old " remembered permissions " policy , to a model where users could be assigned different roles .
See : https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-desktop-list/2009-August/msg00103.html
For some more details about how it works .
The idea was that the change in Policy Kit would be accompanied by a default set of roles , and a nice user interface for assigning users to roles .
Unfortunately , with the constraints of time , it became clear that this all ( and especially the GUI ) was n't going to be there for Fedora 12 .
So , PackageKit needed a fixed policy for all users .
For each action ( install signed packages , install unsigned packages , remove packages , etc. ) , it needed to allow , deny , or ask for the root password .
Among the decisions Richard made was allowing all users to install signed packages from the Fedora repositories .
This was clearly the right behavior for the common case of a single - user system , where the only user is also the administrator .
And it seemed pretty safe : Fedora is n't supposed to have packages in it that are dangerous to install .
( For example , by policy , all network services must be off by default and not enabled by simply installing a package . )
The reaction ( why that probably was n't the best choice ) =======================================================
There 's obviously been a lot of feedback on this list and in other forums about this approach .
And a lot of good points have brought up .
Probably the most important one is a bit obvious in hindsight : Fedora is used on a wide variety of systems , and in some of those - like a shared home system with parents and young children , or like a computer lab system - there are some users who should n't be able to change what is installed on the system .
Even if installing those packages is n't a security hole .
The other thing that is clear from the discussion is that we did n't do nearly enough communication about the change .
I think was partly because the changes * were n't* finished .
A rewrite of Policy Kit was n't a feature in itself ; the feature would have been the accounts dialog , which we did n't do for Fedora 12 .
But clearly the changes we did do had some major impacts that needed to be advertised .
And while there are great low - level docs with all the details about Policy Kit configuration ( see polkit ( 8 ) for a starting point to the docs ) , we did n't have the simple instructions for changing basic system policy .
Moving forward from here ========================
After talking things through a bit , the consensus was that we need to take a course that 's conservative for Fedora 12 .
To do something that is safe for almost all uses of Fedora , if a bit less convenient .
So , what Richard is planning is an update to PackageKit that changes the policy so that the root password will be required for package installation .
We should have this out in fedora - updates quite soon ; hopefully tomorrow .
Once we get that out , we 'll also make sure that there is documentation available about how you can configure some users to be able to install software without having to type the root password every time .
In upcoming Fedora releases , we expect to finish both the default set of policy roles and the user interface components to provide the full experience that was originally planned .
Executive summary =================
We 'll make an update to the F12 PackageKit , so that the root password is required to install packages .
What I Want : Rock Band Franchise
by Michael Camacho [ Monday , 14th of December 2009 - 12:47 AM
]
Recently I played Beatles : Rock Band and Lego Rock Band , and while one was looking back at a band 's career and the other was geared to a younger crowd , they both did something that really caught my attention .
They had a story , not just creating a band and playing songs at venues .
You actually had a story to some gigs or had special concerts you held .
I came to an instant revelation at this point .
Why not expand on this when we eventually see Rock Band 3 .
This editorial will cover what I would like to see in the next iteration of the series and expands on these ideas .
I would love to see Rock Band 3 really start you off from the very beginning .
You can still create the four members of your band , but start them off as high school or college kids practicing in their garage .
Who would n't love to start their band from scratch ?
You could have cut scenes of them meeting for practice and silly arguments , including decisions on a band name or even who plays what instrument and the singer .
Your initial set of songs will just be your band practicing to get better .
Even the instruments and clothing available at this time will be limited and stuff mostly high school or college kids would wear .
After practicing , you could easily move them up to playing shows and gigs as an opening act at local clubs or even just playing school events .
Have them make a small amount of money per show , and you could open up the clothing to include shirts with the clubs ' logos on there .
The next step would see the band in a cut scene being noticed by a small independent label who signs them to a one album deal .
Once signed , you could open up more instruments and fashion for purchase .
And when it comes to making the album actually have the player choose how many songs will be featured , between 7 and 10 songs would be a good number .
After you record your album , you would then go on tour headlining small clubs and eventually opening for larger acts for bigger concerts .
Once you finish the tour promoting the new album , depending on how many stars you received while playing the songs , you could gain more fans and sales of the album .
Depending on how well your album sold , you would then catch the attention of a larger music label and sign a multiple album deal .
You could let the player choose between one to three albums for a deal .
Again , you would go about recording of your first major album , you now headline larger shows .
You could even be featured for special concerts and while you would n't headline , you would garner a middle or higher tier slot to perform in .
The star ratings you receive after playing each song would once again influence sales and how many fans you gain .
As sales and fan numbers improve , the fashion and instruments available for purchase expands .
You would now have access to more elaborate outfits ad costume to wear on stage .
This is where the game can really give itself replayability with a story in place .
Once you finish your first major label deal , you can renew your contract with the same label or even sign with other labels .
After you record your third album , whether with the initial contract or the second , you are now a top - tier band .
You will headline every show , play benefit events , and have access to all fashion and instruments .
You will also have access to playing international shows .
As contracts run out , you continue to renew or negotiate new contracts with other labels and record new albums .
Throughout your career - including pre-independent label - you will record music videos , whether it's a cheesy hand held video camera as a garage band , a small budget independent video , or an epic special effects extravaganza video later in your career .
The game will save these music videos and you will be able to watch them with your characters without the instrument and vocals tracks on screen , so you can go back and see your progression .
Since it is MTV Games , it would be great to include cut scenes through out showcasing your music videos on MTV Countdowns and even seeing your band winning awards on the MTV Video Music Awards .
Another great idea would be to be involved in the hiring of managers , roadies , producers and other members of an entourage .
The cut scene would play and show multiple candidates for each position interviewing for the job and afterward you would then be able to choose which you would prefer to hire .
As you go through your career , you hire more people at more positions similar to Rock Band now , but it would be nice to actually see more interaction .
Have a fan club president and you could talk to them and give them letters to send out to fans or special song downloads to a website , and could help bring gain more fan .
You would discuss tour dates and locations with your manager , and make up a calendar with all the shows you will perform on a tour .
To record your album , you will talk to the producer and choose the songs you will be recording for the album .
Even have a music video director that you talk to and choose the style and direction you want each music video to have .
Lego Rock
Band also had the nice feature of a true Rock Den that was fully customizable , so why not put this into the next full Rock Band sequel .
You could put up posters of your band that you create using various poses for members and various borders and other special effects .
You could also purchase upgrades to the den in the likes of accessories , furniture , new room expansions or even a full upgrade to the entire look of the den .
Finally , I would like to see a more dynamic character creator in the next Rock Band game , and the inclusion of options to change more than just face , hair and body height or weight is much needed .
Having sliders to manipulate the many features of a characters face and body would let the player create characters they connect to even more .
They could keep the similar style of the look of the game , but just expand where it is needed .
I know many enjoy the current features that Rock Band 2 has , but for me personally I would like to actually have more control over my characters look and style , and would love to start my band from their first garage practices and work my way up to super star status .
Rock Band 3 has the chance to take everything Rock Band has done right so far and expand it even more to give the players a more immersive experience to where one feels like they control their band 's fate .
Feel free to leave your comments on what you would like to see in the next version of the game , and who knows maybe Harmonix will take a look into ideas similar to these and make the needed improvements for the next title .
" What I Want " will be an ongoing editorial series from me as I look at various game franchises , genres , consoles , and companies .
I will be focusing on what features , upgrades , improvements and direction I 'd like to see them take on .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The Senate passed a historic $ 871 billion health care reform bill Thursday morning , handing President Obama a Christmas Eve victory on his top domestic priority .
The bill passed in a 60 - 39 party line vote after months of heated partisan debate .
Every member of the Democratic caucus backed the measure ; every Republican opposed it .
Republican Sen. Jim Bunning of Kentucky -- a staunch opponent of the bill -- was the lone senator to miss Thursday 's vote .
Should it become law , the measure would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago .
It is expected to extend insurance coverage to 30 million additional Americans .
" We are now finally poised to deliver on the promise of real , meaningful health insurance reform that will bring additional security and stability to the American people , " Obama said shortly after the vote .
" If passed , this will be the most important piece of social legislation since the Social Security Act passed in the 1930s . "
The bill now must be merged with a $ 1 trillion plan approved by the House of Representatives in November .
Democrats hope to have a bill ready for Obama 's signature before the president 's State of the Union address early next year .
Senate Republicans failed to stop the bill despite utilizing almost every weapon in their legislative arsenal .
GOP leaders have repeatedly warned the measure will raise taxes while doing little to slow spiraling health costs .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , was forced to cut multiple deals in recent weeks to ensure the support of every member of his traditionally fractious caucus .
Top Democrats needed the backing of all 60 members in three key procedural votes over the past four days to break a GOP filibuster .
Final passage of the measure , in contrast , only requires a bare majority in the 100 - member chamber .
i Report : Share your thoughts on health care reform
An exhausted Senate adjourned for the holidays shortly after passing the measure .
The health care debate is " about life and death in America , " Reid said shortly before Thursday 's first vote .
" It 's a question of morality , of right and wrong .
It 's about human suffering .
And given the chance to relieve this suffering , we must take this chance . "
Reid ripped the Republicans for their unanimous opposition to the bill , saying he was " sorry to say that for the first time in American history , a political party has chosen to stand on the sidelines rather than participate in great -- and greatly needed -- social change . "
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , argued it is " clear that even many of the people who support this bill with their votes do n't like it . "
Otherwise , he claimed , " they would n't be rushing it through Congress on Christmas Eve . "
" There is widespread opposition to this monstrosity , " he said .
" This fight is n't over . "
Passage of the Senate health care bill , which is projected to cut the federal deficit by $ 132 billion over the next decade , signaled majority agreement in both chambers of Congress on a broad range of changes affecting every American 's coverage .
Among other things , the House and Senate have agreed to subsidize insurance for a family of four making up to roughly $ 88,000 annually , or 400 percent of the federal poverty level .
They also have agreed to create health insurance exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses , the self - employed and the unemployed to pool resources and purchase less expensive coverage .
Both the House plan and the Senate bill would eventually limit total out - of - pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions .
Insurers would also be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history .
However , both bills allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums for older customers .
Medicaid would be significantly expanded under both proposals .
The House bill would extend coverage to individuals earning up to 150 percent of the poverty level , or roughly $ 33,000 for a family of four .
The Senate plan ensures coverage to those earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level , or just over $ 29,000 for a family of four .
Major differences between the more liberal House bill and the more conservative Senate bill will now be the focus of the conference committee that will try to merge them .
Get help with reading through the bills
One of the biggest divides is over how to pay for the plans .
The House package is financed through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy Americans and new Medicare spending reductions .
Specifically , individuals with annual incomes over $ 500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $ 1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge .
The Senate bill also cuts Medicare by roughly $ 500 billion .
But instead of an income tax surcharge on the wealthy , it would impose a 40 percent tax on insurance companies that provide what are called " Cadillac " health plans valued at more than $ 8,500 for individuals and $ 23,000 for families .
Proponents of the tax on high - end plans argue it's one of the most effective ways to curb medical inflation .
However , House Democrats oppose taxing such policies because it would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous health benefits .
Asked in an NPR interview Wednesday if he prefers the income tax surcharge or the tax on high - end plans , Obama predicted the final bill will probably end up with " a little bit of both . "
" Cadillac plans ... do n't make people healthier , but just take more money out of their pockets , " he said .
The Senate bill also would hike Medicare payroll taxes on families making over $ 250,000 ; the House bill does not .
Another key sticking point is the dispute over a public option .
The House plan includes a public option ; the more conservative Senate plan would instead create nonprofit private plans overseen by the federal government .
Given the reality of the 60 - vote threshold in the Senate , however , there has n't been much serious discussion among House leaders about pushing hard to keep the public option .
The Senate " tried to see if they had support for it .
There is n't .
That 's the reality , " a top House Democratic leadership aide told CNN .
" I think a lot of people are coming to terms with that , and I do n't know how productive it would be to bring it out again . "
Individuals under both plans would be required to purchase coverage , but the House bill includes more stringent penalties for most of those who fail to comply .
The House bill would impose a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual 's income .
The Senate plan would require individuals to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $ 750 or 2 percent of his or her income , whichever is greater .
Both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans .
Employers face a much stricter mandate under the House legislation , which would require companies with a payroll of more than $ 500,000 to provide insurance or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of their payroll .
The Senate bill would require companies with more than 50 employees to pay a fee of up to $ 750 per worker if any of its employees rely on government subsidies to purchase coverage .
Abortion also has been a sticking point for both chambers .
A late compromise with Catholic and other conservatives in the House led to the adoption of an amendment banning most abortion coverage from the public option .
It would also prohibit abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies .
Senate provisions , made more conservative than initially drafted in order to satisfy Nebraska Sen .
Ben Nelson , would allow states to choose whether to ban abortion coverage in plans offered in the exchanges .
Individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds .
Nelson said on CNN's " State of the Union " Sunday that he would withdraw his support if the final bill gets changed too much from the Senate version .
CNN 's Ted Barrett , Dana Bash , Tom Cohen , Lisa Desjardins and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .

A curious fact — one that I can attest to based on my own inbox , and is also borne out by more general observation — is that “ Nazi ” is the preferred term of abuse from today ’s right wing .
We get signs saying “ Obama= Hitler ” , not Obama=Stalin .
I get mail calling me a “ dirty Nazi scumbag ” , not a Commie or pinko .
What ’s going on ?
It really does n’t fit , as far as I can tell — and bear in mind the long - running love affair of the National Review with Francisco Franco .
You ’d really think critics of Comrade President Obama would prefer the Soviet comparison .
So is it that given the way Communism fell , not with a bang but with a whimper , it just does n’t seem menacing enough ?
Is it the fact that Communism has just sort of faded from consciousness , while war movies keep the image of the evil sneering Nazi alive ?
Inquiring minds want to know .

Everett plays three roles in the new St Trinian 's film
Actor Rupert Everett says if he had the power , he would ' " cancel " the London Olympics in 2012 .
Everett , 50 , told the BBC he thought the event would turn into " a very expensive disaster " for the capital .
His comments came after Dame Judi Dench expressed concerns that British theatre funding was being siphoned off , to the tune of £ 100 m , to pay for the event .
Everett is currently starring in the new St Trinian 's film , The Legend Of Fritton 's Gold .
" If I was King , I would cancel the Olympics tomorrow , " the actor said .
" I do n't like the Olympics anyway , " he added , " I do n't think they 're very sporting and I think London is already dysfunctional enough as it is . "
" Disaster "
In an interview with the Times newspaper last week , Dame Judi said she was " concerned that they 've taken a lot of the subsidy to the arts away for the Olympics " .
The Oscar - winner called for funding to be ring - fenced , saying she " mourned " the loss of a number of repertory companies .
In April 2007 , Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell announced that the Arts Council England would lose out on more than £ 100 m of its anticipated funding over the next four years to help pay for the London Olympics in 2012 .
" I just think it 's going to be a disaster , a very expensive disaster , " said Everett .
St Trinian's : The Legend of Fritton 's Gold opens in the UK on Friday .
Rogers : Fed Following in Path of Dodo
December 14 , 2009 at 2:00 am
Jimmy Rogers , the bow - tie boss of Rogers Holdings and past co-founder of the successful Quantum Fund with George Soros , is no stranger to making outrageous predictions .
His latest prophetic assessment is the Federal Reserve Bank is on the path of the Dodo bird to extinction :
“ Do n’t worry – the Fed is going to abolish itself .
Between Bernanke and Greenspan , they ’ve made so many mistakes that within the next few years the Fed will disappear . ”
Given the shock and awe that transpired from the Lehman Brothers collapse , I can only wonder how investors might react to this scenario… .hmmm .
If this doozy of an outlandish call catches you off guard , please do n’t be surprised – Rogers is not shy about sharing additional ones ( Read other IC article on Rogers ) .
For example , just six months ago Rogers said the Dow Jones could collapse to 5,000 ( currently around 10,472 ) or skyrocket to 30,000 , but “ of course it would be in worthless money . ”
Oddly , the printing presses that Rogers keeps talking about have actually produced deflation ( - 0.2 % ) in the most recently reported numbers , not the same 79,600,000,000 % inflation from Zimbabwe ( Cato Institute ) , he expects .
I suppose Rogers will either point to a data conspiracy , or use the “ just you wait ” rebuttal .
I eagerly await , with bated breath , the ultimate outcome .
Is U.S. Fed Alone ?
If the U.S. Federal Reserve system is indeed about to disappear after over nine decades of operations , does that mean Rogers advocates shutting all of the other 166 global reserve banks listed by the Bank for International Settlement ?
Should the 3 ½ century old Swedish Riksbank ( origin in 1668 ) and the Bank of England ( 1694 ) central banks also be terminated ?
Or does the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank have a monopoly on incompetence and / or corruption ?
Sidoxia ’s Report Card on Fed
I must admit , I believe we would likely be in a much better situation than we are today if the Federal Reserve board let Adam Smith ’s “ invisible hand ” self adjust short - term interest rates .
Rather , we drank from the spiked punch bowls filled with low interest rates for extended periods of time .
The Federal Reserve gets too much attention / credit for the impact of its decisions .
There is a much larger pool of global investors that are buying / selling Treasury securities daily , across a wide range of maturities along the yield curve .
I think these market participants have a much larger impact on prices paid for new capital , relative to the central bank ’s decision of cutting or raising the Federal funds rate a ¼ point .
Although I believe the Fed gets too much attention for its monetary policies , I think Bernanke and the Fed get too little credit for the global Armageddon they helped avoid .
I agree with Warren Buffett that Bernanke acted “ very promptly , very decisively , very big ” in helping us avert a second depression while we were on the “ brink of going into the abyss . ”
Beyond the monetary policy of fractional rate setting , the Fed also has essential other functions :
Supervise and regulate banking institutions .
Maintain stability of the financial system and control systemic risk of financial markets .
Act as a liaison with depository institutions , the U.S. government , and foreign institutions .
Play a major role in operating the country ’s payments system .
I will go out on a limb and say these functions play an important role , and the Fed has a good chance of being around for the 2012 London Olympic Games ( despite Jimmy Rogers ’ prediction ) .
Sidoxia ’s Report Card on Rogers
As I have pointed out in the past , I do not necessarily disagree ( directionally ) with the main points of his arguments :
Is inflation a risk ?
Yes .
Will printing excessive money lower the value of our dollar ?
Yes .
Is auditing the Federal Reserve Bank a bad idea ?
No .
My beef with Rogers is merely in the magnitude , bravado , and overconfidence with which he makes these outrageous forecasts .
Furthermore , the U.S. actions do not happen in a vacuum .
Although everything is not cheery at home , many other international rivals are in worse shape than we are .
From a media ratings and entertainment standpoint , Rogers does not disappoint .
His amusing and outlandish predictions will keep the public coming back for more .
Since according to Rogers , Bernanke will have no job at the Fed in a few years , I look forward to their joint appearance on CNBC .
Perhaps they could discuss collaboration on a new book – Extinction : Lessons Learned from the Fed and Dodo Bird .

Warning .
This is a rare nerdy technical post more for .
It is about Healthcare XML standards .
I ’ve was kindly asked to testify at a meeting in DC this week about standards at an hour when I ’m normally not awake .
But despite a deep aversion to not getting enough sleep , I was up and on the phone .
What made me do such a thing ?
Well , the discussion was about what actually will work in terms of making health data liquid .
What standards should be used for the integration of such data ?
Somewhat to my surprise and usually to my pain , I ’ve been involved in several successful standards .
One was used to exchange data between databases and consumer applications like spreadsheets and Access .
It was called ODBC and worked surprisingly well after some initial hiccups .
Another was the standard for what today is called AJAX , namely building complex interactive web pages like gmail ’s .
Perhaps most importantly there was XML .
These are the successes .
There were also some failures .
One that stands in my memory is one called OLE DB which was an attempt to supplant / replace ODBC .
One that comes close to being a failure was / is the XML Schema specification .
From all these efforts , there were a few lessons learned and it is these that I shared with DC this Thursday .
What are they ?
Keep the standard as simple and stupid as possible .
The odds of failure are at least the square of the degrees of complexity of the standard .
It may also be the square of the size of the committee writing the standard .
Successful standards are generally simple and focused and easy to read .
In the health care world , this means just focus first on that data which can be encoded unambiguously such as demographics , test results , medicines .
Do n’t focus on all types of health data for all types of health .
Do n’t focus on how to know if your partner should have access to what ( see points 2,3 , and 4 below ) .
The data being exchanged should be human readable and easy to understand .
Standards are adopted by engineers building code to implement them .
They can only build if they can easily understand the standard ( see above ) and easily test it .
This is why , in the last 15 years , text standards like HTTP , HTML , XML , and so on have won .
The developers can open any edit editor , look at the data being sent / received , and see if it looks right .
When Tim Berners
Lee first did this on the internet , most of the “ serious ” networking people out there thought using text for HTTP was crazy .
But it worked incredibly well .
Obviously this worked well for XML too .
This has implications .
It is n’t enough to just say XML .
The average engineer ( who has to implement these standards ) should be able to eyeball the format and understand it .
When you see XML grammars that only a computer can understand , they tend not to get widespread adoption .
There are several so - called XML grammars that layer an abstract knowledge model on top of XML like RDF and in my experience , they are much harder to read / understand and they do n’t get used much .
In my opinion Hl7 suffers from this .
Standards work best when they are focused .
Do n’t build an 18 wheeler to drive a city block .
Standards often fail because committees with very different complex goals come together without actual working implementations to sanity check both the complexity ( see point 1 above ) and the intelligibility ( see point 2 above ) .
Part of the genius of the web was that Tim Berners - Lee correctly separated the protocol ( HTTP ) from the stuff the browser should display ( HTML ) .
It is like separating an envelope from the letter inside .
It is basic .
And necessary .
Standards which include levels or layers all jammed into one big thing tend to fail because the poor engineers have to understand everything when all they need to understand is one thing .
So they boycott it .
In health care , this means do n’t include in one standard how to encode health data and how to decide who gets it and how to manage security .
If all I , as an engineer , want is to put together a list of medicines about a patient and send that to someone who needs it , then that ’s all I should have to do .
The resulting XML should look like a list of medicines to the me .
Then , if it does n’t work , I can get on the phone with my opposite number and usually figure out in 5 minutes what ’s wrong .
Also I can usually author this in a day or two because I do n’t have to read / learn / understand a spec like a telephone book .
I do n’t have to have to understand the “ abstract data model ” .
The heart of the initial XML spec was tiny .
Intentionally so .
I heard someone say indignantly about the push to simplify Health IT standards that we should be “ raising the bar on standards ” not lowering them .
This is like arguing that we should insist that kids learn to drive an airplane to walk to the next door neighbor ’s house .
All successful standards are as simple as possible , not as hard as possible .
Standards should have precise encodings .
ODBC was precise about data types .
Basic XML is a tiny standard except for the precise encodings about the characters of the text , Unicode .
That is most of the spec , properly so , because it ensures that the encodings are precise .
In health care this means that the standard should be precise about the encodings for medicines , test results , demographics , and conditions and make sure that the encodings can be used legally and without royalties by all parties .
The government could play a role here by requiring NPI ’s for all doctor related activities , SNOMED CT for all conditions , LOINC for all labs , and some encoding for all medicines ( be it NDC , rxNorm , or FDB ) and guaranteeing that use of these encodings is free for all use .
Always have real implementations that are actually being used as part of design of any standard .
It is hard to know whether something actually works or can be engineered in a practical sense until you actually do it .
ODBC for example was built by many of us actually building it as we went along .
In the health care world , a lot of us have built and used CCR as we go , learning what works and what does n’t very practically and that has made it a good easy to use standard for bundling health data .
And the real implementations should be supportable by a single engineer in a few weeks .
Put in hysteresis for the unexpected .
This is something that the net formats do particularly well .
If there is something in HTTP that the receiver does n’t understand it ignores it .
It does n’t break .
If there is something in HTML that the browser does n’t understand , it ignores it .
It does n’t break .
See Postel ’s law .
Assume the unexpected .
False precision is the graveyard of successful standards .
XML Schema did very badly in this regard .
Again , CCR does fairly well here .
Make the spec itself free , public on the web , and include lots of simple examples on the web site .
Engineers are just humans .
They learn best by example and if the standard adheres to the points above , then the examples will be clear and obvious .
Usually you can tell if a standard is going to work if you go to a web site by the group and there is a clear definition and there are clear examples of the standard that anyone can understand .
When you go to the HL7 site the generality and abstraction and complexity are totally daunting to the average joe .
It certainly confuses me .
And make no mistakes .
Engineers are average joes with tight time deadlines .
They are mostly not PhD’s .
Let ’s be honest , a lot of standards are written for purposes other than promoting interoperability .
Some exist to protect legacy advantages or to create an opportunity to profit from proprietary intellectual property .
Others seem to take on a life of their own and seem to exist solely to justify the continued existence of the standards body itself or to create an opportunity for the authors to collect on juicy consultant fees explaining how the standard is meant to work to the poor saps who have to implement it .
I think we can agree that , whatever they are , those are usually not good standards .
Health data interoperability is far too important an issue to let fall victim to such an approach .

The Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war is a week old and even at this very early stage it appears that its chief victim could be Tony Blair , the man who has so successfully prevented the mud sticking to him hitherto .
The questioning may have been gentle , but one after another , the top civil servants of the time have plunged the knife in to the former prime minister , sometimes brutally , sometimes with a surgeon 's finesse .
Whenever the question of responsibility for the war arose , they were clear that it was not theirs .
Which is the constitutional truth .
Their duty as civil servants is to execute the policies of the elected government , not , for all the fun and games of Yes , Minister , to thwart them .
Whether or not Tony Blair eventually emerges with the blame he has so long escaped , however , the inquiry is fast producing another candidate for chief loser .
This one may be a bit more nebulous than the very distinct figure of our former prime minister .
But if anything looks likely to come out of the Iraq inquiry even more sullied than Mr Blair 's reputation , it is the " special relationship " between Britain and the United States .
If this happens , the implications for British policy and Britain 's image of itself would be profound .
Now some will argue that the " special relationship " was always a fiction , created and perpetuated by the British after the Second World War to cover the loss of empire .
But it is difficult to deny that for decades there was genuinely something there .
A fellow feeling , a shared sense of loyalty , all the assumptions now defined as " values " were bound up in it , even before you cite the exchange of intelligence so cherished by the relevant agencies .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This relationship has , of course , had its ups and downs – including Harold Wilson 's decision not to send troops to Vietnam , the US invasion of Grenada without Britain 's say - so , and the policy – fronted by Washington 's then ambassador to the UN , Jeane Kirkpatrick – to keep US links to Latin America open during the Falklands war .
But this little episode also illustrated the ambiguities of the " special relationship " .
Even as Ms Kirkpatrick and others strove to push Britain to negotiate with Argentina , the President and the Prime Minister – Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher – were deep in their mutually admiring love - in .
And what national leader other than Mrs Thatcher could have warned George Bush senior not to " go wobbly " after Iraq invaded Kuwait ?
A generation on , the Iraq inquiry is showing , in merciless detail , how much has changed .
What the early days of the Chilcot proceedings have exposed – far more than any misguided messianism on the part of Mr Blair , or any falling away of senior civil servants – is that the Reagan - Thatcher days are long gone , and that any attempt , by anyone , to see the Bush - Blair relationship in a similar light is a delusion .
This is not primarily a matter of personalities , though of both George Bush and Tony Blair it might be said respectively that they were no Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher .
The " special relationship " , such as it was , could transcend personality .
It is because the context by 2001 , and particularly after 9/11 , was quite different .
The power and wealth relationship had been skewed many times over to the US advantage , while the ideological gap yawned as wide as the Atlantic .
The most striking story of the first days of the Chilcot Inquiry relates to the scale of the misunderstandings , disagreements and , above all , conflicts of interest and approaches that have been revealed between two countries that see themselves as close allies .
Nor was this primarily a result of poor communication .
Yesterday 's witness , Mr Blair 's foreign policy adviser , Sir David Manning , explicitly denied that there was any real difficulty in transatlantic communications .
Both he and Mr Blair and Mr Blair 's chief of staff appear to have had as much direct access to the White House and State Department as they could use .
The difficulty was that the United States and the British government , even under its abjectly pro-American Prime Minister , were actually saying very different things .
Sir David Manning again : " For the US , regime change [ in Iraq ] could lead to disarmament ; for the UK , disarmament could lead to regime change . "
It fell to Sir Jeremy Greenstock , then our man at the UN , to try to conjure up a semblance of unanimity not only between the US and overtly reluctant warriors , such as France and Russia , but between the US and Britain as well .
His skill in steering Resolution 1441 through the Security Council seemed a high point of his career at the time .
But it could – as he now admits – also be seen as diplomacy " being too clever for its own good " .
There simply was no agreement , as became clear , to Britain 's cost , when his efforts to force clarification on the use of force via the so - called Second Resolution failed .
The differences between Britain and the US – differences of principle , practice and perceived interests – look set to be further exposed .
We have yet to hear about the destructive aftermath of the invasion , but when we do , all the evidence from recently leaked documents is that the quarrelling between the two capitals grew ever more acute .
Mr Blair may or may not have been as convinced of the need to remove Saddam Hussein by force as Mr Bush .
But what he appears firmly to have believed is that it would be far more damaging to the world 's peace and security if the US acted alone than if Britain stood alongside .
This is the double conceit of the " special relationship " ; first , that Britain 's very presence might act as a restraint on the US , and second , that their interests are the same as ours .
We are now watching the selfsame illusion unravel in Afghanistan .
British policy was stalled for months , waiting on the decision of another country 's leader .
Gordon Brown 's Commons statement yesterday , like his subsequent video - conference with President Obama , were part of a charade designed to present as independent moves that were not independent at all .
The most productive result of the Iraq Inquiry might be to expose how the " special relationship " has had its day and now compromises our national interest .
That might also be the people 's ultimate revenge : to show Tony Blair how he destroyed what he loved the most .

A new poll says more Americans would prefer a tea party candidate rather than a Republican candidate in 2010 .
' Tea party ' polls better than GOP
Should the “ Tea Party ” movement organize itself to run congressional candidates across the country , it would poll better than the Republican Party , according to a new survey by Rasmussen Reports .
In the national telephone poll of 1,000 likely voters released Monday , 23 percent said they preferred to vote for a candidate from the yet unformed “ Tea Party ” for Congress in 2010 .
The Republican Party trailed the non-existent political organization by 5 percentage points , getting the support of 18 percent of respondents .

Democratic candidates were preferred of 36 percent .
Local tea party organizations have sprung up in states across the country , but there is little national – or even state - level – cohesion among them .
Most states have several groups competing for support .
Despite the disorganization , the tea party brand is strong enough that a number of conservative candidates , including Republican California Senate hopeful Chuck DeVore , have tried to adopt the movement ’s message .
According to the poll , 41 percent of all respondents said they had a “ favorable view ” of the so - called “ Tea Party , ” while only 22 percent characterized their view of the grassroots anti-tax movement as “ unfavorable . ”
Thirty - seven percent said they were unsure .
Seventy percent of Republicans said they had a favorable view .
Fifty - seven percent said they were following news about the new movement either “ very ” or “ somewhat ” closely , while 40 percent said they were watching “ not very closely ” or “ not at all . ”

We are sure once you have a look at these photo collection you will definitely say once again 'yes our universe is truly a beautiful thing .
'One of the most identifiable interstellar cloud in the sky , the Horsehead in Orion , is part of a large , dark , molecular cloud .
Also known as Barnard 33 , the unusual shape was first discovered on a photographic plate in the late 1800s .
The red glow originates from hydrogen gas predominantly behind the cloud .
This expansive ( 1 - degree wide ) telescopic view looks out along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy toward the cloud rich constellation Cygnus the Swan .
It is centered on a bright hydrogen region recorded in the 1959 catalog by astronomer Stewart Sharpless as Sh2 - 101 .
The two brightest objects in the night sky appeared to go right past each other last week .
On the night of May 19 , Earth 's Moon and the planet Venus were visible in the same part of the sky , and at closest approach were less than one degree apart .
The dust is so thick in the center of NGC 1333 that you can hardly see the stars forming .
Conversely , the very dust clouds that hide the stars also reflects their optical light , giving NGC 1333 's predominantly blue glow the general designation of a reflection cloud .
Where are the stars in M81 , one of the closest major spiral galaxies ?
To help find out , astronomers took a deep image in ultraviolet light of the sprawling spiral with the Earth - orbiting Galex telescope .
Hot stars release more ultraviolet than cool stars , and are frequently associated with young open clusters of stars and energetic star forming regions .
Staring across interstellar space , the alluring Cat's Eye 1ies three thousand light - years from Earth .
A classic planetary cloud , the Cat's Eye ( NGC 6543 ) represents a final , brief yet glorious phase in the life of a sun- like star .
One of the brightest galaxies in planet Earth 's sky and similar in size to the Milky Way , big , beautiful spiral M81 lies 11.8 million light - years away in the northern constellation Ursa Major .
This remarkably deep image of the region reveals details in the bright yellow core , but at the same time follows fainter features along the galaxy 's gorgeous blue spiral arms and sweeping dust lanes .
Many spiral galaxies have bars across their centers .
Even our own Milky Way Galaxy is thought to have a modest central bar .
What could cause a cloud to appear square ?
No one is quite sure .
The star system known as MWC 922 , however , appears to be imbedded in a cloud with just such a shape .
Higher than the highest mountain , higher than the highest airplane , lies the realm of the aurora .
Aurora rarely reach below 60 kilometers , and can range up to 1000 kilometers .
If you traveled to the Moon 's near side , you could see the same event as a solar eclipse , with the disk of our fair planet Earth completely blocking out the Sun .

The most comprehensive study to date of the proteins in a species of salamander that can regrow appendages may provide important clues to how similar regeneration could be induced in humans .
Researchers at the School of Science at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis and colleagues investigated over three hundred proteins in the amputated limbs of axolotls , a type of salamander that has the unique natural ability to regenerate appendages from any level of amputation , with the hope that this knowledge will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that allow limbs to regenerate .
" In some ways this study of the axoltol 's proteins was a fishing expedition .
Fishing expedition can be a derogatory term in biology but for us it was positive , since we caught some important " fish " that enable us to formulate hypotheses as to how limb regeneration occurs , " said David L. Stocum , Ph.D. , professor of biology and director of the Indiana University Center for Regenerative Biology and Medicine , both in the School of Science at IUPUI , who led the study .
" Comparison of these proteins to those expressed in the amputated frog limb , which regenerates poorly , will hopefully allow us to determine how we might enhance limb regeneration in the frog and ultimately in humans , Dr. Stocum said .
With few exceptions -- notably the antlers of moose , deer and their close relatives , the tips of the fingers and toes of humans and rodents , and the ear tissue of certain strains of mice and rabbits -- the appendages of mammals do not regenerate after amputation .
Limb regeneration in the axolotl occurs when undifferentiated cells accumulate under the wound epidermis at the amputation site , a process known as the establishment of a blastema .
These cells are derived by the reprogramming of differentiated cells to a less specialized state , and from resident stem cells .
" We found proteins that point to several areas that need to be studied closely to give us vital information about the mechanisms that operate to form a blastema that then goes on to regenerate the missing parts of the limb , " said Dr. Stocum , an internationally respected cell and developmental biologist who has studied limb regeneration for over three decades .
Investigating the proteins found in the axolotl limb , the researchers noted three findings that appear to have significance in reprogramming cells to grow new limbs :
Quantities of enzymes involved in metabolism decreased significantly during the regeneration process .
There were many proteins that helped cells avoid cell death .
Because amputation is very traumatic , this is critical .
A protein which appears to keep cells from dividing until they are fully dedifferentiated and reprogrammed to begin forming a new limb was expressed at high levels throughout blastema formation .
Findings were published online in the journal Biomedical Central Biology on November 30 ( BMC Biology 7:83 , 2009 ) .
Co-authors of the study , which was funded by the W. M. Keck Foundation , are Nandini Rao , Ph.D. and graduate student Behnaz Saranjami of the School of Science ; graduate student Deepali Jhamb and Mathew Palakal , Ph.D. of the IU School of Informatics ; Fengyu Song , D.D.S. , M.S. , Ph.D. of the IU School of Dentistry ; Mu Wang , Ph.D. and Michael W.

For more than a decade , Dr. Earl B. Bradley was a trusted fixture of the small coastal town of Lewes , Del. , seeing thousands of children at a private practice he called BayBees Pediatrics .
On Wednesday , an official from the state attorney general ’s office said that Dr. Bradley might have raped or molested as many as 100 children over the last 11 years , and the police scrambled to identify victims seen on videos that they say the doctor made of the assaults .
They also began contacting law enforcement agencies in Florida , New Jersey and Pennsylvania , where they believe the doctor may have also seen patients .
Last week , Dr. Bradley , 56 , was charged with molesting or raping at least seven patients , including some infants .
A court hearing in the case was canceled Wednesday because Dr. Bradley had been placed on suicide watch .
“ We are acting as quickly as possible , ” the attorney general , Joseph R. Biden III , said Wednesday at a news conference .

What does it mean to sponsor a wreath ?
It means you ’ll honor an American hero at one of more than 1,200 locations nationwide this year on Wreaths Across America Day .
It ’s a day that ’s been set aside to lay wreaths at the places where we remember , honor and teach about our veterans : cemeteries , monuments , parks …
Anywhere we can pay tribute to their sacrifices .
We ca n’t do that without your support , though .
Your sponsorship will ensure that a wreath is hand - crafted of all - American balsam and hand - tied with a red velvet bow here in Columbia Falls , Maine .
It will then be sent to one of our participating locations , where a volunteer will place it on the marker of a fallen hero .
That volunteer will then “ say their name ” to ensure that the legacy of duty , service and sacrifice of that veteran is never forgotten .
So , what does it mean to sponsor a wreath ?
It means you have the opportunity to join a grateful nation in saying “ thank you ” to our veterans .
* Please Note : Specific locations designated as " ceremonial - only " accept a limited number of sponsorships .
Any additional sponsorships received beyond those used for the ceremony will be distributed to other locations .

It is especially important for people to consider their environmental impact at this festive time of year , when recent studies have shown that UK householders throw away over 15 % more waste than at any other time of the year .
Its become second nature that most people recycle their old cardboard boxes , wrapping paper and Christmas cards but people are still unaware that they can do the same with old or unwanted electrical products .
Old mobile phones and other items such as MP3 players , iPods , cameras and games consoles can now be recycled online for cash payments at popular recycling sites , Mobile Phone Xchange or Greentec .
So remember once you have written your thank you letter to Father Christmas , make sure you get your old electrical items in the post not only to help the environment but to get some extra cash for the January sales .
Other electrical items can also be handed in at local council recycling centres to be disposed of correctly .

Watch This : Michael Bay's Victoria 's Secret Commercial
Earlier this year several critic friends of mine were describing Transformers 2 as Michael Bay distilled to an essence , his vision translated directly to the screen with the aid of several million dollars and as many military helicopters as he could get his hands on .
But now , I 'm not so sure that 's true -- what Bay really wants is to be free from the limitations of narrative , of ratings , and of clothes .
And now he 's achieved that dream in the form of a Victoria 's Secret commercial .
The minute - long ad you see below is n't the first Victoria 's Secret ad that Bay has shot , but dear Lord , it must be his best .
It combines everything we 've ever known Bay to love , from deserts to explosions to half - naked women , and distills it into a solid minute of 14 - year - old boy fantasy .
It 's Michael Bay , presented to you like a Christmas gift .
You have no choice but to enjoy it .
The Pacific Northwest indie label Kill Rock Stars and the tragic , beloved singer - songwriter Elliott Smith have a long history together .
Before he decamped for DreamWorks and hit the mainstream via Good Will Hunting , Smith released two intimate , absolutely stone - classic records on KRS : 1995 's self - titled album and 1997's Either / Or .
In 2007 , four years after Smith 's death , KRS released the posthumous double - CD rarities collection New Moon .
And next year , the label will reissue two more Smith albums : his 1994 solo debut Roman Candle ( originally released on Cavity Search ) and the 2004 posthumous full - length From a Basement on the Hill ( originally released on Anti - ) .
Both reissues are due April 6 .
Tape Op Magazine editor and Smith archivist Larry Crane has remastered Roman Candle , and this reissue marks the first time it 'll be available on vinyl in the U.S.
When the reissues drop , every Smith album other than his two major label albums ( 1998 's XO and 2000 's Figure 8 ) will be available via KRS .
In honor of the reissues , KRS has a nice surprise for us : " Cecilia / Amanda " , an unreleased Smith solo track that Crane recorded in 1997 .
The track is a rewrite of " Time Is Ours Now " , a song from the early Smith band Stranger Than Fiction .

Toronto International Film Festival 2009 — Part 2
“ The Iraq war poisoned the water — you ca n’t undo that , it ’s there forever ”
By David Walsh
3 October 2009
This is the second of a series of articles devoted to the recent Toronto film festival ( September 10 - 19 ) .
Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein
Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein have directed at least three remarkable documentaries about the US invasion of Iraq and its consequences : ( Gunner Palace ( 2004 ) , The Prisoner or : How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair ( 2006 ) , and now , How To Fold a Flag .
( I have n’t seen the fourth , Bulletproof Salesman ( 2008 ) ) .
There are internal links between the films .
In Gunner Palace An uncensored look at America ’s young soldiers in Iraq ) , Tucker ( born in Honolulu in 1966 ) and Epperlein ( born in Karl Marx Stadt in East Germany , also in 1966 ) filmed members of the US Army ’s 2nd Battalion , 3rd Field Artillery Regiment , billeted in one of the late Uday Hussein ’s palaces , as they went about their brutal business of patrolling Baghdad ’s streets .
One of the Iraqis arrested during a raid by that unit during the course of filming Gunner Palace , and eventually incarcerated in Abu Ghraib prison , journalist Yunis Khatayer Abbas , became the central figure in the ironically titled , The Prisoner or : How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair ( “ I am not terrorist or monster .
I am not Dracula .
I am not a monkey or cow . I am a man ” ) .
In How To Fold a Flag , the filmmaking team treats the fate of four members of the original unit , now back in the US .
It is an occasionally devastating film that speaks to the horror of the Iraq war , as well as to its ultimately politically destabilizing and radicalizing character .
Two of the Iraq war veterans absorb most of our interest .
African - American Javorn Drummond lives outside Fayetteville , North Carolina — near Fort Bragg , a major US army base .
The film ’s opening shots take in his miserable living conditions .
He works in a hog processing plant and attends a local college .
The filmmakers note that in early 2008 Drummond had sent them a note , “ imploring us to visit him at home … to see ‘ how I live . ’ ”
Drummond and his friends make no effort to conceal their bitterness over the war .
In an early scene , a young woman , Regina , asks , in regard to Drummond , “ What did he benefit ?
Nothing . ”
Javorn himself comments , “ I did n’t choose to go war … Young kids are dying … How is the war relevant ?
We die for nothing . ”
The film ’s production notes tell us about Drummond ’s harsh life : “ He never knew his father .
When he was six , his grandfather took him from his chronically ill mother in the Bronx and brought him to Fayetteville , North Carolina to live with his aunts .
They lived in a shack without potable water near the fields where his great grandmother picked cotton 80 years ago .
…
By the time he was 19 , he was kicking in doors in Baghdad .
“ He hated the army .
He hated his superiors .
Most of all he hated the fact that even when he left the army nothing had changed .
His first few weeks home from the war , he was brutally beaten by policemen at a football game .
In court , even with his eyes swollen shut , the judge told him to write an apology to the officers who beat him . ”
“ In July 2008 , he learned that his mother was dying of terminal cancer in New York City , so he traveled north to help her .
When he arrived , he found his mother at the mercy of an indifferent system . ”
Drummond is smart , and angry .
What is normal ? , he asks , looking up the word in a thick dictionary .
Whatever it is , he ’s never had it .
His visits with his dying mother are painful .
“ Be a good man , ” she tells him , before dying in 2008 .
Iraq war veteran Michael Goss is a suffering human being .
In 2003 while manning a checkpoint in Baghdad he opened fire , along with other US soldiers , on an approaching vehicle .
The back seat , he later told a superior , was “ full of dead kids . ”
How To Fold a Flag : Michael Goss
Unlike some , to his credit , Goss could not get over the atrocity .
During his second tour in Iraq , as the press notes explain , Goss “ fell into depression and went to mental health where the psychiatrist asked him about his tour in 2003 and started scratching at old wounds .
Mirvet [ one of the “ dead kids ” ] came back .
Within a few weeks he was on suicide watch .
He was put on four different medications , but she would n’t go away .
“ He ’s not sure why he did it , but after they took his weapon away , he cut a video featuring a beheading he found online along with pictures of his wife and kids at a BBQ .
He posted it online , thinking it was a good way of saying ‘ help . ’
CID [ Criminal Investigation Division ] thought differently .
They raided his house at Ft. Hood and they arrested him at Taji — sure that he had done the beheading .
Even when they figured it out , even when the shrink wrote a comment on his chart that said ‘ soldier can have weapon , ’ they chaptered him out of the army and gave him ten days to clear Ft. Hood .
He slept with his wife and four kids in the car .
She left him not long after . ”
Goss now makes a living in cage fighting , the brutal gladiatorial competition , in Texas and Louisiana .
“ The most important part of me died out there in Iraq , ” he says .
“ The army expects you to switch over to normal , whatever that means , ‘ normal . ’ ”
The sequences in which he appears are perhaps the film ’s most affecting .
A third veteran of the “ Gunner Palace ” unit , Jon Powers , makes an effort to win the Democratic nomination for a congressional seat in western New York state , on a platform vaguely critical of the war , but loses out to a wealthier opponent .
A fourth , Stuart Wilf , who figured prominently in Gunner Palace , now works in a convenience store and performs in a heavy metal band .
The production notes explain that “ Four years later , he [ Wilf ] does n’t talk about the war much .
He stands out , especially in a town [ Colorado Springs , Colorado ] of big churches , Rev. Dobson , family values and a sea of yellow ribbon magnets . ”
His younger brother joined the army shortly after Stuart returned from Iraq ; after a tour in Iraq , he ’s preparing to deploy to Afghanistan .
“ Becky , their mother , is sick with worry . ”
How To Fold a Flag : Stuart Wilf
In another deeply moving moment , Pat Colgan talks about her son Ben , who died in November 2003 in Baghdad .
He had told his parents it would be a “ quick war . ”
She quietly tells the filmmakers , speaking of the Bush crowd , “ I ’m angry , at what they were allowed to get away with . ”
The inclusion of Powers , a would - be Democratic congressman , and a brief scene of a rally for Barack Obama , presumably provide some clue as to the filmmakers ’ political sentiments .
Although in our conversation at the film festival , Tucker acknowledged that hopes in Obama might have been an “ illusion . ”
During a question and answer session following one of the public screenings of How To Fold a Flag in Toronto , an audience member noted the hopes that millions had had in Obama , pointed to the new administration ’s escalation of the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and asked the filmmakers what the world ’s population was to do now ?
Tucker and Epperlein had difficulty answering the question .
This dilemma points to the objective reality that there is no way to end the neo-colonial wars in the Middle East and Central Asia , or prevent those now being planned , within the existing political framework — the entire American establishment is committed to the drive for global dominance .
How To Fold a Flag treats the way things are in the US .
Not much is added .
The film is proof that the truth can be told about war , poverty , social inequality .
Filmmakers need eyes , brains , a heart .
Why are n’t more of them making such films ?
It seems elementary .
This is not the final word in filmmaking , but it is honest , moving , convincing .
A conversation with the filmmakers
I spoke to Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein in Toronto .
I first congratulated them on the work .
We began talking about how the filmmakers had determined on which Iraq war veterans they would focus .
David Walsh : What about Stuart Wilf ?
Michael Tucker :
He ’s a very interesting young guy , he ’s pretty exceptional , the way he processes the world .
He has this mom who has three sons in the military .
DW : Yes , it seems unlikely for some reason .
Neither he nor his mother seem gung - ho about the military .
MT : He got into some trouble .
What does he say in the film ?
He was given three options : death , the sheriff , or the army .
And this was before September 11 , it seemed as though he needed to go some place and get straightened out , or whatever .
At the time no one was thinking about the possibility of war .
Of course now anyone joining the military understands the consequence of war , and goes in willingly , more or less .
DW : Apparently the military is having a less difficult time at the moment because of the economic crisis .
MT : People have said that .
But it ’s interesting within the world that Wilf comes from in Colorado , for a lot of young men , the military is still something they want to do .
Something they want to experience .
I think with the war , some of them want it all the more , it breaks the boredom .
Petra Epperlein : Jon Powers had done press with us for Gunner Palace , and basically his whole political opportunity came from that film , so …
DW : He toured with you for that film ?
MT : He toured with us , and then via that film he started getting contacts in the Democratic Party campaign world , and he was encouraged to run .
Michael Goss of course had stayed in touch .
You know , at some point he was suicidal .
We were in pretty regular contact with him , and we learned that he had started cage fighting .
It was pretty irresistible .
DW : He wrote to you , indicating that he was suicidal ?
MT : He wrote Jon and me essentially a suicide note .
Jon managed to find him some help , through another soldier ’s mother , in the form of a priest , which was all he could find in the emergency circumstances .
DW : Did the conditions that Javorn Drummond was living in , in or near Fayetteville , surprise or shock you ?
MT : I would n’t say ‘ surprise . ’
But when you look at how he lives , it does n’t jibe with our ‘ reality television ’ version of ourselves , of American life .
But this is the real thing .
People sometimes get documentary confused with reality television .
We are not very good in America at looking at ourselves any more .
We ’re really good at hiding parts of our life .
I recently saw this episode of “ Extreme Makeover . ”
There was an incredibly poor family , their old house was torn down , they got one of these “ McMansions , ” a huge , garish house , a new ford Explorer — that ’s the dream .
The woman is earning no money and has no means to support the lifestyle , but that ’s the dream …
DW : It was significant that scenes of war and scenes of life here are in that film .
As you say , those kinds of scenes do n’t appear very much in film or television .
That could be Flint , or Pontiac , Michigan …
MT : One of the soldiers in the unit was a kid from Pontiac , we originally shot him for this film , but it did n’t work out .
We ’re almost numb to what we see in this country .
DW : I think films like yours make us less numb .
PE : Well , if so , that ’s a good thing .
DW : What about the psychological , emotional consequences of war ?
You have four people who are deeply traumatized .
You had Timothy McVeigh from the first Gulf War .
What are some of the consequences you worry about in terms of this war ?
MT : Everyone deals with it differently .
One thing about the film , it does n’t categorize people , as though everyone was experiencing the same thing .
One of the most important things is the sense of loss .
Loss of friends , family , whatever innocence there was .
That ’s where the title comes from , and why you end up in a kitchen with a mother who lost her son .
Nothing will ever make it right .
You could argue day and night about whether the war was wrong , or whatever , but when you look at the consequences …
DW : All the mothers are there in the film , I noticed .
MT : The mothers are important .
PE : Javorn Drummond says you come back to what you left , the life you left .
So nothing has changed .
These guys come from such different social structures , obviously the war has an effect , how you deal with everyday experience .
MT : The psychological part is complicated .
You mentioned the Gulf War , but this war is so much longer , eight years of continual war in Afghanistan , six in Iraq .
We have to abandon some of our stereotypical ideas about PTSD [ Posttraumatic stress disorder ] , but what about the pure exposure to violence …!
Michael Goss said it best , you ’re in an environment where you ’re constantly afraid , afraid for your life — he did two tours , others have now done three or four , what does that do to you ?
We have to completely rewrite the definition of PTSD .
DW : I agree it would be wrong to draw stereotypical conclusions , because veterans can draw all sorts of conclusions , including political and social ones .
We fight for that .
Nonetheless , there are some very damaged people as a result of this war .
There was a report in the press about ten Iraq veterans at Fort Carson in Colorado , accused or convicted of murder and manslaughter , rape .
MT : That ’s where Stuart Wilf lives .
We try to be careful about it .
One of our larger audiences is a military audience , we want to capture what people are going through , and not just make assumptions , because every unit is different .
Places like Carson , those guys had deployed in the most severe fighting .
We wanted to show people in a process of recovery .
Like Michael Goss .
What are people doing for themselves to be better ?
We wanted to show people fighting , for what should be theirs , a normal life
DW : A war like this , like Vietnam , has consequences for a society .
They ’re inescapable .
Of course there are global consequences , but also for the society here .
Things do n’t go on as usual .
MT : We wanted to avoid revisionist impulses , which both the left and the right have done .
The right has appropriated the Vietnam war , ‘ We could have won , if they had let us really fight it , ’ etc .
At the same time , we wanted to capture the situation as accurately as possible , as an expression of the times — what are people feeling and thinking and doing ?
So you could look back years later , and say , that was happening then .
PE : Yes , these guys coming back from war , it ’s true , there is a consequence for society .
We know what happened in Germany , of course .
I think a lot of Americans do n’t want to see the consequences , they look at the veterans as if they had nothing to do with them .
That ’s a tragedy , the refusal to deal with it .
MT : The complete disconnect from the war is a big problem .
‘ Oh , there ’s some war mysteriously raging somewhere , that really does n’t have anything to do with me .
No one calls on me to do anything about it , it does n’t touch my personal life in any way … I ’m oblivious that my taxes go to it , that my vote may influence it . ’
It ’s become this permanent thing , the long war , it goes on and on .
DW : Yes , there are certainly people walking around , thinking , ‘ I have a feeling something horrible is going on and I do n’t want to know , ’ but the media has played a major role , politics has played a role , in covering up the truth , in lying .
There is an effort to keep the Iraq war out of the media , to pretend that nothing is going on , and the population suffers from that too .
MT : The reporting is reduced to mere minutes a week .
DW : Except Afghanistan prevents them from doing that , because that ’s another catastrophe in the making .
You say you can discuss the rights and wrongs of the war , but your film , whether that was your intention or not , says something horrible is going on , for the Iraqis , for the Americans , for everyone .
MT : I ’ve had no difficulty from the beginning in opposing it .
The week before the war started we were with a half - million Germans on the streets of Berlin .
The fact that now it has fallen off the map ... this completely unnecessary war has put massive strain on people , has ruined people ’s lives , has killed , turned things upside down — the war poisoned the water , you ca n’t undo that , it ’s there forever .
PE : A completely unnecessary war .
DW : Unnecessary for us , but apparently some people did n’t feel it was unnecessary …
MT : Of course , for some people it was essential .
I think there ’s an illusion that it was a Republican war .
It ’s like this is the way America is .
DW : That ’s not fair to the population .
They did n’t make the war .
MT : The public mindset was there .
DW : There were mass demonstrations against the war .
Not just in Berlin and London , but in New York too .
That did n’t have the slightest impact on either party .
MT : One of my favorite sequences involves the Obama inauguration , because it shows that people still hope that things can be more just , that things can be better .
But at the same time you wonder whether it ’s just an illusion .
Something we just want to believe .
DW : In my opinion , the belief that Obama would do something about the wars was an illusion to begin with , because these are colonial wars , and the entire American ruling elite is behind them .
Democrats and Republicans .
MT : We have this kind of kindergarten way of voting .
Change is possible , but people are lazy .
There ’s no sense that we ’re all in this together .
DW : There is going to be a change , but it ’s not going to come through Obama .
This war has had enormous consequences , which we do n’t fully understand yet , and your film is part of it , your films speak to the truth about the situation , and that ’s extraordinary , whatever we disagree about .
Why are you not going to make another war film , as you told the audience at the public screening ?
Are you burned out ?
MT : It ’s complicated .
I think for us , truthfully , there are so many films out there .
I was close to Javorn , to his mother , I really felt angry about the situation … how is that possible ?
Can people be so cold that they will let their neighbors die ?
A young soldier who fought for his country , and he ca n’t do anything for his mother ?
There ’s this cycle that ca n’t be broken … racism is alive , poverty …
PE : These stories more or less came to us , so we can never say this is our last one .
When we began the first one , our daughter was eight years old , she ’s 14 now .
My god , all of her childhood she has spent with her parents making films about war .
Think about it .
So …
DW : So you ’re going to make a film more directly focused on social life in America ?
MT : I think there are so many stories .
I told someone here we would have liked to make a film about Detroit .
DW : It needs to be done .
MT : There is unbelievable stuff going on .
DW : I hope you do that film .
To be continued
I agree with Obama .
Force is necessary at times to fight evil .
But what is “ necessary ” or “ just ” or justifiable force ?
Obama raises this in his Oslo speech , and we would do well to consider it .
Justifiable force , most of us can probably agree , is that used in self - defense or to stop an assault on ourselves and our loved ones .
And such assault we can define as evil .
By that definition Occupation is evil .
And hence Obama the Occupier is evil .
We can fight back with violence if necessary against evil , and often that is the only way to win .
Hence the Iraqis and Afghanis are in the right to use force against the American Occupation .
Just as the Palestinians now and the Black South Africans earlier were in the right when they used violence against their Occupiers and Apartheid .
And the Chinese revolution was in the right when it used force against the Western and Japanese Occupiers and against the murderous landlord class , which were killing Chinese by the millions .
And so too the Indigenous peoples were right to fight back against the Europeans who conquered their lands , and the slaves of America were right to rise in rebellion against their masters .
The American colonists were justified when they violently threw off the arbitrary rule of King George and his army of Occupation , in the same way as are Iraqi and AfPak freedom fighters today .
Our Declaration of Independence , which recognizes this right , is not a pacifist document , and the anti-Empire movement cannot be pacifist either .
Nor is the average American a pacifist , simply because pacifism does not mesh with the common sense idea of self - defense .
Let us add to that a rejection of the fiction that the US is in Central Asia to fight terrorism .
The failure of liberals and the Democratic Party left , like Progressive Democrats of America , is that they accept this premise , a premise which figures prominently in Obama ’s speech and a premise which is clearly a lie .
Iraq did not have WMD , and the perpetrators of the war on Iraq knew that very well .
So why the war ?
Many strands contributed to the war — the ambitions of the puppet master of much U.S. foreign policy , Israel , to wreak as much destruction as possible on Muslim lands ; the desire to control energy resources so as to deprive the Empire ’s economic competitors , principally China , of these energy supplies ; and the desire to control Central Asia militarily and hence to encircle China and to a lesser extent Russia .
In sum these wars are all about maintaining and extending the U.S. Empire ’s world domination as dictated by official , public U.S. policy to allow no nation to eclipse it as number one .
The war on Iraq was never about terrorism ; and it is not believable that the war on AfPak is about that either .
Both are directed at the Empire ’s economic adversaries , especially China .
So Obama is not fighting evil .
Obama is the leader of an Evil that must be fought .
Evil on a grand scale like war is not something built into men ’s brains but can emerge from great power which is given to certain men , notably the President of the U.S. at this point in history , by virtue of social and political arrangements .
This view of things is that of the radical Left or that of a strict Jeffersonian .
But it is also consistent with Libertarianism since Libertarianism views force justifiable against those who assault us or otherwise do us grievous or mortal harm .
The U.S. Empire has set itself not just against the Muslim peoples but against many of the peoples of the world — including the people of the US itself .
If all else fails in curbing this Empire , the peoples of the world are entirely justified in rising up against it .
The “ left ” wing of the Democratic Party , Obama ’s disappointed supporters , has proved useless or worse in curbing Empire .
The next step will surely be an independent anti-imperial electoral effort , and we shall see whether that works .
If it does not , the Declaration of Independence tells us what is likely to follow .

All that Glitters is not Gold
One of the biggest problems in creating a SF story in any medium is the concessions that have to be made to the medium in which the story is told .
This is especially prevalent in visual media such as movies , games , and comics / animation .
The problem is acerbated for those how prefer SF that falls onto the ' harder ' end of the spectrum , as they lose many inaccuracies usually used because they make the telling of the story easier .
While someone unconcerned with how a space battle might actually look given the technology concerned it is a simple matter to add some glory lasers and explosions , copying what has worked in other franchises like Star Wars or Star Trek .
For those of you that do worry over these details , read on ..
I 'm going to discuss some of the more common elements of space battles in visual SF , although by no means all of them .
For each I 'll try to look at why they are shown the way they are , why they are inaccurate , and how they can be changed for greater realism .
A lost of this sort of thing comes down to the exact details of the setting so I will focus on fairly broad issues , things that are unlikely or impossible given our current understanding of physics .
Who , What , When , Where , Why ?
While you might think that a discussion of physics or technology would be the most important part of this blogpost , there are other aspects to creating a space battle equally important .
If the battle is part of a story then it has to show the story or it is ultimately pointless .
Say you are producing something along the lines of Star Wars or Battlestar Galactica with main characters who fly fighters , and with a story that focuses on the personal element that they bring into the tale , rather than the grand strategy of admirals and kings .
In this situation frantic dogfights with wheeling fighters , explosions , and hair - raising manoeuvres will probably serve the story quite well .
If , on the other hand , your story is about a nation , a war , or a leader rather than a simple soldier it has different requirements .
Tactics will let you explore the leader 's abilities , strategy will convey the importance of certain actions or individuals in the grand scheme of things .
In this case your might want to set your scene on the bridge of a starship , with huge tactical displays , and hasty conferences between the officers .
The answers to the above questions will help you to decide on the details of your setting that facilitate the decision ; things like the technology used , the strategies and goals , etc .
Only then can you begin to work on the visual aspects of the space battle and know that it will support and compliment the story you are trying to tell , rather than distracting the viewer from it .
The two examples I gave are by no means the only choices , and you can even switch between the two within the course of a single battle .
There are also other similar considerations ; the design or a ship can be used to reflect on the nature of those who built them .
Dull colours and blocky shapes can suggest lower level technology when contrasted with organic curves and polished metal .
The scenario can also be expanded visually ; chaotic formations during an ambush , or elegant fleet manoeuvres during the siege of a planet .

Space is Big
Space is called Space for a reason , mostly because there is a lot of it .
Yet in a almost any work of visual SF - Star Wars , Star Trek , Farscape , Babylon 5 , etc. - ships huddle together as though running out of space ; as they are , in a way .
The situation is even more ludicrous when you delve into the lore of the various settings and find out that the weapons involved are apparently capable of engaging the enemy at beyond visual rages .
In anything remotely ' realistic ' this is an almost inexcusable error .
The reason it is so widespread is quite simple ; screens have only so much space .
To show a fleet or a battle in as exciting a way as possible , or to convey the course of a battle , the artist needs to crowd the spacecraft together .
Fortunately the cure is almost as simple as the explanation .
The first is a technique occasionally used in Babylon 5 ; it involves showing one ship firing , and then cutting to its target and showing the impact of its weapons .
Having a planet or other large astronomical feature in the background can help to give a sense of the distance between the opposing spacecraft , and if visible energy weapons are being used colour can differentiate between enemy and friendly fire .
The second technique , and the one that better conveys a fleet , is to frequently show the tactical displays being used by the officers directing the battle .
Since such a display should be designed to provide information in a clear manner it should not be too hard to make it legible to the audience .
It also has the advantage that the display can be used to show planned manoeuvres before they are carried out .

Visible Drive Trails & Weapons Fire
Whenever missiles are used in visual media they are almost always have a neat trail of smoke or vapour to mark their progress , something occasionally produced by manned craft as well .
Likewise energy weapons will glow brightly in all the colours of the rainbow , and even kinetic rounds will glow brightly .
Once again the reasoning behind this is simple , it makes it easy to see what is happening and it looks cool .
Movies and games both use this tactic , games often going on to give fighters long exhaust trails that make their trajectory say to determine visually .
The Homeworld strategy games are notable in this regard with most small ships producing visible trails .
Glowing kinetic rounds , while they may seem the most unlikely , are in fact the most realistic - to an extent .
Gauss cannon or railguns could heat up the projectile they are firing ; simple iron shots might be glowing red or white hot by the time they leave the barrel .
But while they might emit some light it is likely to be so little that combined with the small size and high speed of the projectiles they would be invisible to the human eye .
Missiles with smoke trails also seem to be quite plausible at first .
Aircraft can leave contrails behind them , and chemical fuelled rockets will most likely produce some smoke , although it is minimised in missiles to make them harder to spot with the Mk.1 Eyeball .
In space however a vapour or smoke trail will never form ; with no air to slow and support particulate matter from the rocket engine the trail will disperse far to fast for the human eye to catch .
Energy weapons glowing seems like a pretty rational thing .
They are after all composed of energy and in the case of plasma weapons are utilising a state of matter that does usually glow .
Lasers will not be visible without particles to scatter the beam , the only reason that we can see them on Earth .
The component particles of a particle beam do not emit energy unless they are slowed or deflected , and when this does occur the radiation emitted is probably not going to be visible given the energies involved .
Plasma weapons might be visible as glowing projectiles , if they ever prove to be feasible in the first place ; but given the tennis nature of fusion plasmas , and the relatively small volume of a plasma bolt , they might be very hard to see even then .
The weapons that will be very visible would be things like nuclear shaped charges , although they would also be very brief .
Aside from the fact that this means space battles will never look like how Hollywood thinks they will there are a few other result of this .
You will almost never see incoming fire .
In the case of particle beams and lasers even sensors will not , in the first case because there is no radiation emitted , in the latter because the beam is travelling at the speed of light .
Missiles and projectiles might be seen , but not by the human eye due to their probable velocities .
In a written work this is easy to accommodate and while a visual work might have more trouble many weapons can be given a muzzle flash or other effect to show that they have fired , and energy weapons can have radiators that begin to glow ( although visible glowing radiators are in themselves unrealistic ) .
The bigger problem is that without visible weapons fire it may be difficult to convey to the viewer what the individual spacecraft are shooting at .

Explosions & Damage
One of the most dramatic moments in a space battle is when a spaceship with ' the good guys ' aboard takes a hit .
In most franchises this results in a big gout of orange fire and then , if we 're lucky , a shot of the hull plating torn away from the support structure underneath , preferably glowing from the energy of the shot .
This same ball of improbable fire makes its appearance when a spaceship , missile , or asteroid is blown up , and often on the detonation of nuclear weapons .
The problem with this is that high energy explosives use in warheads do not produce an orange fireball like an exploding car .
Normal high explosives usually produce a nearly invisible blast since it is thermal energy that creates the visible fireball , and most explosive warheads are optimised to produce mechanical damage .
A thermobaric warhead would create a nice gout of flame , but they are fundamentally unless in space .
The explosion of fuel stores , the ignition of leaking atmosphere , and the release of superheated coolant can be used to explain these gouts of flame to some extent , but even then the effect will be far more rapid than inside an atmosphere , becoming more of a flash than a ball of fire .
And even if something aboard the targeted vessel is ignited there will be no billowing smoke clouds , since these too will expand extremely rapidly in the vacuum of space .
High energy weapons such as lasers , particle beams , nuclear warheads , and possible plasma cannon , might leave glowing areas on the armour of a spaceship .
I do n't have the knowledge to judge on that .
I do know that they will not produce big orange fireballs , though .
High powered weapons strikes are going to be a bright flash of light , potentially coloured depending on the materials and weapons involved , with mechanical deformation affecting the surrounding area to some extent .
The extent of the damage and its appearance is quite a complex question , and the best place to get answers is over on
Related to this is the explosive end of every ship damaged in battle , usually with a nice fireball .
Given the penetrative qualities of kinetic weapons , and the soft kill potential of radiation based weapons , it seems likely that many ships could be put out of action with very little exterior damage , at least in the case of larger ships .
Given that real fusion and fission reactors are likely to explode the only explanation is that it is a result of high energy reactors of other kinds loosing containment .
Certainly in Star
Trek with their antimatter warp cores even an small but penetrating hit could cause a massive explosion .
From a historical perspective it was easier to add a fireball back when CGI was in its infancy that it was to do complex battle damage , so that is the reason why it is so common in older works ; newer works just continuing the trend for the most part .

Anything nuclear is usually surrounded by a lot of inaccuracies in any fiction , so it is no surprise that many works do not show nuclear explosions the way they should .
In space , without an atmosphere to produce a fireball nuclear explosions will be very very brief , albeit of great intensity .
Of course the afterimage would last much longer if you did see it in person .
Often in movies and games nuclear explosions , even when they do not produce fireballs , persist for quite a while ; in the real world you would blink and miss it .
The final inaccuracy commonly found alongside dramatic explosions is that nearby spacecraft will shudder as though hit by a blast wave ; yet this is impossible without an atmosphere .
The total mass left behind by an exploding missile , or even a ship , is insignificant compared to the volume of space , and unless the other spacecraft is ridiculously close , or shrapnel is involved , this is not going to happen .
None of the above are significant problems .
They are mostly matters of convenience , of limitations in the medium used to depict that battle , or of convention .
There is no particular trick to incorporating the ' correct ' version of space battle visuals , but it does seem to be somewhat uncommon .
I suspect that it is largely a result of the saturation of Star Wars and Star Trek ; people are inspired by these franchises to create their own SF but often end up with a variation , rather than something that makes more sense on the world - building side .
This is kind of like the ridiculous size of many spacecraft in SF , everyone else is doing it , so there is a temptation to use the exist metric rather than try to make the viewer use your universes internal scale or logic .
The smart move would be for the " party of no " to make a deal where Obama withholds using regs , and in return , Republicans agree to new bipartisan legislation .
They almost certainly will not , so get ready for the Obama regs that Congress will never prevent or overturn .
Despite these and other similarities , libertarians and environmentalists have a difficult time communicating with one another .
The two groups use different jargon and often apply two different meanings to similar terms .
Misunderstandings often lead to rancorous debate with no resolution .
Yet libertarians and environmentalists have much to gain from a possible alliance between them .
Libertarians can gain from the sheer numbers of environmentalists :
More than two out of three Americans call themselves environmentalists ; more than one in five actively work somehow to protect the environment ; and perhaps as many as one in twenty are dues - paying members of some environmental group .
Meanwhile , environmentalists can gain from a strategy that relies on individuals rather than big government .
The time is ripe for such an alliance .
The 1994 election has left the environmentalists running scared .
Up through the 1970s , the environment was a nonpartisan issue .
But the strongly Democratic Congresses of the 1970s and ' 80s , combined with the polarization generated by the Reagan Administration , led environmentalists to hitch their star to the Democratic Party .
Now that the Democrats are out of power , and likely to remain so for some time , environmentalists need a new strategy .
But an alliance between libertarians and environmentalists can only happen if libertarians make an effort to understand environmentalists , to learn their language , and to emphasize the things they have in common rather than the things they do not .
This article attempts to bridge the barrier between the two groups .
The National Wildlife Federation 's Conservation Directory lists close to 1,000 different environmental activist groups in the U.S. , most of which have paid staff .
The Directory omits hundreds of other groups with paid staff , and I conservatively estimate that for every group with staff there are at least five groups that rely solely on volunteers .
All totaled , the U.S. has between 5,000 and 10,000 organizations committed mainly to environmental causes .
The largest groups have hundreds of thousands ( a few claim millions ) of dues - paying members and dozens or even hundreds of staff members .
But most environmental activists believe that the real work is done by the local , volunteer or near - volunteer organizations .
Those groups lead the way in finding new issues and provide the backbone for grassroots lobbying .
In this article , I 'll use the term " environmentalist " to mean anyone who believes strongly in the need for more environmental protection .
" The environmental movement " refers to the collection of organizations that work on environmental causes .
" Environmental activist " is an environmentalist who devotes a significant amount of time to lobbying , organizing , or other political activities for environmental causes .
One of the effects of the decentralized nature of the movement is a huge amount of tension between various environmental groups .
If you think a Libertarian Party convention is contentious , try going to a meeting of different environmental groups .
Groups fight over strategy , tactics , and goals .
Underlying the outward differences is a competition for members , media attention , and funding from large foundations .
Most environmental activists think that the main conflicts are between national and local groups .
In fact , the real tension is between staffed and volunteer groups .
The volunteer groups tend to focus on a single goal : saving a particular scenic area or stopping a particular project .
Once a group has a staff , however , it has a new goal : staying alive .
This leads it to broaden its range of activities and makes it more likely to compromise so that politicians will view it as someone they can deal with .
The volunteer groups accuse the staffed groups of selling them out .
The staffed groups view the volunteers as unreasonable .
Meanwhile the staffed groups contend with one another for members and donations , leading to further changes in behavior and further conflicts .
For all its tactical skills , the environmental movement is strategically inept .
With hundreds or thousands of groups competing for resources , members of the movement have little incentive to develop a cohesive strategy .
As a result , environmental " strategy " is little more the sum total of individual tactics .
Sometimes those tactics work together with amazing success , as they appear to have done ( at least for now ) in Northwest forests .
Most often , the movement can hope to do little more than temporarily stall activities it opposes .
This tactical strength and strategic weakness has backed the environmental movement into a corner .
One of the best tactics for any political movement is polarization and demonization of the opposition .
This tactic mobilizes supporters , draws media attention , and enhances the fortunes of any group that chooses to use it .
For example , in 1980 , two groups -- the Wilderness Society and American Forestry Association - - each had about 100,000 members .
When Reagan was elected , the Wilderness Society used the tactic of polarization , while the American Forestry Association tried to position itself as a middle - of - the - road group .
Within a few years , the Wilderness Society doubled its membership , while AFA 's declined by two - thirds .
Yet polarization carries with it a major long - term cost :
It also polarizes the opposition .
This is a particular problem for the environmental movement , which really had no enemies in 1970 , when everyone from Richard Nixon to Newt Gingrich was an environmentalist .
Despite the lack of real enemies , demonization produced such short - run benefits that environmental magazines railed against corporate America , corrupt politicians , inept bureaucrats , and private landowners for harming the environment .
By 1994 , such demonization became a self - fulfilling prophecy as corporate leaders , elected officials , agency employees , and property owners turned into opponents of environmental causes .
All of these trends were highly visible in 1993 when environmentalists tried to form a coalition to reform national forest management .
The problem , of course , was that the groups could n't agree on a strategy .
So they agreed to a " kitchen sink " strategy that combined all of the legislative goals of the individual groups while pretending to ignore the many conflicts between these goals .
The resulting package had something to anger every other forest interest group : private landowners , public land users , public land managers , state and local government officials , even timber companies that do n't buy from public lands .
It was a strategy that made enemies of everyone but the true - believer environmentalists .
The proposal never happened , but it remains no different from the basic strategy environmentalists have followed in any case .
In saying these things , I am not casting aspersions on any environmental leader or group .
The tactical situation of the past few years was beyond the control of any leader or group .
So long as the Democrats were in power , the benefits of polarization outweighed the costs , so the groups that embraced polarization were the most successful .
Today , with a Republican Congress , groups that are willing to make friends rather than enemies may have an advantage .
A libertarian environmental alliance should be particularly powerful , because libertarians deny that the environment has " enemies . "
Instead , the real environmental problems are institutional : lack of property rights for certain resources and government interference in the market for others .
Unfortunately , the latest opposition provoked by environmental polarization calls itself the " property rights movement , " leading environmental activists to be immediately suspicious of anyone defending property rights .
This makes it especially important for libertarians who wish to build an alliance with environmentalists to learn and speak in the language of environmentalists .
This should n't be a problem because economics and ecology are really the same subjects .
" The theory of natural selection is uncannily similar to the chief doctrine of laissez - faire economics , " says noted biologist Stephen Jay Gould .
In fact , he adds , " the two theories are `isomorphic ' -- that is , structurally similar point for point , even though the subject matter differs . "
If , as most environmentalists agree , a natural ecosystem is best , then what does that ecosystem tell us about the best way to order our political - economic system ?
The ecosystem has millions of individual plants and animals , all working for their own selfish ends .
No central planner told the trees where to grow , no judge decided which deer the wolves could eat , no legislature allocated land to individual species .
Yet the system as a whole thrives .
In fact , environmental doctrine holds that attempts by humans to interfere with or plan the ecosystem will be ultimately destructive .
Clearly , there are powerful parallels between the libertarian and the environmental world views .
Many of these parallels are presented in Michael Rothschild 's excellent book , Bionomics , which completely recasts classical liberal economics in the language of biology .
This book is a " must read " for libertarians who wish to work closely with environmentalists -- and vice versa .
While environmentalists are suspicious of markets , they are also suspicious of big government .
Few feel happy with any of the federal agencies originally created to protect the environment ; these agencies have become environmental destroyers , not saviors .
The hard part is to convince environmentalists that markets will do any better .
The answer lies in a basic understanding of environmental issues .
Every environmental problem consists of a market resource that threatens a non-market resource .
The conclusion that environmentalists erroneously reach is that markets caused the problem .
The reality , of course , is that non-markets caused the problem .
The solution is to create markets for environmental goods .
This is n't always possible , but it is possible more often than not .
This means focusing on environmental problems not as technical issues but as big government and property rights issues :
" Will dams make the salmon go extinct ? " is the wrong question .
The right question is , " Why is the government subsidizing dams ? "
" Will timber cutting make the spotted owl go extinct ? " is the wrong question .
The right question is , " Why are there no property rights for owls and salmon , and how could property rights help protect these species from extinction ? "
" Is burning of hydrocarbons changing world climate ? " is the wrong question .
The right question is , " Why are people allowed to emit pollutants into the air that trespass onto my property ? "
" Do pulp mills damage rivers with dioxin pollution ? " is the wrong question .
The right question is " Why are there no property rights to the rivers and how could property rights protect them from pollution ? "
The real key is not " Who owns the land ? " but " What are the incentives facing the land managers ? "
Both public and private resource managers have incentives to seek subsidies from Congress .
Environmental problems will be resolved -- and taxpayers will save billions of dollars -- only when a new political philosophy becomes dominant that rejects such subsidies , no matter who owns the land .
My solution for all federal lands is to decentralize them into individual units -- forests , parks , or whatever -- and fund them exclusively out of a fixed share of the net income they earn from a broad range of user fees .
Each unit might have a board of directors elected by users , but each would be expected to return funds to the Treasury each year as " rent " for using public land .
This arrangement should satisfy both libertarians and environmentalists who are familiar with the current state of public land management .
Finally , do n't expect to successfully reach every environmentalist you meet .
Some environmentalists are more rational ; others more spiritual .
The spiritual ones will be the harder sell ; even the rational environmentalists have a difficult time talking with them .
Other environmentalists are dedicated extremists , seeking to polarize the situation by taking more radical positions than anyone else .
The great majority of environmentalists , however , are open to new ideas .
Not surprisingly , those most willing to embrace libertarian ideas have operated their own businesses or worked in the private sector at some time or another .
So if at first you do n't succeed , try again .
Some libertarians worry that the environmental movement threatens liberty .
While this is true of some of the tactics used by some of the environmental groups , it is not true of environmentalists in general .
Treating environmentalists as threats will have the effect of polarizing them into an anti-libertarian stance .
Libertarians will be much better off if they work with , rather than against , environmentalists .
To do so , libertarians must :
Learn to think of the economy as an ecosystem ;
Not argue with environmentalists over technical issues ;
Instead , focus on the lack of property rights as the fundamental environmental problem ;
Play on environmental suspicions of big government ; and
In the case of federal lands , worry more about the incentives facing land managers than on who actually holds title to the land .

In his blog post , Giorgio Gilestro claims to show that the adjustments made by GHCN to temperature data do not induce artificial trends into the data based mainly on this histogram of adjustments .
Arguments were made on the blog that the temporal order of the adjustments makes a difference and in fact these arguments seem to be correct .
I checked this through the following reasonably simple analysis :
I downloaded the GHCN datasets that he used and read them into R line by line .
The next step was to identify which lines in the adjusted set corresponded to specific lines in the raw data set .
There were one obvious error in the adjusted set : the last 10 lines were identical ( but continued nothing but missing value codes .
After fixing that , it was found that 31 adjusted lines had no corresponding raw partners – including a full station record .
These were also removed .
The individuals differences were calculated for each month and station to produce a set of 5068104 values .
Of these 4 % were not available and 32 % were zeroes .
The remainder were adjusted in one way or another , some by fairly large amounts .
The resulting differences were averaged over each year for each station :
Nothing obvious here except for the size of some of the adjustments .
Finally , these averages were again averaged over the stations to calculate an average for each year . :
The graph has some interesting features .
First of all , there is a fairly linear trend from about 1900 to the present .
The increase is about 0.25o .
A second unexpected feature was the fact that there seems to be a fairly constant reduction of 0.10 o C from about 1990 to 2006 !
The expression “ hiding the decline ” comes to mind and I believe this would need some sort of explanation .
The R program is available as a pdf here .
Update : December 13 , 2009
Since posting this yesterday , I have become aware of a post doing a similar analysis by blogger hpx83 .
His results are basically the same as the ones I have posted .
However , using further information about the stations , he has also included a graph of the number of stations available in a given year :
What I find particularly interesting about this in relation to the adjustment plot directly above is the post 1990 portion which parallels the sudden drop in the adjustments at that time .
Further looks are probably in order .
As well , Jean Demesure commented on the use of a pdf file for posting the R script .
I appreciate the problem , however quotes are not properly handled if the script is pasted into the blog post and WordPress limits my ability as to what types of files I can upload to the blog .
The only extensions allowed for files containing text are doc , docx , odt , and pdf .
Even txt files can not be uploaded .
I have just done a simple experiment which seems to work .
A text which is renamed as .doc will upload .
I have done this with the current script and it is now here : ghcnR .
It opened without difficulty in a simple text editor .
I will do this in the future .

Petrol has recently been priced on average at 108.99 pence per litre
Two of Britain 's supermarkets have sparked a petrol price war as they cut the cost of fuel .
Asda and Tesco have both dropped the price of their unleaded and diesel by up to three pence a litre , saying they are passing on a cut in oil prices .
But the AA said the supermarkets were a " bit slow " in bringing the prices down and that they could have done it weeks ago rather than just before Christmas .
And the AA warned January 's VAT rise would put the price back up .
' Competitively priced '
Asda said drivers filling up at its 179 forecourts across the UK would pay no more than 103.9 p per litre for unleaded and 105.9 p for a litre of diesel .
Recently , average UK pump prices were standing at 108.99 p for petrol and 110.26 p for diesel .
David Miles , Asda 's commercial director , said : " With Christmas just around the corner , it 's a time when cash is tight and we want to help our customers make it go further . "
A Tesco spokeswoman said their price cuts would help millions of customers travelling over the festive period and that it was committed to being " competitively priced on petrol " .
Meanwhile a Sainsbury 's spokeswoman said : " We price on a local level and in any local level we would aim to remain competitive . "
But Paul Watters from the AA said supermarkets had been holding out for as " long as they could before someone started pointing the finger at them " .
" The supermarkets have done this in the past .
They will lead the market and hopefully we will now see the premium brands follow suit . "

It ’s not their fault that they are incompetent ( Image : David Seed / Taxi / Getty )
IN THIS season of goodwill , spare a thought for that much - maligned bunch , the men and women at the top of the management tree .
Yes , the murky machinations of the banking bosses might have needlessly plunged millions into penury .
Yes , the actions of our political leaders might seem to be informed more by dubious wheeler - dealing than by Socratic wisdom .
And yes , the high - ups in your own company might well be the self - important time - wasters you ’ve always held them for .
Do n’t blame them , though .
It ’s not their fault .
There are good reasons to expect that bosses can’t help but be incompetent – adrift on a sea of troubles they neither understand nor can control .
Better to take pity on the poor souls : there with the grace of the promotion committee go all of us .
The idea that high - level incompetence is inevitable was formulated in the 1969 best - selling book The Peter Principle :
Why things always go wrong .
Its authors , psychologist Laurence Peter and playwright Raymond Hull , started from the observation that while jobs generally get more difficult the higher up any ladder you climb , most people only come equipped with a more or less fixed level of talent that corresponds to their intelligence , knowledge and energy .
At some point , then , they will be promoted into a job they ca n’t quite handle .
They will , as Peter and Hull put it , “ reach the level of their own incompetence ” .
And there they will stay , fouling up operations until they either retire or some egregiously inept act gets them fired .
The problem is what they get up …
WASHINGTON  Senate Democrats said Saturday that they had clinched an agreement on a far - reaching overhaul of the nation ’s health care system and forged ahead with efforts to approve the legislation by Christmas over Republican opposition .
As the Senate convened in a blizzard , Democratic leaders hailed a breakthrough that came when Senator Ben Nelson , Democrat of Nebraska , agreed to back the bill after 13 hours of negotiations on Friday , making him the pivotal 60th vote for a measure that President Obama has called his top domestic priority .
“ Change is never easy , but change is what ’s necessary in America , ” Mr. Nelson said at a morning news conference .
“ And that ’s why I intend to vote , ” he said , “ for health care reform . ”
Mr. Obama , appearing on television from the White House , said : “ Today is a major step forward for the American people .
After nearly a century - long struggle , we are on the cusp of making health care reform a reality in the United States of America . ”

Clojure is the new hotness among people who think the JVM is an interesting platform for post - Java languages , and for people who think there ’s still life in that ol ’
Lisp beast , and for people who worry about concurrency and state in the context of the multicore future .
Over the last few days I ’ve been severely bipolar about Clojure , swinging from “ way cool ! ” to “ am I really that stupid ? ”
Herewith some getting - started tips for newbies like me .
This is almost certainly not interesting to anyone except those who are already interested in Clojure , and to one other group : those who might want to package up a programming language in such a way that learning it will be straightforward .
Background · I understand the JVM and Java package structures reasonably well .
I am by no means a Lisp hacker , my experience being limited to a few thousand lines of elisp , mostly to cook my own idiosyncratic XML editing mode that I ’m using as I write this .
What To Read · Before I started , I read most of Mark Volmann ’s Clojure — Functional Programming for the JVM , and bought the PDF of Stuart Halloway ’s Programming Clojure from the Prags , although I ’d only read the Concurrency section in any detail .
Neither is great , but both are OK , and with addition of another resource , will get you what you need .
That other resource is the Clojure source code , which provides tons of examples of how - to - do - X ; go grepping around in $ CLOJURE / src / clj /... and you ’ll strike gold .
REPL ! ·
You just really can’t do any exploratory programming in a dynamic language without a REPL , as in Read - Evaluate - Print Loop .
Unlike Ruby , Clojure does n’t come with a precooked readline - equipped REPL , but you can get a primitive one going in a simple shell script .
Do n’t do that though , get yourself some IDE help .
Emacs and NetBeans are both plausible choices , because Emacs is already Lisp - centric and NetBeans knows about the acres of gleaming Java machinery that is holding this whole thing up .
IDE · I saw there was a NetBeans plug - in called Enclojure , so I went and got that from wherever Google took me .
Do n’t do that !
Get whatever ’s the latest from github .
Enclojure ’s install documentation is a little baffling .
I liked the idea of having a REPL right there in the IDE , so I followed the link and it expected me to understand what the difference between “ managed local ” and “ remote unmanaged ” and “ standalone ” REPLs were , and it was n’t obvious what I ’d need to download .
I eventually convinced myself that I wanted a “ Project REPL ” and it turns out that you get that with the plug -in .
Here are the basic things you need to know before you can do anything with the Project REPL :
Right - click in your code buffer and select “ Change REPL to file / ns ” .
Otherwise Nothing Will Work .
When you hop over to the REPL ( command - T on the Mac flips back & forth ) , you have to do a “ Load File ” ( control - L on the Mac ) so that the REPL will know about your functions .
Otherwise Nothing Will Work .
I wasted literally the best part of a day trying various weird incantations so that I could define a function foo and say ( foo ) in the REPL .
It ’s worse , because the “ Load File ” option is n’t advertised when you right - click in the REPL .
Once you get past this stuff , Enclojure seems like a rather good ( if young ) IDE front - end for Clojure .
And the REPL has all the command - line editing and history you could want .
But it should be easier to get started .
Namespace Hell · I noticed when I made a Clojure project , taking all the defaults , some ceremonial arm - waving at the top of the file :
( ns org.tbray . paralines ( : gen-class ) )
So I went to read up on this ns thing , and , well , it ’s a maze of twisty little passages , all different .
There ’s ns and in - ns and use and require and import , except for ns takes : require and :use and : import clauses , which are said to be better .
Some of them are forms and some of them are macros , and eventually you come to the sickening realization that this is essentially your old friend CLASSPATH
Hell , which evidently is not improved by the application of S - expressions .
The documentation in all the sources I could find shares the assumption that you understand what ’s going on and leaps directly into the finer points .
I have no fucking idea what ’s going on , but I managed to spelunk through the Clojure sources and steal enough working samples to get my code to run .
On the other hand , I have n’t yet had the courage to try to distribute my code across more than one file .
Asking For Help ·
There ’s a ( very quiet ) #enclojure IRC channel , and a rather high - quality Google group , where I was able to get some problems answered with archive searches .
As a professional philosopher my first question naturally is : " What or who is an atheist ? "
If you mean someone who absolutely and utterly does not believe there is any God or meaning then I doubt there are many in this group .
Richard Dawkins denies being such a person .
If you mean someone who agrees that logically there could be a god , but who does n't think that the logical possibility is terribly likely , or at least not something that should keep us awake at night , then I guess a lot of us are atheists .
But there is certainly a split , a schism , in our ranks .
I am not whining ( in fact I am rather proud ) when I point out that a rather loud group of my fellow atheists , generally today known as the " new atheists " , loathe and detest my thinking .
Richard Dawkins has likened me to the pusillanimous appeaser at Munich , Neville Chamberlain .
Jerry Coyne , author of Why Evolution is True , says ( echoing Orwell ) that only someone with pretensions to the intelligentsia could believe the silly things I believe .
And energetic blogger PZ Myers refers to me as a " clueless gobshite " because I confessed to seeing why true believers might find the Kentucky Creationist Museum convincing .
I will spare you what my fellow philosopher Dan Dennett has to say about me .
There are several reasons why we atheists are squabbling – I will speak only for myself but I doubt I am atypical .
First , non -believer though I may be , I do not think ( as do the new atheists ) that all religion is necessarily evil and corrupting .
This claim is on a par with golden plates in upstate New York .
The Quakers and the Evangelicals were inspired and driven by their religion to oppose slavery , and a good thing too .
Of course there has been evil in the name of religion – the pope telling Africans not to use condoms in the face of Aids – but as often as not religion is not the only or even the primary force for evil .
The troubles in Northern Ireland were surely about socio-economic issues also , and the young men who flew into the World Trade Centre towers were infected by the alienation and despair of the young in Muslim countries in the face of poverty and inequalities .
Second , unlike the new atheists , I take scholarship seriously .
I have written that The God Delusion made me ashamed to be an atheist and I meant it .
Trying to understand how God could need no cause , Christians claim that God exists necessarily .
I have taken the effort to try to understand what that means .
Dawkins and company are ignorant of such claims and positively contemptuous of those who even try to understand them , let alone believe them .
Thus , like a first - year undergraduate , he can happily go around asking loudly , " What caused God ? " as though he had made some momentous philosophical discovery .
Dawkins was indignant when , on the grounds that inanimate objects cannot have emotions , philosophers like Mary Midgley criticised his metaphorical notion of a selfish gene .
Sauce for the biological goose is sauce for the atheist gander .
There are a lot of very bright and well informed Christian theologians .
We atheists should demand no less .
Third , how dare we be so condescending ?
I do n't have faith .
I really do n't .
Rowan Williams does as do many of my fellow philosophers like Alvin Plantinga ( a Protestant ) and Ernan McMullin ( a Catholic ) .
I think they are wrong ; they think I am wrong .
But they are not stupid or bad or whatever .
If I needed advice about everyday matters , I would turn without hesitation to these men .
We are caught in opposing Kuhnian paradigms .
I can explain their faith claims in terms of psychology ; they can explain my lack of faith claims also probably partly through psychology and probably theology also .
( Plantinga , a Calvinist , would refer to original sin . )
I just keep hearing Cromwell to the Scots .
" I beseech you , in the bowels of Christ , think it possible you may be mistaken . "
I do n't think I am wrong , but the worth and integrity of so many believers makes me modest in my unbelief .
Fourth and finally , I live in the American South , surrounded by ardent Christians .
I want evolution taught in the schools and I can think of no way better designed to make that impossible than to spout on about religion , from ignorance and with contempt .
And especially to make unsubstantiated arguments that science refutes religion .
I never conceal my nonbelief .
I defend to the death the right of the new atheists to their views and to their right to propagate them .
But that is no excuse for political stupidity .
If , as the new atheists think , Darwinian evolutionary biology is incompatible with Christianity , then will they give me a good argument as to why the science should be taught in schools if it implies the falsity of religion ?
The first amendment to the constitution of the United States of America separates church and state .
Why are their beliefs exempt ?
Back in 1961 , in the depths of the cold war , terrified as we were by the threat of nuclear annihilation , John Whitcomb Junior and Henry Morris published The Genesis Flood , a six - day - creationist account of origins .
Because of its dispensationalist message – God clears things out every now and then , as he did at the time of Noah , and we should expect the next ( literal ) blow up fairly shortly – it became the fundamentalist bible .
But do n't worry .
It 's all part of God 's plans , even the Russian bomb .
Today , nearly a decade after 9/11 , terrified as so many still are by the terrorist threat , the atheistic fundamentalists are finding equally fertile soil for their equally frenetic messages .
It 's all the fault of the believers , Muslims mainly of course , but Christians also .
But do n't worry .
In the God Delusion , we have a message as simplistic as in The Genesis Flood .
This too will solve all of your problems .
Peace and prosperity await you in this world , if not the next .
Forgive me if I do n't sign on .
Boris Gelfand of Israel is the 2009 World Cup champion .
Gelfand won the title by beating Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine in a playoff on Monday .
The first four games of the playoff were rapid games ( 25 minutes per player per game ) and Gelfand took the lead by winning the second game .
But Ponomariov , with his back to the wall , won the last rapid game to tie the match up again .
The playoff then went to blitz chess ( 5 minutes per player per game ) and Gelfand once again took the lead by beating Ponomariov in the first game when he managed to trap Ponomariov ’s queen in 21 moves .
Ponomariov rallied again , winning the second game .
But Gelfand won the third and Ponomariov finally ran out of reserves , losing the fourth .
That clinched the match , 7 points to 5 , for Gelfand .
Gelfand was the No. 1 seed in the 128 - player event .
At 41 , he was also one of the oldest , but that did not hinder him in the long tournament .
Afterward , in an interview published on the tournament ’s Web site , Gelfand pointed out that he had come to the World Cup after competing in the Tal Memorial and the World Blitz Championship that followed it .
Altogether , he said he had played more than a month of top - level chess , but he added , “ Now I will relax , make up for lost sleep , walk with my daughter .
So I will be back to ‘ normal ’ life . ”
This was the second time that Ponomariov , 26 , was runner - up in the World Cup .
He lost in the final in 2005 to Levon Aronian of Armenia .
Still , he came in as the No. 7 seed , so he performed above his pre-tournament rank .

Despite the fact that I find this comic pretty funny , I have to admit that it does make me feel better that Obama was actually listening to people and doing research when coming to the decision about what to do in Afghanistan .
Could you imagine the same thing from the previous occupant ?
And considering that most of us gave Dubya the benefit of the doubt when he invaded Afghanistan and created this mess in the first place , it seems only fair to give Obama an equal chance to screw up .
But as people have pointed out , this decision officially makes this Obama ’s war now ( it does n’t matter that he did n’t start it , just like LBJ did n’t start VietNam ) .
If things are n’t looking up by 2011 , then he will at the very least have to share the blame with Dubya .
UPDATE : Here ’s a comic that pretty much sums up how I feel about Obama ’s plan for Afghanistan :

UPDATE 2 : Here is a provocative view of what is wrong with our approach to Afghanistan , and what we can do to fix it .
Suggested prerequisite equipment .
Suggested prerequisite skills .
First signs of trouble .
Once you have secured the safe - house ...
Searching for survivors
There are many different survival manuals for the Zombie Apocalypse .
In my version I give simple outlines in what to do and how to react in this crisis ; however , we need to address a few skills as well as equipment you should have .
You need a few rifles and handguns .
Forget about chainsaws because they run on fuel and take to long to cut through a zombie .
Now this is not just for zombies but this is how you will enforce your will to survive around the living .
In a time of great crisis people will break down to savagery you will also need a diesel truck preferably an early model .
You want a diesel vehicle because you can run that rig off of vegetable oil when diesel pumps are inaccessible because the power is out .
Having prior military survival training is very helpful .
If you have none then perhaps now is the time to take survival training classes .
At the least you should know how to purify water , tie different types of knots , basic welding , basic electronics , basic auto mechanics , and basic first aid .
During the apocalypse you may be alone for a while and there will be nobody to call when you need to repair something .
1 .
Get out of the house quick !
Do n't worry about grabbing clothes , your wallet , or your favorite Star Wars DVD's .
That stuff wont mean jack - shit in the new world .
Grab your gun , cell phone , and hit the road in your truck .
2. DO NOT stop for people asking for help .
DO NOT attempt to rescue relatives or loved ones .
Yes , this is a " dick move " , but this is the time you take your cell phone and tell your loved ones where you are headed .
If possible make sure they STAY PUT and lock themselves in a basement or somewhere with solid walls and no more than two exits .
Time to get to a safe zone is of the essence and you will have to get them later .
3 .
Make your way to a Costco or Sams Club .
In fact , any large warehouse shopping club store with limited exists are preferable .
There will be enough supplies to last at least a year if not more .
DO NOT go for the gun store , small grocery store or mall and be prepared to take the store by force .
4 .
Commandeer assistants because you are going to need help locking down the store .
You may encounter resistance so use your gun and explain the situation to others .
For those who do not agree with you ; you must force them to leave and lock the doors behind them .
Use large heavy bulk items to barricade the door .
Be prepared to use the forklift to make moving heavy objects faster .
5 .
For now we will call this the " safe - house " and you should now be secured from the outside zombie threat .
* Remember that power will stop working for from a few days to about a week from the time of the apocalypse .
Without living humans the grid will shut down , and when the power goes out basic services will cease to function .
No more cell phone calls , no more running water , no more flushing toilets .
1 . Find all the large clean 55 gallon trash cans you can find and take them to the deli , bathroom , or anywhere with a faucet .
Start filling ALL the trash cans with water from the tap .
You will use this water to drinking , cooking , and sanitation .
Remember , when there are no living people working the public utilities , water and power will fail within days or weeks .
DO NOT use bottled water .
You are going to need these for later .
2 .
Make contact with loved ones and relatives including those who have agreed to help you .
You are now the leader of a group effort and you must now act like a leader .
You will need someone you can trust and both of you should start to formulate chain of command .
3 .
If your people are hungry , make sure they eat everything that is perishable first .
DO NOT use canned goods because you will need those for later .
Perishable food will expire soon and freezers and refrigerators will be rendered useless when the power goes out .
Now is a good time to start charging the rechargeable batteries that the store sells .
1. Start making calls .
Everyone who answers the phone , get their location and start planning a route to pick up survivors .
A bus would be perfect but for now the diesel truck will have to work .
Remind survivors that they should pack nothing but the basic essentials .
I would agree that dogs and cats should be allowed to come because these animals add a comfort factor to survivors .
2 . Travel in daylight only .
Zombies do not care if it is day or night so it would be best to take advantage of the most light possible .
Drive out and make sure they secure the door of the safe - house behind you .
Drive carefully .
Reckless driving will only lead to an accident that may disable your vehicle .
If your vehicle is disabled , your odds of survival are slim .
3. DO NOT stop and pick up equipment .
Stick to the plan and pick up survivors .
Returning with survivors increases the morale of the people in your safe - house .
From here you can determine your next course of survival , but remember that you should react quickly and with purpose .
You should remind yourself that people will be in a state of disbelief and shock and you should be prepared for that .
Good luck .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian police have arrested three homeless people suspected of eating a 25 - year - old man they had butchered and selling other bits of the corpse to a local kebab house .
Suspicions were raised when dismembered parts of a human body were found near a bus stop in the outskirts of the Russian city of Perm , 1,150 km ( 720 miles ) east of Moscow .
Three homeless men with previous criminal records have been arrested on suspicion of setting upon a foe with knives and a hammer before chopping up his corpse to eat , local investigators said in a statement on their www.susk.perm.ru
Web site .
“ After carrying out the crime , the corpse was divided up : part was eaten and part was also sold to a kiosk selling kebabs and pies , ” the Prosecutor - General ’s main investigative unit for the Perm region said in a statement issued Friday .
It was not immediately clear from the statement if any of the corpse had been sold to customers .
Police in Michigan are investigating after an irate reader of the Port Huron Times - Herald reportedly called in a threat to the newspaper after it criticized a local House representative ’s participation in the anti-health reform Tea Party protest two weeks ago .
“ A 60 - year - old Port Huron woman threatened to take a gun to the newspaper and ‘ do what they did at Fort Hood , ’ according to police , ” the Times - Herald reported on Tuesday .

The threat referred to the shooting deaths of 13 people at the US Army base in Fort Hood , Texas , on November 5 .
Army psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan has been charged with murder in the shootings .
The newspaper says the woman ’s alleged threat came over an editorial that ran last week which described US House Rep.
Candice Miller ’s participation in the anti-health reform protest as “ shameful . ”
Miller , a Republican who represents Michigan ’s 10th district , reportedly made herself very visible during the November 5 protest on Capitol Hill , organized by Republican firebrand Michele Bachmann .
Among other things , the protest featured a sign that compared Democrats ’ health care reform efforts to the slaughter of Jews in the Dachau concentration camp .
The Times - Herald ‘s editorial stated :
Rally participants carried a variety of disturbing signs .
One placard had a health care message superimposed over dead bodies from Holocaust concentration camps .
One referred to President Barack Obama as “ Sambo . ”
One depicted the president as the evil “ Joker ” from Batman movies .
One referred to “ Obama and his Marxist buddies . ”
At one point , the crowd chanted “ Nazi , Nazi . ”
Apparently , our congresswoman is OK with all of this .

The editorial concludes :
If Miller truly has signed up with the right - wing fringe — the bigots , the hate - mongers and the Nazi- chanters — all of us in the Blue Water Area might well need to take another look .
Perhaps Miller could start with an apology for her performance at last Thursday ’s GOP festival of hate .
According to the Editor & Publisher blog , the unnamed woman made her threat to the newspaper the morning the editorial ran .
She had called a Gannett call center in Kentucky , where the conversation was recorded .
Gannett owns the Times - Herald .
Police identified the source of the call and interviewed a woman at a local address in Port Huron .
Police did not say if the woman admitted making the threat .
The Times - Herald says police have not yet decided whether the woman will be charged .
ABORTION
Would allow people who receive insurance subsidies to choose a plan that covers elective abortions , but insurers must use premium money or co-payments contributed by consumers , and not federal subsidies , to cover the cost of the abortions .
Would also require that every state offer at least one insurance plan that covers abortion and one that does not .
Prof Nutt criticised the reclassification of cannabis
Three more government advisers have resigned after the home secretary 's sacking of his chief drugs adviser Prof David Nutt , the BBC has learned .
Dr John Marsden , Dr Ian Ragan and Dr Simon Campbell have quit the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs after two others left earlier this month .
Members of the council had met Alan Johnson seeking reassurance that their independence would not be compromised .
Mr Johnson dismissed Prof Nutt for " crossing a line " into politics .
BBC home affairs editor Mark Easton said the absence of certain experts on the council meant it was " stymied " and effectively was now unable to operate under its current constitution .
' Big problem '
He said the remaining 25 members still had outstanding concerns and Mr Johnson was presented with " a big problem " .
ACMD'S REQUIRED POSTS
Medicine ( other than veterinary medicine ) Dentistry Veterinary medicine Pharmacy Pharmaceutical industry Chemistry ( other than pharmaceutical chemistry )
Mark Easton : Johnson miscalculated The Home Office confirmed that the ACMD had to have 20 members to remain quorate , and that six positions had to be filled for the advisory group to function .
The three to resign were psychologist Dr John Marsden , Simon Campbell , a synthetic organic chemist who received a CBE for services to science , and pharmaceutical consultant Ian Ragan .
Earlier the home secretary said he stood by the decision to remove Prof Nutt but wanted to improve relations with the council , saying he would give " due weight " to their views in the future .
The Home Office had published a statement following a meeting between Mr Johnson and the ACMD on Tuesday .
It said : " The discussions were very constructive , and it was agreed that the ACMD would continue discussions with the Home Office and government chief scientific advisors in establishing a way to work collaboratively together into the future with a common purpose of reducing any drug - related harm in the UK . "
Free from influence Clinical director Marion Walker and Dr Les King were the first to resign following the row .
Dr King said he wanted the council to become independent , free from government influence .
Prof Nutt was sacked after calling cannabis less harmful than alcohol and nicotine , and saying it was upgraded to Class B for political reasons .
But Mr Johnson said Prof Nutt had " crossed the line between offering advice and then campaigning against the government on political decisions " .
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said : " Whilst we backed the original decision , by now I would have expected the home secretary to be able to sit down with other members of the council and rebuild confidence and stability in what they are doing .
Quite clearly he has failed to do that . "
Liberal Democrat science spokesman Dr Evan Harris said : " The fact the resignations come after Alan Johnson met the ACMD demonstrates he just does n't get it when it comes to the importance of respecting the academic freedom and integrity of independent , unpaid , science advisers . "

Some of the shots look like they 're close , but all I can think about is how fucked we are when the Terminator thing goes down and all we have are sparklers .

Russell Turnbull , now 38 , lost almost all the sight in his right eye after trying to break up a fight and being sprayed with ammonia 15 years ago .
The result for him was what 's known as Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency , which caused him great pain , the need for therapeutic treatment , and economic dependency .
Good news for Russell is that he can put all that behind him now , after becoming one of the first recipients of a new stem cell grafting procedure , whereby healthy tissue from his left eye was implanted into his right and -- just like a video game medpack -- restored his vision to normal .
For the moment , this treatment is limited to patients with at least one healthy eye , but given the pluripotent nature of stem cells , it is hoped that tissue from elsewhere in the body could one day be used to regenerate damaged parts , such as the cornea in this case .
You may find further enlightenment in the video after the break .

An anecdote about ML type inference , the author uses implementation of merge sort as a learning exercise for ML and is pleased to find an “ incorrect ” type inference .
Much to my surprise , the compiler reported a type of
' a list -> int list
In other words , this sort function accepts a list of any type at all and returns a list of integers .
That is impossible .
The output must be a permutation of the input ; how can it possibly have a different type ?
The reader will surely find my first impulse familiar : I wondered if I had uncovered a bug in the compiler !
Ocean in motion : Surfer captures mesmerising world where waves break against the shore
Churning up the golden sands , a wave breaks upon the shore in a glorious mix of emerald greens and frothy whites .
The crystal clear shots were taken by photographer Clark Little , who spent two years capturing these remarkable shots in Hawaii .
Featured in his new book , ' The Shorebreak Art of Clark Little ' , he braved the notoriously fierce swell off the coast of the island to illustrate the beauty of the ocean .
Photographer and surfer Clark Little has spent years capturing waves breaking against the shore in Hawaii
The moment a huge wave begins to break as sand is churned up from underneath in the never - ending cycle
' Three years ago that my wife Sandy wanted a photograph of the ocean for our bedroom wall , ' he said .
' I got a very inexpensive waterproof camera for this challenge and went to the shorebreak near my house on the North Shore of Oahu , Hawaii to try and capture a good wave .
' I had been trying to explain to people for years what the waves look like when I was surf the shorebreak .
' Not many people surf these type of waves since large waves that break right on the beach are very dangerous .
' The photographs were able to convey to people a very unique view which they would never be able to see . '
The sunlight shines through a breaking wave just off Hawaii with the water turning a deep emerald green
Clark Little in his element .
The surfer has been a professional photographer for three years after being inspired by the ocean
Standing , wading and swimming in the waves , Clark spends up to six hours in the water each day .
With a waterproof camera strapped to his wrist , he used his surfing experience to plot the best positions and timing for the perfect picture .
' I have over 30 years of surfing experience so that is what has helped me the most , ' he said .
' Having the knowledge of how waves break in the shorebreak , wave timing , and how to escape them is needed .
' You must always watch the tide , swell height , swell direction , wind , weather , sand bar conditions .
' You must be able to swim very very well .
I wear swim fins made for bodysurfing which are a lifesaver and can get me out of dangerous situations very quickly .
' I could be out in waves up to 20 ft high or standing in just a few feet of water while shooting .
I took as many shots as I can before the wave crashed down on me . '
Mirage : A sandy beach viewed through the water , creating a strange mirror effect
Clark only turned professional three years ago .
His new book is the result of shooting thousands of pictures since then .
' The colours , patterns , texture are all mesmerising .
The ocean is always in flux and changing so the mind is always awake and intriguing , ' he said .

The History
Kasteel is a brand by the Belgian Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck .
Van Honsebrouck also brews a few other labels - including Bacchus and St. Louis - but Kasteel is the most popular and most available in the US .
Kasteel is named for the Castle [ Kasteel ] van Ingelmunster , which is owned by the brewery and featured on the label .
Unfortunately , not a lot of detail about the van Honsebrouck ’s exists .
The brewery dates back to sometime around the turn of the 20th century , and it is still in the family ’s possession .
Beyond that , there is n’t much aside from a Dutch Wikipedia Article and the company ’s horribly outdated website .
So let ’s let the beers speak for themselves .
Tonight I ’ll be trying three styles : Tripel , Donker , and Rouge .
Blonde is also brewed , but I ’ve never been able to find it .
Tripel
Kasteel Tripel is , obviously , a Belgian Tripel .
The term comes from the amount of malt used in the brewing process - around three times the amount used in a “ simple ” brew .
Generally light in color and body yet high in alcohol and with a bold flavor .
Sweetness and complexity are common , and usually a result of a combination of yeast , spices , and / or Belgian candi sugar .
Tripel pours a pale orange with a hue and effervescence reminiscent of ginger ale .
Big champagne bubbles foam and fizzle , leaving practically zero head , even after a vigorous pour .
Although it does n’t stick , plenty bubbles continue to rise from the bottom and pop .
Aroma is bready citrus .
Lemon peel , plus a little apple .
Initial taste is a peppery spice , followed quickly by a fruity sweetness .
More apple , some white grape , and a hint of fresh cherries .
There ’s the characteristic candi sugar taste , but it ’s much lighter and fruity than a typical Belgian tripel .
Warming alcohol in the aftertaste , a slight hint at Tripel ’s well - hidden 11 %ABV .
Almost no bitterness to speak of .
This beer has the texture of fine champagne .
Bright bubbles sting the tongue .
It ’s light , more sharp than smooth , yet pleasant .
8/10
Donker
Donker - meaning dark - is a Belgian Strong Dark ( Kasteel appears to be very straightforward with their names ) .
I ’ve reviewed a couple belgian darks in the past ( Trois Pistoles and Gulden Draak ) , so I wo n’t go too into the details of the style .
Pours a deep reddish caramel .
Both the beer and the head resemble Coca - cola ( okay , last soda analogy ) .
The head has a bit more retention than the Tripel , but still fades fast to a thin ring with some floating foam clusters .
Smells of dark fruits - raisin , date , and cherry .
Taste is ultra sweet .
A lot of brown sugar , some dried plum , and caramel .
Again , hops are barely there .
Alcohol presence is there - Donker is also 11 % - but mostly well hidden .
A mixture of molasses and soy takes over as the beer warms , along with the tiniest hint of iodine bitterness .
Donker has the flavor profile and feel of a tawny port more than a dark beer .
Perhaps a well - aged quad .
The mouthfeel is big and thick .
A tad syrupy , although that is mostly offset by some smooth - probably natural - carbonation .
Once the carbonation subsides , the port - wine quality takes over and the beer is almost too sweet .
This is definitely a slow sipper .
Complex , but not in the best way , and not very drinkable .
Donker might be good as a 4oz.
pour ( again , port ) but the whole 11.2 ounce bottle is hard to put down without some heavy nursing .
6.75/10
Rouge
Kasteel Rouge - also sometimes known as Kriek - is a blend of brown ale aged for at least six months with sour cherries .
It ’s not a lambic or a kriek , even though the flavor might suggest it , because it is not fermented with wild yeast .
The closest category into which Rouge fits is probably a Fruit Beer .
But I digress …
Living up to its name , Rouge pours a near - opaque blood red , with about a finger of pale - pinkish foam .
Once again the carbonation is big and champagne - like .
The best retention of the three , but bubbles still recede fairly quickly .
Aroma is overwhelmingly of fresh cherries .
Similarly , the taste is all cherry .
Sweet at first , then a bit sour towards the end .
A brief glimmer of dark malt - the one hint that this is a brown ale at heart - but cherry and candi sugar are the singular stars .
Rouge is slightly less alcoholic than Tripel or Donker at 8 %ABV , and it ’s undetectable save for a slight warmth way down in my throat .
Body is not too heavy .
Full , but not syrupy .
The long - lasting natural carbonation helps liven it up .
Rouge is highly swishable , moderately drinkable .
Rouge has a great complexity for having only one featured ingredient .
Yes , it ’s all cherry , but many facets of the cherry - sugar , sour , tart - are allowed to shine .
This is definitely the most balanced and most enjoyable of the three Kasteels .

CAIRO ( Reuters ) - Soheila , an Egyptian village housewife , traded her kidney for $ 2,185 to pay off debt -- the best option the desperate mother of three could find to keep food on the family table .

The 32 - year - old from the fertile Nile Delta region is one of many people caught up in a thriving trade for illegal organs in Egypt , where there is no legal path to transplants .
Donation is allowed in practice only in very limited circumstances .
But conservative Egypt , one of the world ’s biggest organ trade hubs , is now working on legislation to legalize transplants from brain dead donors and hopes the new law will cut back on demand for illicit organs .
“ Giving my kidney is better than working in furnished apartments , ” Soheila told an Egyptian transplant advocacy group , using a euphemism for prostitution .
“ This is against my dignity and I would n’t want to go and do such things . ”
“ I did n’t want to do ( anything religiously wrong ) and steal for money .
There was no other way to get such money so I decided still to give my kidney , ” she told the Coalition for Organ Failure Solution in testimony posted on the group ’s web site .
Other Egyptians have complained of being tricked into giving up their kidneys , and some have filed lawsuits .
In 2008 , police arrested a Syrian and Jordanian over organ trade in Cairo .
Eighteen other Islamic countries , including staunchly conservative Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite Iran , are more liberal than Egypt on transplants , allowing operations from dead donors , said lawmaker Hamdy al - Sayed , who drafted the law in Egypt .
Egypt has no transplant laws although in practice living kin can legally donate a kidney and portions of their liver .
It also does not recognize brain death , a matter up for debate in Muslim religious circles and among conservatives .
But the World Health Organization said Cairo has agreed to the need for both .
Most of Egypt ’s commercial living kidney donors are young and male , and later regret selling their organs .
Nearly four in five face worsening health after the transplant , and the money they earn is gone within five months , according to WHO .
Commercial living donors , mainly the poor and vulnerable , are thought to supply 10 percent of the world ’s kidneys , WHO says .
It has estimated the price of a kidney in Egypt at $ 1,700 - $ 2,700 .
“ SPARE PARTS FOR THE RICH ”
Egypt ’s parliament is due to vote in the next few weeks on a law that would legalize transplants from brain dead donors and regulate organ donations from the living , Sayed said .
“ We cannot stop organ trading where the poor sell their organs through dodgy people unless there is a law that criminalizes illegal organ trading , ” said Alaa Ghannam , director of the health program in the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights .
“ This law is a positive step forward . ”
The law , which in previous years has failed to make it onto the parliamentary agenda , now has the blessing of President Hosni Mubarak , who told parliament ’s opening session that he hoped to reach a resolution on the matter .
The law would establish a formal organ waiting list and would bar financial rewards for organ donations .
Doctors caught performing illegal transplants may face up to 15 years in jail .
It would also require living donors to sign consent papers , while organs could be harvested from dead donors based on a will or family consent .
Operations would be supervised by the state .
To avoid controversy in Egypt , where sectarian tensions sometimes erupt between Muslims and minority Christians , the law would bar transplants across faiths and between Egyptians and non-Egyptians , said Sayed , the law ’s author .
If the law passes , the number of legal transplants performed annually in Egypt could surge to roughly 40,000 from just 1,000 now , he said .
Egypt ’s Mansoura University Hospital , the country ’s premier transplant center and a top trauma center , says it already has the capacity to perform thousands more transplants a year .
Mansoura , where gleaming halls smell of antiseptic and teams of nurses hover at bedsides , is a far cry from many typical Egyptian hospitals , where patients often sleep on trollies in hallways and must tip nurses to receive standard care .
“ Once the law is approved , we can start work the next day , ” said Mohamed Abdel Wahab , a gastroenterologist who works on liver transplants at Mansoura Hospital .
RELIGIOUS DEBATE
Egypt ’s state - run Islamic authorities , including the prominent Al - Azhar mosque and university , have given a religious nod of approval to the draft law , controversial among many Muslims because it recognizes brain stem death as ending life .
But the proposed law still faces critics even from within Mubarak ’s ruling National Democratic Party , who disagree over the definition of death and fear that allowing transplants in any form could exacerbate organ trade .
“ The law should not leave the matter in hands of doctors to decide if death has occurred and should set a clear definition for death that would guarantee the soul has permanently left the body , ” ruling party lawmaker Mohamed Khalil Kwaitah said .
As early as 1997 , al - Azhar Grand Sheikh Mohamed Sayed Tantawy issued a fatwa , or Islamic decree , allowing organ transplants , and vowing to donate his own organs after death .
Some religious Muslims in Egypt , however , believe that death occurs only when the heart stops beating -- a view that would proscribe viable transplants because organs would deteriorate after the heart stops .
“ The death of the brain stem is a disease and is not death . ” said Al - Sayed Abdel Maksoud Askar , a lawmaker from the powerful Muslim Brotherhood , which holds a fifth of the seats in parliament and is the biggest opposition bloc .
He said organs cannot be taken from a person with brain death because in his view life ends with death of all organs .

Tell me what you really think .
Now that the Copenhagen climate - change summit is finally underway , do the thousands of delegates gathered there to save the planet have much of a mandate from their home countries ?
A pair of fresh surveys paint a very different picture of public concern about climate change — and enthusiasm for big fixes .
A new poll by the Nielsen Company shows public concern about climate change falling sharply in the last two years — roughly when the global economy started to sputter .
A separate survey by Globe Scan / BBC still shows plenty of worry about climate change , but a very mixed picture about how far people are willing to go to combat it .
The Nielsen survey shows concern about climate change falling in 35 of 54 countries over the last two years .
In the U.S. , for example , the percentage of people describing themselves as “ very concerned about climate change ” fell to 25 % in October , from 34 % in October 2007 .
Other countries had even bigger declines : 29 % of Australians are “ very concerned , ” compared with 51 % two years ago .
Concern in Sweden has halved to 17 % in the last two years , and so on .
The Globe Scan / BBC poll offers a different picture , with nearly two - thirds of respondents in 23 countries describing climate change as “ very serious , ” and 61 % supporting action to fight it , “ even if these investments hurt the economy . ”
Nestled near the beaches of the Italian Riviera and the snow - capped Alps sits the tiny principality of Seborga , a place that floats on legends .
Over the centuries , plagues and earthquakes have struck the region and missed Seborga , or so the stories say .
Some insist that knights took the Holy Grail there .
But the true miracle of Seborga may have been the 46 - year reign of Prince Giorgio I , the constitutionally elected royal ruler of its five square miles and 2,000 people , about 350 of whom are enfranchised citizens .
Prince Giorgio , a bewhiskered grower of mimosa flowers from a family of mimosa growers , was seized by a glorious vision : that Seborga was not part of the surrounding Italian nation .
It was an ancient principality , cruelly robbed of its sovereignty .
After convincing his Seborgan neighbors of their true significance , Giorgio Carbone was elected prince in 1963 .
He gracefully accepted the informal title of His Tremendousness , and was elected prince for life in 1995 by a vote of 304 to 4 .
Voters then ratified Seborga ’s independence , which , by the prince ’s interpretation , it already had .

Having a disease named after you is a decidedly mixed bag .
On the one hand , your scientific developments are forever commemorated .
On the other hand , though , you 're stuck with the knowledge that no patient will ever be happy upon hearing your name .
Who are the scientists and doctors behind some of our most famous diseases and conditions , though ?
Here are a few of the physicians and their eponymous ailments .
1. Crohn 's disease
The inflammatory digestive disease could just have easily ended up with the name Ginzburg 's disease or Oppenheimer 's disease .
In 1932 , three New York physicians named Burrill Bernard Crohn , Leon Ginzburg , and Gordon Oppenheimer published a paper describing a new sort of intestinal inflammation .
Since Crohn 's name was listed first alphabetically , the condition ended up bearing his name .
2. Salmonellosis
Yes , the salmonella menace that haunts undercooked chicken is named after a person .
Daniel Elmer Salmon was a veterinary pathologist who ran a USDA microorganism research program during the late 19th century .
Although Salmon did n't actually discover the type of bacterium that now bears his name — famed epidemiologist Theobald Smith isolated the bacteria in 1885 — he ran the research program in which the discovery occurred .
Smith and his colleagues named the bacteria salmonella in honor of their boss .
3. Parkinson 's disease
James Parkinson was a busy fellow .
While the English apothecary had a booming medical business , he also dabbled in geology , paleontology , and politics ; Parkinson even published a three - volume scientific study of fossils .
Following a late - 18th - century foray into British politics where he advocated a number of social causes and found himself briefly ensnared in an alleged plot to assassinate King George III , Parkinson turned his attention to medicine .
Parkinson did some research on gout and peritonitis , but it was his landmark 1817 study " An Essay on the Shaking Palsy "  that affixed his name to Parkinson 's disease .
4. Huntington 's disease
George Huntington was n't the most prolific researcher , but he made his papers count .
In 1872 , a fresh - out - of - med - school Huntington published one of two research papers he would write in his life .
In the paper , Huntington described the effects of the neurodegenerative disorder that now bears his name after examining several generations of family that all suffered from the genetic condition .
5. Alzheimer 's disease
In 1901 , German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer began observing an odd patient at a Frankfurt asylum .
The 51 - year - old woman , Mrs. Auguste Deter , had no short - term memory and behaved strangely .
When Mrs. Deter died in 1906 , Alzheimer began to dissect the patient 's brain , and he presented his findings that November in what was the first formal description of presenile dementia .
6. Tourette syndrome
Credit George Gilles de la Tourette for his modesty .
When the French neurologist first described the illness that now bears his name in 1884 , he did n't name it after himself .
Instead , he referred to the condition as " maladie des tics . " 
Tourette 's mentor and contemporary Jean - Martin Charcot renamed the illness after Tourette .
Tourette did n't have such great luck with patients , though .
In 1893 , a deluded former patient shot the doctor in the head .
The woman claimed that she lost her sanity after Tourette hypnotized her .
Tourette survived the attack .
7. Hodgkin's lymphoma
British pathologist Thomas Hodgkin first described the cancer that now bears his name while working at Guy 's Hospital in London in 1832 .
Hodgkin published the study " On Some Morbid Appearances of the Absorbent Glands and Spleen "  that year , but the condition did n't bear his name until a fellow physician , Samuel Wilks , rediscovered Hodgkin 's work .
8. Bright 's disease
The kidney disease bears the name of Richard Bright , an English physician and colleague of Hodgkin's at Guy 's Hospital .
Bright began looking into the causes of kidney trouble during the 1820s , and in 1827 he described an array of kidney ailments that eventually became known as Bright 's disease .
Today , doctors understand many of the symptoms historically clumped together as Bright 's disease are in fact different maladies , so the term is rarely used .
9. Addison 's disease
Guy 's Hospital was apparently the place to work in the 19th century if you wanted to have a disease named after you .
Thomas Addison , a colleague of Bright and Hodgkin at Guy 's Hospital , first described the adrenal disorder we call Addison 's disease in 1855 .
On top of this discovery , Addison also published an early study of appendicitis .
10 . Tay - Sachs disease
Although both of their names are attached to this genetic disorder , Warren Tay and Bernard Sachs did n't work together .
In fact , they did n't even work in the same country .
Tay , a British opthalmologist , first described the disease 's characteristic red spot on the retina in 1881 .
In 1887 Bernard Sachs , a colleague of Burrill Crohn at Mount Sinai Hospital , described the cellular effects of the disease and its prevalence among Ashkenazi Jews .
11 . Turner syndrome
The chromosomal disorder got its name from Oklahoma doctor Henry Turner , who first described the condition in 1938 .
12 . Klinefelter 's syndrome
The genetic condition in which males have an extra X chromosome bears the name of Harry Klinefelter , a young Boston endocrinologist who published a landmark study while working under the tutelage of endocrinology star Dr. Fuller Albright in 1942 .
Albright pushed his young protÃ©gÃ© to be the lead author of the paper that described the condition , so the young Klinefelter 's name is forever associated with the syndrome .
13 . Asperger 's syndrome
Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger first described the syndrome that now bears his name in 1944 after observing a group of children who suffered from what Asperger described as " autistic psychopathy . " 
( He called his patients " Little Professors . " )
Interestingly , since Asperger 's research was all written in German , his contributions to the literature went unrecognized until much later .
The term " Asperger 's syndrome "  did n't come into widespread usage until 1981 .
Today it 's classified as an autism spectrum disorder .

Officials : Only A Failed Detonator Saved Northwest Flight Screening machines may need to be replaced ; Al Qaeda aware of ' Achilles heel . '
Dec. 26 , 2009  --
Officials now say tragedy was only averted on Northwest flight 253 because a makeshift detonator failed to work properly .
Bomb experts say there was more than enough explosive to bring down the Northwest jet , which had nearly 300 people aboard , had the detonator not failed , and the nation 's outdated airport screening machines may need to be upgraded .
" We 've known for a long time that this is possible , " said Richard Clarke , former counterterrorism czar and ABC News consultant , " and that we really have to replace our scanning devices with more modern systems . "
Clarke said full body scans were needed , " but they 're expensive and they 're intrusive .
They invade people 's privacy . "
Al Qaeda , said Clarke , is aware of this vulnerability in the U.S. airport security system .
" They know that this is a weakness and an Achilles ' heel in our airport security system and this is the second time they 've tried it . "
In 2001 , would - be " shoe bomber " Richard Reid failed in his attempt to blow up a transatlantic flight with a highly explosive chemical known as PETN .
He attempted to light a fuse to his shoe on a December 22 American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami but was subdued by other passengers .
According to investigators , the bomb on Northwest flight 253 , which was en route from Amsterdam to Detroit when suspect Umar farouk Abdulmutallab allegedly detonated it , contained more than 80 grams of PETN .
The material was allegedly sewn into Abdulmutallab 's underwear , and was not detected by airport security .
READ THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT AGAINST ABDULMUTALLAB HERE
The bomb was built and the plot organized , say U.S. officials , by al Qaeda leaders in Yemen , just north of the capital city of Sanaa .
Suspect Was On Terrorism Watch List
Authorities say the 23 - year - old suspect spent months in Yemen being trained for the Christmas Day suicide mission .
Investigators believe Abdulmutallab was connected to al Qaeda by the same radical imam , American - born Anwar Awlaki , who is linked to the American Army major accused of opening fire at Fort Hood in November .
According to investigators , the bomb used yesterday was built in Yemen by a top al Qaeda bomb maker .
Northwest Airlines flight 253 -- operated on a Delta airplane - was getting ready to land in Detroit just before noon Friday when " a passenger caused a disturbance , " said Delta spokeswoman Susan Chana Elliott .
The man , later identified as Abdulmutallab , was trying to ignite when was initially reported as firecrackers .
According to the criminal complaint filed against Abudlmutallab , he boarded KLM Flight 588 from Lagos , Nigeria and transferred to Northwest Flight 253 at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam .
Prior to the incident , Abdulmutallab went to the bathroom for about 20 minutes .
Upon returning to his seat , Abdulmutallab said he had an upset stomach , and pulled a blanket over himself .
Passengers then heard popping noises similar to firecrackers and smelled an odor .
Some saw Abdulmutallab's pants leg and the wall of the airplane on fire .
Passengers and crew then subdued Abdulmutallab and used blankets and fire extinguishers to put out the flames .
A passenger apparently saw the suspect holding what a partially melted and smoking syringe .
The passenger took the syringe , shook it to stop it from smoking and threw it to the floor .
Dutch filmmaker Jasper Schuringa has been identified in the media as a passenger who subdued Mutallab .
Abdulmutallab , who flew from Nigeria to Amsterdam and then Detroit , was taken into custody at the Detroit airport and was interviewed by authorities there .
He was then taken to an area hospital to be treated for burns .
Abdulmutallab was on a terrorism watch list , but not on a no - fly list .
Said Clarke , " So once again , we have the U.S. government , as in the case of the Fort Hood attacks , knowing about someone , knowing that they were suspicious , but that information did n't get to the right people in time . "

Tony Blair has never publicly commented on the EU president role
The UK has failed in its attempt to get Tony Blair chosen as the new president of the EU Council after the Belgian prime minister was handed the job .
Downing Street abandoned its campaign to put the ex-prime minister in the prestige job on Thursday after it was clear he did not have enough support .
But , in a surprise move , Labour peer Baroness Ashton was appointed to the new role of EU foreign affairs chief .
Gordon Brown said this " reinforced " the UK 's place " at the heart of Europe " .
' Effective ' " It will ensure Britain 's voice is very loud and clear , " he said .
Baroness Ashton is currently the EU's Trade Commissioner , a job in which Mr Brown said she had been " highly effective " .
Mr Brown said Baroness Ashton - who will also become vice - president of the European Commission - would represent the EU on the world stage .
Little - known outside the UK and not a high - profile figure in British politics , Baroness Ashton was formerly leader of the House of Lords .
Gordon Brown spent a great deal of energy and political capital trying to secure the presidency for Tony Blair
William Hague , shadow foreign secretary
In choosing Baroness Ashton , Mr Brown said he had been determined to protect the UK 's national interest in Europe .
Mr Blair had never publicly said he was in the running for the job of EU President - given to Belgium 's Herman van Rompuy - despite vocal support from Mr Brown .
The prime minister said that his predecessor would have made an " excellent candidate " and that he did not " apologise " for backing him .
However , he said it had become clear that the job was destined for a centre - right candidate and that the nature of the post had changed - making it less suitable for Mr Blair .
' Defeat for PM '
The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats welcomed the fact that Mr Blair had not got the job , saying he would have been a divisive figure .
" We did not agree with the Lisbon Treaty 's establishment of these posts but they are now a fact , " said shadow foreign secretary William Hague .
" We look to the President of the Council and the High Representative to ensure that the EU 's business as an association of nation states is conducted efficiently . "
" Gordon Brown spent a great deal of energy and political capital trying to secure the presidency for Tony Blair .
The summit 's result is a defeat for him . "

It has been months since Windows 7's successor has entered the planning and early development stages , and already Microsoft is taking aim at its competition deep inside its headquarters .
At least two of them , Apple and Google , are being scrutinized especially closely , according to sources within the company .
Despite the strong start Windows 7 has had , and Windows ' huge installed base , the company realizes that there are new challenges in the changing marketplace that have to be met head - on if the Windows brand is to continue to flourish .
Specifically , Microsoft is taking note of competitive pressures from Google , with its Android and Chrome operating systems , saying that the search giant " poses a whole new set of challenges . "
As for Apple , Microsoft noted that the company could not be forgotten , because there would still be the " the traditional competition " from Cupertino .
Linux was not explicitly mentioned , though this is likely because Microsoft believes it poses a bigger threat in the business space , and sources say this particular discussion looked at the consumer - facing aspects of the Windows brand .
Microsoft will focus on evolving and optimizing " the Windows brand experience , " specifically the " trifecta " of Windows brands for the consumer audience ( Windows 7 , Windows Live , and Windows phone ) in the years to come with Windows 8 and beyond , sources said .
More broadly , Microsoft leaders and colleagues will be trying to refine " the holistic brand strategy " for Windows Client , Windows Server , Windows Azure , and Windows Embedded .
Microsoft is planning to switch internal focus from Windows 7 to Windows 8 at the start of its next fiscal year in July 2010 , and according to a Microsoft roadmap , Windows 7's and Windows Server 2008 R2's successors are slated for release in 2012 .
Tidbits for Windows 8 will continue to come in till then , including more on where the branding of the operating system will be heading .
Stem cell treatment allows the blind to see again
Pioneering stem cell treatment by British scientists has restored the sight of those threatened with permanent blindness .
The technique has transformed the lives of patients who have lost their vision through injury or disease .
The procedure has so far been carried out only on those who have lost their sight in one eye .
But trials are already under way on patients who have damage to both their eyes - and millions could one day benefit from the treatment .
The technique involves growing stem cells from the patient 's ' good eye ' in the laboratory before transferring them to the damaged eye .
Among those who have already undergone the procedure is a have - a- go hero who lost the sight in one eye after being attacked with ammonia 15 years ago .
Russell Turnbull is one of the handful of patients who have been treated successfully by scientists and eye surgeons from the North East England Stem Cell Institute at Newcastle University .
Within a few weeks Mr Turnbull , 38 , found his sight back to the level when he was attacked on a bus journey home following a night out in Newcastle in 1994 .
As a ' guinea pig ' on a trial at the institute , researchers took a tiny amount of stem cells from Mr Turnbull 's good eye and grew them in a laboratory .
They were implanted in Mr Turnbull 's damaged right eye where they began to function as normal , restoring sight .
Yesterday , he said : ' I have my life back thanks to the operation . '
The technique avoids the need for drugs to suppress immunity because the patient 's own implanted cells cannot be rejected .
What is LSCD ?
LSCD is a painful , blinding disease that requires long - term , costly treatment with frequent clinic visits and intensive hospital admissions .
The vision loss due to LSCD often means social support is necessary due to the enormous impact on the patient 's quality of life .
This is magnified by the fact that LSCD mostly affects younger patients .
It is also the first procedure that does not use animal products to help grow the stem cells in the laboratory .
Scientists expect the technique to help hundreds of patients whose eyes have been damaged by contact lenses , in industrial accidents involving thermal or chemical injuries , and by diseases .
The procedure targets corneal cloudiness - known medically as limbal stem cell deficiency - which has been estimated to cause blindness in eight million sufferers worldwide each year and affects up to 10,000 in Britain .
Francisco Figueiredo , a consultant eye surgeon at the North East England Stem Cell Institute who co-led the project , said the breakthrough could potentially ' help millions of people ' .
' This technique we have been working on for the last three years has the potential to change people 's lives , ' he added .
' By doing an operation to transplant the stem cells we can restore their life back to normal . '
The research , published in the U.S. journal Stem Cells , has been used to help eight patients with corneal cloudiness in one eye , who have sufficient sight in the remaining eye to provide a supply of healthy stem cells .
But researchers are already carrying out trials involving patients who have damage to both eyes .
Mr Figueiredo said : ' I have a 74 - year - old patient who has not been able to see out of one eye for 54 years .
At the age of 20 he was attacked in the street with ammonia and lost his sight .
' Since then he has practically been unable to see out of that eye .
Now , having had the operation , he can see again .
It 's incredible .
Provided the blindness is caused by stem cell deficiency we can restore their sight using this technique . '
All clear :
The treatment has given Mr Turnbull sight in his damaged eye almost on par with the healthy eye , from which stem cells were taken for the surgery
Professor Michael Whitaker , co-director of the institute , said : ' Stem cells from bone marrow have been used successfully for many years to treat cancer and immune disease , but this is the first successful stem cell therapy using stem cells from the eye without animal products to treat disease .
Because the early results look so promising , we are thinking hard now about how to bring this treatment rapidly into the clinic as we complete the necessary clinical trials , so that the treatment can be shared with all patients that might benefit . '
A larger study involving 24 patients is under way with funding from the UK's Medical Research Council .
It 's Christmas time ( nearly ) and quite soon it will be impossible to switch on the radio without being bombarded by the preachy strains of a slightly shambolic Christmas song recorded 25 years ago in an effort to feed the world .
Band Aid's " Do They Know It 's Christmas ? " , written in haste by Bob Geldof of the Boomtown Rats and Midge Ure of Ultravox , was unprecedented .
Shocked by the BBC newsreader Michael Buerk 's report of the famine in Ethiopia , which claimed a million lives , and the distressing footage of children with distended stomachs in a bleak African landscape , Geldof and Ure strong - armed some of the biggest names of the 1980s music scene into making the charity record .
Geldof , whose own career was on the decline , pledged that every penny would go to the cause .
He even faced down Margaret Thatcher 's government which initially refused to waive VAT on the single but later relented .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
So at dawn on a bleak 24 November , Ure and Geldof turned up at the London studio of the record producer Trevor Horn , which he had donated for 24 hours as he was not able to work on the track .
The two musicians were armed with backing recorded the previous evening at Ure 's home studio .
It was also the perfect news story , and the world 's media were on hand as the biggest acts of the 1980s – Spandau Ballet , Duran Duran , George Michael , Sting , Bono and Adam Clayton of U2 , Paul Young and Bananarama – turned up to record their contributions .
Geldof even insisted that Boy George fly in from America – he turned up at six in the evening .
Ure and Geldof worked late into the night mixing the record , before Geldof went on the radio the next morning to plug it .
The resulting single , bolstered by media attention , sold a million copies in the first week of its release in early December 1984 , and went on to be the fastest - selling UK single of all time .
It stayed at No 1 for five weeks , clocking up sales of 3.5 million , the biggest selling UK single until Elton John 's Princess Diana tribute , " Candle in the Wind " , in 1997 .
Eventually , it raised £ 5 m for famine relief .
Two other versions – 1989's Band Aid II and 2004's Band Aid 20 , which both also hit No 1 – raised millions more .
There was more money from the Live Aid concert in 1985 and 2005 's follow - up , Live 8 .
In all , Geldof and Ure 's wheeze – copied in America as USA for Africa – put more than £ 150 m into famine relief .
The Band Aid Trust still has an income of about £ 2 m a year , which is spent in Ethiopia , Sudan , Uganda , Eritrea , Somalia and Nigeria .
It was meant to be the song that changed the world .
Only it did n't .
Twenty - five years on , famine stalks Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa again .
As The Independent on Sunday reported in August , millions of people in the Horn of Africa are facing malnutrition and starvation in the worst food shortages since 1984 .
The United Nations warned in June that as many as 6.2 million people in Ethiopia will need some kind of food aid in the next few months .
But the true figure of those with insecure food supplies could be as high as 13.7 million .
Twelve million Ethiopians received food from donor countries last year – Britain is the second biggest donor – most of it through the United Nation 's World Food Programme .
Aid agencies fear for this year 's harvest because of poor rain and critical water shortages .
The government in Ethiopia , however , remains reluctant to use the word famine .
Earlier this year , its prime minister , Meles Zenawi , said there was no danger of famine this year .
Ethiopia 's ambassador to Britain , Berhanu Kebede , insisted the problem was being tackled .
" We are addressing the problem .
Food is in the pipeline , " he said .
Ethiopia does n't want attention distracted from its achievements in education , trade and infrastructure .
But its population has doubled to 80 million since 1984 , and its rural economy is said to be less productive than that of medieval England .
" The [ Ethiopian ] government has just got to embrace the crisis and not be frightened of the statistics , " Gareth Thomas , a minister with the Department for International Development , said .
" It is different from 1984 , but there 's still huge need .
There 's got to be a recognition that if we are going to stop children from being malnourished and keep people alive , we have to have accurate information . "
I was one of the affected today .
Having worked at Pandemic for close to 5 years , it 's a bittersweet moment .
We literally just finished Saboteur and are extremely proud of the game it turned out to be , considering the amount of hardships we had during development .
On the other hand , we now have no job and are forced to part our ways with people we hold dear to our hearts .
I can tell you one thing .
The reason why the studio closed down has everything to do with the existing Pandemic management .
From what we were told , Pandemic management was given free reign to do as they please .
Time and time again , they dropped the ball with bad decisions ( promoting / keeping people based on loyalty , no production accountability , misallocation of resources , poor milestone objectives , no mentoring , etc. ) .
It 's a true shame , as there was a lot of talent and passion at the studio .
I would n't necessarily hate on JR and EA 's execs just yet .
In my eyes , they probably made the right decision as Pandemic cost a lot to upkeep and , quite frankly , the last few products were n't up to snuff .
I think many of you would be surprised how much a game like Saboteur costs to make ( think ~100 people for 3 years + ~ 20 people for ~ 2 years ) .
Add overhead cost to incompetence in management / direction and you have a pretty convincing case to cut your ties and call it a day .
It probably does n't look good for JR considering he made a cool 5 mil off of the sale of Pandemic / Bioware .
One more thing I will say : EA is totally sending Saboteur out to die .
And it 's a fucking shame .
It 's easily Pandemic 's best game yet .
Of course , I am a bit biased having worked on the game for so long .
If you were disappointed with Mercs2 and LOTR ( who was n't ) and enjoyed previous Pandemic games , give Saboteur a shot .
Gonna pour one out for my homies :
When Henri Becquerel spotted that photographic plates became fogged if kept in a drawer next to uranium salts , the discovery of radioactivity was immediate .
By contrast , other scientific findings – global warming , for instance – take place incrementally , the result of gradually accumulating evidence .
Last week , scientists announced a small but potentially significant step in our slowly evolving understanding of what the universe is made of .
Astronomers have long known the stars contain the same atoms as those found on Earth .
But for years evidence has been growing that most stuff in the cosmos is not made of atoms or subatomic particles at all , but Something Else .
The first inkling that the universe is dominated by unseen material came from the observations of clusters of galaxies made in the 1930s .
The astronomer Fritz Zwicky noticed that within the clusters , galaxies mill around so fast that the clusters ought to fly apart .
So what keeps them intact ?
The simplest explanation is that some form of dark matter provides the necessary gravitationally binding .
Today , cosmologists can put a precise figure on the amount of dark matter in the universe : about five times the mass of the luminous , common - or - garden variety of matter .
And its role in shaping the cosmos is crucial .
After the big bang that created the universe 13.7bn years ago , matter was spread smoothly through space .
Aided by the gravitating power of the dark component , ordinary matter was pulled into clumps , which later evolved into galaxies that spawned stars , planets and , in one case at least , life .
A consensus has emerged that dark matter mostly consists of massive particles coughed out of the big bang .
The reason for the appellation " dark " is because , unlike atomic particles , they have no electric charge , so can not emit or scatter light .
Nor do they feel the strong nuclear force that traps protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei .
As a result , the dark particles interact so feebly with ordinary matter that they mostly pass right through it .
The race to detect and identify these particles started in the 1980s .
Because the solar system orbits the galaxy at more than 200 km per second , it should be ploughing through an ocean of primordial dark matter .
As a result , there is a small probability that a dark matter particle will bump into an atomic nucleus and send it flying .
The challenge is to detect such a collision .
One such experiment , known as the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search , in Minnesota , has been gathering data for several years .
Now , following painstaking analysis , project scientists have declared that they have recorded a couple of likely looking dark matter events .
Theoretical physicists long ago predicted the existence of various weakly interacting massive particles .
One of these theories , called supersymmetry , links the nature of fundamental particles to the structure of space and time , and is an essential ingredient of string theory , the scheme that seeks to unify all nature .
Part of the rationale for building the Large Hadron Collider at Cern in Switzerland was to create what could be the very same particles that the Minnesota experiment may have detected coming from space .
Meanwhile , many other groups are planning experiments to elucidate the nature of dark matter .
Though it is too soon to open the champagne , if the Minnesota results are confirmed , they will represent nothing less than a transformation in our understanding of how the physical universe is put together .
The White House security procedures in place during last week ’s state dinner had been used at times during past administrations without problems , the Secret Service director said Thursday as he tried to explain how a Virginia couple managed to talk their way into one of the most heavily guarded buildings in the world .
A contrite Mark Sullivan told the House Homeland Security Committee that the breakdown was an isolated incident and not an institutional failure .
“ I believe it ’s due just to poor judgment , ” Sullivan told lawmakers , adding that three uniformed agents had been placed on paid administrative leave while investigators look into how Tareq and Michaele Salahi managed to attend a state dinner for the Indian prime minister without being on the guest list .
The pair of aspiring reality television stars -- as well as White House Social Secretary Desiree Rogers -- declined to testify Thursday .
That left Sullivan as the sole witness .
Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson ( D - Miss . ) emphasized that the matter was about “ real - world threats to the nation . ”
That did n’t stop him from playing to cameras , however , by placing two name cards in front of empty chairs when it was the Salahis ’ scheduled turn to speak .
Thompson said he would seek subpoenas for their testimony , but would not do the same for Rogers , despite Republican objections .
“ Ms. Rogers is not a central figure in this security matter , ” Thompson said .
Rogers ’ office has come under scrutiny for not posting staff members at security checkpoints -- a practice that ’s been used to support Secret Service agents at other state dinners , but not all White House functions , Sullivan said .
His agents have handled the guest list before , he said , although he did not know whether they had done so at a state dinner .
Last week , the agents were instructed to notify a supervisor and the White House social office if the name of someone seeking entry did not show up on the list , he said .
That did not happen .
“ This is the first time that we had a breakdown based on our people accepting ” responsibility for the guest list , Sullivan said .
The decision not to post White House staff at the checkpoints -- in addition to Secret Service -- was a joint recommendation agreed upon before the event , he said .
The White House has since said it will post staff at each gate as a matter of policy .
The incident has spawned more than a week of scrutiny of White House security procedures , with Sullivan repeatedly accepting blame .
But he pushed back Thursday when Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton ( D- D.C. ) suggested that the event may not have been properly staffed given reports of a rise in threats against President Obama .
Sullivan said that the number of threats against the nation ’s first black president was now “ at the same level it was ” during the two previous administrations .
In an interview Thursday with USA Today , Obama said that he was “ 100 % confident ” in his protection , though he acknowledged the system did n’t work as planned .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Manny Pacquiao ’s desire to take on Floyd Mayweather may not be enough to persuade the American to climb into the ring for a dream fight against the Filipino , promoter Bob Arum said on Thursday .
As Pacquiao returned to a hero ’s welcome in Manila on Friday following his impressive WBO welterweight title win over Miguel Cotto at the weekend , Arum cast doubt on a Mayweather showdown , saying the American might not want to blemish his perfect record .
“ But you have to understand Mayweather ’s psyche , ” Arum told reporters at a lunch saluting Yuri Foreman , who became the first Israeli to win a world title when he claimed the WBA super welterweight crown on the Pacquiao undercard .
“ Psychologically he may not be prepared to do this fight , ” Pacquaio promoter Arum added .
“ Now this is me being an amateur psychologist , but Mayweather is so tied up with the fact that nobody has beaten him , that he has a zero on his record , I do n’t know if he would be willing to go into the ring with anybody that could jeopardize that zero .
The 32 - year - old Mayweather , who has won titles at five different weight classes , has a 40 - 0 career record while Pacquiao , 30 , improved to 50 - 3 - 2 when he stopped Cotto in the 12th round in Las Vegas .

HIGHER FIGURES
“ He is afraid , terrified of losing that zero , ” said Arum , possibly in an effort to goad Mayweather into making the match .
“ That ’s why he ’s ducked ( Shane ) Mosely , ( Antonio ) Margarito and Cotto , and the question is will he duck Manny Pacquiao because he ’s so afraid of losing that zero . ”
Pacquiao , who won his seventh world title in an unprecedented seventh weight class , told a radio interviewer this week he wanted to fight Mayweather in what would be a showdown between the world ’s two best pound - for - pound boxers .
However , the Filipino threw the ball back in Mayweather ’s court with comments to local media at Manila airport .
“ We are not pushing the fight .
He should be the first to challenge me , after all I got a higher pay - per - view from my fight , ” the Inquirer newspaper quoted him as saying on its website ( www.inquirer.net).
Mayweather ’s last fight against Mexico ’s Juan Manuel Marquez in September , a victory by a unanimous points decision , drew a million pay - per - view buys .
Final figures are yet to be released but Pacquiao ’s stoppage win over Cotto is widely tipped to have generated more .
After being greeted by a media scrum at the airport , Pacquiao rode a flat - bed truck adorned with flags around the streets of Manila , drawing thousands of cheering fans .
Representatives of HBO
Boxing expressed confidence that Pacquiao and Mayweather would fight as welterweights in May , and Arum said he would try his best to arrange it .
“ Boxing is on such a roll now , not to do this fight would slow down considerably the momentum that boxing has , and that would be wrong , ” Arum said .
A Strange Old Tool . . . .

Thirty years since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
30 December 2009
In the press coverage of President Barack Obama ’s recent decision to deploy more US troops to Afghanistan , a historical milestone has gone curiously unmentioned — the 30th anniversary of the USSR ’s invasion of Afghanistan , which began on December 27 , 1979 .
An examination of the circumstances of this event undermines Obama ’s claims that American policy in Afghanistan is motivated by a “ war on terror , ” revealing instead the imperialist aims behind US policy .
At the time , President Jimmy Carter seized on the Soviet intervention — which aimed to suppress mujahadeen rebels fighting the Soviet - backed regime of the People ’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan ( PDPA ) — to undo a decade of détente and escalate tensions with the USSR .
This critical decision unleashed a conflict that would ultimately devastate Afghan society .
It emerged only years later that the Soviet invasion was itself a response to a deliberate US attempt to set up a new military front against the USSR in Afghanistan .
Even before the Soviet invasion , Washington was secretly assisting the mujahadeen , with the aim of provoking a Soviet intervention and trapping the USSR in a bloody quagmire .
The US foreign policy establishment ’s ultimate goal in pursuing this policy was to destroy the USSR and promote an expansion of US power in strategically located , oil - rich Central Asia .
In his 1996 memoir From the Shadows , Robert Gates , the current US secretary of defense , recalls US deliberations in the winter and spring of 1979 .
He describes a March 30 , 1979 meeting : “ Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Newsom stated that it was US policy to [ demonstrate ] to the Pakistanis , Saudis and others our resolve to stop the extension of Soviet influence in the Third World …
Walt Slocombe , representing Defense , asked if there was value in keeping the Afghan insurgency going , ‘ sucking the Soviets into a Vietnamese quagmire ? ’ ”
On July 3 , 1979 , President Carter authorized the CIA to fund and carry out propaganda for the Afghan rebels .
The CIA reportedly sent its first shipments to the mujahadeen that summer .
The Kremlin Stalinists , guided by purely military and nationalist calculations , fell squarely into the trap set by Washington .
The Soviet leadership thought that Afghan President Hafizullah Amin , from the PDPA ’s Khalq faction , was negotiating a separate deal with Washington to halt US aid to the mujahadeen .
Moscow feared that a pro-US regime in Kabul might let the US deploy Pershing missiles to Afghanistan , where they would be aimed at the USSR .
It also feared that the US would use Afghan Uzbeks and Tajiks for national - separatist propaganda aimed at Soviet Central Asia .
Carter administration National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski ( now one of the main mentors of Barack Obama ) publicly advocated an ethnic carve - up of the USSR .
As Soviet forces invaded , KGB commandos assassinated Amin .
In his place , Moscow installed Babrak Karmal , leader of the conservative Parcham wing of the PDPA , as president .
This was a signal to the ruling classes that the PDPA would abandon its partial land redistribution and other reform measures .
The Kremlin ’s strategy was to arrange a deal with Afghanistan ’s tribal elites , while crushing resistance to the PDPA regime with mass bombing raids .
Washington ’s policy towards the Soviet - Afghan war was marked by unsurpassed cynicism .
It unleashed a barrage of sanctimonious protests against an invasion it had helped promote , including organizing a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics .
As it sent billions of dollars in weaponry to the mujahadeen , it publicly denied that it was giving the rebels any assistance .
Though Washington proclaimed that its Afghan proxies were “ freedom fighters , ” the mujahadeen and their international backers were social reactionaries .
With the assistance of right - wing Muslim regimes such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan , the US promoted Islamic fundamentalist warlords within the resistance .
Washington turned a blind eye as they exterminated competing mujahadeen factions and funded themselves through large - scale opium sales .
When the mujahadeen proved incapable of organizing attacks on Kabul and strategic roadways , the CIA armed and trained international Muslim recruits to launch terrorist attacks and suicide bombings .
The young Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden oversaw these global recruitment networks , which later formed the core of Al Qaeda .
These networks gathered together recruits from the Muslim Brotherhood , those influenced by extremist Saudi Islam , and all the forces in the Muslim world that had historically been mobilized against the powerful socialist traditions of the Middle Eastern workers and intellectuals , including in Afghanistan .
Rising losses and popular discontent in the USSR prompted Moscow to withdraw its forces in 1989 .
This was followed by the Soviet collapse in 1991 and the 1992 collapse of the PDPA regime , as leading PDPA officials passed into the service of competing mujahadeen warlords .
Afghanistan descended into civil war .
The architects of US policy in Afghanistan have recorded their callous indifference to the consequences of their policies .
Asked in 1998 if he felt remorse about the Afghan tragedy , Brzezinski replied bluntly : “ What ’s more important to the history of the world ?
The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire ?
Some stirred - up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war ? ”
The world still faces the consequences of this eruption of US imperialist influence into Central Asia .
Great power competition — unleashed by the Afghan civil war — for dominant influence over Afghanistan , strategically located at the center of the Eurasian land mass , initially saw an attempt by the US , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to unify Afghanistan under the fundamentalist Taliban militia in the mid-1990s .
It culminated in 2001 in the US invasion and occupation of Afghanistan — carried out under the fraudulent banner of a “ war on terror ” — against the same forces Washington had supported in the 1980s and 1990s .
As it seeks to use its position in Afghanistan to enforce its hegemony over an unstable Asian continent , Washington faces the toxic political results of its policy in 1979 : Afghan narco - warlords , international terrorist networks , ex-Soviet republics socially devastated by the collapse of the USSR , and the general poverty of the region .
The catastrophes of the present emerge from crimes committed in the past .
The history of US imperialism ’s first major push into Central Asia must be understood in order to assess the consequences the current US escalation will have for the region and the world .

On Friday , the BLS announced that unemployment in November had edged down to 10 % , which was WAY better than analysts had been expecting .
The report was , arguably , the first major green shoot on the unemployment front .
( Though ominously , it came even as other measures of economic activity showed signs of backsliding in November . )
But before you crack open the champagne about one month , you should get some perspective
Nathan A. Martin at Nathan 's Economic
Edge has gone through all of the employment data , most of it out of the St. Louis Fed , and it paints a grim picture about how bad the employment situation really is .
The scope of the problem -- which has now become an obsession in Washington -- truly remains enormous .
Vic Chesnutt , a singer - songwriter of spare , idiosyncratic folk songs tinged with melancholy , died Christmas Day in Athens , Ga. , after taking an overdose of prescription muscle relaxants , a family spokesman said .
He was 45 .
Chesnutt had been admitted to Athens Regional Medical Center on Wednesday and died surrounded by “ devastated ” friends and family , according to Jem Cohen , a filmmaker and friend who produced Chesnutt ’s 2007 album “ North Star Deserter . ”
“ This is not a story of a rock star being on heroin or even drinking themselves down , ” Cohen said Friday in an interview with The Times .
“ The real story here is about someone who struggled against amazingly difficult odds for many years and managed to transcend those odds with almost unparalleled productivity and creativity and power in his work . ”
FOR THE RECORD :
Vic Chesnutt obituary :
The obituary of folk singer and songwriter Vic Chesnutt in Saturday ’s Section A misstated his date of birth .
He was born Nov. 12 , 1964 , not Nov. 11 . —
Paralyzed after a 1983 single - car accident when he was driving drunk at age 18 , Chesnutt had limited use of his arms and hands but nonetheless carved out a career as a songwriter , singer and guitarist .
He was discovered in the late - 1980s by REM frontman Michael Stipe , who championed his early recordings , and he gained the respect of music critics and fellow musicians who were struck by his darkly humorous songs .
Chesnutt tackled death and mortality head - on in his lyrics , as in “ It Is What It Is , ” from his new album “ At the Cut . ”
“ I do n’t worship anything , not gods that do n’t exist / I love my ancestors , but not ritually / I do n’t need stone altars to hedge my bet against the looming blackness / that is what it is . ”
In recent interviews he contemplated the challenges he faced as a wheelchair - using paraplegic with inadequate health insurance and mounting medical bills .
“ I ’m not too eloquent talking about these things , ” Chesnutt told The Times earlier this month .
“ I was making payments , but I ca n’t anymore and I really have no idea what I ’m going to do .
It seems absurd they can charge this much .
When I think about all this , it gets me so furious .
I could die tomorrow because of other operations I need that I ca n’t afford . ”
A prolific musician with a high , plaintive voice who recorded raw , intensely poetic albums with a rock edge in quick succession and maintained a rigorous performance schedule , Chesnutt had appeared Dec. 1 at the Echoplex in Echo Park in support of “ At the Cut . ”
In The Times interview , he called “ Flirted With You All My Life , ” a song on the new album , “ a suicide ’s breakup song with death . ”
“ I ’ve been a suicidal person all my life , and that song is me finally being , ‘ Screw you , death . ’ ”
Born Nov. 11 , 1964 , in Jacksonville , Fla. , Chesnutt grew up in Zebulon , Ga. , where his grandfather taught him to play the guitar .
After moving to Athens , Chesnutt began performing in clubs there and attracted the attention of Stipe , who produced his debut album , “ Little , ” in 1988 .
The albums “ West of Rome ” and “ Drunk ” followed , paving the way for his major - label debut “ About to Choke ” in 1996 .
That same year REM , the Smashing Pumpkins , Hootie and the Blowfish and others covered Chesnutt ’s songs for “ Sweet Relief II : The Gravity of the Situation , ” an all - star tribute album that benefited the foundation that raises money to help pay uninsured musicians ’ medical bills .
Chesnutt ’s survivors include his wife , Tina Whatley Chesnutt , who played bass with him , and his sister , Lorinda Crane .

To many of those who remember Ronald Reagan ’s presidency , his latter - day popularity is a little puzzling .
The Republican icon , who like George W. Bush produced skyrocketing federal deficits by advocating tax cuts even as he hiked military spending and -- also like Bush -- promoted laissez - faire regulatory policies that culminated in a home - loan crisis , is today so widely admired that even Democrats such as President Obama frequently praise him .
But if Americans ’ perceptions of Reagan are puzzling , Russians ’ perceptions of Josef Stalin are downright bizarre .
On Monday , hundreds of admirers of the former Soviet leader lined up in Moscow ’s Red Square to lay wreaths at his grave , in honor of the 130th anniversary of his birth .

Ivan Melnikov of Russia ’s Communist Party , the deputy parliament speaker , wrote on his party ’s website , “ We would very much like for any discussion of the mistakes of the Stalin epoch to be silenced today , so that people can reflect on Stalin ’s personality as a creator , a thinker and a patriot . ”
Not to mention a genocidal maniac .
The “ mistakes ” Melnikov would prefer not to discuss include a treacherous pact to divide Europe with Adolf Hitler , as well as bloody purges and engineered famines that killed tens of millions of Russians and rank high among the worst atrocities of the 20th century .
Stalin ’s cult of personality has been strengthening for nearly a decade , with open support from the Kremlin .
So popular is the Gardener of Human Happiness ( one of Stalin ’s many self - imposed titles ) that almost a third of Russians in a recent poll said the country needs a leader like him today .
Last year , when state - controlled broadcaster Rossiya TV asked online voters to choose history ’s greatest Russian , Stalin was reported to be leading in the polling until organizers threw out the votes and started over , saying the contest had been victimized by a spam campaign .
Medieval saint Alexander Nevsky emerged as the winner , though many Russians are convinced the outcome was fixed because a win for Stalin would have been too embarrassing .
It ’s widely believed that Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who recently said Stalin ’s legacy is too complex for any black - and - white assessment , is encouraging nostalgia for the dictator in order to build support for his own authoritarian rule .

Like those who aim to canonize Reagan , he has some big advantages :
The subject being reinvented is no longer around to demonstrate his many flaws , and memories are short .
Were sure GM CEO Fritz Hendersons resignation this afternoon would have been a shock to most , and even after the hours that have passed were still left wondering how the shock announcement came about .
Someone proclaiming to be the daughter of Henderson , Sarah Henderson , has gone some way as to explain what has happened , on General Motors official Facebook page of all places .
Sarah Henderson has posted a colorful rant attacking the chairman of the board of GM , Ed Whitacre , claiming that he was the reason behind Henderson 's resignation and is only out to help himself .

For Respublika it has been a long battle for survival .
In September bailiffs seized the opposition newspaper 's entire print run .
Working through the night , reporters retrieved the proofs from a USB flash disk , photocopied them , and stapled them together .
By 7 am they had churned out 2,000 homemade copies – not exactly a big edition , but a small symbolic victory in the struggle for media freedom in Kazakhstan .
Respublika 's long - running scrap with officialdom is n't unusual for Central Asia , a region not known for its pluralism .
What makes it extraordinary is that Kazakhstan is about to assume the chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) , the Vienna - based body devoted to democracy and press freedom .
On 1 January , Kazakhstan will become the first post -Soviet country to lead the organisation of 56 countries .
Since 2007 , when member states voted it OSCE chair , Kazakhstan 's own record on press freedom has worsened .
Respublika is known for its mocking criticism of Kazakhstan 's autocratic government , which has responded by repeatedly trying to close it .
In 2002 Respublika 's editorial office mysteriously burned down .
The arsonists left a headless dog dangling from a ground - floor window .
Attached to it was a note .
It read : " You wo n't get a second warning . "
Respublika now appears in text that cannot be read without squinting and is stuck together with a couple of staples .
The amateurish format is familiar to anyone who remembers the late Soviet Union .
" We 're the new samizdat , " Respublika 's deputy editor - in - chief , Oxana Makushina , explains in the paper 's small office in Almaty , Kazakhstan 's attractive former capital on the edge of the snowy Tian Shan mountains .
" When we outwitted the bailiffs we felt triumphant .
The next day all of our copies sold out immediately . "
Other Central Asian countries share Kazakhstan 's iron - fist approach to critical newspapers .
A bunch of variously repressive super - presidents rule all five post - communist Central Asian republics : Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan .
Kazakhstan 's ageing leader , Nursultan Nazarbayev , has been in the job for 18 years .
He shows no signs of retiring .
On the eve of its OSCE chairmanship , Kazakhstan 's broader human rights record is also causing alarm .
On 3 September the country 's most famous human rights activist , Yevgeny Zhovtis , was jailed for four years for knocking down and killing a pedestrian .
Zhovtis does not deny his role in the accident , but his unusually harsh punishment has provoked concern among human rights activists and western governments .
Government officials have tightened the screw on critical publications .
Last January Ramazan Esergepov , the editor of the Alma - Ata info portal , was arrested after publishing documents revealing corruption inside Kazakhstan 's spy agency .
He got three years in jail .
Then in April the opposition newspaper Tasjargan was closed down after reporting on a long - running scandal involving claims that a US oil fixer paid Nazarbayev and his associates $ 78 m in bribes .
Kazakhstan 's alarming slide on press freedom has embarrassed the EU countries , led by Germany , that backed its OSCE candidacy .
The Germans believed that giving the job to Kazakhstan would show that the OSCE was not a closed western club but was open to the former communist states of eastern Europe .
They also argued that democratic reform would be stimulated inside Kazakhstan , which would then serve as a model for the rest of the region .
In fact , the opposite happened .
Over the summer Kazakhstan passed a repressive internet law and legislation on defamation – in effect a prohibition on stories about corrupt officials .
At a meeting earlier this month in Athens , OSCE foreign ministers expressed concern at Kazakhstan 's democratic slide .
Kazakhstan , however , appears indifferent to western criticism .
Analysts say its leadership is more worried about internal revolt than international hand - wringing by European and US human rights groups .
" The new media laws are a legacy of the economic crisis and the Soviet mentality of our ruling elite , " Adil Kaukenov , a political analyst based in Almaty , said .
" They do n't know how to do it any differently . "
According to Kaukenov , Kazakhstan was making modest progress on democratic issues until late 2007 .
Then the credit that had fuelled the country 's economic boom – it is Central Asia 's most prosperous nation – suddenly dried up .
Officials were terrified that Kazakhstan might become engulfed in the kind of pro-reform uprising that took place in 2005 in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan , he said .
( Kyrgyzstan 's so - called Tulip revolution has since fizzled out . )
As well as muzzling the media , Kazakhstan 's elite has been busy with another project : transforming the president into a mythical national super - figure .
Already nicknamed " papa " , Nazarbayev is now portrayed by state - run television as a revered global statesman .
Nightly broadcasts include fawning testimonies from old school chums and ordinary Kazakhs .
Astana , the gleaming new capital in the northern steppes , has just got its first Nazarbayev statue .
Kazakhstan 's OSCE chairmanship is central to this giddy PR offensive .
Kazakhstan has proposed that , as well as hosting a meeting of foreign ministers next December , it holds the first OSCE summit for a decade to be attended by heads of state .
A summit would pander to Nazarbayev 's increasingly messianic pretensions .
Analysts suggest it would also enable Kazakhstan to assert its regional leadership role over its Central Asian neighbours .
The man who lobbied for Kazakhstan to get the OSCE job was Rakat Aliyev , Nazarbayev 's former son - in - law .
Aliyev , now the president 's bitter enemy , suggested the idea when he was Kazakhstan 's ambassador to Austria .
He fell out with Nazarbayev in 2007 and has since been divorced from the president 's daughter , sentenced to 20 years in prison for plotting a coup and stripped of all privileges .
Exiled in Vienna , Aliyev has been avenging himself against his former father - in - law .
Aliyev was once head of Kazakhstan 's committee on national security – the country 's equivalent of the KGB – and he has posted dozens of compromising conversations with Nazarbayev on his LiveJournal blog .
Kazakhstan responded by banning LiveJournal in 2008 .
It also pulled the plug on the satellite TV channel K+ after it broadcast an interview with Aliyev .
According to Andrei Grozin , an expert from Moscow 's Institute for the Study of the Commonwealth of Independent States , the group of former Soviet republics , Kazakhstan 's power structures are engulfed in a vicious clan war , with the security services pitted against the financial police and the prosecutor .
" Aliyev 's departure has been the trigger for the complete restructuring of the elite field in Kazakhstan , " Grozin said .
Opposition politicians express little optimism that Kazakhstan will change .
Nazarbayev , who turns 70 next year , has failed to anoint a successor .
None of Kazakhstan 's elections have met OSCE standards : widespread ballot - box stuffing and refusal of registration for opposition parties has been alleged .
The parliament has only one party – the ruling pro-presidential Nur -Otan faction won all the seats at the last election in 2007 .
" Nazarbayev is surrounded by a load of toadies .
They are prepared to do anything , not because they love him but because they see his epoch coming to an end , '' Zharmakhan Tuyakbay , the head of the opposition Azat party , said .
" They want big political positions . "
Tuyakbay , who stood unsuccessfully against Nazarbayev in the 2005 presidential election , said Kazakhstan had duped the Europeans over the OSCE .
" It 's absurdly cynical .
Kazakhstan is n't orientated towards the west .
It 's merely using the OSCE so it can boast to Kazakhs it leads Europe . "
Respublika 's latest troubles , meanwhile , began earlier this year when it reported that the state - owned BTA Bank was on the brink of bankruptcy .
The bank sued the weekly newspaper for damages .
A court near Almaty upheld the bank 's claim , fined the weekly $ 401,000 , and threw its print run in a lorry .
Government critics say that Respublika is an irresponsible scandal - sheet .
Its journalists say that the court proceedings are merely another politically driven attempt to crush the title .
Kazakh officials insist that the country 's media laws are not repressive but merely an attempt to strike a balance between media freedom and the interests of national security .
" I would strongly argue that there has been no concerted effort to stifle dissent , as people would like to say , " Roman Vassilenko , chairman of Kazakhstan 's foreign ministry international information committee , said .
He added : " Reporters need to know the rules of the game . "
Vassilenko pointed out that the OSCE was n't just concerned with democratic values but had two other " baskets " – security and economics .
' It 's a major misunderstanding in western Europe that the OSCE is only about monitoring elections and promoting human rights , " he said .
Kazakhstan , which had successfully avoided conflict between its ethnic Kazakh , Russian and other populations , planned to host an OSCE conference on tolerance and diversity , he said .
Asked why Kazakhstan had banned LiveJournal , Russia 's answer to Facebook , Vassilenko grew vague .
" I do n't know about that , " he said .
This is definitely not your average stroller .
Designer Joe Iacono shares a close relationship with the Oakley Brand and came up with the 2009 Kid Kustoms Oakley Roddler .
Oakley had no interest in strollers , per say , but as a coolest stroller on the planet for parents , especially dads … they built one with the ultimate Oakley theme .
Oakley has always been known for its Tuff , Airborne look so the theme is inspired by the p38 Lightning .
The stroller features : white wall tires , dual turbo covered wheels , Oakley badges , POWMIA support patches and tail wing grip handle bars to hold on tight as the Roddler hauls ass .

With the official unemployment rate at 10 % and the real unemployment rate over 18 % ( accounting for people who can only find part - time employment or have given up looking for work ) , it 's clear that job creation should be the country 's top priority .
That is why I firmly believe we need additional economic stimulus .
But this time we need to do it the right way .
Here are three steps we can take that will move the economy forward without increasing the federal budget deficit .
These steps will also dramatically reduce our trade ...
Let 's finish up this middleware discovery with " Do It Yourself " tutorial now .
Writing Middleware
PSGI middleware behaves like a normal PSGI application but wraps the original PSGI application , so from the server it looks like an application but from an application it looks like a server ( plays both sides ) .
A simple middleware that fakes HTTP user - agent would be like this :
# Wrapped application my $ app = sub { my $env = shift ; my $ who = $ env->{HTTP_USER_AGENT} =~ / Mobile Safari/ ? 'i Phone ' : ' non-iPhone ' ; return [ 200 , [ ' Content - Type ' , ' text / html ' ] , [ " Hello $ who " ] ] ; } ; # Middleware to wrap $ app my $ mw = sub { my $env = shift ; $ env->{HTTP_USER_AGENT} .= " ( Mobile Safari ) " ; $ app ->( $env ) ; } ;
The app would display " Hello iPhone " only if a request comes with iPhone browser ( Mobile Safari ) , but the middleware adds that phrase to all incoming requests , so if you run this application and open the page with any browsers , you 'll always see " Hello iPhone " .
And the default Access Log would say :
127.0.0.1 - - [ 23/Dec/2009 12:34:31 ]
" GET / HTTP /1.1 " 200 12 " -" " Mozilla / 5.0 ( Macintosh ; U ; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_2 ; en-us ) AppleWebKit/531.21.8 ( KHTML , like Gecko ) Version / 4.0.4 Safari/531.21.10 ( Mobile Safari ) "
You can see " ( Mobile Safari ) " is added to the tail of User - Agent string .
Make it a reusable Middleware
So that was a good example of writing your own middleware in .psgi .
If it is one - time middleware that you can quickly whip up then that 's great , but you often want to make it generic enough or reusable in other applications too .
Then you should use Plack : : Middleware .
package Plack : : Middleware :: FakeUserAgent ; use strict ; use parent qw ( Plack : : Middleware ) ; use Plack : : Util : : Accessors qw( agent ) ; sub call { my ( $ self , $ env ) = @_ ; $ env->{HTTP_USER_AGENT} = $ self -> agent ; $ self -> app ->( $env ) ; } ; 1 ;
That 's it .
All you have to do is to inherit from Plack : : Middleware and defines options that your middleware would take , and implement call method that would delegate to $ self -> app which is a wrapped application .
This middleware is now compatible to Plack : : Builder DSL so you can say :
use Plack : : Builder ; builder { enable " FakeUserAgent " , agent => " Mozilla / 3.0 ( MSIE 4.0 ) " ; $ app ; } ;
to fake all incoming requests as it comes with the good old Internet Explorer , and you can also use enable_if to conditionally enable this middleware .
Post process requests
The previous examples does pre-processing of PSGI request $env hash , what to do about the response ?
It 's almost the same :
my $ app = sub { ... } ; # Middleware to fake status code to 500 my $ mw = sub { my $env = shift ; my $res = $ app - > ( $env ) ; $ res - > [ 0 ] = 500 unless $ res - > [ 2 ] == 200 ; $res ; } ;
This is an evil middleware component that changes all the status code to 500 unless it 's 200 OK .
Not sure if there is any use for this but it 's simple enough for a quick example .
Because some servers implement special streaming interface to delay HTTP response , this middleware does n't really work with such an interface .
Dealing with this special callback interface in individual middleware is not efficient , so we have a special callback interface in Plack : : Middleware to make this easy :
package Plack : : Middleware :: BadStatusCode ; use strict ; use parent qw ( Plack : : Middleware ) ; sub call { my ( $ self , $ env ) = @_ ; my $res = $ self -> app ->( $env ) ; $ self ->response_cb ( $res , sub { my $res = shift ; $ res - > [ 0 ] = 500 unless $ res - > [ 0 ] == 200 ; } ) ; } 1 ;
Pass the response $res to response_cb and set the callback to wrap the real response , and the method takes care of the direct response and delayed response .
Namespaces
In this example we use Plack : : Middleware namespace to make middleware , but it does n't really have to be .
If you think your middleware is generic enough for all PSGI apps can benefit , feel free to use the namespace , but if the middleware is too specific for your own needs , or works only with a particular application framework , then use whatever namespace , like :
package MyFramework :: Middleware :: Foo ; use parent qw ( Plack : : Middleware ) ;
and then use the + ( plus ) sign to indicate the fully qualified namespace ,
enable '+ MyFramework : : Middleware :: Foo ' , ...;
Or use the non-DSL API ,
$ app = MyFramework : : Middleware :: Foo -> wrap ( $app , ... ) ;
and they should work just fine .

[ Focus — Thanks David Keyes ]
( CNN ) --
The night before she was killed on the streets of Tehran , the woman the world would come to know simply as Neda had a dream .
" There was a war going on , " she told her mom the next morning , " and I was in the front . "
Neda 's mother had joined her in the street protests that erupted after Iran 's disputed June 12 presidential election .
But on that fateful morning , she told her daughter she could n't go with her .
As Neda prepared to leave , the mother was filled with anxiety .
" I told her to be very careful , and she said she would . "
More than four months after Neda 's death , her mother , Hajar Rostami , described the pain her family has endured and how grateful they are to millions across the world who have hailed Neda as a martyr -- a symbol of freedom for Iran .
She spoke with CNN by phone in her native Farsi from her home in Tehran a few days ago .
" As a message to everyone , I really want to thank the whole world , " she said .
" And I do n't really know how to thank them , so I ask of you : Please find the right words for me .
" I can't tell you how much it has warmed our hearts , how much it 's helped us . "
There is a Farsi expression that describes a grieving person 's need to talk about the pain in her heart , to empty her soul .
And that 's what this is : a mourning mother who for months has wept and cried -- and remained silent about her daughter 's killing , until now .
" This is a pain that will never heal , " she said in a gentle , hushed tone .
Watch mom mourn the " look in her eyes "
' I need not worry '
On June 20 , Neda Agha -Soltan , 26 , headed to Tehran 's Nilofar Square , where thousands of protesters gathered .
Clashes were particularly intense that day , with demonstrators and riot police squaring off .
Neda , accompanied by her music teacher , called home with frequent updates .
" Mom , there are just too many clashes going on .
There are a lot of police and forces around . "
Tear gas was lobbed at the crowd .
Neda headed to a medical clinic to get her eyes washed .
" My eyes are really burning hard , " she said .
Twenty minutes later , Neda 's mom reached her again .
" She said she was on her way back home -- that I need not worry . "
Neda told the same thing to her aunt and uncle , who also called to check up on her .
Wearing blue jeans , a black shirt and white sneakers , Neda walked toward her car , parked on a side street not far from the heated protests .
" It did n't occur to her that anything was going to be different , " her mother said .
Then , Neda was killed .
A single bullet struck her chest .
Recalling that day , her mother paused in the hourlong interview .
The family , she said , has gone back to the scene and retraced Neda 's movements .
" She was only 26 steps from her car . "
Those were 26 steps Neda never had a chance to take -- the difference between returning home to her family and becoming a symbol of a greater struggle inside Iran .
' She was absolutely beautiful '
While millions across the globe were transfixed by Neda 's death , captured on video , her family entered a traditional seven - day grieving period .
Her parents ' house was too small to host everyone ; they gathered at Neda 's older sister 's home .
The family , Neda 's mother said , was barred from holding a memorial service .
" I did see Neda when her body was being washed before burial , " she said .
" When her body was covered in the white shroud for burial , when they uncovered her face , I saw her .
She was absolutely beautiful -- with a smile , a beautiful smile .
Like an angel . "
It was during the seven days of mourning , around the third or fourth day , that a relative told her about the video of Neda 's death , by then widely watched on the Internet .
The mother did n't watch it that first week .
" But when I returned home , I did see the video , " she said .
" It was enormously painful .
So painful that I 've never been able to watch it again all the way through to the end .
" It was the moment of seeing her give her life , the life leaving her body .
That was very painful .
The look in her eyes at that moment .
I wake up with that look in her eyes every morning ; I go to bed with the image of that look in her eyes every evening . "
She continued , " I want to say that the moment that bothers me the most -- that bothers me terribly -- is the moment Neda got shot .
That 's because Neda was an extremely brave person .
Ever since she was a child , she was brave and fearless .
So that moment when she got shot , I saw it in the video , she could n't believe it -- that she had taken a bullet .
So much so that she takes a look at her body .
And when she sees she 's been shot , she takes a few steps backwards and then falls .
The only words she managed to utter was : ' Teacher , I 'm burning . '
And people said she passed within 44 seconds . "
The mother visits Neda 's grave every Friday .
She 's heartened that even now , throngs of people still greet her -- " It 's as though she just passed away . "
She carries with her a painting of her smiling daughter that she received as a gift .
" People go and write on her grave in red ink the word ' martyr , ' " she said , " and then the authorities go and wipe it off . "
Blog : Behind the scenes with Neda 's mom
She said her daughter 's killer is still at large , but she 's confident the person will be found and tried in court .
" I am waiting for that day . "
" I saw Neda as a martyr from the start .
Neda was a martyr for her homeland . "
A ' caring ' debater
Long before Neda became a household name , she was a " very excited girl " who always had answers for everything .
" She was very well tempered and very friendly and very emotional and caring -- extremely emotional and caring , " her mother said .
" She was never the type of girl who would submit to force . "
In their last face - to - face conversation , the mother and daughter debated the political climate inside Iran .
" We had a hearty debate and discussion , " her mother said .
Neda 's favorite activity was aerobics .
She also liked to sunbathe at a local swimming pool .
Her final meal was her favorite dish : pan kabob .
Neda was divorced , her mother said .
After the divorce , Neda tried to get a job , but it was impossible .
Every time she went for interviews or filled out an application , she felt people looked at her differently .
" So she decided she was going to stay home . "
That home is now adorned with photographs of Neda .
One of her last gifts to her mom was perfume , a birthday present she cherishes .
" On a daily basis , when I want to think of her , I can't tell you how hard it is .
It 's too hard to be able to speak . "
Neda , the middle of three children , shared her room with her younger brother .
He played guitar and violin .
Neda loved the piano , and wanted him to learn to play .
Just days before she was killed , she picked out a piano for him .
He has since purchased it .
" When he comes home from work every evening , " the mother said , " he plays the piano and sings in Neda 's memory .
And that 's what keeps us going every evening . "
She hopes the people of Iran and the world will hear her story -- Neda 's story -- and never forget her daughter .
" I just want to thank you for remembering her .
It 's that which stays with me , and it's her eyes , the look in her eyes in those last moments that had a story to tell that I can never forget , " she said .
" Neda has made me enormously proud . "
It is tradition in Iran to give away personal belongings of a loved one after they die .
But Neda 's bed , her makeup stand , her photographs -- everything that was hers -- remains untouched .
The reason : Neda appeared in her sister 's dream and told her not to part with anything .
" I am alive , " Neda said .
Guttenberg 's Plans to Talk To Taliban The Beginning Of The End Of Afghanistan
More and more , it seems the West will have to negotiate with moderate elements of the Taliban if they want to get out of Afghanistan .
Germany 's defense minister was against it in the past .
But now he 's changed his tune .
And rightfully so , since that is the only way to start a German exit strategy off .
Von Olaf Ihlau
As part of the $ 787 - billion economic stimulus package enacted in February , Washington sent a $ 250 check to every adult on Social Security .
every adult on Social Security .
The same amount went to those enrolled in Veterans Administration , Railroad Retirement and Supplemental Security Income benefit programs .
The purpose of the one - time payments was to boost consumer spending and help revive the economy .
But in President Obama ’s view , once was not enough .
On Wednesday , he urged Congress to spend $ 13 billion on a second round of $ 250 checks , saying , “ Even as we seek to bring about recovery , we must act on behalf of those hardest hit by this recession . ”
The next morning , the government announced that Social Security benefits would not go up automatically next year .
For the first time since Congress tied benefits to the consumer price index in 1975 , there was no increase in the cost of living .
In a masterful bit of spin , the head of the Social Security Administration said that the lack of a cost - of - living adjustment made it all the more important for Congress to approve another $ 250 bonus .
But that ’s looking at the situation through the wrong end of the telescope .
The decline in prices means that seniors will be able to buy more with the dollars they ’re already receiving .
Some advocates for seniors argue that the government ’s yardstick for inflation underestimates the effect of rapid increases in the cost of prescription drugs .
But even an experimental version of the consumer price index that ’s focused on the elderly found that the cost of living went down over the last year , not up .
The president ’s proposal might have more of a Robin Hood quality -- after all , his “ pay czar ” just persuaded departing Bank of America Chief Executive Ken Lewis to give up $ 2.5 million in salary -- if the new checks were aimed only at the poor .
But they are n’t .
Everyone collecting Social Security would be included , regardless of wealth .
Perhaps Obama ’s real goal here is to win points with seniors and their advocacy groups , quelling some of the anger simmering over proposals to cut the Medicare Advantage program to help finance the healthcare reform effort .
Living on a fixed income is tough for many Americans .
But so is being unemployed , or maintaining a business when sales are slow and credit is hard to come by .
And although the average Social Security payment is n’t much -- it ’s less than $ 1,200 a month -- there ’s no cost - of - living justification for increasing it .
If the president wants to try again to stimulate the economy , all options should be on the table .
He should explain why paying $ 250 to this group of beneficiaries would do more for the economy than other uses of the money .
And if lawmakers agree , they should find a way to pay for the next round of checks out of the $ 787 billion already approved but not yet spent .
Death Denial
Why the sudden surge in climate change denial ?
Could it be about something else altogether ?
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 2nd November 2009
There is no point in denying it : we ’re losing .
Climate change denial is spreading like a contagious disease .
It exists in a sphere which cannot be reached by evidence or reasoned argument ; any attempt to draw attention to scientific findings is greeted with furious invective .
This sphere is expanding with astonishing speed .
A survey last month by the Pew Research Centre suggests that the proportion of Americans who believe there ’s solid evidence that the world has been warming over the past few decades has fallen from 71 % to 57 % in just 18 months ( 1 ) .
Another survey , conducted in January by Rasmussen Reports , suggests that , due to a sharp rise since 2006 , US voters who believe that global warming is the result of natural causes ( 44 % ) now outnumber those who believe it is caused by human action ( 41 % ) ( 2 ) .
A study by the website Desmogblog shows that the number of internet pages proposing that manmade global warming is a hoax or a lie more than doubled in 2008 ( 3 ) .
The Science Museum ’s Prove it !
exhibition asks online readers to endorse or reject a statement that they ’ve seen the evidence and want governments to take action .
As of yesterday afternoon , 1006 people had endorsed it and 6110 had rejected it ( 4 ) .
On Amazon.co.uk , books championing climate change denial are currently ranked at 1,2,4,5,7 and 8 in the global warming category ( 5 ) .
Never mind that they ’ve been torn to shreds by scientists and reviewers , they are beating the scientific books by miles .
What is going on ?
It certainly does n’t reflect the state of the science , which has hardened dramatically over the past two years .
If you do n’t believe me , open any recent edition of Science or Nature or any peer - reviewed journal specialising in atmospheric or environmental science .
Go on , try it .
The debate about global warming that ’s raging on the internet and in the rightwing press does not reflect any such debate in the scientific journals .
An American scientist I know suggests that these books and websites cater to a new literary market : people with room - temperature IQs .
He did n’t say whether he meant Fahrenheit or Centigrade .
But this ca n’t be the whole story .
Plenty of intelligent people have also declared themselves sceptics .
One such is the critic Clive James .
You could accuse him of purveying trite received wisdom , but not of being dumb .
On Radio
Four a few days ago he delivered an essay about the importance of scepticism , during which he maintained that “ the number of scientists who voice scepticism [ about climate change ] has lately been increasing .
” ( 6 ) He presented no evidence to support this statement and , as far as I can tell , none exists .
But he used this contention to argue that “ either side might well be right , but I think that if you have a division on that scale , you ca n’t call it a consensus .
Nobody can meaningfully say that the science is in . ”
Had he bothered to take a look at the quality of the evidence on either side of this media debate , and the nature of the opposing armies – climate scientists on one side , rightwing bloggers on the other – he too might have realised that the science is in .
In , at any rate , to the extent that science can ever be , which is to say that the evidence for manmade global warming is as strong as the evidence for Darwinian evolution , or for the link between smoking and lung cancer .
I am constantly struck by the way in which people like James , who proclaim themselves sceptics , will believe any old claptrap that suits their views .
Their position was perfectly summarised by a supporter of Ian Plimer ( author of a marvellous concatenation of gibberish called Heaven and Earth ( 7 ) ) commenting on a recent article in the Spectator .
“ Whether Plimer is a charlatan or not , he speaks for many of us ” ( 8 ) .
These people are n’t sceptics ; they ’re suckers .
Such beliefs seem to be strongly influenced by age .
The Pew report found that people over 65 are much more likely than the rest of the population to deny that there is solid evidence that the earth is warming , that it ’s caused by humans or that it ’s a serious problem ( 9 ) .
This chimes with my own experience .
Almost all my fiercest arguments over climate change , both in print and in person , have been with people in their 60s or 70s .
Why might this be ?
There are some obvious answers : they wo n’t be around to see the results ; they were brought up in a period of technological optimism ; they feel entitled , having worked all their lives , to fly or cruise to wherever they wish .
But there might also be a less intuitive reason , which shines a light into a fascinating corner of human psychology .
In 1973 the cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker proposed that the fear of death drives us to protect ourselves with “ vital lies ” or “ the armour of character ” ( 10 ) .
We defend ourselves from the ultimate terror by engaging in immortality projects , which boost our self - esteem and grant us meaning that extends beyond death .
Over 300 studies conducted in 15 countries appear to confirm Becker ’s thesis ( 11 ) .
When people are confronted with images or words or questions that remind them of death they respond by shoring up their worldview , rejecting people and ideas that threaten it and increasing their striving for self - esteem ( 12 ) .
One of the most arresting findings is that immortality projects can bring death closer .
In seeking to defend the symbolic , heroic self that we create to suppress thoughts of death , we might expose the physical self to greater danger .
For example , researchers at Bar - Ilan University in Israel found that people who reported that driving boosted their self - esteem drove faster and took greater risks after they had been exposed to reminders of death ( 13 ) .
A recent paper by the biologist Janis L Dickinson , published in the journal Ecology and Society , proposes that constant news and discussion about global warming makes it difficult for people to repress thoughts of death , and that they might respond to the terrifying prospect of climate breakdown in ways that strengthen their character armour but diminish our chances of survival ( 14 ) .
There is already experimental evidence suggesting that some people respond to reminders of death by increasing consumption ( 15 ) .
Dickinson proposes that growing evidence of climate change might boost this tendency , as well as raising antagonism towards scientists and environmentalists .
Our message , after all , presents a lethal threat to the central immortality project of Western society : perpetual economic growth , supported by an ideology of entitlement and exceptionalism .
If Dickinson is correct , is it fanciful to suppose that those who are closer to the end of their lives might react more strongly against reminders of death ?
I have n’t been able to find any experiments testing this proposition , but it is surely worth investigating .
And could it be that the rapid growth of climate change denial over the past two years is actually a response to the hardening of scientific evidence ?
If so , how the hell do we confront it ?

A 55 - year - old woman has been found guilty by a jury of stabbing a teenage boy in her care after he refused to stop playing a games console .
Isobel Mackenzie , of Inverness , had denied assaulting the 13 - year - old boy to the danger of his life .
A trial at Inverness Sheriff Court heard that the pair had punched and kicked each in an earlier row about him wanting to connect to the internet .
Sheriff Margaret Neilson called for background reports before sentencing .
Mackenzie had earlier admitted wilfully neglecting the youngster by being in a drunken state while the boy was in her care .
Sentencing was set for 22 December .
In a meeting with editors and reporters of the Washington Post , Kaine ( D ) said Deeds squandered the opportunity to sell his own appealing life story as a guy who had overcome long odds and economic disadvantage .
Instead , the rural state senator took the advice of campaign consultants who wrongly assumed Deeds 's Democratic support was solid and believed he should instead focus on wooing independents by attacking Republican Robert F. McDonnell .
" After the [ June ] primary was done , his advisers basically said , distance yourself from the president .
We think we have our base locked down , we 've got to win independents .
And we 're going to win by being negative about McDonnell , " Kaine said .
" That was the basic strategy they pursued , despite some significant urging to the contrary . "
Asked about his own advice to Deeds , who lost to McDonnell on Nov. 3 by 17 percentage points , Kaine said : " I 'd rather not talk about my personal conversations .
But what I will say is that I always believed from the very beginning that the paradigm in Virginia had changed and that the way to win the race was to energize voters who had demonstrated they would vote for Democrats .
That I did advise him very , very early .
I advised all the candidates , prior to the primary , that was a path to victory . "
Kaine said the key to victory for Democrats in a highly competitive Virginia is recognizing that party members need not be " apologetic " about their affiliation to find success .
He noted that about 200,000 more people voted in the Democratic primary for president on a frigid February day in 2008 than cast ballots for Deeds this year , and said McDonnell successfully spooked Deeds by suggesting that Virginians had grown anxious about the Democratic agenda .
" I think the issue of being nervous about the Virginia electorate was overdone and I think Creigh did exactly what the McDonnell campaign hoped he would do , which was distance himself from the president and national issues , " Kaine said .
To be kind , Obama 's DNC head , Tim Kaine , is n't exactly from the Howard Dean mold and does n't quite represent the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party .
Generally speaking , the outgoing governor of Virginia represents the Establishment or , in Paul Krugman 's words about his kind of Democrats , " corporate tools , defending special interests . "
What he has in common with Dean , though , is that he 's smart and he likes to win .
There are n't many people better positioned to analyze the spectacular defeat earlier this month of conservative Democrat Creigh Deeds to succeed him in the governor 's mansion .
Deeds turned Obama 's startling 6 - point win in Virginia last year into an 18 - point ass - whooping this year .
How did he do what Republicans have n't been able to accomplish ?
Kaine admitted Deeds was " unable to energize his base , falling into a Republican trap that led him to shrink from the president and his policies , " what Blue Dogs and cowardly conservative Democrats are doing across the country , where quasi-Democrats like John Barrow ( Blue Dog - GA ) , Parker Griffith ( Blue Dog - AL ) , Travis Childers ( Blue Dog - MS ) , Glenn Nye ( Blue Dog - VA ) , Bobby Bright ( Blue Dog - AL ) , Frank Kratovil ( Blue Dog - MD ) , Ann Kirkpatrick ( D - AZ ) and John Adler ( D - NJ ) are preparing to cede their seats to Republicans by re-enacting Deeds ' catastrophic campaign strategy .
When Deeds declared he would opt out of the public option -- the public option being a winner nationally and anwinner among Democrats -- he opted out of any chance for a victory .
What Deeds did was completely de-incentivize the Democratic base to turn out -- why bother if he 's just going to be the same piece of crap as the Republican ?-- and not only doomed his own chances but killed Democrats in state legislative races where a strong turnout from the base was essential .
Now , look at that motley list of supposed Democrats above .
Let 's start with their overall voting records this session .
These are the ProgressivePunch rankings of substantive votes this year : John Barrow ( Blue Dog - GA ) - 29.41 Parker Griffith ( Blue Dog - AL ) - 17.65 , worse than 3 conservative Republicans !
Travis Childers ( Blue Dog-MS ) - 25.29 Glenn Nye ( Blue Dog-VA ) - 25.49 Bobby Bright ( Blue Dog - AL ) - 23.53 Frank Kratovil ( Blue Dog-MD ) - 29.41 Ann Kirkpatrick ( D - AZ ) - 34.00 John Adler ( D - NJ ) - 38.00
All of these " Democrats " vote far more frequently with the Republicans than they do with their fellow Democrats -- especially on the important issues that are meaningful to people 's lives .
Remember Krugman 's words .
He was talking about this crew : " corporate tools , defending special interests . "
It describes each and every one of them .
On top of that , let 's take a look at how they voted on two issues that are of the utmost importance to the Democratic base -- the ones who propelled Obama to victory , gave both houses of Congress to the Democrats , and are essential if any of these galoots hopes to not repeat what happened to Creigh Deeds and last year 's most pathetic losers , Don Cazayoux ( Blue Dog - LA ) and Nick Lampson ( Blue Dog - TX ) .
Both votes came up 2 weeks ago on the same extraordinary Saturday session , one to make it more difficult for women to exercise their constitutional right to reproductive choice and the other for the highly popular health care reform bill .
Among the 64 Democrats voting against women were Boehner Boys Barrow , Bright , Childers , and Griffith .
And among the 39 Democrats to cross the aisle and vote with Republicans against health care reform were Adler , an egregious Insurance Industry shill , Barrow , Bright , Childers , Griffith , Kratovil , and Nye .
Although these corrupt members are already looking forward to their lives as K Street lobbyists , Kaine is hoping more reasonable conservative Democrats -- like himself -- will take the right lesson from Deeds ' massacre and " be more supportive of Obama 's policies , not less , as they contemplate their reelection efforts next year .
"
We are running an ongoing campaign to replace Blue Dogs with real Democrats , and we are already in gear with Regina Thomas and Marcy Winograd , respectively running against John Barrow and Jane Harman .
Please take a look at what we 're trying to do at the link just above .
Are these the kinds of people -- regardless of what party they happen to claim they 're in -- you want to see in leadership positions in our country ?

[ UPDATED , 5:05 p.m. : Pennsylvania State University is looking into the issues raised in the emails , as well ( pdf file at preceding link ) .
The University statement is below .
A short story in The Times on the developments is here .
Hat tip to Keith Johnson at Environmental Capital . ]
As the University of East Anglia investigates the disclosure of thousands of e-mail messages and documents from its Climatic Research Unit , as well as the implications of the contents for its climate research , the head of the unit is stepping aside .
Here is the news release :
Prof .
Phil Jones has today announced that he will stand aside as director of the Climatic Research Unit until the completion of an independent review resulting from allegations following the hacking and publication of e-mails from the unit .
Professor Jones said : “ What is most important is that CRU continues its world leading research with as little interruption and diversion as possible .
After a good deal of consideration I have decided that the best way to achieve this is by stepping aside from the director ’s role during the course of the independent review and am grateful to the university for agreeing to this .
The review process will have my full support . ”
Vice Chancellor Prof. Edward Acton said : “ I have accepted Professor Jones ’s offer to stand aside during this period .
It is an important step to ensure that CRU can continue to operate normally and the independent review can conduct its work into the allegations .
We will announce details of the independent review , including its terms of reference , timescale and the chair , within days .
I am delighted that Prof. Peter Liss , F.R.S. , C.B.E. , will become acting director . ”
For more than a week , the episode has fueled a fierce debate on the blogosphere and in newspaper columns and once again placed global warming science under intense scrutiny .
Presuming that the inquiry is as independent , probing and transparent as advertised , some clarity may emerge on many fronts .
[ UPDATE , 5:05 p.m. ]
Here ’s a statement issued on Tuesday by Pennsylvania State University on the issues raised in the emails :
The image was captured at 50 frames per second over 20 seconds with a rapid - fire X - ray camera .
It 's part of speech researcher Christine Ericsdotter 's work to precisely capture and build a computer model of the intricate movements of the tongue , lips , pharynx and jaw during speech .
Consumer confidence and expectations have risen , and more employers are planning to hire workers in 2010 , according to studies released Tuesday , signaling increasing economic strength .
A consumer expectations index formulated by the Conference Board rose to its highest level in two years , but Americans still feel pessimistic about their current state .
The nonprofit organization ’s “ present situation index ” fell to its lowest point in 26 years .
“ While the worst of the economic times are behind us , it ’s not euphoria , ” said Lynn Franco , director of the board ’s Consumer Research Center .
“ Confidence is stronger than when we started the year , but for much of the last several months we ’ve been moving sideways . ”
The consumer confidence index rose to 52.9 in December , a three - month high after increasing to 50.6 in November from October ’s 48.7 and February ’s historic low of 25.3 .
But confidence is still shaky , according to the index , which last reached a “ stable ” 90.6 reading in 2007 .
The data are based on a monthly survey conducted by research firm TNS covering a sample of 5,000 U.S. households .
Consumer spending , however , is still moving ahead at “ fairly respectable rates , ” said Brian Bethune , chief U.S. financial economist for IHS Global Insight .
But the steep discounts and inventory clearance sales that are helping spending now could create a vacuum in early 2010 .
“ Barring a New Year ’s miracle in the labor markets , it will be an enormous challenge to maintain forward momentum on real consumer spending early next year , ” he said in a statement .
Still , expectations are high for the next six months , buoyed by improvements in the business and labor markets .
The Conference Board expectations index jumped to 75.6 from 70.3 in November , reaching the highest level since the 75.8 recorded in December 2007 .
But worries about short - term income , which Franco said probably would affect spending early in the new year , dragged down the present - situation index to 18.8 from 21.2 in November .
The index hit a low of 17.5 in February 1983 .
A separate report by online jobs site CareerBuilder.com had more mixed news .
While 20 % of employers said they would add full - time , permanent workers in 2010 , compared with 14 % who said they would do so in 2009 , actual job growth probably wo n’t arrive until the second quarter .
“ There have been many signs over the past few months that point to the healing of the U.S. economy , especially the continued decrease in the number of jobs lost per month , ” CareerBuilder.com Chief Executive Matt Ferguson said in a statement .
Just 9 % of employers intend to cut workers in 2010 , while 16 % said they would swing the ax in 2009 .
Another 61 % said their staffing levels probably would stay the same , according to the study , which surveyed more than 2,700 hiring and human resource professionals in November .

The Tragedy of One Laptop Per Child
It did n’t come as much as a surprise , but the good folks working on the One Laptop Per Child Project announced that the that the OLPC XO - 2 concept had been shelved and in what appears to be bowing to the hype of tablet form factors , they ’ve announced the new XO - 3 .
Yawn .
Feels like we ’ve been here before and you know why ?
It ’s because we have .
Like the mythical predecessors that came before it , the new device is said to have an 8.5 x 11 inch touch screen made by Pixel Qi with an indoor / outdoor display , use inductive charging ( like the Palm Pre ) , will be waterproof and cost no more than $ 100 .
Of course , you ca n’t buy or order one as they ’re targeting 2012 for the ship date .
I ’ve been asked by a few folks how the OLPC project could manage this with their current specifications and the answer is simple : they wo n’t be able to .
In the meantime , some other interim device based on the original model , with slightly more functional specs is to be released .
This is another case of more time and money being wasted on a dubious and unobtainable dream .
I ’ve talked in the past about why this program is not a good idea but forget that for a moment .
Let ’s assume we all agree that education in emerging markets is critical .
We know that while there ’s no silver bullet to cure the ills of society , education comes pretty close .
Today , that means education with the ability to be part of the digital community .
This project is not the answer .
Look at the issues related to the notion of the $ 100 laptop ( which ended up costing a lot more than a $ 100 and will continue to do so ) such as who will program them ?
How will they be repaired ?
What ’s the courseware and curriculum ?
Now listen to the answers ( mostly , the kids will do it all ) and you realize there ’s a real problem as a good deal of this intended market is illiterate .
As this project continues to fail , those countries that have gambled and invested in it do not have the money and resources for a “ do over ” .
While there ’s been a lot of flaming about those who are bringing up objections to the project , this is something that ’s too important to get wrong and it ’s time to start thinking elsewhere and thinking in a different way how to solve this problem .
It ’s not clear to me that there ’s one correct approach to the problem , but it does seem like the one approach that got all the attention and the buzz had the most margin for error and little chance for success .
At the same time , there needs to be a re-think on the degree of priority of computers in emerging markets .
One of the most talked about features of the first OLPC prototypes were the hand cranks to power them .
Did no one ever consider that in places where computers need to be cranked to powered there might be more pressing issues than getting on the internet and using Twitter ?
Such as ; Electricity ?
Medicine ?
Clean water ?
While a noble concept in the ideal , it ’s time to call the OLPC project and it ’s all gimmicks , odd promotions ( such as the “ Give One , Get One ” , where US citizens could “ buy ” an OLPC at double the cost , with the idea that the other one would be given away .
It was a failed program two years running and mercifully not repeated this year ) what it is , a failure .
Let ’s get companies such as Apple , Microsoft , Intel , IBM , HP and Google among others to tackle the issue of global literacy in the digital age as a product they must all share the burden in and reap the rewards .
Education is indeed a silver bullet that can cure much of what ails society , but at the same time focus must be kept on real issues such as clean water , food to eat and elimination of disease .
More money spent on a mythical tablet that will likely never see the light of day is n’t innovative , it ’s just tragic .

Women could endanger their health by wearing burqas By By Adriana Stuijt May 8 , 2009 in Health Forget evening dresses and bikinis .
The girls who participate in a ten - week - long beauty contest in Saudi - Arabia are disguised in black burqas .
And the winner will be the woman with ' the greatest ' inner beauty ' .
Rickets :
The burqas are very controversial among health authorities in Western countries , who are increasingly having to deal with the often very serious medical consequences suffered by the growing number of Islamic women who are now migrating into Western Europe , but who are also still being coerced into wearing the burqa mainly through family pressure and imams at their local mosques .
Medical experts in the West warn that Islamic women wearing these all - encompassing burqas in the northerly climates , which have far less sunshine , suffer much more from osteoporosis due to a lack of Vitamin D .
The garments do n't let through enough sunshine .
And their newborn babies are prone to getting more seizures for the same reason .
" In Ireland , which is experiencing a large influx of muslim immigrants at the moment , women wearing the burqa , doctors are warning , 'are at increased risk of pelvic fractures during childbirth because of vitamin D deficiency due to a lack of sunlight .
" And babies born to women with vitamin D deficiency are also more prone to seizures in their first week of life , " according to Dr Miriam Casey , expert in Medicine for the Elderly at the Osteoporosis Unit in St James ’s hospital in Dublin .
The burqa - an all - enveloping outer garment , does not allow enough sunlight through to give women sufficient vitamin D , she warns .
However it 's not known whether the young women who are participating in the beauty contest in Saudi Arabia , might be suffering from Inner beauty contest does not consider health issues of the Burqa Map of Saudi Arabia
What makes the situation doubly tragic is that women who are constantly being denied access to direct sunlight , can be cured very easily : basically , treatment against rickets involves more exposure to sunshine , and increased dietary intake of HGH , phosphates .
Especially important would be exposure to ultraviolet B light ( sunshine when the sun is highest in the sky ) , cod liver oil , halibut - liver oil , and viosterol are all sources of vitamin D. Basically , if they did n't have the burqa , they would be healthy .
A sufficient amount of ultraviolet B light in sunlight each day and adequate supplies of calcium and phosphorus in the diet can prevent rickets .
Also important : darker - skinned people need to be exposed longer to its ultraviolet rays .
The replacement of vitamin D has been proven to cure rickets using these methods of ultraviolet light therapy and medicine .
The contest starts on Saturday in the Islamic country and will be judged by a female jury for a whopping ten weeks .
The entire country is ruled by Sharia law .
Women are not allowed to drive cars , have their own bank accounts , cannot go shopping without male relatives , and are allowed outdoors only when enveloped in the familiar , thick black shrouds .
Two hundred girls have signed up for the contest , aged from fifteen to 25 years .
But at Saudi Arabia 's only beauty pageant , the judges do n't care about a perfect figure or face - nor about their health . .
What they 're looking for in the quest for " Miss Beautiful Morals " is the contestant who shows the most devotion and respect for her parents .
" The idea of the pageant is to measure the contestants ' commitment to Islamic morals ...
It 's an alternative to the calls for decadence in the other beauty contests that only take into account a woman 's body and looks , " said pageant founder Khadra al - Mubarak .
"
The winner wo n't necessarily be pretty , " she added .
" We care about the beauty of the soul and the morals . "
So after the pageant opens Saturday , the nearly 200 contestants will spend the next 10 weeks attending classes and being quizzed on themes including " Discovering your inner strength , " " The making of leaders " and " Mom , paradise is at your feet " — a saying attributed to Islam 's Prophet Muhammad to underline that respect for parents is among the faith 's most important tenets .
Pageant hopefuls will also spend a day at a country house with their mothers , where they will be observed by female judges and graded on how they interact with their mothers , al - Mubarak said .
Since the pageant is not televised and no men are involved , contestants can take off the veils and black figure - hiding abayas they always wear in public .
The Miss Beautiful Morals pageant is the latest example of conservative Muslims co-opting Western - style formats to spread their message in the face of the onslaught of foreign influences flooding the region through the Internet and satellite television .
A newly created Islamic music channel owned by an Egyptian businessman aired an " American Idol " - style contest for religious - themed singers this month .
And several Muslim preachers have become talk - show celebrities by adopting an informal , almost Oprah - like television style , in contrast to the solemn clerics who traditionally appear in the media .
Now in its second year , the number of pageant contestants has nearly tripled from the 75 women who participated in 2008 .
The pageant is open to women between 15 and 25 .
The winner and two runners up will be announced in July , with the queen taking home $ 2,600 and other prizes .
The runners up get $ 1,300 each .
Last year 's winner , Zahra al - Shurafa , said the contest gives an incentive to young women and teens to show more consideration toward their parents .
" I tell this year 's contestants that winning is not important , " said al - Shurafa , a 21 - year - old English major .
" What is important is obeying your parents . "
There are few beauty pageants in the largely conservative Arab world .
The most dazzling one , for years , has been in Lebanon , the region 's most liberal country , where contestants appear on TV in one - piece swimsuits and glamorous evening gowns and answer questions that test their confidence and general knowledge .
There are no such displays in ultra-strict Saudi Arabia , where until Miss Beautiful Morals was inaugurated last year , the only pageants were for goats , sheep , camels and other animals , aimed at encouraging livestock breeding .
This year 's event kicks off Saturday in the mainly Shi'ite Muslim town of Safwa , and mostly draws local Shi'ite contestants .
But it 's open to anyone — and this year , 15 Sunni Muslims are also participating , al - Mubarak said .
" This is a beautiful thing , " she added .
There have long been tensions between the two sects in the kingdom .
Hard - liners in the Sunni majority consider Shi'ites infidels , and the Shi'ites often complain of discrimination and greater levels of poverty .
Al - Zayer , a 24 - year - old international management student , said she signed up because she is the " spitting image " of her mother .
" I 'm proud of my devotion to my parents , " she said .
What does she think of Lebanon 's beauty contests ?
" It 's a matter of cultural differences , " she said .
" In Saudi Arabia , they are Islamically unacceptable . "
The decision will fall in July .
The woman with the most beautiful soul will win 2,600 dollars .
It 's not known whether she'd be allowed to keep it , though .
The burqas are very controversial among health authorities in Western countries , who are increasingly having to deal with the often very serious medical consequences suffered by the growing number of Islamic women who are now migrating into Western Europe , but who are also still being coerced into wearing the burqa mainly through family pressure and imams at their local mosques .
Medical experts in the West warn that Islamic women wearing these all - encompassing burqas in the northerly climates , which have far less sunshine , suffer much more from osteoporosis due to a lack of Vitamin D. The garments do n't let through enough sunshine .
And their newborn babies are prone to getting more seizures for the same reason .
"
In Ireland , which is experiencing a large influx of muslim immigrants at the moment , women wearing the burqa , doctors are warning , 'are at increased risk of pelvic fractures during childbirth because of vitamin D deficiency due to a lack of sunlight .
" And babies born to women with vitamin D deficiency are also more prone to seizures in their first week of life , " according to Dr Miriam Casey , expert in Medicine for the Elderly at the Osteoporosis Unit in St James ’s hospital in Dublin .
The burqa - an all - enveloping outer garment , does not allow enough sunlight through to give women sufficient vitamin D , she warns .
However it 's not known whether the young women who are participating in the beauty contest in Saudi Arabia , might be suffering from rickets -- the condition caused by vitamin - D deficiencies .
However , the ' inner - beauty ' contest in Saudi Arabia does not consider their physical health , as opposed to a recent incident during a beauty contest in the West , when a contestant failed to win the beauty title because she looked very ' anorexic ' .
What makes the situation doubly tragic is that women who are constantly being denied access to direct sunlight , can be cured very easily : basically , treatment against rickets involves more exposure to sunshine , and increased dietary intake of HGH , phosphates .
Especially important would be exposure to ultraviolet B light ( sunshine when the sun is highest in the sky ) , cod liver oil , halibut - liver oil , and viosterol are all sources of vitamin D. Basically , if they did n't have the burqa , they would be healthy .
A sufficient amount of ultraviolet B light in sunlight each day and adequate supplies of calcium and phosphorus in the diet can prevent rickets .
Also important : darker - skinned people need to be exposed longer to its ultraviolet rays .
The replacement of vitamin D has been proven to cure rickets using these methods of ultraviolet light therapy and medicine .

The contest starts on Saturday in the Islamic country and will be judged by a female jury for a whopping ten weeks .
The entire country is ruled by Sharia law .
Women are not allowed to drive cars , have their own bank accounts , cannot go shopping without male relatives , and are allowed outdoors only when enveloped in the familiar , thick black shrouds .
Two hundred girls have signed up for the contest , aged from fifteen to 25 years .
Associated Press interviewed one hopeful , Sukaina al - Zayer , writing : " She covers her face and body in black robes and an Islamic veil , so no one can tell what she looks like .
She also admits she 's a little on the plump side .
" But at Saudi Arabia 's only beauty pageant , the judges do n't care about a perfect figure or face - nor about their health .
What they 're looking for in the quest for " Miss Beautiful Morals " is the contestant who shows the most devotion and respect for her parents .
" The idea of the pageant is to measure the contestants ' commitment to Islamic morals ...
It 's an alternative to the calls for decadence in the other beauty contests that only take into account a woman 's body and looks , " said pageant founder Khadra al - Mubarak .
"
The winner wo n't necessarily be pretty , " she added .
" We care about the beauty of the soul and the morals .
" So after the pageant opens Saturday , the nearly 200 contestants will spend the next 10 weeks attending classes and being quizzed on themes including " Discovering your inner strength , " " The making of leaders " and " Mom , paradise is at your feet " — a saying attributed to Islam 's Prophet Muhammad to underline that respect for parents is among the faith 's most important tenets .
Pageant hopefuls will also spend a day at a country house with their mothers , where they will be observed by female judges and graded on how they interact with their mothers , al - Mubarak said .
Since the pageant is not televised and no men are involved , contestants can take off the veils and black figure - hiding abayas they always wear in public .
The Miss Beautiful Morals pageant is the latest example of conservative Muslims co-opting Western - style formats to spread their message in the face of the onslaught of foreign influences flooding the region through the Internet and satellite television .
A newly created Islamic music channel owned by an Egyptian businessman aired an " American Idol " - style contest for religious - themed singers this month .
And several Muslim preachers have become talk - show celebrities by adopting an informal , almost Oprah - like television style , in contrast to the solemn clerics who traditionally appear in the media .
Now in its second year , the number of pageant contestants has nearly tripled from the 75 women who participated in 2008 .
The pageant is open to women between 15 and 25 .
The winner and two runners up will be announced in July , with the queen taking home $ 2,600 and other prizes .
The runners up get $ 1,300 each .
Last year 's winner , Zahra al - Shurafa , said the contest gives an incentive to young women and teens to show more consideration toward their parents .
" I tell this year 's contestants that winning is not important , " said al - Shurafa , a 21 - year - old English major .
" What is important is obeying your parents .
" There are few beauty pageants in the largely conservative Arab world .
The most dazzling one , for years , has been in Lebanon , the region 's most liberal country , where contestants appear on TV in one - piece swimsuits and glamorous evening gowns and answer questions that test their confidence and general knowledge .
There are no such displays in ultra-strict Saudi Arabia , where until Miss Beautiful Morals was inaugurated last year , the only pageants were for goats , sheep , camels and other animals , aimed at encouraging livestock breeding .
This year 's event kicks off Saturday in the mainly Shi'ite Muslim town of Safwa , and mostly draws local Shi'ite contestants .
But it 's open to anyone — and this year , 15 Sunni Muslims are also participating , al - Mubarak said .
" This is a beautiful thing , " she added .
There have long been tensions between the two sects in the kingdom .
Hard - liners in the Sunni majority consider Shi'ites infidels , and the Shi'ites often complain of discrimination and greater levels of poverty .
Al - Zayer , a 24 - year - old international management student , said she signed up because she is the " spitting image " of her mother .
" I 'm proud of my devotion to my parents , " she said .
What does she think of Lebanon 's beauty contests ?
" It 's a matter of cultural differences , " she said .
" In Saudi Arabia , they are Islamically unacceptable .
" The decision will fall in July .
The woman with the most beautiful soul will win 2,600 dollars .
It 's not known whether she'd be allowed to keep it , though .

BBC News , Cherrapunji
Cherrapunji was once the wettest place on earth ( Photos : Subhamoy Bhattacharjee )
Once the world 's wettest places , Cherrapunji is getting up to 20 % less rain every year - and is suffering water shortages .
Residents say their heavenly abode in the clouds is hotter and drier than ever before - and they blame it on global warming .
Cherrapunji - or Sohra in the local Khasi language - is located in the West Khasi Hills of India 's north - eastern state of Meghalaya .
" Never were there very big forests around Cherrapunji and many of those that are there are sacred to us , " says Millergrace Symlieh , a senior member of Sohra Science Society .
" We never cut a branch in these sacred forests .
So you cannot say this adverse weather change is our creation .
We are affected by what 's happening all over the world , " he told the BBC .
" This hot weather and less rain here is not due to huge deforestation or massive industrialisation , " says Mr Symlieh .
" We only have a cement plant near here . "
Water shortage Cherrapunji's weather office says the average annual rainfall in the town has dropped by about 20 % in the last five years - though the trend started a decade ago .
" It is basically since 2005 that we are often getting 8,000 mm - 9,000 mm of rain in Cherrapunji annually - against the normal average of 11,000 mm , " says one of the office 's staff , Amit Chaudhuri .
But the town has been getting drier due to erratic rain since the beginning of the decade , Mr Chaudhuri says .
People in the area say there is a water shortage now The immediate impact is a water shortage in what was once the world 's wettest area , especially during winters .
Longer summers and shorter winters mean much more heat and less moisture in the air .
On a recent hot morning , I could see scores of trucks climbing up to Cherrapunji from the neighbouring plains , loaded with large containers of water .
They make quick money by selling water to the residents , whose numbers have risen sharply .
From 7,000 people in 1961 , Cherrapunji 's population has grown to 15 times that size .
So less rain means water scarcity for the town 's growing population .
It was such a contrast to the 1990s when I used to visit Cherrapunji quite often .
Then , it was fun driving through thick clouds on hill roads which were often dangerous because of poor visibility .
" We have to purchase water here in the winter in a place where there was so much rain until recently , " says local teacher Ila Manora Nongbri .
" We never learnt water harvesting but we do n't have a choice now . "
Her sister Mimi complained that rainfall was now very erratic .
" We get rains suddenly when we do n't expect them .
And we do n't get rain when we expect it .
Also it does not rain all over any more .
Rain is getting localised even within Cherrapunji , " Mimi told the BBC .
Tourism affected
In 1861 , Cherrapunji created a world record with 22,987 mm of rainfall in a year .
" That will never happen again , though we still get much rain during the monsoon .
But earlier , we got rains here even during the winters and that is not happening any more , " says Ila Manora Nongbri .
When a separate state was created from the Khasi Hills in 1972 , India promptly named it Meghalaya - literally " Home of the clouds " in Sanskrit and Hindi .
Mr Lyngdoh says the number of tourists is falling Meghalaya enjoys the distinction of having two of the world 's wettest places : Cherrapunji and Mawsynram , which gets about 12,000 mm of rain annually .
Mawsynram is now the wetter of the two - but both places are getting less rain and Cherrapunji is drying up faster .
That may also affect tourism in the town .
" We have a thriving tourist traffic here but it is beginning to fall .
Specially the number of foreign tourists is getting less and less , " says Banzer Cooper Lyngdoh , an officer with Meghalaya tourism in Cherrapunji .
" Tourists come here to see the rain and clouds , so why should they come at all if it is hot and sunny ? "
Mr Lyngdoh asked .
Shillong , Meghalaya 's capital and known as the " Scotland of the East " , is clubbed with Cherrapunji on most tour packages offered for north - east India .
But both places are getting hotter - with average daytime temperatures rising by 2C - 3C in the summer and somewhat less in the winter .
" And summers are much longer , stretching into November , " says Ila Manora Nongbri .
At this rate , environmentalists fear the waterfalls around Cherrapunji , a major tourist attraction , may also start to dry up .

The history of science is filled with lucky breaks , cases where researchers have stumbled across something unexpected that ended up leading to a major breakthrough — it was a scientist , after all , who said " chance favors the prepared mind . "
But a perspective published today in Science brings the year of astronomy to a nice end by discussing just how often luck has played a role in the progress of that field .
One of the stories , of course , is Galileo — it 's the anniversary of his first use of a telescope .
But it 's easy to forget that the first instrument was n't actually intended to be a telescope at all ; instead , it was a spyglass that was expected to find use as an instrument of war .
Nor was Galileo especially intent on completely upsetting Europe 's view of its place in the Universe when he pointed the spyglass at the skies .
That just happened to be a side effect of seeing comets and the moons of other worlds for the first time .
The perspective does tread some familiar ground , discussing the accidental discovery of the cosmic microwave background by Bell Labs researchers who initially considered it annoying background noise .
In that case , the prepared minds were at a completely different institution , and they correctly interpreted the noise in a paper that was published separately from its description .
But what 's stunning is a catalog of just how common this sort of event has been .
Herschell was looking for faint stars when he happened across the planet Uranus , while Piazi was simply creating a star catalog when he observed the object that turned out to be the first asteroid to ever be described , Ceres I .
Someone I 'd never heard of , Vesto Slipher , obtained critical data while looking at something that the entire field had completely misidentified .
Other galaxies had once been thought to be what we'd now call a proto - planetary disk , with the central bulge being the star and the spiral arms a collection of planet - forming dust .
Slipher was attempting to get some measurements of the arms when he discovered that they were moving faster than anything ever previously identified , far faster than dust could orbit a star .
It was an essential step on our road to recognizing an expanded and expanding Universe .
Technology has also played a key role .
Radio astronomy might have taken decades longer to catch on if it had n't been for the rapid development of radar technology during the second world war .
X - rays do n't penetrate the atmosphere , so the cold - war era space race was critical in enabling us to start high - energy astronomy .
Even then , luck played a role .
Researchers were trying to look for X - rays originating on the Moon ( they were expected to be induced by solar radiation ) when their instruments picked up the first sources of X - rays outside our solar system .
Pulsars were found by researchers looking for fluctuations driven by the solar wind , while the first cosmic gamma-ray sources were picked up by sensors designed to spot nuclear tests .
All of these sources have also turned out to be a playground for theoretical physicists , given that they appear to involve exotic objects like black holes , neutron stars , and gravity waves .
A few other examples do n't even make the cut for the article , like the discovery of the first exoplanets .
My understanding ( which a reader now tells me is in error ) is that astronomers found them while looking for binary star systems by scanning stars for periodic orbital wobbles .
They just happened to do tests that were sensitive enough to pick up smaller objects .
I 'm also not sure if anyone was even talking about dark energy when the WMAP probe was designed , but its detailed look at the cosmic microwave background apparently contains evidence that about three - quarters of the stuff in the Universe appears to be dark energy .
Nobody expected the Voyagers to spot volcanoes on Io , either .
( This sort of thing is hardly unique to astronomy , either .
An expedition to the deep sea rift zones was supposedly so completely unprepared to find thriving ecosystems that they had to raid the ship 's vodka supply to preserve the samples . )
In any case , the article has helped me end the Year of Astronomy with a profound sense of excitement .
We 've currently got some absolutely superb single - purpose instruments in orbit , like the planet hunters CoRoT and Kepler , that appear to be performing their expected functions extremely well .
But the Universe has been full of surprises , and there seems to be a better - than - ever chance that one of those observatories will stumble onto something they were n't designed to see .
I can't wait to find out what it is .

THE “ BIG REGISTRY : ” THE BOOMING SEX OFFENDER INDUSTRY
Derek “ The Fallen One ” Logue
Created November 21 , 2009
INTRODUCTION
“ It is a very dangerous thing …
Not only sex sells , but sex offenders sell [
1
] . ” Fear and loathing have generated big
bucks in an otherwise bad economy .
From iPhone apps to companies selling your personal information to those
individuals advocating these laws , the sex offender business has become a major industry , raking in untold billions of
dollars annually .
Like all industries , however , those profiting from the sex offender registry have no real incentive to tell
the public the truth about sex offenders and the laws affecting their lives .
In fact , many of the organizations profiting from
the sex offender industry lobby , misinform , and mislead the public .
Those profiting from the sex offender industry behave much like the industries involved in “ Big Tobacco ” and “ Big Oil . ”
Powerful lobbyists pass laws to put money directly into their own pockets .
The media largely ignores studies which
reveal the negative impact of sex offender legislation , while efforts are made to suppress or “ debunk ” these studies .
The
media blasts high - profile but rare sex crimes incessantly over the airwaves , while celebrity advocates make public
appeals for more support and money while spreading their own myths and lies .
Thus , the sex offender registry could be
described as “ Big Registry . ”
There is not currently any study which shows exactly how much Americans are spending on the sex offender registry .
This article is not exhaustive .
It is not impossible to determine an exact amount , but best left in the hands of researchers
with far more time and money .
The purpose of this article is to shed light on the many ways the sex offender industry is
profiting from one of the most controversial and ineffective criminal justice methods ever devised and implemented .
IT ’S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY
The Big Registry generates big bucks for organizations that lobby for tough sex - crime legislation .
Below are the budgets
of two well - known organizations , The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) and Parents For
Megan ’s Law ( PFML ) :
NCMEC Annual Report 2007 [
2
]
Federal Funding - $ 29.8 million
Total Funds - $ 42.9 million
Other Contributions - $ 13.1 million
Expenses - $ 40.6 Million
2007 profit - $ 2.3 million
Total assets - $ 29.3 million
Ernie Allen ’s Salary - $ 410 k + $ 427 k in benefits
John Walsh ’s benefits - $ 38 k
PFML tax form 2007 [
3
]
Public support - $ 56,658
Govt Grants - $ 879,000
Total - $ 1.1 million
Expenses - $ 900,000
Profit - $ 210,000
Assets - $ 264,000
Ahern ’s salary - $ 107,323
Almost 10 % of total funds went to Ahern ’s salary alone !
It is not surprising the heads of these “ non-profit ” organizations make large salaries .
What is surprising , however , is that
most of those “ expenses ” listed are all employee salaries and fundraising expenses .
Below are the 2007 salaries of the
heads of some of these organizations :
Salary comparisons 2007 [
4
] :
Ernie Allen [ NCMEC ] $ 837 k
Xavier Von Erck [ Perverted - Justice ] $ 120 k
Laura Ahern [ PFML ] $ 107 k
Mark Lunsford [ Lunsford Foundation ] $ 44 k
Klaas Family [ Klaas Kids ] $ 46 k
The NCMEC , the largest of the well - known “ non-profit ” organizations , has not been without controversy .
The NCMEC
does not physically search for children ; local law enforcement agents search for children .
Instead , the NCMEC
distributes fliers of missing children ( again , not physically ) , runs a fingerprinting and DNA campaign , and fundraises .
The NCMEC , along with founder John Walsh was described as “ cause - related marketing , ” and “ they do n’t look for
children , they look for money [
5
] . ”
The NCMEC was founded under the myth of “ 50,000 missing children ” every year , and criticisms of inflating statistics
and misleading the public to generate profits still plague its nearly 30 - year existence [
6
] .
John Walsh , a founder of the NCMEC , collects a portion of their funding as compensation and for lobbying [ 7 ] .
In turn ,
the NCMEC stands to collect more government funds from the controversial Adam Walsh Act [ 8 ] ; the Act also gives the
NCMEC a great deal of immunity from lawsuits [ 9 ] .
Thus , it is no surprise John Walsh has staunchly advocated for
funding the Adam Walsh Act [
10
] , even enlisting the help of Oprah Winfrey to campaign for funding the Act [
11
] .
John Walsh has faced fierce criticism for propagating myths to the media and Congress , including testifying before
Congress “ 1.5 million missing kids annually ” and claiming our land is “ littered with mutilated , decapitated , raped and
strangled children ” [ 12 ] .
Recently Walsh has been criticized from promoting the Adam Walsh Act , which allows teens as
young as age 14 to be listed on the national sex offender registry [
13
] . Despite the mounting criticisms and articles
showing teens are indeed placed on the registry for consensual offenses , John Walsh still denies the AWA would do
that , claiming it is only for those who “ physically or violently offended someone and you ’re a repeat offender . ”
In his
recent interview , Walsh propagates another myth , claiming the registry has lost track of 100,000 “ level three sex
offenders ” [
14
] . The “ 100,000 missing sex offenders ” claim is just one of the many myths used to justify high - priced ,
ineffective legislation .
LOBBYING THE INDUSTRY
With billions of dollars at stake , the Big Registry has relied on outlandish statistics and appeals to emotion that shock
and scare the public [
15
] . Inflated statistics , such as the “ Goldilocks Number [
16
] , ” are created to justify the need for
their products .
John Walsh had stated on ABC ’s Nightline there are “ 100,000 missing level three sex offenders [
17
] . ”
Chris Hansen of NBC Dateline ’s controversial “ To Catch a Predator ” series claimed there were “ 50,000 internet
predators ” online at anyone time [
18
] .
Many of these inflated statistics can be found on various websites promoting their
services , such as Family Watchdog and Klaas Kids .
Where did these statistics come from ?
In the case of the 50,000
internet predator claim , apparently it was conjured out of thin air in order to promote a trashy quasi-reality show and
shock the public [
19
] .
The “ 100,000 missing predators ” myth was derived from a flawed study by the group Parents For Megan ’s Law ( PFML ) .
This study , conducted in 2002 , relied on a telephone call to states to ask how many sex offenders were complying with
registration requirements .
Of the 50 states plus the District of Columbia , only 32 states gave estimates , and the study
estimated “ roughly ” 24 % of the registrants did not comply , and since there were around 460,000 registrants in 2002 ,
PFML estimated it at 100,000 [ 20 ] .
Flaws with the study were reported early ; most states never audited their sex
offender registries and gave only estimates of their accuracy , while 18 states and the District of Columbia gave no
estimates at all [
21
] .
This did not stop PFML from releasing the seriously flawed study as statistical fact .
And despite
being thoroughly debunked , these myths are still cited on myriads of websites and media articles even today !
It is worth
noting that Laura Ahern , founder of Parents For Megan ’s Law , also exploited local high - profile cases to gain national
attention , and recently received a half - million dollar grant to create an email alert system [ 22 ] .
Many of the sites that promote the Big Registry go beyond inflating ( or creating ) statistics ; many actively attack or
suppress valid studies that debunk the various myths these businesses propagate .
In 2008 , Maureen Kanka fought to
have a research study proving Megan ’s Law ineffective suppressed [ 23 ] .
Later , Kanka released a statement claiming
Megan ’s law was never intended to be a crime deterrent , claiming the purpose of the registry was to increase public
awareness [
24
] . Within 24 hours of the release of the Human Rights Watch report in 2007 on the negative impact of sex
offender laws , Family Watchdog hastily created a blog on their website to “ respond to ” and debunk the report [
25
] .
Why
would these organizations lobby so hard to debunk valid studies ?
The answer lies in the preferred method of promoting
the Big Registry .
FEAR MONGERS AND TEAR JERKERS
Fear mongering and appeals to emotion have been the driving force behind the Big Registry since its inception .
The
public registry came on the heels of the tragic case of Megan Kanka , with the claim , “ If only we had known about sex
offenders in our neighborhood , we could have prevented this case ” [
26
]. John Walsh frequently appeals to his
deceased son in support of funding the Adam Walsh Act [
27
] , even though his son was not killed by a registered sex
offender or a pedophile [ 28 ] .
The reactions to such high - profile cases fueled by fear - laden media reports has been a
nation of fearful “ helicopter parents ” [
29
] . Based on the money pumped into the Big Registry , fear also sells [ 30 ] .
Thin Air Wireless , creator of the controversial “ Offender Locator ” iPhone App , makes the ominous statement , “ They
know where you live .
Now it ’s time to turn the tables on them ” [
31
] . The App became one of the top sellers within days of
its release [
32
] .
The founder of Thin Air Wireless , Howard “ Trip ” Wakefield , relies on fear mongering to justify using his
product ; he states in one article , “ If I was going to take my child to the park and I see that the area is infested with child
predators and I look up one that is n't , I 'm going to take them to the one that is n't " [
33
] . On the Offender Locator
Facebook page , in addition to using scary avatars to pinpoint locations of registrants in the area , Trip claims by not
using his product , you are “ playing Russian Roulette with the safety of your loved ones ” [
34
] .
Of course , this was only
one of three so - called “ Peace of Mind ” products offered by Thin Air Wireless [
35
] .
The controversial App was
temporarily suspended because selling personal information violated California law [ 36 ] .
This has not stopped other
organizations from boldly proclaiming sex offender information was “ going corporate ” [ 37 ] .
Other organizations have
jumped on the Big Registry bandwagon , including Offendar , a company offering devices that read GPS devices to warn
of sex offenders in the area [
38
] , Masonic chip implants for “ identification purposes ” [
39
] , and even the Ku Klux Klan [ 40 ] .
Perhaps no man has come under more criticism , scrutiny , and controversy than Mark Lunsford .
The criticism of
Lunsford and his “ Jessica Marie Lunsford Foundation ” began to surface when Lunsford announced he was suing the
Citrus County , FL Sheriff ’s Office for the wrongful death of his daughter , Jessica .
First came the feud with a local shock
jock , who accused Lunsford of just suing “ for the money ” and questioned his spending habits [
41
] , then came scrutiny
from the local media on how Lunsford ’s foundation spent the donation money and used donated equipment , most of
which was never reported to the IRS [
42
] . Amid the controversy , the Lunsford Foundation disbanded , and Lunsford
began collecting a paycheck from Hank Asher , the former drug - runner turned multimillionaire information seller .
After
Lunsford disbanded his foundation , around $ 400,000 in assets were unaccounted for , and former members of his
Board of Directors have claimed Lunsford pocketed the money , living like a “ rock star . ”
Mark Klaas , while claiming never
to be paid by a for - profit industry , applauded Lunsford ’s work with Asher [ 43 ] .
Lunsford , as a board member of the
group Stop Child Predators , is also partnered with Thin Air Wireless [
44
] .
STATE OF THE ECONOMY
Individuals and businesses are not the only entities looking to cash in on the Big Registry .
The federal government
earmarks millions of dollars in grants to various local , state , and federal government agencies , as well as private
business ( such as therapists ) working in the criminal justice system .
Decisions to not enforce certain laws , like the Adam
Walsh Act , mean law enforcement agencies fighting for a share of JAG / Byrne grants could lose 10 % of those funds [
45
] .
Below are just a few ways in which law enforcement and other criminal justice agencies are exploiting the laws to
generate profits .
Registration Laws
States get federal funding for the registry under SOMA based on the number of offenders on the state registry .
Thus , it
came as little surprise when it was reported Florida ’s public registry listed 541 dead sex offenders , 807 deported
offenders , 7173 out of state offenders , and 8260 incarcerated offenders on the state ’s public registry , roughly half of
the reported 36,000 registrants for the year 2005 [ 46 ] .
Ironically , this is the state Parents For Megan ’s Law considers
Florida one of the “ highest compliance rates ” [
47
] and has given the grade “ A+ ” for their registry [
48
] . Another growing
trend is law enforcement agencies forcing registrants to pay registration fees to supplement costs already covered in
the law enforcement grant [ 49 ] .
Civil commitment
Civil commitment has been a costly method of incarcerating individuals long after their prison sentences are completed .
Costs to keep registrants in civil commitment centers range from $ 32,000 to $ 180,000 per year per registrant [
50
] . Out
of over 3000 in civil commitment centers across the country , only 50 have “ graduated ” from a program , while double the
amount were released due to other factors [
51
] .
One sex offender cost the state over $ 600,000 to keep in a civil
commitment center for a year and a half after the doctors cleared him for release [
52
] . The Minnesota civil commitment
program also came under fire after spending over $ 70 million on their program while releasing no one from their
programs .
The program saw great increases in the committed population following the Dru Sjodin murder [ 53 ] .
Adam Walsh Act
The Adam Walsh Act must implemented by June 2010 or face a 10 % cut in Jag / Byrne law enforcement funding [ 54 ] .
Also at stake are millions of dollars to assorted programs such as Fugitive Safe Surrender , child fingerprinting
programs , registration compliance programs , and other sex offender - related programs , as well as Big Brothers Big
Sisters [ 55 ] .
However , as evidenced from John Walsh ’s lobbying for funding , the Adam Walsh Act is a largely unfunded
mandate , which may influence states ’ decisions on whether or not to implement this asinine bill .
When Ohio passed their
version of the Act , SB10 , it found the Federal government only had $ 25 million in funding to divide amongst 56 US
states and territories , while the cost of making the small changes to the registry to become compliant with the Act alone
was around a half million dollars .
This did not include upkeep , court costs and potential lawsuits , and mandatory
minimums , which were all considered but no solid figures given [
56
] . If indeed the Adam Walsh Act was to receive full
funding for all its included programs , would states still adopt the Act ?
It would take billions of tax dollars to pay for new
registries , civil commitment , GPS pilot programs , mandatory minimums , Title 6 funding , and other provisions of the Adam
Walsh Act .
GPS
Speaking of GPS , the program has become heralded as a “ valuable ” tool in the efforts to track registrants .
In one such
program in Massachusetts , the cost of monitoring individuals on GPS was $ 10 per day per offender in 2004 , or $ 3650
per year [ 57 ] .
In 2009 the same state reported it cost $ 6 million to track the 359 offenders plus 250 suspects awaiting
trial , including the cost of false alarms , or an average cost of $ 9852.22 per offender [
58
] . False alarms and faulty
devices have been a common problem , a problem that will likely increase as outdated GPS satellites begin to fail as
early as 2010 [
59
] .
This fact has not stopped businesses from hocking GPS devices to states as demand for the
devices increase [
60
] .
CONCLUSION
The Big Registry is a booming business , bucking the trends of even the deep recession of 2008 - 2009 .
With billions of
dollars at stake , celebrity advocates , private businesses , and even government and law enforcement agencies
propagate fear , misleading statistics , and outright lies to promote their ventures .
Lobbying and mass advertising for
these ventures promote fear based laws that generate big buck for social programs that use their services .
Any studies
and arguments to the contrary are conveniently ignored by the mass media , and effective social programs are ignored
in favor of ineffective laws that generate publicity , votes , and most of all , money .
Much like Big Oil and Big Tobacco , the
Big Registry has convinced the public these laws are not dangerous , but a necessary product for our culture .
However ,
the negative impact of these laws is proving the Big Registry is indeed as deceptive and dangerous as the other “ Big ”
businesses .

Thirty years after leaving ULowell following his sophomore year to begin a pro career that saw him become an NHL All - Star and etch his name on four Stanley Cups , MacTavish is back in school , working for an MBA at Queens University in Kingston , Ont .
In what should come as no surprise , Craig MacTavish is using his time away from the game to better himself .
As quoted above , Chaz Scoggins brings us news that MacTavish is going to add an MBA to his already impressive resume .
That lengthy resume includes ECAC Player of the Year , All - American honors , playoff MVP , a Division II title , four Stanley Cups , three years as an NHL assistant coach , and eight years as an NHL head coach .
Add to that an MBA and MacTavish 's resume has all of the qualifications of a General Manager in the NHL .
I 've often complained that management personnel in the NHL are woefully lacking of the background and skills necessary to run a large - scale business like a multi-million dollar pro sports franchise .
A significant number of people within management have little more than an equivalency degree others have a single professional qualification -- they have a personal relationship with someone within the management of the franchise that they are working for .
Craig MacTavish does not suffer from the same problem .
MacTavish understands what it takes to develop non-pedigreed players into outscoring NHL players .
Under his watch , Fernando Pisani , and Shawn Horcoff developed into bonafide NHL outscorers despite having pedigrees that linked them more to a third - line plugger role .
Horcoff , in fact , credits his success to MacTavish :
" I owe a lot to him .
He did a lot for my career and he helped me a lot in becoming and putting me in the situation and making me the player than I am today "
His work with Liam Reddox was starting to pay dividends this year prior to the dirty hit by Buffalo 's Clarke MacArthur , which derailed Reddox 's game and sent him back to the AHL .
Not only does MacTavish understand how to develop those players without a draft pedigree , he 's demonstrated an ability to develop , even if it requires a tear - down first , high - end talent into NHL outscorers .
MacTavish turned Ales Hemsky into an outscorer without limiting his creativity and explosiveness .
His work with Sam Gagner began paying dividends last year , and thus far this year , Gagner is still on track to become a tough - minutes NHL center .
When it comes to roster management , MacTavish was put into situations by his general manager , whether it was Kevin Lowe or Steven Tambellini , that forced him to coach majorly unbalanced rosters .
Whether it was a lack of defense , a lack of forwards , an over - abundance of unproven rookies , or an shortage of proven veterans , each year the roster was incomplete .
The effect was two - fold .
The general manager 's mistakes left him with a deep understanding of the need for a balanced roster as well as an understanding of the value of real NHL players , especially relatively cheap veterans from the Wes Walz genus .
In his final season with the Oilers , MacTavish seemed to burn out .
He made no excuses for his poor season , and being the man that he is , he will take lessons away from a situation that he struggled to manage .
MacTavish is intelligent enough to understand his limitations .
He pointed that out this year in an interview with TSN , saying " ... the players lost their trust and faith in me and my ability to get the job done , and for a large part I think that was the same for me , that I lost faith in the players . "
The situation escalated and he made things personal in the media , something he had n't previously done .
More than most general managers in the NHL MacTavish is likely to learn from his mistakes and surround himself with competent assistants to handle areas in which he may display weaknesses .
He knows how to handle the media as anyone that has listened to a MacTavish post - game interview or press conference is well - aware .
There will be no " ... is it me ? " moments , no " MACT ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE " moments , and no " deer in headlights " moments .
When his coursework at Queens is complete , MacTavish will likely re-enter the NHL in some capacity .
If a team is willing to give him an interview as a coach , they should listen to what MacTavish has to say about a possible general manager 's position .
He 's a guy with a proven record as a player , a proven record of player development , a proven record of roster management , an understanding of roster building , and a record of intelligence .
Teams like Atlanta , Florida , Ottawa , and Edmonton should be at least willing to listen to what MacTavish has to say , let alone hire the guy to fix their significant messes .
I cringe inside when people say they 're not " good " at video games , or that they 'd never in a million years be able to figure out the controls to Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 .
" It looks really good , but I 'm not really a gamer so I 'll probably never play it , " they say with a defeated shrug .
In the past , I 've argued that video games are a medium unto themselves , but I realize now I 've been wrong .
There is a new and evolving medium , but video games are only a small piece of a much larger picture .
If you have a Facebook profile , can use MS Word , or have bought something on eBay , you understand the essential language of interaction , which is at the heart of every video game .
You may not want to bother figuring out a hardcore shooter , but that does n't mean you 're not an active patron of the medium in which video games are contained .
Virtual interaction is at the heart of the modern media , the answer to the looming question of what comes next .
For thousands of years games mimicked the forms of interaction , but they required two present parties to reproduce the interactivity .
With widespread adoption of the home computer and , consequently the internet , all the necessary technology for systemic interaction in everything from commerce to storytelling has arrived .
It 's Facebook that 's introduced the benefits of interactivity to the mainstream more than Wii or DS .
Like AOL , Amazon , and eBay before it , Facebook uses many of the same mechanical principles of traditional video games , though its ultimate purpose is completely different .
What follows is a comparison of Facebook to World of Warcraft in an effort to more clearly define interactivity as its own unique medium , and then carve out the special purpose of video games within that larger medium .
The Interface
The PC is the biggest gaming platform in the world , and it's the frontline for demonstrating the most essential qualities of interactivity .
With a mouse and keyboard you have the interface to browse the web , build a spreadsheet , or smack zombies in the face with a crowbar .
While the purposes in moving the mouse cursor in PowerPoint versus adjusting your aim in Left 4 Dead 2 are different , the interface is identical .
In World of Warcraft , user interface is multi-layered , framing the game world with iconic buttons , a running log of events , and a record of social exchange .
Facebook 's pages are drawn in clean columns with actionable buttons and links standing out in sharp blue against the soft white background .
In both , mouse navigation fine - tunes your orientation in the world while keystrokes are used for personal interaction and expression .
WoW presents its visual interface as the frame of the entire game world .
In Facebook , each new bit of information has a smaller set of interface options that are consistent from profile to profile and status update to status update .
" The primary guideline for anything that we add to Facebook is to help our users connect and share with each other , " said Gareth Davis , Platform Manager and Games Lead at Facebook .
" That 's the lens through which we evaluate every single thing that we add to the site .
Does it help people connect and does it facilitate sharing ? "
Sharing and connecting is crucial to WoW , but it happens in the context of roleplay and fantasy projection .
Those elements , the quest design , the story that connects them , and the art style through which players can bring their fantasy to life are elements of art and authorship .
" Simplified UI that is able to easily achieve what the user is motivated to accomplish often outweighs gorgeous design , " said Ariel Waldman , digital anthropologist , founder of Spacehack.org , and former NASA coordinator .
" In social networks , Twitter and Foursquare are shining examples of this factor , while Tumblr leads the way on balancing simple interactivity with decent aesthetics and information architecture . "
Creating an Identity
Interacting is a way of self - expressing , be it on the highest level of metaphysical fantasy or in the most mundane functions of e-commerce .
" I think the difference between an MMO and a social platform is an MMO is about a fantasy projection and a social network is about self - identity and expression , " said Neil Young , co-founder of ngmoco .
" Another way of thinking about it is the difference between reality television and dramatic television .
Yes , it 's a reflection of yourself , but it 's also fictional .
Whereas a social network tends to be a much more accurate reflection of you and you can modify that and play with that , but it tends to be regulated by your friends in the real world . "
In WoW you align with a faction ( conveniently good or evil ) , pick a character class based on your preferred metaphor for interaction ( druid , hunter , priest , mage , paladin etc. ) .
Your appearance becomes a record of events you 've completed or places you 've been .
It 's a fictional aggregator that tells people small pieces of information about your experience .
In Facebook , you have many more options for creating your identity , but the function is still through association .
Your most basic identity is established through personal affiliation , guilds and classes become towns , networks , and mutual friends .
The aggregation of tagged photos creates its own sort of narrative about where you 've been and what you 've done .
" A decision was made very early on that the interface should look very clean and very consistent , so if I 'm visiting three different friends ' profiles I can find the information that I care about very quickly and easily , " said Davis .
" The most important thing is that people are really who they say they are and who you know they are . "
A special appeal from Free Software Foundation executive director Peter Brown .
" I'm a computer science student living in Dumfries , Scotland .
Ever since I started using GNU / Linux as my main operating system in 2007 , I 've been advocating free software to my close friends and family .
I wanted to show my support to the Free Software Foundation by becoming a member . "

Dear Free Software Supporter ,
The free software movement is one the most successful social movements to emerge in the past 25 years , driven by a worldwide community of ethical programmers dedicated to the cause of freedom and sharing .
But the ultimate success of the free software movement depends upon teaching our friends , neighbors and work colleagues about the danger of not having software freedom , about the danger of a society losing control over its computing .
As we grow more dependent on computers , the software we run is of critical importance to securing our future .
Free software is about having control over the technology we use in our homes , schools and businesses , where computers work for our individual and communal benefit , not for proprietary software companies or governments who might seek to restrict and monitor us .
The Free Software Foundation works on three fronts to advance the cause of the free software movement :
Software : we are the home of the GNU project , the campaign to develop a completely free operating system .
We promote those distributions of the GNU system that are 100 % free -- such as gNewSense and Trisquel .
They demonstrate that freedom is possible and that free software is easy to use .
We also highlight high - priority free software projects that make it easy for everyone to make the move to the GNU / Linux system and away from Windows or Mac OS .
And we maintain the Free Software Definition so that we all know what it means to have software freedom .
Licensing : we publish the world 's most popular free software licenses , particularly the GNU General Public License .
The GNU GPL is the only license written with the express purpose of protecting computer user freedom and preventing free software from becoming proprietary .
Software developers around the world use the GNU GPL to express their respect for users ' freedom and to encourage other developers to do the same .
We collect thousands of copyright assignments from developers working on the GNU system and other important free software projects .
We then register these copyrights with the US Copyright Office .
This lets us protect the distribution of free software worldwide and ensure that corporations follow the rules and pass on ( to you ! ) all the rights that our free software licenses promise .
Campaigns : we campaign to promote and extend the adoption of free software and free data formats .
We campaign for free formats in our PlayOgg and OpenDocument campaigns .
We campaign against Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) and Treacherous Computing in our DefectiveByDesign.org campaign .
And for the past two years , our campaign against software patents ( EndSoftPatents.org ) has driven home the message about the harm software patents inflict on society , and our submission of an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court could help end the patenting of software entirely .
However , all our campaigns are focused on raising awareness as to why it is ethically and socially responsible for a society to be in control of its computing .
Only the free software movement focuses on the ethical aspect of software , yet it 's the most important area .
For our society to attain computer user freedom we must make freedom our goal !
We rely entirely on the support of individuals like you to donate or join the Free Software Foundation as our members .
If you use free software .
If you use GNU / Linux .
If you support the cause of computer user freedom .
Get involved .
Become a card carrying member and support our work .
Thank you .

Politicians in the US are raising the pressure on chemists and other scientists to ensure their work ’s legitimacy following the publication of emails suggesting unethical research practices at the University of East Anglia .
Ralph Hall , the Republican representative for Texas , introduced House Resolution 954 on 8 December ’ to preclude future infringements of public trust by scientific falsification and fraud ’ .
’ In addition to economic and regulatory concerns about international climate agreements , the issue of scientific integrity also has been called into question , ’ explained Hall .
The bill ’s text includes specific references to the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at UEA , describing ’ attempts by some , including the head of the CRU , to alter data that is the basis of climate modelling across the globe ’ .
Hall hopes that the resolution will caution the US president against signing any international agreements at the climate change conference currently ongoing in Copenhagen .
Mike Pilling , an atmospheric chemist at the University of Leeds , UK , agrees that the possibility that the CRU deleted data and attempted to suppress papers published in the peer review literature is ’ extremely worrying ’ .
He is concerned , however , that HR954 implies that this may have significantly affected the data used in reports by the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
’ Given the way in which the data were collected , the number of independent data sets , and the checks and balances that are in place , I find it inconceivable that there is widespread malpractice , ’ he says .
However , Pilling does say that a detailed enquiry into the data used by the IPCC , as well as data used by climate change sceptics , should be very valuable in helping resolve the current controversy .
’ Public trust in science has been diminished by the UEA emails and the way in which they have been reported , ’ he told Chemistry World .
’ It is essential that this trust is restored . ’
Even prior to the CRU revelations , worries about tampering with scientific results had already led the US National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) to publish a report entitled Ensuring the integrity , accessibility , and stewardship of research data in the digital age .
Although prompted by letters from the journal Science and the Journal of Cell Biology citing incidences of digital image manipulation , the July 2009 report is actually relatively positive about current research practices .
’ There is simply no evidence to suggest some sort of increase in cheating , ’ explained co-author and Harvard atmospheric chemist Steven Wofsy .
To help ensure untainted data in future , Hall ’s resolution calls for a ’ bipartisan group ... monitoring the status of scientific assessments on Global Climate Change ’ .
Pilling says that he ’ would be very unhappy if this were to take place ’ , as it would undermine the way in which academics operate .
Wofsy points out that direct political involvement in research has sometimes been less than benign in its intent .
’ There are instances of political interference in the scientific process that are highly egregious , ’ he said .
’ Fortunately there are actually few such major incidents . ’

Different ways of seeing stats
As the rich are told they will pay most to repair the public finances after the recession , Michael Blastland , in his regular column , digs out a provocative fact about where the tax burden falls .
But do n't jump to any conclusions .
Imagine all the nation 's income tax sitting in a pile in the Treasury , a great mountain of ready cash ( £ 147,856,000,000 in 2008 - 09 , according to Revenue and Customs ) .
What share of that pile was paid by those taxpayers with the highest one per cent of incomes ?
a. 1 % b. 5 % c. 12 % d. 19 % Everyone has an opinion about the burden of taxation , but how many know where it falls ?
The answer is
We cheated .
The answer is none of the options above .
The people with the top 1 per cent of incomes pay very nearly a quarter of all the income tax , as the chart shows .
So option d - the highest available - gets points .
The other options are at best half the true amount .
We can also see from the chart that people with the top 10 % of incomes pay more than half the income tax .
( See link here )
What does it tell us ?
That 's where facts become interesting .
Because you might draw all sorts of conclusions from this number .
You might say that the rich pay plenty already ; or that it simply shows how rich the rich are .
You might be shocked by how much the state depends on the rich , but that might just confirm your belief that what 's unfair is not the tax people pay but the incomes they begin with .
Or will you switch focus and argue that it reveals how many of those in the middle do not pay the lion 's share of the welfare state , contrary to what some believe , but are in fact heavily subsidised by those at the top ?
Happy to pay his share ?
So are the middle classes spongers ?
Other data suggest that people receive services from the state greater in value than the tax they pay up to about 70 per cent of the way up the income scale , though that calculation is difficult and depends as much on households ' composition - whether they have children at state school , are retired etc , - and makes no allowance for how efficiently services are provided .
How we react to provocative data also says something about us .
So here 's another multiple choice question , not about tax , but about you .
When you saw the answer , did you a .
Change your mind in any way about the tax burden ?
b.
Assimilate this fact into your existing political opinion as fast as possible ?
c.
Say that this number alone does n't tell us nearly enough so how can I know what to think ?
It does n't , for example , tell us who pays the Vat , excise duty , or other taxes , it is only about income tax , which is the most progressive of taxes .
It does n't tell us what share of their income each group pays in tax - which will be some people 's measure of fairness .
The Office for National Statistics ' annual publication about the effect of taxes and benefits ( see internet links , above right ) suggests that most people actually pay a similar share of their income in taxes when all taxes are taken into account , even up to the top 10 per cent as a whole .
But my guess is that a lot of us are tempted by b : to think less about the data than how it can be used for our side of the argument , rather than to set out by asking the open question implied by c : what data would I need to form a proper opinion ?
For this reason , an economist acquaintance of mine says - provocatively - that the facts do not matter to political argument .
If , like this column , you assume value in trying to know and understand the data , that 's a hard conclusion to swallow .
Is it true ?
Where does your money go ?
A minor political scandal is how hard it is for people to see easily , in an accessible form , how tax is spent , compare previous years , break it down regionally , and so on .
Where Does My Money Go ?

The Government Spending ( Website ) Bill would have created a free , wide - ranging , searchable website of all spending by government and executive agencies .
But not enough MPs turned up to vote , from any party , so the Bill failed .
Never mind , it is only the sort of basic information that citizens might use to make sense of probably a good half of all political argument .
In the US , A Federal Funding and Accountability Transparency
Act requires official bodies to publish figures on spending in a single place .

In the UK , the only attempt to do this that I knew of was ukpublicspending .
co.uk by Christopher Chantrill , a writer based in the US .
( See link , above , right on this page . )
Then last week , I was contacted by the Open Knowledge Foundation , a charity , to say they had trawled official data to identify where the money goes and turned this into various visualisations .
Readers can see them at WhereDoesMyMoneyGo.org ( Again , the link is above , right ) Michael Blastland will be examining the issue of tax and the rich further in More or Less , broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Friday 18 December at 1330 GMT .
Here is a selection of your comments .
The observation that the top 10 % of earners pay 50 % of all income tax begs the question , what proportion of the nation 's wealth do they own ?
And how much of that is above the basic standard of living costs we all face and the normal standard of living costs for the population ?
Julia , London
Of course the rich pay a high percentage of the total tax bill , but they receive a large slice on National Income .
When you look at both direct tax ( income ) and indirect tax ( VAT , NI , Council tax ) , the top decile group pays about 33 % of its income in tax --- the figure for the bottom decile is 47 % .
George Irvin , Brighton
One argument about who pays the most tax is that the rich should pay more , because they require the use of our infrastructure to create their wealth ; be that the public transport system for getting people to work , the health service for ensuring that employees do n't have productivity problems on account of poor health or the armed forces to give them a stable environment in which to make their money and much more .
With direct and indirect consequences , the rich benefit from government spending more than they think .
Graeme Phillips , London
The income tax charts show how easily the government could afford to drop income tax for the bottom half of earners , creating a massive stimulus for the economy .
They wo n't , of course .
The education chart shows increasing expenditure , but does n't account for inflation .
The sums should be reported in pounds adjusted for a single year , or reported as a proportion of GDP , or total government expenditure , etc .
Paul , Glasgow
It would have been interesting to know the corresponding salaries that define the income groups though rather than defining them by a percentage .
As I reader , I want to understand what group I am in .
Jonny Crabb , London
What is more startling is that using HRMC's Table 3.5 ( Tax payers only ) , it is clear that 7 % of the population earn over £ 50,000 a year and contribute over 47 % of the income tax for the whole tax paying population .
Also , less than 1 % of the population earn over £ 150,000 a year and these people contribute over 22 % of total income tax .
The scary conclusion I come to is that a small wealthy contingent of people leaving the country can have a large impact on the overall income tax take and thus everybody else would need to pay significantly more to cover the loss .
Schocca , Brentwood
The rich do a lot more than pay taxes .
They have much more money than the middle classes , who tend to have more debt , and the poor , who ca n't afford either .
That money does n't sit in a pile doing nothing - it 's being invested in the economy , either directly by buying shares , bonds or owning companies , or indirectly invested by the bank that is looking after it - because that 's how your bank interest is earned .
Indirect investment by banks is where the majority of growth comes from .
Tom Foale , High Wycombe Unfortunately the article fails to mention that the top 1 % of earners earn 12.4 % of the total income , i.e. they earn over 12 times the average person .
Therefore , proportionately they are paying just under twice as much tax as the average person on each pound of their income .
Seems to me that they are getting a very generous deal .
Robin Bangerter , Market Harborough
It 's not those who pay tax , it 's those who do n't .
The so - called non -doms .
There are two ways to deal with this : 1 ) tax all assets , wherever they are , or 2 ) Make entry for all non-doms restricted to 10 - 14 days entry per year , not 90 , as now .
Harry Cozens , Cardiff I disagree with how much tax the rich pay .
It ignores the legitimate loopholes .
For example , if I were to work as a consultant with my own limited company , then my company ( me ) can charge my client a fortune .
I then pay my employee ( also me ) a pittance , and the employee consequently pays even less tax and NI .
My company ( me ) then pays my shareholder ( erm...me ! ) a huge dividend , at less tax and no national insurance .
The result is , that although I actually earn a significant wage , technically I earn a pittance , pay tax and NI on it , and get a large dividend on which I pay capital gains .
Obviously , if my wife also happens to be a shareholder in my company , then I can split the dividend with her and we both pay less capital gains .
That 's why there are probably a significant number of ' actual ' high earners who technically appear in the low earners box .
That 's why your numbers do n't stack up .
Engineer , London
As a basic rate taxpayer I 'm embarrassed to be subsidised by higher earners .
Why should they pay more tax than me if they 've earned fair and square ?
Tesco wo n't sell us the same loaf of bread at a different price , because we 're after the same commodity .
It 's the same with tax .
Higher earners who earn more because they work harder , have taken more risks or are just simply cleverer deserve to keep what they earn .
Mike Call , Cambridge I am one of the " rich " .
I spend all my earnings on tax , my largest single expense , housing and schooling , and save little .
With the coming tax rises however , I have finally had enough .
I 'm going abroad to live in March .
The political debate in this country just seems to be about how much the population want to stuff me , and other people like me .
I hear from indignant people who pay next to nothing into the system , how unfair it is that people like me do n't pay for everything .
It is not the same elsewhere , indeed quite the opposite .
I am not alone either .
How many more after the next election ?
I do like Britain , I was born here .
But I do n't love anywhere enough to sacrifice my earning life for .
Incidentally , I 'm not a banker .

Even though a Bush - era request to conduct blanket searches of computer files was rebuked by judges , the Obama administration is now pushing to have the decision reversed , according to court documents filed the week of Thanksgiving .
U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan , an Obama appointee , and twenty other government attorneys submitted a brief to the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals , making a very extraordinary request .
ADVERTISEMENT
Federal prosecutors went too far when they seized the drug test results of 104 pro baseball players , according to a 9 - 2 “ en banc ” panel decision in August by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals .
The ruling included guidelines for computer search conduct designed to protect Fourth Amendment privacy rights , in the style of Miranda rights .
Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote at the time that the government “ must maintain the privacy of materials that are intermingled with seizable materials , and … avoid turning a limited search for particular information into a general search of office file systems and computer databases . ”
In 2006 , the 9th Circuit initially sided with the Bush administration against the Major League Baseball Players Association in a 2 - 1 decision .
Back in 2003 , the warrant in the hands of the prosecutors allowed them to search urinalysis records of ten pro baseball players at a Long Beach drug - testing facility .
They claimed the information on other players found in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was in plain sight , and therefore lawful .
But the Court of Appeals argued agents could have selected , copied and pasted only the rows listing the specific players named in the search warrant .
Instead they scrolled to the right side of the spreadsheet to peek at the test results of each player .
The names of four players not linked to the warranted BALCO investigation were later leaked to The New York Times .
In the public eye , power - hitters David Ortiz , Manny Ramirez , Alex Rodriguez and Sammy Sosa may never scrub clean the taint .
Sosa will be eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2013 , along with controversial star Barry Bonds .

The player ’s union accused The Times of breaking the law .
“ The leaking of information under a court seal is a crime , ” he said in a statement .
“ The active pursuit of information that may not lawfully be disclosed because it is under court seal is a crime . ”
Michael Schmidt , the reporter , insists he did nothing wrong , “ It is the choice of the source to talk .
I believe it is legal and ethical for me to ask questions of people who may be covered by court orders . ”
During the slow news week of Thanksgiving the Obama administration took action , seeking to reverse the 3 - month old decision .
Wired Magazine and libertarians had applauded the dramatic reductions to the government ’s search - and - seizure powers , but the government now claims “ computer searches have ground to a complete halt ” in some districts .

Inside a 27 - page brief submitted to the San Francisco - based court Nov. 23 ( and made available on the Wired Magazine website ) Solicitor General Kagan and twenty other undersigned government attorneys insist the 9th Circuit Appeals judges must “ withdraw the en banc panel ’s decision . ”
In other words , throw out the 11 - judge ruling and review the case again with all 27 of its judges , an unprecedented request .
“ The United States is mindful that this Court has never granted full court en banc , ” the brief states .
“ Indeed , the federal government has never asked the Court to do so .
But the broad issues unnecessarily addressed in the en banc panel ’s opinion are of surpassing importance and compel that extraordinary action . ”

The court said rather than copy an entire drive , the government should cull the specific data described in its search warrant .
Otherwise , use an independent third party to comb through files under court supervision , providing nothing else to government agents .
So , which Fourth Amendment protections are unnecessary ?
The government is pointing to a nauseating rape case to argue investigators are now the ones in handcuffs .

The chief executive of International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ) sees a huge business opportunity in making the U.S. health - care system more efficient .
( Sam ) Palmisano sees IBM providing everything from electronic - health records technology to ultra-tiny personal devices that read DNA and cost less than $ 1,000 .
He likened those technologies to health - care equivalents of universal bar - codes in the retail industry , which made that industry more efficient .
But Palmisano acknowledged that single - payer , government health systems outside the U.S. make it easier to use technology for health - information sharing , because health information is more centralized .
“ The advantage of a government payer or centralized system is they can begin to create incentives for change much more so than you can in a fragmented model , ” he said .
He said the federal government could save itself $ 900 billion over 10 years in health - care spending by simply managing it better .

So IBM CEO Sam Palmisano says that single payer , government health systems have an advantage over fragmented systems ( like ours in the U.S. ) since they can create incentives for change .
That seems counter to those who claim ( falsely ) that government systems suppress innovation .
He also states that the federal government could manage health care spending better ( as Medicare and the VA have done ) .
Wow !

Age itself is one of the most significant variables in understanding marijuana use .
Past - year use of marijuana increasesd with age , to a peak prevalence of about 23 percent among 18 - to 25 - year - olds , before declining to about 44 percent among persons aged 35 and older .
Additionally :
From age 12 to age 13 , the proportion of teens that who say they could buy marijuana if they wanted to more than triples , from 14 percent to 50 percent .
From age 12 to age 13 , the percentage of teens who say they know a student at their school who sells illegal drugs almost triples , from 8 percent to 22 percent .
From age 12 to age 13 , the percentage of teens who say they rely most on their parents ’ opinions when making important decisions drops by almost one - third , from 58 percent to 42 percent .
By age 14 and 15 , marijuana use in the past year increases to 16 percent .
Marijuana smoking among 8th graders increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 22 percent in 1997 .
Gender
Marijuana use — whether lifetime , past year or current — is most common among males .
Among adults , male smoking rates for marijuana are nearly twice those for females .
In the total surveyed population , males were about 70 percent more likely than females to have used marijuana in the past year ( 11 percent versus 6.7 , nearly 7 percent ) .
The only exception to the data showing more male smokers of marijuana than females occurs among children and teens .
Given that marijuana is by far the most commonly used illicit drug , it is not surprising that gender and age patterns for marijuana are similar to the corresponding patterns for any illicit drug .
Race and Ethnicity
In almost every racial and ethnic subgroup , males are more likely than females to have used marijuana in the past year , except among Native Americans and Hispanics , where there is no significant difference between males and females .
Males are more than twice as likely as females to be past - year marijuana users , except among Native Americans ( 16 percent of females vs. 14 percent of males ) .
For example :
Hispanics ( 9.2 percent and 8.9 percent )
non-Hispanic blacks ( 7.7 , nearly 8 percent of females used marijuana in the past year vs. 14 percent of males who used in the past year )
non-Hispanic whites ( 6.7 , nearly 7 percent vs. 11 percent ) .
Among Asian / Pacific Islanders ( 2.0 , 2 percent vs. 7.7 , nearly 8 percent )
South Americans ( 4.2 , more than 4 percent vs. 13 percent )
In general , males are at least three times as likely as females to be past - year marijuana users .
The exception is among Native Americans and Hispanics , where there is no significant difference between males and females ( e.g. , Native Americans , 16 percent of females vs. 14 percent of males ; and Hispanics , 8.9 percent of females vs. 9.2 percent of males ) .
White males have higher marijuana use than black or Hispanic males .
Similarly , white females have higher levels of use than black or Hispanic females .
In 1991 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , 14.7 percent of students said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days .
By 1995 , that rate had jumped to 25.3 percent .
Use among white students jumped from 15.2 percent to 24.6 percent ; among Hispanics , from 14.4 percent to 27.8 percent ; and among blacks , from 13.5 percent to 28.8 percent .
In every age group , Puerto Ricans and non-Hispanic whites are relatively high in past - year marijuana use , while Asian or Pacific Islanders , Caribbean inhabitants , Central Americans and Cubans are relatively low .
Native Americans are relatively high at ages 12 through 34 , but data for Native Americans at age 35 and older are is too sparse to yield a reliable estimate at age 35 and older .
Non-Hispanic blacks are relatively high at ages 26 and older ( e.g. , 5.8 , nearly 6 percent among individuals age 35 and older ) but about average at younger ages .
Mexicans , South Americans and other Hispanics are about average in past - year marijuana use .
Geography
Major U.S. metropolitan areas have higher rates of marijuana smoking , but the differences are quite small .
However , youth in large and small metropolitan areas are significantly more likely than youths in non-metropolitan areas to report current marijuana use .
Furthermore , among adults ages 26 to 34 , marijuana use was much more common among those living in large metropolitan areas .
Use of marijuana appears to be greatest among residents living in the West and North Central United States .
Education and Employment
Marijuana use is generally equal across all educational levels , except for higher rates of use in the past year among those with the least formal education and lowest rates of use in the past month among college graduates ages 26 to 34 .
Overall , college graduates report less use than those with some or no college experience .

ASTONISHING discoveries in space , revelations about human nature , frightening news on the environment , medical advances that will banish life - threatening diseases : an inexhaustible stream of wonders runs through the pages of New Scientist .
All tell the same tale .
Science is exciting .
Science is cutting - edge .
Science is fun .
It is now time to come clean .
This glittering depiction of the quest for knowledge is … well , perhaps not an outright lie , but certainly a highly edited version of the truth .
Science is not a whirlwind dance of excitement , illuminated by the brilliant strobe light of insight .
It is a long , plodding journey through a dim maze of dead ends .
It is painstaking data collection followed by repetitious calculation .
It is revision , confusion , frustration , bureaucracy and bad coffee .
In a word , science can be boring .
My own brief and undistinguished research career included its share of mind - numbing tasks , notably the months of data processing which revealed that a large and expensive orbiting gamma - ray telescope had fixed its eye on the exploding heart of a distant galaxy and seen … nothing .
I tip my hat , though , to New Scientist ‘s San Francisco bureau chief , who spent nearly three years watching mice sniff each other in a room dimly lit by a red bulb .
“ It achieved little , ” he confesses , “ apart from making my clothes smell of mouse urine . ”
And the office prize for research ennui has to go to the editor of NewScientist.com .
“ I once spent four weeks essentially turning one screw backwards and forwards , ” he says .
“ It was about that time that I decided I …
With a hat tip to John Hodgman , who has pretty well cornered the market on ridiculous solutions to serious problems , I think I 've got the answer to climate change : a cap - and - trade program for babies .
As related by the Washington Post , two recent studies have pointed out that the real culprit for global warming is n't cars or coal plants , it 's us .
There are too many humans on planet Earth , emitting too much carbon .
The cheapest cure is contraception , according to a study released last week by the London School of Economics , which points out that each $ 7 spent on family planning over the next four decades would reduce carbon - dioxide emissions by more than a ton .
Achieving the same result with low - carbon technologies would cost at least $ 32 .
What 's more , a study from Oregon State University concluded that having children ( especially American ones , because Americans use vast amounts of energy compared to people from other countries ) is the most environmentally damaging decision you can make .
I can see the answer now :
You place a cap of one child on every couple , but set up a market to trade child - bearing credits so low - income couples can sell them to those with the means to support big families .
It 's eugenic - tastic !
OK , maybe not .
But the notion is only a little sillier than the solution being promoted by the London School and its study 's sponsor , the British - based Optimum Population Trust .
Their model for fighting climate change by promoting birth control in the Third World ignores the fact that such programs almost never work .
There are many reasons for the population explosion , but most of them come down to one factor : poverty .
Women in poor countries have little education and almost no power over reproductive decisions , so they go from one pregnancy to the next .
In places where infant mortality is high , women have a lot of children because some are expected to die .
Agrarian societies need children to work the farm .
Programs to promote condoms are n't going to change any of this ; if you want to lower birth rates , as Jeffrey Sachs and other scholars have pointed out , you have to reduce poverty .
That means investing in development for poor countries .
Of course , with development and industrialization come higher greenhouse gas emissions .
There 's a solution for that , too :
Make sure these societies " grow green . "
To do that , the U.S. and other rich countries have to develop clean - energy technologies , and mass produce them until solar panels and windmills are cheaper for industrializing nations to install than coal - burning power plants .
As Hodgman would say , " Global warming , solved .
You 're Welcome . "

Mini - hole made of metamaterials ensnares microwave light .
The artificial ' black hole ' sucks up microwaves .
Q. Cheng and T. J. Cui
Physicists have created a black hole for light that can fit in your coat pocket .
Their device , which measures just 22 centimetres across , can suck up microwave light and convert it into heat .
The hole is the latest clever device to use ' metamaterials ' , specially engineered materials that can bend light in unusual ways .
Previously , scientists have used such metamaterials to build ' invisibility carpets ' and super - clear lenses .
This latest black hole was made by Qiang Chen and Tie Jun Cui of Southeast University in Nanjing , China , and is described in a paper on the preprint server ArXiv1 .
Black holes are normally too massive to be carried around .
The black hole at the centre of the Milky Way , for example , has a mass around 3.6 million times that of the Sun and warps the very space around it .
Light that travels too close to it can become trapped forever .
The new meta - black hole also bends light , but in a very different way .
Rather than relying on gravity , the black hole uses a series of metallic ' resonators ' arranged in 60 concentric circles .
The resonators affect the electric and magnetic fields of a passing light wave , causing it to bend towards the centre of the hole .
It spirals closer and closer to the black hole 's ' core ' until it reaches the 20 innermost layers .
Those layers are made of another set of resonators that convert light into heat .
The result : what goes in cannot come out .
" The light into the core is totally absorbed , " Cui says .
The device is made of 60 concentric metamaterial ' resonators ' .
Q. Cheng and T. J. Cui *
" I am very impressed , " says John Pendry , a theoretical physicist at Imperial College London .
Pendry says that the black hole is yet the latest example of the many strange devices that can be built with metamaterials .
But , he adds , it is not a perfect black - hole analogy .
The enormous gravity of real black holes causes them to emit an eerie quantum glow , known as Hawking radiation .
" The optical device reported in this paper has no internal source of energy and therefore cannot emit Hawking radiation , " Pendry says .
Nevertheless , Cui says that the hole could prove useful .
By the end of the year his team hopes to have a version of the device that will suck up light of optical frequencies .
If it works , it could be used in applications such as solar cells .

THE ethanol industry , once the darling of corn growers , environmentalists and the auto industry , has fallen on hard times .
Producers spent this year caught between falling ethanol prices and rising corn costs , causing many to go bankrupt .
In response , they are pushing the Environmental Protection Agency to increase the amount of ethanol they can blend into gasoline to 15 percent , up from the current 10 percent .
Allowing this , however , would only double down on a discredited environmental policy without solving the industry ’s fundamental economic problem .
That problem is simple : Ethanol prices trend higher and lower along with the price of gasoline , yet the cost of producing ethanol tends to rise with demand , since higher ethanol production exerts upward pressure on the price of corn .
In a free market , corn prices might be expected to eventually fall as the market adjusts to increased demand .
But because the government heavily promotes ethanol use through subsidies and regulation , the market is continually strained .
The problem is magnified because corn is a water - and fertilizer - intensive crop that requires considerable investment .
Worse , since fertilizer is often an oil - based product , the cost of growing corn tends to rise at the very moment ethanol prices , which rise with oil prices , might bring a good return .
The ethanol industry has less incentive to control its costs and diversify its market as long as the federal government guarantees it a place at the pump .
Yet Congress ’s solution to the plight of ethanol suppliers has been to mandate more ethanol use in gasoline .
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated that use of renewable transportation fuel rise from nine billion gallons last year to 36 billion gallons in 2022 .
Although some of this mandate must be met by advanced biofuels from switchgrass and other sources , corn-produced ethanol is the only large - scale alternative fuel currently available to meet Congress ’s mandate .

An entertaining and informative presentation , even for those who work with this stuff on a daily basis .
The hosts ’ comparison on the power of gasoline to black powder is especially impressive : using a makeshift cannon , they demonstrate how far a projectile launches with a spoonful of black powder , then with a spoonful of gasoline .
The difference is astounding .
The early evolution of dinosaurs , in the late Triassic period , is fuzzy , to say the least .
Paleontologists know that the first dinosaurs appeared about 230 million years ago , but fossil evidence is so spotty that it is unclear where and when the major lineages  theropods , sauropods and ornithischians  began to diverge .
Some excellent 215 - million - year - old fossils unearthed in Ghost Ranch , in northern New Mexico , are helping to clarify things .
The bones , of a theropod that the discoverers have named Tawa hallae , support the idea that the lineages diverged early on in the part of the supercontinent Pangea that is now South America .
“ What Tawa does is it helps signify the relationships at the base of dinosauria , ” said Sterling J. Nesbitt , a University of Texas researcher and lead author of a paper in Science describing the find .
Dr. Nesbitt worked on the fossils while at the American Museum of Natural History and Columbia University .
Like later theropods , Tawa walked on two legs and had sharp teeth for tearing apart its food : other animals .
The most complete specimen , a juvenile , was about six feet long .
Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez has accused the Netherlands of allowing the United States to use Dutch islands off Venezuela ’s Caribbean coast to prepare a possible military attack against his country , news agency AP reports .
AP says Chavez claims the US has sent intelligence agents , war ships and spy planes to the Antillean islands of Aruba , Curacao and Bonaire .
‘ They are three islands in Venezuela ’s territorial waters , but they are still under an imperial regime : the Netherlands , ’ Chavez was reported as saying during a speech at the climate change conference in Denmark .
He called on the European Union to take a stance .
Chavez has repeatedly accused the US of conspiring with Colombia to topple his government , AP said .
Mercenaries ?
CIA Says Expanded Role for Contractors Legitimate Afghan and Iraq combat role for Blackwater , other firms , would be illegal
Dec. 11 , 2009  --
The CIA and the military special forces have quietly expanded the role of private contractors , including Blackwater , to include their involvement in raids and secret paramilitary operations in Afghanistan , Pakistan and Iraq , four current and former U.S. military and intelligence officers tell ABC News .
American law specifically prohibits the use of private soldiers or mercenaries in combat , according to Jonathan Turley , a professor of public interest law at George Washington University .
" The United States Congress has never approved the use of private contractors for combat operations , " Turley told ABC News in an interview to be broadcast tonight on ABC World News with Charles Gibson .
CIA officials acknowledge that two private contractors were killed in Afghanistan in 2003 when they and other members of a CIA paramilitary team were in a firefight with Taliban fighters on a remote road .
In another case , in 2006 , 12 Blackwater " tactical action operatives " were recruited for a secret raid into Pakistan by the U.S. military 's Joint Special Operations Command , according to a military intelligence planner .
The target of the planned raid , code - named Vibrant Fury , was a suspected al Qaeda training camp , according to the planner , who said he did not know the outcome of the mission .
In Iraq , a high - ranking U.S. Army officer told ABC News , Blackwater personnel have been used in military operations that " are supposed to include U.S. soldiers but often end up with the Blackwater people on their own . "
The New York Times reported Friday that such raids against Iraqi insurgents were conducted " almost nightly " between 2004 and 2006 , and it quoted several Blackwater guards as saying " the operations became so routine that the lines supposedly dividing the Central Intelligence Agency , the military and Blackwater became blurred . "
" A Very Serious Offense to Our Constitution "
The Washington Post today quoted former government officials as saying Blackwater 's actions included " active participation in raids overseen by CIA or special forces personnel . "
American officials reject the term " mercenary , " but others say the term applies if the role of private American contractors has been so significantly expanded beyond their previously known assignments in security and logistics .
" If contractors have been sent on true combat missions , missions where they are supposed to kill and engage the enemy , then they are by every definition of the term mercenaries , " said Professor Turley .
" To have such a force without allowing Congress to approve it would be considered a very serious offense to our Constitution , " said Turley .
A CIA spokesperson , George Little , acknowledged the use of contractors " in roles that complement and enhance the skills of our workforce , just as American law permits . "
Little said " it 's the way things actually work in the real world , " and he stressed that CIA officials always retained " decision - making authority and bear responsibility for results . "
" CIA does not use Blackwater to perform our core missions of collecting intelligence , performing analysis or conducting covert operations , " said Little .
A U.S. government official told ABC
News the private contractors " do n't kick down doors " but only fulfill a " security role " on certain CIA missions .
The new CIA director under the Obama administration , Leon Panetta , has continued a " rigorous look " at the use of contractors and a " thorough review " of Blackwater 's contracts .
Said Little , " Earlier this year , Director Panetta ordered the end of one Blackwater contract and the transition of those activities to government personnel .
In addition , he ordered a review of all Blackwater contracts . "
" At this time , " said Little , " Blackwater is not involved in any CIA operations in other than a security or support role . "
" A Wild and Unsubstantiated Allegation "
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said the allegation that private contractors were used in combat situations by the American military was " bogus , nothing more than a wild and unsubstantiated allegation . "
He said there was no evidence that the military had ever contracted with Blackwater for such missions .
Morrell did not respond to specific questions about the top- secret Vibrant Fury operation in 2006 that allegedly recruited Blackwater operatives .
" If you have a team of private contractors who are going into Pakistan with the approval of the United States government to engage in combat , then you have very serious international and domestic problems , " said Professor Turley .
Blackwater 's " Select " Program
Blackwater , now re-named Xe , has a " select " program within its operation that helped to staff some of the expanded and more difficult roles in the two war zones , according to U.S. military officials , former U.S. intelligence officers and a person with knowledge of Blackwater operations .
A 2007 on - line recruitment advertisement for the Blackwater USA select program described the openings as positions in a " Mobile Security Contract in support of a U.S. government agency . "
Candidates were required to be able to maintain a Top Secret clearance and have " one year of experience in Iraq , Afghanistan or other High Threat Environment . "
A U.S. Army officer who ran human intelligence collections activities in Afghanistan in 2003 , Tony Shaffer , says he never worked directly with Blackwater personnel but frequently encountered them in secret operations run by the military and the CIA .
" I actually met with the CIA and Blackwater operatives who were working together , totally hand in glove , to conduct operational planning and support of their objectives , which are paramilitary operations along the border , " said Shaffer , then a Major but now a Lieutenant Colonel who teaches at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies .
" The idea was to bring to bear additional resources for specific special operations missions , " he said .
" The purpose for that , in my judgment , may have been to avoid some level of oversight . "
In the case of Operation Vibrant Fury , military personnel say the decision to request Blackwater personnel came after a request for military " tier one " operatives was denied .
A spokesperson for Blackwater said the company was unaware of any operation with the code name Vibrant Fury .
The mission was to raid , destroy and kill al Qaeda members at a camp in Pakistan where guards for Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri were believed to be training , according to the military planner .
A second person briefed on the operation confirmed Blackwater agreed to provide operatives for the military special forces .
The commanders of the elite special forces , then called Task Force 373 , decided to solicit help from Blackwater , said the planner , after military superiors said the men could not be spared from Iraq .
The request to Blackwater was met on Oct. 31 , 2006 , according to the planner .

Man , I hate being forced to insult someone .
But he brings it on himself : Glenn Beck is an idiot .
He is a right - wing blowhard who talks endlessly about stuff he does n't have a clue about .
A web search on him will yield endless idiotic rants where he is precisely wrong ( his penultimate latest was claiming that people who hate America -- meaning progressives -- were getting their houses burnt in California .
That dope does n't even know how conservative San Diego county is , let alone understand just how truly offensive such a statement is on its own merits ) .
So now he is pontificating on global warming and the SoCal fires .
And what does this brain trust have to say ?
BECK : We 'll tell you the truth .
We 'll tell you the things that are politically incorrect .
I 'll go on and I 'll tell you the fires have very little to do with global warming , if anything .
The globe was the hottest in 19 -- was it 1934 , Stu [ executive producer Steve " Stu " Burguiere ] , or ' 37 ? -- ' 34 , 1934 was the hottest year .
A stat , by the way , that was , I believe , intentionally distorted by the guy the left holds up as the scientist on global warming .
America 's temperature peaked in 1934 .
Since 1934 , the hottest year on record was 1998 .
It has not gotten warmer since 1998 .
That 's a fact .
Now , why are these fires burning out of control ?
Al Gore and everybody else will have you believe that it is all about global warming .
Well , really ?
A one - degree temperature change that happened at the first part of the century , not in the last part of the century , at least most of it , and a temperature change that has n't changed since 1998 is causing superfires in California and only California ?
Only America ?
It 's in the American borders .
How is that possible ?
His first statement is wrong , right off the bat : it 's nowhere near the truth .
First , 1934 was the hottest year in the US , not globally .
Second , as I discussed extensively on this very blog , 1934 was just barely hotter than 1998 , the second hottest year on record ( again , in the US , not in the world ) .
The difference is so miniscule that they can be considered to be tied .
Third , that stat was not intentionally distorted by James Hansen ( the scientist he mentions obliquely ) .
There was some recalibration done on the temperatures , and the numbers get shuffled around a bit .
Not terribly much , in fact , and the overall conclusions on global warming do n't change .
Fourth , the fluctuations in temperature year - to - year are large , so you can't simply state that it has n't gotten hotter since 1998 .
That 's meaningless .
You need to look at longer trends .
Fifth , while the one degree rise in Fahrenheit has been going on for the past century , in fact the temperature has spiked upward since about 1980 .
That 's obvious from this graph ( x - axis is years since 1880 ) :
So in fact , Beck is wrong again : the majority of the rise in temperatures in the US has been over the past few decades .
Sixth , no real scientist is saying that global warming is causing these fires .
What it 's doing is setting up conditions where things like this are more likely .
Global warming affects global weather patterns , and it's the Santa Ana winds that turned these fires from a nuisance into a killer .
I 'm not saying that GW is the trigger here ; I 'm saying that things will get wonkier from here on out .
Count on it .
Glenn Beck has an astonishing record of saying astonishingly stupid things .
He said this particular garbage on his radio show .
I 'm not surprised ; AM radio is loaded with talk shows that spew nothing but hate , lies , distortions , and intolerance ( I am only intolerant of willful ignorance and willful distortion of reality ) .
But he also has an hour - long program on CNN every day !
Why the heck does CNN give him any air at all ?
I do n't like to call people names , but Beck is given a national audience , and his intellectual capacity is clearly such that he should n't even be allowed to rant in public parks to passing squirrels .
I 've had enough of such idiocy , especially on matters of what is in fact and in deed life and death .
Joe Lieberman , you just screwed my mother when you played political gamesmanship with the proposal to lower the Medicare opt in age to 55 .
See , my mom devoted herself to raising her family and that meant giving up a lot .
She gave up a potential career for us , choosing instead to try to be at home as much as possible to give us a nuturing family life and work a series of low - wage , part - time jobs to try and bring money in for food and the mortgage .
Many women still choose that route today - I admit that I 'm one of them - because at a certain point you are " upside down " on the amount of money you take in with a job versus the amount of money you pay out in childcare expenses .
It 's life , we all make choices .
The downside to my mother 's life choice of being there for her children was that now , when my dad is reaching retirement age , she will have to try to convince her employer to take her on full time so that she can have health care coverage until she reaches the age of 65 , because my parents can't afford the Cobra payments after my dad retires from his job .
It is n't a long time we 're talking about , and there 's a pretty good - not certain , but pretty good - chance that Mom will be able to work this out .
But still , at the end of her working life after busting butt for us she will have to bust some more for over a year just so she can be covered in case something happens with her back , or her high blood pressure , or any number of other things that one 's body can do to one in their 60's .
Still , my mom is fortunate .
She is lucky in that she has options .
But those options are only the coincidence of fate - how many women are in my mother 's place who did n't have their stars align in the right pattern and who now have to spend every day worrying about what they will do if they get ill , or need to have a knee replaced , or discover that they have any number of lifetime conditions that require medical treatment ?
Joe Lieberman , you just made my mom's life harder because of your pigheaded , evil need for retribution against a rag - tag group of internet bloggers who had the temerity to primary you .
So on behalf of my mother , and all the women in her similar situation : F*ck you and the horse you rode into the Senate on .
As God is my witness I will work every .
friggin. day .
to ensure your defeat when your seat is up , and I 'll talk to my friends and neighbors about doing the same .
Peace out .
UPDATE : With my thanks for the recs please accept this humble 6 second baby smack - down of Joe Lieberman :
Kid 's got a point , you know .
The 100,000 words a day that are changing our brains and ruining our concentration
Having trouble concentrating on this story ?
It could be because your brain is bombarded with more than 100,000 words a day .
The average adult hears or reads 100,500 words a day , research shows .
And the ' day ' takes into account only waking hours outside work - meaning the true figure is much higher .
Information overload : Talking on the phone and surfing the internet can see the average adult exposed to more than 100,000 words a day
Researcher Roger Bohn estimated the amount of information people are exposed to inside and outside the home , for activities other than work .
Trips to the cinema , listening to the radio , talking on the phone , playing video games , surfing the internet and reading the newspaper were all factored in to create a ' snapshot of the information revolution ' .
It concluded that the average adult was exposed to more than 100,000 words daily and 34 gigabytes of information - or a fifth of the storage capacity of a notepad computer .
There are concerns our brains are being overloaded and even that their structure is being changed by the flood of data .
Susan Greenfield , one of Britain 's most eminent scientists , has repeatedly warned that social networking sites may be harming children 's brains by shortening attention spans , encouraging instant gratification and making young people more self - centred .
Constant computer use may also be ' infantalising ' the brain , making it harder to learn when things to wrong .
Professor Bohn , from the University of California , said : ' I think one thing is clear :
Our attention is being chopped into shorter intervals and that is probably not good for thinking deeper thoughts . '
Oxford University neuroscientist Professor Colin Blakemore added : ' The brain can grow and increase in size depending on how it is used .
Perhaps dealing with this new information will cause new nerve cells to be born . '
The Caribbean could be among the poor regions of the world that could be challenged by the need to increase levels of investment in agriculture in order to meet the food demands that are likely to result from medium to long - term population growth .
Projections contained in a Food and Agricultural Organiza-tion ( FAO ) Discussion Paper prepared for an October 12 - 13 High Level Experts Forum on How To Feed The World in 2050 indicate that investments in agriculture by developing countries must increase by about 50 per cent to around US $ 83 billion annually if there is to be enough food to feed the anticipated 9.1 billion global population in 2050 .
Of the projected net investments in agriculture Latin America and the Caribbean will have to pump some US $ 20 billion into the sector if the anticipated food needs of the region are to be met .
Overall , the FAO ’s latest projections indicate that global agricultural production must increase by 70 per cent over current levels by 2050 in order to feed the estimated additional 2.3 billion people likely to be living on the planet within the next four decades .
The recent High Level Experts Meeting held in Rome saw intense discourses among 300 food and population experts on the nexus between moving increased agricultural production further towards the front burner of the global agenda and responding to the challenge of meeting the world ’s food needs in 2050 .
The forum was convened against the backdrop of a projected global population increase from the current 6.9 billion to a projected 9.1 billion .
“ Agriculture will have no choice but to be more productive , ” FAO Director General Jacques Diouf told the Rome meeting .
The deliberations of the Rome meeting put into perspective the food challenges confronting the Caribbean where last year ’s estimated US $ 3 billion food import bill galvanized Caribbean Community Heads into debate on the need to reduce food imports and to focus more attention on shoring up the region ’s agricultural sector .
The 2008 regional forum on food security convened in Georgetown witnessed a broad range of discussions on several agriculture - related issues including more private sector investment in agriculture , a more liberal bank lending regime for investment in the sector , regional collaboration in the establishment of mega - farms utilizing Guyana ’s vast land resources and increased investment in significantly enhancing the agricultural research investment in the region .
Guyana ’s President Bharrat Jagdeo , the designated regional lead spokesperson on agriculture has been the principal advocate of a stronger Caribbean agricultural sector including significantly increased levels of regional and international investment in the sector .
President Jagdeo had admitted that the regional response to what is widely believed to be an impending global food crisis has been slow and the alarm bells sounded in Rome at the experts forum will , hopefully , help to galvanize CARICOM states into paying more attention to their respective agricultural sectors .
At the two - day Rome forum , the food and population experts from around the world reviewed and debated the investment needs , technologies and policy measures needed to secure global food supplies by 2050 as well as the likely impact of climate on the attainment of targeted food production levels .
Securing development aid to boost agricultural production is likely to be one of the key challenges that will face developing countries in the period ahead and with an estimated US $ 44 billion annually in development aid needed for agriculture – as against the US$ 9 billion currently being expended – developing countries are expected to mount an intense lobby at the November 16 - 18 World Summit on Food Security for more bilateral and multilateral support for agriculture .
The World Summit is likely to represent another major diplomatic assignment for President Bharrat Jagdeo who is expected to be one of the Heads of State from the FAO ’s 192 member countries in attendance .
Conceivably , President Jagdeo could use the opportunity of the global food summit both to rally CARICOM behind FAO Director General Jacques Diouf ’s advocacy of more private sector investment in agriculture and to further promote his current diplomatic preoccupation , Guyana ’s Low Carbon Development Strategy as a mechanism for helping to ensure that the 2050 food production targets are met .
According to the FAO discussion paper temperature rises by more than 2 degrees Celsius could severely contract global food production potential resulting in major yield reductions in critical food crops .
The decline , the Paper says , is likely to be particularly pronounced in the low - latitude regions of Africa , Asia and Latin America where yields could be reduced by between 20 - 40 per cent if effective adaptation measures are not taken .
Private sector investment apart , developing countries , including Caribbean territories are likely to be significantly challenged by the requirement that more public funds be allocated to enhancing agricultural output .
The FAO ’s Discussion Paper identifies agricultural research and development , large scale infrastructure such as roads , ports and power , extension services and education , particularly of women , sanitation , clean water supply and healthcare as areas into which significantly increased public funds will have to be sunk if the 2050 food production is to be met .
“ New technologies and improved practices will therefore also be needed to deal with a changing climate as well as rapidly increasing water scarcity , ” the paper says .
IA - 32 assembly on Mac OS X
I had to do some low level work with Mac OS X Snow Leopard using my MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo .
I learned plenty regarding GAS for i386 and x86_64 but I would not recommend this setup to learn assembly .
I think Apple 's specifics would discourage a beginner and impair his / her ability to use code samples found in most books .
I would rather recommend a IBM T42 with Linux Ubuntu .
EDIT : I 've received numerous emails so I 'm going to try to explain further .
It 's legitimate to buy a IA - 32 book or to follow an online tutorial about i386 assembly intending to use a MacBook Pro to experiment as it should be backward compatible .
My concern is that by doing this :
Nothing will work !
The code sample wo n't compile , the libc call wo n't link and the stack wo n't be aligned properly .
That would be a huge learning curve .
Memory refresh
Just to make sure we are at on the same page , here is a schema of the memory the way I like to represent it :
Lower memory at the top .
Higher memory at the bottom .
Text section contains the actual code .
Data section contains initialized global variables ( with 0s ) .
Bss section contains uninitialized global variables .
Heap grows " down " , toward higher address .
Stack grows " up " , toward lower address .
Every function calls , a stack frame is created to hold parameters and local variables .
Registers EAX , EBX , ECX , EDX , Floating Points , MMX's , SSE's are used in operations but logistic is mostly done via ESP and EBP .
More about Stack Frames :
Function parameters are pushed on the stack in reverse order of declaration in source code .
The EIP return address ( instruction to start from when the function returns ) is pushed on the stack .
The function prolog is :
Current EBP value is pushed on the stack .
EBP takes the value of the current ESP .
Function 's local variable are allocated on the stack in order of declaration .
While in the function body , arguments and local variables are referenced via the EBP register ( see schema ) .
The function epilog is :
ESP takes the value of the current EBP .
EBP value is popped from the stack .
Every time a function is called , a new stack frame is created relying mostly on the EBP and ESP registers .
ESP points to the last item inserted in the stack .
EBP points to the base of the current stackframe :
void function ( int parA , int parB , int parC , int parD ) { int foo ; int bar ; [...] return ; }
The annoying 16 byte stack alignment
Because compilers try to take advantage of the SIMD unit ( MMX , SSE , SSE2 and SSE3 instructions set )
Apple want the stack to be 16 byte aligned even in an IA - 32 environment , so ESP point to a 0xXXXXXXXC memory address .
Let 's take the example of a small program such as cpuid2.s which goal is to write on screen the type of CPU running , using the libc function printf :
.bss .data output : .asciz " The processor Vendor ID is ' %s '
" .lcomm buffer , 13 . text .globl _main _main : movl $ 0 , %eax # define cpuid output option cpuid movl $ buffer , %edi # put values in string movl %ebx , 0 ( %edi ) movl %edx , 4 ( %edi ) movl %ecx , 8 ( %edi ) movl $ 0 , %ecx movl %ecx , 12 ( %edi ) # Now Calling printf subl $ 0x4 , %esp #padding stack :/ ! pushl $ buffer pushl $ output call _printf #macosx need libc pre_ # ESP is at 0xXXXXXXX0 now , # with MacOS X Special stub it will be at 0xXXXXXXXC call _exit nop
Here are three significant stack state at :
Beginning of the program
Just before call _printf Inside libc 's printf
On a " regular " system :
push
0xXXXXXXXC
push
8(%EBP )
12(%EBP )
Compilation problems
On Mac OS X : Not only you need to pad the stack but you also need to take into account the fact that Mac OS X will perfom an extra 4 byteon the stack .
That 's why with two 4 byte parameters , the stack is only padded with 4 byte so the Mac OS X special still find the stack aligned onAlso on the list of thing to adapt , you need to remember that function parameters are 4 byte further than where they would be because of " Mac OS X " 's special .
For example , the first parameter on regulat system is atwhile it is aton Mac OS X .
An other issue that beginners may find discouraging is that plain old compilation does n't work .
GAS assembly program can normally be compiled via as assembler & ld linker ( or gcc directly ) via :
as -o cpuid2.o cpuid2.s ld -e _main -o cpuid2 - lc cpuid2.o // or gcc cpuid2.s - gstabs -o cpuid2
But this wo n't work on a MacBook Pro Core2 Duo running Snow Leopard , cpuid2.s althought IA - 32 valid wo n't get assembled :
cpuid2.s:50 : suffix or operands invalid for `push ' cpuid2.s:51 : suffix or operands invalid for `push '
It seems as default to x86_64 assembly .
You need to be specific about the target architecture :
as - arch i386 -o cpuid2.o cpuid2.s ld -e _main -o cpuid2 - lc cpuid2.o // or gcc -arch i386 cpuid2.s - gstabs -o cpuid2
EDIT : Reddit user jah6 pointed out that you can get rid of the alignment problem when compiling with gcc : Use -mstackrealign parameter .
LibC method names
Mac OS
S requires yout to prefix all your libc method name with " _ " .
Most code sample in Unix world do n't have this constraint .
Recommended reading
Try " Professional Assembly Language " , it 's a pretty good book .
Except that they should really really really stop putting the face of their author on the front cover .
What a turn off .

A photographer strapped a Canon Rebel XT to his helmet while skydiving , but instead of capturing some great airborne shots , it fell off his helmet and plummeted 3,000 feet to the ground .
Unbelievably , it survived .

According to a friend of the photographer :
Amazingly , the Rebel survived the fall and my friend is still using it to this very day .
It has a crack in the plastic body and the kit lens is a little jerky when zooming , but functional .
I 'd like to know if there is a similar story or something close to this but I doubt .
It might be a world record indeed ( for the height of a camera drop which survived ) .

Photos show that the camera is remarkably intact — the viewfinder is still functional , both the camera body and lens are pretty much fine .
Not that we recommend you heave your DSLR out of a low - flying plane , but it 's nice to know that if you do , there 's a chance it 'll be just fine .

The Bureau of Labor Statistics released this chart today , showing the fall and rise of import and export price indices from October 2008 to October 2009 .
As you can see , prices fell when the recession was in full swing last year , which is great , because when everyone 's poorer , falling prices are helpful .
Well , were still pretty poor , but here come higher prices roaring back :
BLS : The price index for all imports rose 0.7 percent in October , led by a 1.8 percent increase in fuel prices .
The rise followed a 0.2 - percent increase in September .
The price index for all exports advanced 0.3 percent in October after decreasing 0.2 percent the previous month .
Export prices rose 0.3 percent after falling 0.2 percent in September .
Rising nonagricultural prices more than offset a drop in the price index for agricultural exports .
Prices of overall exports decreased 3.4 percent for the October 2008 – 2009 period .
REYKJAVIK ( Reuters ) - Thousands of Icelanders lined up at McDonald ’s restaurants to order their last Big Macs before the U.S. fast - food chain abandons the crisis - hit island at midnight Saturday due to soaring costs .
The world ’s largest fast - food company said earlier this week that all three of its restaurants in Iceland , operated by franchisee Jon Ogmundsson , would shut down October 31 .
The outlets have been packed since the announcement , with lines at one restaurant on the east side of the city backing up out the door and onto the street .
At lunchtime Friday the outlet ’s parking lot was full and staff inside were working furiously to keep up with the soaring demand .
“ It ’s my last chance for a while to have a real Big Mac , ” Siggi , a 28 - year old salesman waiting in line , told Reuters .
“ With the economy as it is , I wo n’t be traveling abroad any time soon , ” he added .
“ It ’s not that I ’m a big fan of McDonald ’s , but a Big Mac now and then adds to variety . ”
Ogmundsson , who will continue running the restaurants under a different name after taking down the golden arches , said he had even run out of Big Macs for a few hours Thursday .
“ Sales have not just gone up , ” Ogmundsson was quoted saying in the local media .
“ It ’s gone turbo . ”
Ogmundsson said he managed to catch up with the surge in demand and had been selling about 10,000 burgers a day -- more than ever before .
Iceland has been reeling from the effects of the financial crisis since October 2008 , when its banks collapsed in the space of a week under the weight of billions of dollars in debt .
The fall of the banks sapped confidence in Iceland ’s economy and sent its currency , the crown , into freefall .
McDonald ’s said the crown ’s weakness was part of the reason for its withdrawal , along with the high cost of importing food from abroad .
McDonald ’s said it would not seek to come back to Iceland .
In a nearby stationary store , Thora Sigurdardottir , a 35 - year old nursing assistant , said she had no intention of going for a final McDonald ’s meal .
“ Good riddance , ” she said .
RIGA — The Constitutional Court ’s ruling Monday that the decision by Latvia ’s government earlier this year to lower pensions had violated the Satversme will , at the very least , force a new round of talks with international lenders and could trigger a new wave of political instability .
Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis suggested the spirit of the decision was erroneous since , as he told LNT television in an interview Wednesday , “ We will just go bankrupt if we observe all legal norms . ”
Still the prime minister said the government would honor the court ’s ruling , which stated that the reduction in pensions earlier this year – 10 percent for all pensioners , and 70 percent for employed pensioners – must be canceled by March 1 of next year .
In financial terms , this boils down to some 183 million lati ( €260 million ) that the government must cough up in next year ’s much maligned budget , though part of this ( 83 million lats ) can be disbursed later , according to reports .
Given the role international lenders are playing in Latvian fiscal policy , the court ’s decision also means that the government will first have to sit down with officials from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union and hope that the latter entities empathize with its predicament .
However , after the Constitutional Court also ruled that the government ’s agreement with international lenders was also unconstitutional in that it had n’t been approved by parliament — Latvia , after all , is a parliamentary democracy , some officials are calling for a review of the agreement .
Regional development minister Edgars Zalāns told the Delfi news portal the agreement with the IMF and other lenders can easily be amended given its shaky legal grounds , a position that flows from the People ’s Party ’s growing criticism of the government ’s fiscal policy and the increasing role lenders are playing in it .
Be that as it may , no one is doubting the court ’s ruling , and as of Tuesday nearly every minister and lawmakers was trying to figure out how to come up with the funds .
On the bright side , Dombrovskis said Wednesday that Latvia ’s slightly lower budget deficit — 7.5 percent of GDP instead of 8.5 percent — would give the government room to move .
Finance minister Einars Repše said any amendments to the budget would have to be made by March 1 , and that there would be no new taxes – only expenditure reductions .
One of the most interesting aspects about the discussion was whether to begin reimbursing pensions now or in a few years when Latvia ’s economy begins growing again .
Some politicians believe that it is imperative to begin paying back pensions – the 83 million lats ( €117 million ) – as soon as possible , otherwise electioneers will seize this issue and use it to win vote in next year ’s national elections .
“ If we did not settle this debt by the next elections , the votes would go to those who will promise to repay [ it ] before 2015 , ” said independent lawmaker Aigars Štokenbergs .
“ Then you ’ll have populists in the next Parliament that you ’ve never seen even in your dreams . ”
You might have seen pictures such as this , of a man wearing a hijab and dressed like a woman , do n’t let them fool you , they are not among the many who make Iran the second largest country of transsexuals ; rather , they are campaigning for the release of Majid Tavakoli .
Tavakoli was arrested on Students Day , Dec. 7 , after giving an impassioned speech during a protest at Tehran ’s Amir Kabir University .
After his arrest , according to Radio Free Europe ,
The semi-official Fars news agency posted pictures of Tavakoli dressed as a woman after he reportedly tried to escape by disguising himself .
Fars paired a picture of Tavakoli with one of Abol Hassan Bani Sadr , Iran ’s first president after the 1979 revolution , who reportedly escaped in 1981 disguised as a woman . *
The government has spread the picture of him dressed like a woman to shame him , but it backfired as he has become another accidental hero and rallying point for the protesters .
In a rapid response to his arrest , The Free Majid Tavakoli Facebook Page was created and notes his last Facebook updates ,
‘ Only two more days [ to Monday ’s demonstrations ] .
I have spent ten exhausting days on the road with more than 100 hours of driving and now I have to leave for Tehran .
… I welcome and accept all the dangers , standing next to my friends with whom I am honored and proud to be on 16 Azar shoulder to shoulder we will shout against tyranny .
For Freedom .’
In solidarity with Tavakoli , hundreds of men around the world and in Iran have donned the hijab for his release .
You can also see a video of them here .
Tavakoli is one of the hundreds of thousands who protested on Monday despite the risks , and he was one of the more than a hundred who were arrested that same day .
Despite the censorship , arrests , killings , and torture , the perseverance and continued ingenuity demonstrated by the Iranian protesters is undeniable and they proved once again , that this movement is a marathon , not a race .
* Update : A protester in Iran clarified that Tavakoli did not dress as a woman when he tried to escape , in fact the details of his attempted escape is not clear , rather , the government dressed him as a woman solely to shame him .

Twilight fans beware .
A viral marketing campaign designed to exploit your anticipation over the New Moon movie coming out tomorrow may look like normal free media you ’ve come to expect on the Internet .
A scareware purveyor has been spreading bad URLs , with the help of corrupted Google search results , Ã‚Â having to do with the movie and its stars , according to PC Tools .
Fans are being directed to chats and blogpostsÃ‚Â that read “ Watch New Moon Full Movie . ”
Concurrently , the bad guys use an automated scriptÃ‚Â to fill the posts and comments with related keywords to attract more search engines .
Fake ‘ streamviewer ’ akin to fake Flash player
Search results for the movie then link users to stolen images from the
movie itself , convincing the fan that the movie is only one click away .
But first the fan is required to download a free video player , called streamviewer .
But clicking on the download actually results in swift installation of a wormhole , called a Trojan downloader , on the fan ’s harddrive .
Thus the bad guys can now load any malicious program they so choose on the PC , says Michael Greene , security analyst at PC Tools .
Thus far , the bad guys have been installing a scareware program that launches a fake security scan and tries to get the user to spend $ 80 for a worthless cleanup and antivirus protection .
The last time an attack of this scale and sophistication swamped the Internet was during the run up to the last Harry Potter movie , says Greene .
While the bad guys appear to be after a quick buck selling worthless security , the wormhole they set in place , stays in place , giving them the ability to use the PC as part of a botnet to spread spam , steal data and hijack Web mail , social networking and online banking accounts , says Greene .
PC Tools has watched this particular downloader pull down scareware , a botnet management program , and downloaders that connect back to multiple sites for more information and downloads , he says .
Scareware recovery and protection
“ The payload is changing all the time , ” says Greene .
PC users , he says , should make sure they use an antivirus suite designed to repel this type of attack .
Naturally , he recommends Spyware Doctor with Antivirus and Threat Fire .
For anyone whose PC is already hopelessly infested with scareware and / or other infectious programs , Sunbelt Software ’s free deep scanning tool could be a godsend .
VIPRE PC Rescue can neutralize many of the nastiest scareware promos , rootkits and keyloggers lurking on your hard drive , and bogging down your machine ’s performance .
“ VIPRE PC Rescue makes it easy to wipe out infections on a nearly inoperable computer , often times enabling successful repair , as well as installation of necessary security applications to prevent these infections from happening in the future , ” says Eric Sites , Sunbelt CTO .
If your PC is locked up in a fake antivirus promo loop , using VIPRE PC Rescue in a safe mode boot up can at least give you back control of your machine , after which you can run other clean up tools .
If your machine is just getting slower and slower , VIPRE PC Rescue can usually improve performance noticeably .

The FBI ’s explosive , secret dossier on Michael Jackson was made public yesterday and includes sickening — and surprising — allegations involving the kiddie - molestation raps against the superstar .
The sensational files on the late King of Pop — started after LA cops asked the federal agency to become involved in their sex probe of Jacko — include creepy new details of his antics with kids , specifically from a Canadian couple ’s ride on the same train with him .
A Toronto woman told investigators probing allegations against Jackson in 1993 that she and her husband — both social workers in children ’s services — were aboard a train on March 7 , 1992 , during a visit to California and that the singer and his entourage had four compartments near them .
She said a 12 - or 13 - year - old boy — identified as Jacko’s “ cousin ” to anyone who asked — was with the singer at the time .
“ Jackson was very possessive of the boy at night , ” the woman told cops , adding that she and her hubby grew even more suspicious of the star ’s behavior when they “ heard questionable noises through wall , ” according to one FBI file .
“ She was concerned enough to notify the conductor of her suspicions , ” authorities wrote at the time .
FBI files from 1992 - 1993 ( PDF , 196 pages )
FBI files from Sept. 1993 to Aug. 1994 ( PDF , 56 pages )
FBI files from Sept. 1993 to Oct. 1993 ( PDF , 9 pages )
FBI files from Oct. 1995 to Jan. 1997 ( PDF , 8 pages )
FBI files from Jan. 2004 to April 2004 ( PDF , 41 pages )
FBI files from Sept. 2004 to Dec. 2004 ( PDF , 5 pages )
FBI files from March 2004 to June 2005 ( PDF , 18 pages )
The woman ’s comments were part of the probe into allegations that the singer had molested Jacko mini-me Jordie Chandler , a young hanger - on who had been traveling with the star .
FBI files also contained information about the 2005 molestation trial against Jackson , as well as an attempted extortion of the singer in 1992 .
The more - than - 300 pages of documents show :
* The FBI had been asked to analyze one of Jacko ’s VHS tapes — home - labeled “ Michael Jackson ’s Neverland Favorites an All Boy Anthology ” — seized amid a related child - porn probe .
The Sony tape was only described in the documents as a “ poor - quality , third - or fourth - generation recording ” that could be “ a copy of a copy of a copy . ”
There were no details of its contents .
* The LAPD appeared hot to nail Jackson on the federal Mann Act — involving “ transportation of a minor across state lines for immoral purposes ” — when it came to Chandler , and asked the FBI to consider the move .
But the agency balked at the idea .
* Investigators scribbled down notations about the case that included , “ Chimp .
Male chimp , ” apparently referring to Jacko ’s beloved primate sidekick , Bubbles .
* Jackson had once been accused of molesting two Mexican boys in the mid-1980s — but the case was supposedly covered up .
An unnamed source told the FBI that while researching a book he was writing about Jackson , he was informed the agency had investigated the charge in 1985 or 1986 .
But the case was n’t pursued because “ Jackson was to receive an honor at the White House from the president , ” the person said he was told .
He added that his source insisted to him , “ The investigation was covered up . ”
An FBI agent wrote that he turned up no such evidence of a probe .
The agency ’s records also show that authorities were willing to traipse the world to collect dirt on the singer .
Detectives went to Manila in the Philippines to interview two former Jackson ranch employees , Mariano Quindoy and his wife , Faye .
The probers also went to Canada to talk to the train - riding tourists .
Copies of newspaper clippings in one file allege that Mariano had seen the singer fondle young boys on two occasions .
Jackson ’s people called Mariano a failed extortionist .
In their pursuit of Jackson , detectives even had the US Embassy in London send them British reports of a case involving the singer and a teen there .
The FBI pored over the newspaper articles , which reported a relationship between Jackson and 13 - year - old British schoolboy Terry George in 1979 .
George , who as a kid had met Jackson , had surfaced amid the Chandler case , saying he remembered what could now be considered a disturbing phone call that the pair once had shared about masturbation .
Chandler ’s allegations were eventually settled with a reported $ 20 million payout .
But Jackson — who died of a prescription - pill overdose at his LA home on June 25 — was criminally tried in California in 2005 for allegedly touching a young cancer patient .
At the time of the singer ’s arraignment , cops in Santa Maria , Calif. , where the trial was being held , fretted that the media onslaught would make the venue a “ soft target ” for terrorists .
But the FBI said there was no evidence to suggest that .
Still , the agency noted that a known Black Panther member had been at Jackson ’s first court date .
A jury wound up acquitting the Gloved One .
Besides the molestation stigma , Jackson had other worries .
One involved an extortionist who targeted him — as well as infamous mob boss John Gotti — back in 1992 , according to copies of the man ’s threatening notes in one file .
“ I told you what will happen to John if he does n’t pay up .
Michael , I will personally attempt to kill if he does n’t pay me my money , ” reads one letter to a newspaper .
The deeply disturbed man , Frank Paul Jones , said he was willing to “ commit mass murder at a Michael Jackson concert if necessary in an attempt to murder Michael . ”
The writer was eventually charged with extortion and sentenced to prison time .
The FBI papers were released after requests by The Post and other media outlets .

WITHIN Europe , broadly , northerners and westerners are more likely to leave home when young than southerners and easterners .
It may be that university habits explain this , with Britons moving out to attend college at a relatively early age , for example .
Strongly religious and family - oriented societies seem to have a higher than average age for children leaving the parental nest .
And the housing market probably plays a role too : in countries , such as Germany , where a relatively large portion of the housing stock is rented , it may be easier for the young to find an affordable home away from their parents .

South Australian attorney general and professional bugbear , Michael Atkinson , has announced his intention to appeal the MA - 15 classification of Modern Warfare 2 for all the terrorist glorifying it does .
Aww .
No doubt he 'll also get on the large hadron collider people to see what they can do about altering the fabric of the space - time continuum , transmuting the content of the several million copies already sold .
Ha !
Too late .
We won this round .
Let it go , you stupid old cunt .
Anyway .
" You did n't try the online multiplayer portion of modern warfare 2 ?????
Seriously ?????
THAT'S LIKE TRYING ORANGE BOX AND SKIPPING OVER THE SILLY PORTAL GAME . "
- Matt , via email
Yes , I had a feeling I 'd be answering for this today .
Why did n't I give Modern Warfare 2's online multiplayer the time of day , despite it being one of the game 's big selling points and apparently bestowed upon this Earth by the divine hand of Siddhartha Buddha ?
I suppose if people are confused enough to use five question marks at a time then I 'd better explain why I usually feel that online multiplayer is n't my department .
1. Because I live in a faraway kingdom of fantasy .
Australia is a land of flowing alcohol and happy people , of Christmas on the beach ; where even the louts will have smiles on their faces as they kick your teeth in , but the one place you wo n't find us smiling is when we 're trying to game online .
Australia is very far away from other English - speaking nations , which is usually a bonus because it's a lot easier to get along with people when you can't understand a word they 're saying , but it does mean it 's hard to find decent servers .
So either you try to get by on a US server and put up with being issued some kind of strange delayed - reaction gun , or play on one of the few local Australian games you can find , which does n't offer a lot of choice .
And you can forget about playing the more obscure games online .
It took me something like fifty tries to join a Fat Princess server .
That 's a lot of wasted effort to finally figure out that a game is a pile of shit .
2. Because of time restrictions .
The thing about me is that I 'm a professional game critic , and that means I play a new game every week .
Sometimes I regret that .
Sometimes I 'd like more time to explore the nooks and crannies , just like I did your mum .
But this is the lifestyle I have chosen for myself and I can't really complain .
Anyway , the thing about the multiplayer portion is that it 's usually the bit that keeps the value for money going once the actual story , campaign -y , structured part has been exhausted .
And I 'm not usually around long enough to care .
Besides , especially in games like Modern Warfare 2 , you join your first game and are immediately flattened by fifty people who have been playing for way longer than you and know every level inside out .
It 's easy to be discouraged from playing any further .
People tell me " Ooh , you 'd have fun if you stuck with it " but I 've never accepted the " it gets better later " excuse .
I 've never been bumming around the house and thought to myself " Hm , I do n't really feel like playing a game now , but I might a few hours from now , so I 'd better start playing a game that gets better later . "
3 . Because there 's nothing more to see .
You see , there are various different kinds of gamer , defined by the reasons they play games .
Some do it to test their skills , some to find all the secrets , and some people like to see things brought to a conclusion .
I 'm probably one of the latter .
Allen Fawcett admits he and his wife are mildly addicted to keeping track of their babies ’ schedules .
The pair of economists have been recording every diaper , feeding and nap since they became parents .
With the help of the Trixie Tracker website , they know they ’ve changed exactly 7,367 diapers for their three - year - old son and 969 for their three - month - old daughter .
They also have a graph of precisely how many minutes each of their children slept on nearly every day since birth .
During their daughter ’s first month , the data shows she averaged 15 hours of sleep a day , which is two hours more than her brother at the same age and well above average for other Trixie Tracker babies .
“ People look at us and say , ‘ My goodness , how do you spend so much time on this ? ' ”
Fawcett said .
“ But each record takes just a few iPhone clicks , so it ’s really not as time - consuming as it looks . ”
The Fawcett family may take schedule tracking to the extreme , but they ’re certainly not the only parents who are measuring , recording and comparing minute details of their kids ’ lives .
Fifteen years ago , tracking your baby ’s development meant going to the pediatrician every few months and recording his growth on a simple height and weight chart .
Today , baby tracking is a booming business .
In addition to websites that let you track your infant ’s schedule , there are iPhone apps that translate and record your baby ’s cries , wearable devices that keep track of how much you talk to your child , and even electronic toys that record how your child plays with them , so you can compare his progress to developmental norms .
As a soon - to - be mom expecting my first child in less than a month , I sympathize with the desire to keep close tabs on a baby .
Almost the instant a second line appeared on my pregnancy pee stick , I found myself seized by a strong desire to make sure my baby was developing normally .
I managed to refrain from buying a home Doppler device to monitor my kid ’s heartbeat , and I skipped the special Kickbee belt that detects fetal kicks and tweets every time baby wiggles in the womb .
But once my first son makes his appearance , I know I ’ll be tempted to try some of the infant - tracking technology .
Who would n’t want more ways to record their child ’s health and well - being ?
According to pediatricians and child development experts , however , this new obsession with quantifying our kids has a potential downside , especially when parents cross the line from merely tracking an infant ’s schedule to obsessing over developmental milestones and worrying about how baby measures up to her peers .
“ As a pediatrician and researcher , I applaud anything that gets parents more interested in their child ’s development , ” said Dimitri Christakis of the University of Washington , who studies the impact of technology on early childhood .
“ But I would hate to find out that a parent is spending an hour a day entering data on their child ’s development , especially if that hour of data entry comes at the expense of spending an hour with your kid , or an hour somehow recharging your battery so you ’re better able to engage with them in the future . ”
Christakis recognizes that tracking certain aspects of infant development can be incredibly helpful .
For instance , parents who use Trixie Tracker say having all the data is a life - saver when you ’re trying to understand why your baby is awake all night for the fourth time in a row , or suddenly develops a rash after trying a new food .
Data - loving parents like Fawcett say tracking is also just plain fun :
For instance , in the time - lapse video below , you can see Fawcett ’s graph of his son ’s sleep patterns from age zero to one , where a blue bar means sleeping and yellow means awake .
He loves that the data “ neatly shows how we emerged from that tunnel of sleep deprivation , how the chaos of newborn sleep patterns blossomed into this nicely ordered set of days and nights . ”
But as we keep track of more and more statistics on our kids , and spend more time comparing our offspring ’s numbers to the national averages , some experts fear we ’re becoming a generation of neurotic parents , obsessed with making sure our children are at the top of the pack .
Preoccupied with percentages
DIY Autism Screening
Some baby - tracking products do more than track kids ’ schedules or how they play with toys :
One new device assesses language ability and calculates risk of autism and developmental delay .
The digital recorder was developed by the nonprofit LENA Foundation as an autism research tool .
Now , for about $ 200 , parents can buy their own LENA Language and Autism Screen .
After recording at least 12 hours of speech , parents mail the device and some questionnaires about their kid ’s behavior to LENA , and get a full report back of their child ’s language ability , including an autism risk score and a calculation of developmental age .
“ A lot of times parents may suspect something is wrong , ” said LENA spokeswoman Mia Moe .
“ But there are n’t a lot of great automatic screening tools that they have access to . ”
Parents can bring up concerns at their child ’s yearly checkup , Moe says , but 15 minutes with a pediatrician is often inadequate to diagnose a problem or get a referral to a specialist .
“ A lot of times they say , ‘ Let ’s just wait and see , ’ and then children end up getting these diagnoses at age 5 or even later , ” Moe said .
But early intervention programs can be very effective , so it makes sense for parents to want to detect problems early .
But not everyone thinks home screening is the answer .
Although devices like LENA can be very useful for research or professional assessment , marketing the tools to parents is n’t appropriate , says University of Rochester developmental psychologist Lucia French .
“ Certainly , keep an eye on your kid and make sure they ’re doing better in everything today than they were yesterday , ” French said .
“ But to do a formal screening and then worry that your child is n’t quite normal yet , that ’s going way too far for parents ’ knowledge level . ”
“ I ’ve seen this developing over the last decade or so , ” said developmental psychologist Lucia French , who studies language and cognitive development at the University of Rochester .
“ Parents have more information available , but they do n’t always know how to use that information . ”
For instance , French said , there ’s a huge amount of data on the internet about normal developmental milestones — when most kids start to crawl , say their first word , or learn the alphabet — but such information often lacks the disclaimer that 50 percent of children will fall either above or below the average range .
The same goes for products like LENA Home , a digital recording device that tracks how often parents talk to their children , and how often their kids talk back .
Parents get a graph of the number of “ conversational turns ” they have with their kids throughout the day , and they can compare their performance with that of other users across the country .
The concept behind the product is great , French says , because it encourages parents to talk more with their children , but she ’s concerned about the focus on percentiles .
“ Not everybody can be average , ” French said .
“ If you have everyone average or above average , who ’s going to be in the below average range ?
Mathematically , it does n’t work .
And there ’s no point either , because everyone gets to walk and everyone learns to talk , so if they do it one or two months earlier or later , it really does n’t matter . ”
That ’s not the message most parents get from the media or marketplace , however .
In the past decade , there has been an explosion of digital toys , movies and computer programs marketed for the two - and - under crowd , and many of these new products claim to enhance your baby ’s development or help teach critical skills .
Christakis calls the new industry the “ build - a - brainier - baby enterprise , ” and he says it has resulted in a national neurosis around how to make sure your child is as smart as he or she can possibly be .
“ The truth is that those of us who are interested in early childhood are somewhat to blame for this , ” Christakis said .
“ We ’ve succeeded over the last 10 to 15 years in convincing people that the early years are critical to long - term brain development .
Unfortunately , unbeknownst to us , what that ’s done is created a marketing juggernaut preying on parent ’s vulnerabilities and concerns . ”
Toys that teach — and track
In addition to targeting specific skills , the latest electronic toys also record how children are playing with them , so that mom and dad can hook the toys up to the computer using a USB connection and see what Junior has been doing all day .
Last month , I visited the Emeryville , California , headquarters of LeapFrog Enterprises , one of the most popular brands of kid-friendly technology and the leading manufacturer of the new kid- tracking toys .
Although most of LeapFrog ’s USB - connected products are designed for children three and older , their free program for tracking child development , called the Learning Path , begins at birth .
Parents who sign up for the Learning Path receive regular e-mails about their child ’s developmental milestones , along with tips and activities to help enhance learning at each stage .
Of course , the program also suggests LeapFrog products that parents can buy to help their babies master new skills .
A talking stuffed dog named Scout or Violet ( pictured at the top of the page ) is supposed to teach first words and early number sense , while a set of electronic maracas are designed to help babies explore colors , music and even Spanish vocabulary .
For kids two and older , LeapFrog offers a digital book reader called Tag Junior , which reads aloud or asks questions when a child points the device at text and pictures in a book .
The system also tracks how long a child spends on each page , so parents know what skills or activities their toddler is focusing on .
“ If you have Tag Junior , we can tell you that this is the page that your child enjoyed the most , ” said Jeff Grant , vice president of web products at LeapFrog .
“ When you get into the older products like Leapster and Tag , which both start at age four , that ’s when we ’ll start telling you which questions they ’re getting right or wrong . ”
The products are designed to encourage specific skills and track a child ’s progress , but the Learning Path team actually cautions that focusing too much on a kid ’s performance is n’t a good idea .
“ Even though we ’ll tell you the correct answer percentage , we have some information there that says there are lots of reasons why kids will get the wrong answer , ” said Tina O’Shea , senior producer on the Learning Path team .
“ It can be because they think it ’s hilarious , or because they ’ve reached the top level of the game and now they just want to get everything wrong to see what happens . ”
But despite the disclaimer , some over - eager parents are bound to obsess about how well their child is doing compared to other kids or their grade level , and that ’s one of the reasons many experts are hesitant about kid-tracking toys .
“ Anything that gives you a number , you need to realize it ’s about what the number represents , ” said pediatrician Gwenn O’Keeffe , a member of the Council on Communications and Media at the American Association of Pediatrics .
She says focusing too much on a specific number — whether it ’s how many hours a baby sleeps through the night , or the percentage that a toddler scores on a computer game — can make parents forget that the real focus should be on their child .
“ It ’s like when a child has a fever , ” O’Keeffe said .
“ I really do n’t care how high the fever is .
What I care about is how does your child look ?
Are they zipping around the house with a 104 - degree fever , or are they lying limp on the couch ? ”
Similarly , to assess a child ’s development , O’Keeffe says parents do n’t need to rely on digital toys or tracking programs .
They just need to look at their kid , trust their instincts and consult an expert if they ’re concerned .
In praise of blocks and crayons
In addition to encouraging parents to obsess over numbers and percentiles , it turns out that not all of the so - called “ educational ” products actually enhance cognitive development .
For example , although “ Baby Einstein ” clearly sounds like a product that will make your child smarter , there ’s no data to suggest that babies learn anything from watching Baby Einstein videos .
Even worse , recent research has shown that infant television programs may actually stunt language acquisition rather than support it .
“ What ’s fundamentally lacking here , quite honestly , are standards and enforcement about what constitutes educational toys , ” Christakis said .
Companies can label their products ‘ educational ’ without doing any research on the toys ’ effectiveness , he said , as long as they do n’t explicitly state that the toys have been proven to teach a particular skill .
Parents often miss this subtle nuance , however , and some are quite angry about the false advertising .
In fact , to avoid a class action lawsuit claiming “ unfair and deceptive marketing practices , ” Disney now offers a full refund on any of their Baby Einstein DVDs purchased between June 5 , 2004 and September 4 , 2009 .
“ The names and the marketing have successfully convinced parents that this is actually really good for their children , ” Christakis said .
“ Parents often ask me , ‘ Well if my child does n’t watch Baby Einstein , are they somehow losing out ?
Are other children at a competitive advantage because they ’re getting this high - tech intellectual stimulation ? ' ”
According to Christakis , the opposite is actually true .
“ You ’re giving your child a leg up if you spend more time with them , read to them more , sing to them more , play with them more , ” he said , “ not if you park them in front of a DVD or an iPhone app . ”
Even the folks at LeapFrog caution that electronic toys should n’t replace the tried - and - true childhood staples of previous generations .
Plain old wooden blocks can be an incredibly valuable learning tool , says Jim Gray , a former child development researcher who now heads the learning team at LeapFrog .
“ I would recommend that parents have a healthy toybox , ” Gray said , “ with a variety of types of toys .
Electronic toys are one type , wooden blocks are one type , rubber balls are another type .
Dress - up toys , even a piece of paper and crayons are wonderful as a learning environment . ”
Perhaps parents would do well applying this idea of a healthy toybox across all of the baby tracking technologies .
In the end , most of the experts I talked with concluded that it ’s all about balance .
While there ’s nothing wrong with data - loving parents tracking their baby ’s schedule for the fun of it , at the end of the day there ’s no reason to obsess about the numbers .
“ Kids have been raised by parents without tools like this for generations , ” O’Keeffe said .
“ What parents need is a good inoculation of common sense and some self - esteem , to realize that they can do this without a tool .
Just because we have computers and hand - held devices , does n’t mean we need a tracking device .
What we need to do is look at our kids and realize they ’re developing just fine . ”

Metallzäune , Panzerfahrzeuge , Hunderte Polizisten , bis an die Zähne
bewaffnet­ - wer in der letzten Septemberwoche des Jahres 2009 zum
Oktoberfest aufbricht , kommt leicht auf die Idee , sich im Datum geirrt zu
haben .
Einen vergleichbaren Großeinsatz erlebt München sonst nur zur
alljährlichen Sicherheitskonferenz im Februar .
Aber eine Bannmeile um die
Bierzelte , das gab es bisher nie .
Die Wiesn 2009 , ein Fest hinter Gittern :
drinnen ein Prosit der Gemütlichkeit , draußen Alarmstufe Rot. Und Tariq
Samir* ist draußen .
Der Informatikstudent sitzt am Morgen des 26 .
September zehn Kilometer
entfernt im Münchner Norden am Schreibtisch und lernt für seine
Diplomprüfung .
Sein Blick schweift aus dem Fenster , zum Firmenparkplatz
gegenüber seiner Wohnung .
An Wochenenden ist der sonst wie leer
gefegt , jetzt steht dort ein silbergrauer BMW .
Eigentlich würde sich Samir nichts dabei denken .
Aber da war dieser Mann vor drei Monaten in der Uni-Bibliothek , der ihn mit einer Handy - Kamera filmte .
Als Samir ihn aufforderte , die Aufnahmen zu löschen , hat er sich umgedreht und ist auf die Straße gerannt , in ein Auto gesprungen und losgefahren , bei Rot über die Ampel .
Wie im Film .
Samir notierte sich das Kennzeichen und erstattete Anzeige bei der Polizei .
Der Beamte sagte , das Kennzeichen sei im Computer gesperrt , und wunderte sich .
Samir liest regelmäßig Zeitung und kennt auch den Fall von Murat Kurnaz , der mit Wissen deutscher Behörden nach Guantanamo deportiert wurde .
Irgendwie ahnt Samir , dass auch er selbst ­ Muslim , Mann , 26 Jahre alt , geboren in Marokko , regelmäßiger Moscheebesucher­ im Krieg gegen den Terror verdächtig sein könnte .
Natürlich würde kein Vertreter des deutschen Staates auch nur andeuten , dass er einen Mann wie Samir nach Haut - und Haarfarbe oder gar nach seiner Religion beurteilt .
Auch Wolf - Dieter Remmele nicht , Chef des
Verfassungsschutzes im bayerischen Innenministerium .
Er beteuert , dass es den Nachrichtendiensten » nicht um den Islam als Religion , sondern um den Islamismus als politische Bestrebung gegen unsere Verfassung « gehe .
In Deutschland gebe es aber eine gewisse Zahl von Muslimen , die » unserer westlichen Ordnung und den im Grundgesetz vertretenen Werten ablehnend gegenüberstehen« .
Es sei daher geboten , » diese Werte zu verteidigen « .
Am Morgen des 26 .
September zeigt sich , dass diese Werte nicht mehr viel gelten , sobald die Sicherheitsbehörden einen potenziellen Feind ausgemacht haben .
Und dass sich , wenn die allgemeine Stimmung nur genügend aufgeheizt ist , dieser Feind auch sehr schnell findet .
Als der BMW gegen zwölf
Uhr immer noch nicht verschwunden ist , läuft Samir die Treppe hinunter , um sich den Wagen genauer anzuschauen .
Zwei Männer sitzen darin , einer starrt ihn an , der andere wendet den Blick ab .
Samir notiert das Kennzeichen und ruft mit dem Handy die Polizei an .
Er hat das Telefonat kaum beendet , als der Beifahrer aus dem BMW steigt und zu Samirs Wohnblock läuft .
Dann heult der Motor auf , und der BMW entschwindet Richtung Hauptstraße .
Samir ruft noch mal bei der Polizei an .
Der BMW gehöre zur Polizei , beruhigt ihn der Beamte , aber » die sind nicht wegen Ihnen da« .
Der Informatikstudent verständigt eine Anwältin , die er schon länger kennt .
Gegen 16
Uhr erhält er eine SMS von ihr : » Sind die immer noch da ? « Wieder verlässt Samir die Wohnung , um nach den Beobachtern zu schauen .
Nun geht alles sehr schnell : Zwei VW - Busse bremsen neben ihm , Männer springen heraus .
Samir sieht eine Nachbarin und schreit , sie solle die Polizei anrufen .
Einer der Männer , er trägt eine Sonnenbrille , lacht nur : » Wir sind doch von der Polizei . « Samir wird in einen VW - Bus gedrängt und davongefahren .
In einer Einzelzelle auf dem Polizeipräsidium verbringt Samir , wie er später sagt , » die schlimmste Nacht meines Lebens « .
Er versteht nicht , warum er hier ist .
In den Nachbarzellen schreien die Betrunkenen ; es ist Oktoberfest .
Samir hat Angst .
Angst hat ihn hierher gebracht .
Nicht seine eigene , sondern die Angst eines ganzen Landes :
Am nächsten Morgen erklärt ihm die Richterin , er werde verdächtigt , ein Attentat auf das Oktoberfest zu planen .
( Lesen Sie auf der nächsten Seite : Die Sicherheitsbehörden treibt die Angst um , nicht alles getan zu haben , um einen Anschlag zu verhindern . )
Die meisten Menschen wissen , dass sie sich , statistisch betrachtet , der
größten Gefahr aussetzen , wenn sie ins Auto oder in die Badewanne steigen oder sich mit Grippe infizieren .
Trotzdem geben 76 Prozent der Deutschen an , dass sie vor allem Angst haben , Opfer eines Terroranschlags zu werden .
Die Anschläge von New York , London und
Madrid haben sich tief ins kollektive Bewusstsein eingegraben ; islamistischer Terror ist seit Jahren ein medialer und politischer Dauerbrenner .
Die meisten Deutschen würden wohl den Satz unterschreiben , dass gegen den Terrorismus » irgendetwas « getan werden muss .
Deshalb arbeiten Polizei und Verfassungsschutz schon Wochen vor dem festlichen Anstich an der Sicherung des Oktoberfestes .
Mehrere Drohvideos im Internet haben die Behörden alarmiert .
Der deutsche Islamist Bekkay Harrach
warnt vor einem Attentat innerhalb von zwei Wochen nach der Bundestagswahl , sollte auch die neue Regierung am Bundeswehr - Einsatz in Afghanistan festhalten .
Außerdem erzählt Harrach von einem jungen Muslim , der ein
Selbstmordattentat mit einer Autobombe begeht , um sich auf diese Weise von seinen Sünden zu befreien .
Auf einem anderen Video von einem
Islamistenm namens Ayyub ist im Hintergrund das Oktoberfest zu sehen .
Ermittler haben die Videos als authentisch bewertet .
Immerhin wurde Harrach von Aiman Al - Zawahiri , der Nummer zwei des Terrornetzwerkes Al - Qaida , als Sprecher der Organisation in Deutschland autorisiert .
Deshalb bereiten sich die Sicherheitskräfte auf das Albtraumszenario vor , dass ein mit Sprengstoff beladener Lkw in das Oktoberfest rast .
Das Festgelände wird großräumig abgesperrt .
Dabei bleiben viele Fragen offen : Warum sollten Terroristen , die einen
Anschlag planen , davor warnen ?
Weder die Attentäter des 11 .
September 2001 noch die sogenannte Sauerland - Gruppe stellten Botschaften ins Netz .
Junge Muslime , mutmaßen die Behörden , könnten sich doch von den aktuellen Drohvideos zu einer spontanen Aktion ermuntert fühlen .
Aber wie spontan lässt sich ein mit Sprengstoff beladener Lkw ins Oktoberfest steuern ?
Wie muss man sich die » jungen Muslime « überhaupt vorstellen , die sich durch das Betrachten eines Videos in Massenmörder verwandeln ?
Und warum spricht ein Islamist , der zum Anschlag anstacheln will , seine Brüder nicht auf Arabisch an , sondern auf Deutsch -­ wo doch so viele Muslime diese Sprache nicht beherrschen , wie hiesige Politiker immer beklagen ?
Doch Angst fragt nicht .
Anders als Liebe macht Angst tatsächlich blind .
Und die Sicherheitsbehörden treibt nicht nur die Angst vor einem Anschlag .
Sie treibt auch die Angst , nicht alles unternommen zu haben , um ihn zu verhindern .
Wer wollte das verantworten ?
Vor diesem Dilemma steht auch die Ermittlungsrichterin , die am Wochenende von Samirs Verhaftung Bereitschaftsdienst hat .
Sie ist Jugendstrafrichterin am Amtsgericht , in Sachen Terror hat sie keine Erfahrung .
Stundenlang wird um den Beschluss gerungen , auf dessen Grundlage Samir bis zum Ende des Oktoberfests ins Gefängnis soll .
Die Polizei begründet Samirs Festnahme mit einem 13 Seiten starken Dossier .
Unter dem Punkt » staatsschutzmäßige Erkenntnisse « heißt es , zwei enge Bekannte von Samir hätten sich mit Bekkay Harrach getroffen ­ im Jahr 2003 .
Daher sei es wahrscheinlich , dass auch Samir den Islamisten Harrach kennt .
Außerdem habe Samir zwischen Mai und Juli 2007 mit einem Mann verkehrt , der mit dem Anführer der Sauerland - Gruppe in Kontakt gewesen sei .
Die Richterin fragt die Polizei nach weiteren Belegen .
Sie deutet an , dass
sie die Beweislage für dünn halte -­ so schildert jedenfalls Samirs Anwältin
später die Vorgänge im Richterzimmer .
Die Polizei bleibt stur , obwohl auch
eine Durchsuchung von Samirs Wohnung nichts Verdächtiges liefert .
Gegen 23
Uhr gibt die Richterin dem Drängen der Staatsschützer nach : Samir wird acht Tage eingesperrt , um » einen möglichen Anschlag sicher zu verhindern « .
( Lesen Sie auf der nächsten Seite : Im " Krieg gegen den Terror " ist der Ausnahmezustand die Regel : Es könnte immer irgendetwas passieren )
Die Entscheidung stützt sich auf Artikel 17 des Polizeiaufgabengesetzes :
» Die Polizei kann eine Person in Gewahrsam nehmen , wenn das unerlässlich ist , um die unmittelbar bevorstehende Begehung einer Straftat von erheblicher Bedeutung für die Allgemeinheit zu verhindern . «
Dieser Passus ist vor allem für Demonstranten oder Fußballfans gedacht , die ihre Gewaltbereitschaft offen zur Schau tragen ; zur Terrorbekämpfung wurde er bisher nie angewendet .
Der Münchner Polizeipräsident Wilhelm Schmidbauer räumt ein , dass er und seine Mitarbeiter vor einer schwierigen Aufgabe stehen : Man habe es nicht mit einem
Täter zu tun , der ein Verbrechen begangen hat .
Auch nicht mit einem , der ein Verbrechen ankündigt .
Es gehe darum nachzuweisen , ob es genügend Indizien gibt , dass er ein Verbrechen plant .
» Wir müssen also eine Prognose stellen « , sagt Schmidbauer und verhehlt dabei nicht , » dass Prognosen auch falsch sein können , keiner von uns ist ein Prophet , das sieht man ja fast jeden Tag am Wetterbericht .
Aber wir haben unser Bestes getan . «
Seit dem 11 .
September 2001 liegt der Schwerpunkt polizeilicher Arbeit im
Bereich Terrorismus nicht mehr auf der Aufklärung begangener Delikte ,
sondern auf deren Verhinderung .
Angesichts der Attentate von New York ,
London und Madrid erscheint dieses Vorgehen logisch .
Aber nur auf den ersten Blick : Denn wer künftige Verbrechen verhüten will , ohne mit hellseherischen Fähigkeiten ausgestattet zu sein , muss auch Menschen observieren , denen keinerlei Fehlverhalten vorzuwerfen ist .
Weil theoretisch jeder Mensch ein Attentat planen könnte , aber nicht jeder beschattet werden kann , muss der Kreis der Zielpersonen irgendwie eingegrenzt werden .
Dabei richten sich die Ermittler nach Kriterien , die nach dem Gleichheitsprinzip gerade nicht zur Beurteilung von Menschen herangezogen werden sollen : Alter , Geschlecht , Religion , soziale Netzwerke .
Der Präventionsstaat kollidiert also zwangsläufig mit dem Rechtsstaat , der verteidigt werden sollte .
Um ihren massiven Eingriff zu rechtfertigen , gibt sich die Polizei alle
Mühe , Samir als höchst gefährlich erscheinen zu lassen .
Seine Freunde heißen in dem Observationsbericht » Kontakt - und Vertrauenspersonen « ; sein Bekanntenkreis ist ein » Geflecht « .
Dass er sich in der Moschee mehrmals mit einem Bekannten unterhielt und beide das Gebäude » jeweils getrennt voneinander « verließen , wird als verdächtig eingestuft ; ebenso wie der Umstand , dass Samir sich von der Beobachtung durch die Sicherheitsbehörden belästigt fühlte .
» Der Betroffene zeigte sich äußerst misstrauisch « und » versuchte , seine Verfolger abzuschütteln « .
Weil Samir sich nicht in aller Ruhe von Unbekannten fotografieren und verfolgen ließ , schließen die Ermittler daraus , dass er » Freiraum für Aktivitäten gewinnen « wollte .
Die Tatsache , dass Samir vor seiner Festnahme zweimal bei der Polizei
anrief , um Hilfe gegen seine Verfolger zu erbitten , fehlt in dem Bericht .
Aus gutem Grund : Der besagte Artikel 17 greift nur , wenn die Behörden
nachweisen , dass die Zielperson eine schwere Straftat begehen wird und nur durch Inhaftierung davon abzuhalten ist .
Aber ruft ein Attentäter allen
Ernstes kurz vor dem Anschlag zweimal bei der Polizei an ?
Das muss selbst eine in Terrorangelegenheiten unerfahrene Ermittlungsrichterin misstrauisch machen .
Doch auch die Richterin hat sich das präventive Prognose - Denken zu eigen gemacht :
In ihrem Beschluss wiederholt sie , was die Polizei zu Samirs angeblichen Kontakten zur Islamisten - Szene vorgebracht hat .
Und schreibt : » Weitere Kontakte können nicht belegt , aber auch nicht widerlegt werden . «
Mit diesem Argument könnte man gleich alle achtzig Millionen Bundesbürger wegsperren .
Schließlich ist es immer möglich , dass irgendjemand ein Attentat plant .
Jedenfalls kann es nicht belegt , aber auch nicht widerlegt werden .
Nach acht Tagen in der Justizvollzugsanstalt Stadelheim wird Samir in der Nacht zum Montag , 5 . Oktober , auf freien Fuß gesetzt .
Er hat acht Kilo abgenommen und trägt seinen Gürtel um zwei Löcher enger .
Als er um halb drei
Uhr früh seine Wohnung aufschließt , sieht er sich einem Schlachtfeld gegenüber : Überall liegt Papier verstreut , darunter auch seine Zeugnisse .
Der Mülleimer wurde auf dem Boden ausgeleert , die Ermittler haben ganze Arbeit geleistet .
Samir findet keinen Schlaf und beginnt , die Wohnung aufzuräumen .
Was er nicht beseitigen kann , ist das ungute Gefühl , dass die Polizei vielleicht ein paar Abhörwanzen hinterlassen hat .
Polizeipräsident Schmidbauer und Verfassungsschützer Remmele verbuchen den Einsatz rückblickend als Erfolg -­ das Oktoberfest sei ja ohne Zwischenfälle verlaufen .
Trotzdem verkündet der bayerische Innenminister Joachim Herrmann am Tag nach dem Oktoberfest , dass die Alarmstufe Rot keineswegs beendet ist : Al - Qaida habe sich mit der Ankündigung , in den zwei Wochen nach der Bundestagswahl zuzuschlagen , selbst in Zugzwang gesetzt .
Als auch die Zweiwochenfrist verstreicht , werden in den Zeitungen Sicherheitskreise mit der Aussage zitiert , die Gefahrenlage bestehe unvermindert fort .
Worauf sich die Prognose stützt - ­ die Öffentlichkeit wird es nie erfahren .
Denn jenseits der nebulösen Einschätzungen von » Terrorexperten « und anderen Fachleuten verweigern die Sicherheitskräfte jegliche Erklärung ­ angeblich aus Geheimschutz - oder polizeitaktischen Gründen .
Die Bevölkerung reagiert mit einer gewissen Abstumpfung : Irgendetwas werde an all den Prognosen schon dran sein .
Solange es nur eine Minderheit betrifft , in diesem Fall die Muslime , bleibt der allgemeine Aufschrei jedenfalls aus .
Darf sich die schweigende Mehrheit wirklich so sicher fühlen ?
Besonders stutzig am Fall Samir macht die Begründung der Richterin , warum sie den Informatikstudenten für so gefährlich hält : Aufgrund der Islamistenvideos im Internet sei von einer » aktuell gesteigerten Gefährdungslage « auszugehen .
» Das Ausmaß eines terroristischen Anschlags hätte erhebliche Auswirkungen für die Allgemeinheit . «
Schließlich heißt es in dem Beschluss : » An die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines Schadenseintritts sind umso geringere Anforderungen zu stellen , je größer und folgenschwerer der möglicherweise eintretende Schaden ist . «
Auf den Präventivstaat angewendet bedeutet dieser Grundsatz der Verhältnismäßigkeit : Ist das Szenario für einen Anschlag nur verheerend genug , haben die Sicherheitsbehörden weitgehend freie Hand .
Wie wahrscheinlich das Szenario ist - unwichtig .
Es reicht , dass es möglich
erscheint .
Und möglich erscheint vieles nach dem 11 .
September .
Das heißt aber auch : Niemand , egal wie gesetzestreu er sich verhält , ­ kann mehr sicher sein , nicht doch in die Mühlen des Sicherheitsapparats zu geraten .
Nach seiner Freilassung hat Samir wieder begonnen , für sein Diplom zu lernen .
Eine Prüfung muss er im Frühjahr nachholen ­ sie fand genau in der Woche statt , als er in Haft saß .
Das wäre zu verkraften .
Dass ihn weiter Polizeibeamte verfolgen , auch damit kann er leben .
Nicht jedoch mit dem Terrorverdacht , der auf ihm lastet : Zwar läuft das Beschwerdeverfahren gegen seine Inhaftierung .
Aber selbst wenn das Landgericht zu seinen Gunsten entscheiden sollte , wird ihm das nicht viel nützen , ahnt Samir .
Sein richtiger Name kursiert im Internet .
Nach dem Studium wollte er ursprünglich in Deutschland arbeiten .
Doch welche Firma will einen Bewerber , den eine einfache Google - Suche als » terrorverdächtig « ausweist ?
Selbst unter seinen Bekannten » fragt doch jeder , warum die gerade gegen mich ermittelt haben .
Viele sagen : Die Polizei ermittelt doch nicht einfach so , das wird schon seinen Grund gehabt haben . «
Seine Existenz ist hier zerstört , vermutlich wird er nach Marokko zurückgehen .
» Dann haben die Behörden ihr Ziel erreicht « , lautet sein bitteres Fazit .
Aber wiegt die Sicherheit von Tausenden nicht schwerer als das Schicksal
eines Einzelnen ?
Fordert nicht jeder Krieg seine Kollateralschäden ?
Auch
diese Überlegung führt in die Irre.
Frühere Kriege waren zeitlich begrenzt ,
im sogenannten Krieg gegen den Terror ist der Ausnahmezustand die Regel : Es könnte immer irgendetwas passieren .
Ein paar Internet - Videos haben gereicht , dass unsere Gesellschaft aus dem Ruder lief .
Wer garantiert , dass sich das nicht wiederholt , auf dem Weihnachtsmarkt , im Fußballstadion , beim Karneval ?
Benjamin Franklin , einer der Gründer der USA , mahnte schon vor mehr als 200 Jahren : » Wer die grundlegenden Freiheiten aufgibt , um vorübergehend etwas mehr Sicherheit zu erkaufen , hat weder Freiheit noch Sicherheit verdient . «
Auch kein Prosit der Gemütlichkeit , würde er heute wohl ergänzen .

Juli Zeh und Rainer Stadler beschäftigt seit Jahren die Frage , wie weit der Staat die Grundrechte seiner Bürger einschränken darf .

APC Magazine details how Optus , an Australian mobile phone operator , has for months been deliberately blocking access to Android paid apps
The article speculates , reading between the lines of the opaque comments offered by both Optus and Google , that the carrier is " demanding a cut of the sales revenue from Android apps if it is to remove its restriction on accessing them . "
Potentially , the solar cell could bring the cost of solar power down to around $ 3 a watt , after installation costs and other expenses are factored in , over the life of the panel .
The new cost information comes from Boeing , whose Spectrolab unit supplies searchlights and solar simulators , and the Department of Energy , which sponsored the project .
Current silicon solar cells provide electricity at about $ 8 a watt , before government rebates .
The goal is to bring it to $ 1 a watt without rebates or incentives .
The cell achieves 40.7 percent efficiency .
The Department of Energy has been sponsoring research to find ways to get solar cells past the so - called 40 percent barrier .
Earlier this year , researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories reported that cells made of a new type of semiconductor , zinc - manganese - tellurium , combined with a few atoms of oxygen , could convert around 45 percent of sunlight into electricity .
That technology , also partly sponsored by the Department of Energy , has been licensed to RoseStreet Labs in Arizona .
It remains to be seen whether this material can be made into solar cells economically .
Sharp Solar , one of the biggest solar companies in the industry , showed a solar cell offering 36 percent efficiency earlier this year .
The Sharp cell includes a concentrator - - a thin lens that focuses sunlight on the cell -- but is not made of silicon .
It instead is made out of III - V compounds , molecules made from elements in the III and V columns of the periodic table of elements .
( The metallic element gallium - - used in semiconductors and optoelectronic devices -- is from this neighborhood . )
Currently , the best commercial silicon solar cells can , and physics dictates that maximum efficiency for these cells will come at around 26 percent .
Boeing got around that barrier by integrating two technologies .
One , the solar cell , contains a layer of concentrators .
From a practical point of view , using a concentrator is like adding extra surface area to the cell .
The solar cell also contains more than one material .
Silicon cells interact with only a limited part of the light spectrum .
Additional layers of gallium arsenide or other materials can convert light in other portions of the spectrum into electricity .
Making so - called multi-junction solar cells is more expensive than making single - junction silicon cells .
Still , many companies believe the higher manufacturing expense can be offset by cost savings from the cells ' greater electrical output .
Boeing , however , did not state what materials it used in its cell .
Aikens pointed a gun at him and the cabbie ducked behind a car , Vanore said , adding that Allen then fired , striking the driver in the left shoulder .
The driver was taken to Jefferson , where he was listed in stable condition .
" From my perspective that would ideally be an " in or out " referendum .
But what David Cameron could also do is set out clearly which powers he wants to return to Westminster and hold a referendum on that .
If the British public supported that he could take that as a negotiating position to the EU . "
HP is responding to claims that the facial - tracking technology used by its Webcams is somehow racist .
A YouTube video uploaded earlier this month showed a Webcam , identified as being an HP model , failing to follow a face when the person on - screen was black .
When a white woman stepped in front of the same camera , the facial - tracking system appeared to begin working properly .
" I think my blackness is interfering with the computer 's ability to follow me , " the man in the video said .
" I 'm going on record and I 'm saying it : Hewlett - Packard computers are racist . "
HP acknowledged the problem in a blog posted to its TheNextBench.com site on Sunday .
Tony Welch , the lead social media strategist for HP's Personal Systems Group , said the company is currently investigating the issue to figure out what 's going on .
" The technology we use is built on standard algorithms that measure the difference in intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose , " Welch explains .
" We believe that the camera might have difficulty ' seeing ' contrast in conditions where there is insufficient foreground lighting . "
Welch suggested users visit HP 's Webcam optimization center while the company seeks a full solution .
Those Photoshop - happy guys from Microsoft , meanwhile , must be breathing a sigh of relief .

Hump Day Q&A : Tashia McIntosh Makes Me Question Myself
0 SHARES Share
According to model / actress Tashia McIntosh ’s MySpace page , she is one of the most photographed swimsuit models .
According to me , my high school guidance counselor sucked for never mentioning that “ Professional Swimsuit Photo Counter ” was a real job .
Seriously , Mrs. King how did you leave that out during all of those one - on - one sessions filled with the “ stick to writing , there ’s a bright future in journalism ” speeches ?
Sorry , I got a little carried away .
You did n’t come here to watch me ask myself questions , you ’re here for the conversation I had with this 24 year - old model from Los Angeles who has appeared in ads for Affliction ’s Sinful line and had what she describes as a “ small , small tiny role ” in “ Entourage . ”
If you want to see Tashia in various small , small tiny bikinis be sure to scroll down beyond the words .
— –
In regards to you being one of the most photographed swimsuit models , do the photos where you ’re not wearing the top of the swimsuit count ?
We ’re not complaining at all about the topless shots , just trying to get a better understanding of how these stats work .
Um , yes it counts and I ’m not topless it ’s just an illusion .
As a girl who grew up going to church twice a week , did you ever think you ’d end up modeling for a clothing line called Sinful ?
No , I never thought I would ever model period .
I was always into acting but just fell into modeling .
Just because you ’re working for Sinful , does n’t mean you actually are sinful , right ?
I think everyone has a “ sinful ” side .
You were in an episode of “ Entourage . ”
I ’m not going to ask if Jeremy Piven hit on you .
Instead , I will ask you how long it took for him to hit on you ?
It was a lot of fun and Jeremy was actually really sweet .
I ’m sure he was .
Besides Jeremy Piven , who ’s the most famous guy to hit on you ?
Well that ’s not something I need to talk about , but I did meet Leonardo DiCaprio , my favorite actor , and I was speechless .
Other than that I ’m not really the “ star struck ” type .
What ’s the biggest mistake guys make when they approach you ?
Come to close into my face or are too touchy feely .
Before picking you up for a first date , a guy should make sure he does what ?
Takes a shower .
I like clean guys .
What ’s been the highlight of your first 10 years in modeling ?
Living my dreams to the fullest and being able to support myself while doing it .
It ’s a tough business and not a steady paycheck .
I have met so many wonderful people and have seen places that I probably would n’t have had the chance to if it were n’t for my job .
What ’s next for you ?
I am just working really hard .
I really want to get into Sports Illustrated and , of course , Victoria ’s Secret .
I also want to start getting into acting more .

MANILA ( Reuters ) - Suspected Muslim rebels punched a hole on the wall of a provincial jail on a remote southern island in the Philippines and freed 31 prisoners before dawn on Sunday , security officials said .
They killed one jail guard and wounded another during a 10 - minute raid at the main prison on southern Basilan island , Superintendent Abubakar Tulawie , provincial police chief , told reporters .
“ We got two of them .
Their bodies were abandoned just outside the jail ’s perimeter , ” Tulawie said , adding the raiders rescued two Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) leaders detained there for their role in the beheading of soldiers on Basilan in 2007 .
“ These two rebel leaders are high - risk prisoners .
We have organized a team together with the military units on the island to pursue them .
We ’ve started an internal inquiry to determine responsibility for the lax security in the jail . ”
The MILF , which is seeking broad autonomy in southern Mindano island , is in peace talks with the government .
Another Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf , once linked to al Qaeda , is also fighting in the south , but it was not clear if any of their jailed members escaped .
Tulawie said the raiders used sledge hammers to make an opening on the prison ’s 18 - foot high rear perimeter wall and used bolt cutters to destroy the padlock of a jail cell where the two rebel commanders were held before shooting their way out .
Only four of 16 guards were on duty at that time .
The two rebel leaders who escaped were on trial for the murder of 14 soldiers in al - Barka town in July 2007 .
Twenty - nine other prisoners got out .
The one - hectare facility has 65 inmates .
Police authorities said it was the second mass jailbreak on the island after 53 inmates escaped during a riot in 2004 .
Jailbreaks are common in the Philippines , where many of the more than 1,000 penitentiaries across the archipelago are overcrowded and guards are underpaid .
Mike Nelson ,
the former host of cult - hit cable - TV show " Mystery Science Theater 3000 , " has admirably added to his resume with
RiffTrax
: downloadable commentary tracks for blockbusters and B - movie obscurities that can be synced with your DVDs .
He and fellow Riffsters Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett also host live events , including the recent dismantling of Ed Wood 's classic sci- fi bomb " Plan 9 From Outer Space , " broadcast to hundreds of movie theaters nationwide .
On Wednesday , they 're following up with the Christmas Shorts - Stravaganza , with " Weird " Al Yankovic will be a guest riffer .
They 'll get snarky about several obscure films , including a mostly forgotten Max Fleischer version of " Rudolph the Red- Nosed Reindeer . "
I recently chatted with Nelson , who called from the RiffTrax office in San Diego , about his unusual career , the Stravaganza and the kind of person it takes to be a lover of terrible movies .
Oh , and fish .
IF YOU GO RiffTrax Live : Christmas Shorts - Stravaganza When : 8 p.m. Wednesday ( encore presentation 8 p.m. Thursday )
Where : Celebration Cinema North , 2121 Celebration Drive NE , and Celebration Cinema at RiverTown Crossings , 3728 Rivertown Pkwy .
SW , 530-7469 or celebrationcinema.com , tickets $ 11.50 ; Holland 7 , 500 Waverly Road , Holland , 546-7469 or gqti.com , tickets $ 10 .
More about the Christmas Shorts - Stravaganza
Tell me a little about the Christmas event .
Are you friends with " Weird " Al Yankovic ?
We contacted him pretty early in RiffTrax , after I started it , and he thought it was a cool idea .
He sat with me to do " Jurassic Park . "
I 've only met him then , and I 've seen him a few times since then .
I 've gone to his shows .
He 's a great guy , easy to work with , and a lot of fun , obviously .
Is he riffing or singing ?
He 's just riffing with us .
It 's a musical short , so hopefully we 'll get him to sing a little bit .
Is this the classic Claymation " Rudolph " you 'll be riffing on ?
No , it 's a Max Fleischer cartoon from I do n't know when .
It 's very weird .
They have n't zeroed in how they 're going to anthropomorphize the animals .
Santa Claus delivers toys to reindeer ( which are ) wearing diapers .
Rudolph 's mom is disturbingly this curvaceous woman wearing a dress , standing on her hind hooves , so it confuses a man to watch this thing .
I do n't think I 've ever seen that before .
There 's one guy in our office who said he saw it as a kid , and it gave him nightmares , so I said , " That 's perfect for us ! "
Has that been buried like the " Star Wars Christmas Special " or something ?
Most of the stuff we 're going to present has been buried , and we are sort of archiving it .
( " Rudolph " ) is out there -- if you research the internet , you can find it .
The other stuff , we went to small film libraries to get .
We wanted to bring some new stuff to people .
Obviously , the Plan 9 event was pretty successful .
Are you going to do more of these live events ?
We hope to .
We really like doing the live shows , but when we were doing them before -- when they were n't linked to all the theaters -- it takes us away from our main mission , which is to stay on top of the blockbusters and put out some odd video - on - demand stuff .
We really are focused on the internet business , but this allows us , every quarter or so , to satisfy people 's desire for the live experience .
So obviously , you 're doing OK in the internet business .
Yeah !
I told my wife the other day , it 's kind of pathetic when you boil it down , and say to people , " I run an internet humor site . "
It does n't quite capture what I do , but technically , it 's correct .
( Laughing )
And immediately they ask , " So , you 're broke , right ? "
( laughing )
That 's the assumption everyone would make !
So do you make a living doing this ?
And if you answer how I expect you to , I 'll be really jealous .
I do !
I do make a living .
RiffTrax and " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " seem to have inspired a lot of people .
My wife and I have bad movie parties in my living room , and call them Serba 's Sucky Sinema Sensation .
Are you at all threatened by this ?
( Laughs )
Not at all .
The fact that I can find people who share ( the appreciation for bad movies ) is great .
Even though I 'm in this business and I do this for a living , when I go out with friends to see a movie , I 'm magically drawn to the worst thing out there .
You just know that you 'll have something to talk about when you go out for a cigar and a beer afterwards .
People just love the bad stuff .
I love that mission , so I say carry on .
There does n't seem to be any shortage of crap out there .
No , no .
The only danger is when I make an assumption , that this is a bad film , and Twitter on it or something , and get a lot of hate in return .
" Are you kidding ?
I loved ' Battlefield Earth ' ! "
But I thought it was pretty much understood ... ( laughs )
People are pretty passionate about their films , and I 'm just not .
That might explain why nothing seems to be off - limits to you guys .
Is n't riffing on " Casablanca " blasphemous ?
It is .
It admittedly was a stunt .
People had always asked that question : Could you ( riff on ) this movie ?
You know , " The Godfather , " stuff like that .
It was more , can we find a way into this movie ?
It remains one of my favorite movies , " Casablanca . "
It 's really sharply written .
It ends up being a kind of meta - commentary that does n't sharply cast aspersions on the film .
There are none to cast , really .
How many times do you have to sit through a movie to come up with all your material ?
We kind of break it into sections with writers , then combine them ...
It 's the equivalent of maybe 10 , 12 times through , maybe a little more than that .
This is going slowly -- stopping and rewinding , and everything .
That sounds like torture .
It 's a bit like editing -- you have a problem to solve , and you can kind of detach from the torture of that .
You 're so microfocusing on one little thing .
But there are moments when a writer will snap and stand up and go on a tirade about a particular moment in a film , and you kind of have to talk him down .
Do you have a particular favorite episode of " MST3K " or RiffTrax ?
Well , I 'm kind of partial to cheesy ' '80s movies .
If it stars Patrick Swayze or Sylvester Stallone , I 'm even happier .
They 're getting a little out of fashion .
They do n't sell as well , so we spice them in there every now and then .
But that 's where my true affection lies , with an " Over the Top , " a " Road House , " " Red Dawn , " something like that .
We ridiculed " Over the Top " at my house .
And " Cobra . "
( Laughs )
The thing I love about " Over the Top " is that , when they did those formula ' 80s movies , they made them kind of watchable , even though they 're terrible .
They hit all the beats right , and you 're like , " Yeah , I can see why these things bring a smile to people . "
And then you enjoy them on a different level , too .
It 's funny that we can enjoy bad movies on a different level .
People enjoy good movies on a different level , too .
Exactly !
I solicited some questions for you on Twitter .
One person suggested " lavishing praise and gifts of exotic delicacies to appease ( the RiffTrax guys ) .
They may , if they choose , grant a boon to you . "
Before I start ordering fine wines , are you capable of granting boons ?
( Laughs ) I think California law prohibits that .
A co-worker of mine asked , " How many different kinds of fish can you name ? "
You do n't have to answer that .
Having grown up fishing in freshwater lakes in Wisconsin , which has its own peculiar names for fish , I could probably stump them on that .
You could greatly impress people with your obscure knowledge .
People do n't know about the delicacy of walleye cheeks , deep - fried .
Cheeks ?
Yeah , does n't that sound delicious ?
Well , I love walleye ...
Walleye cheeks .
A little bit of meat behind the gills .
They should rename it .
You know , pork is pork , you do n't call it " pig meat . "
You should soften the blow , and call it " sweetbreads , " or something .

WHICH of his generals will President Barack Obama listen to ?
Will it be his commander in Afghanistan , Stanley McChrystal , who has asked for some 40,000 extra troops to reverse the recent gains of the Taliban ?
Or will it be one of General McChrystal 's predecessors , Karl Eikenberry , now Mr Obama 's ambassador to Afghanistan ?
He insists that no such reinforcement should be sent until President Hamid Karzai tackles the corruption and mismanagement that is rife in the country .
The debate over what to do in Afghanistan has raged in Washington for more than ten weeks since General McChrystal gave warning in an initial assessment that “ resources will not win this war , but under - resourcing could lose it ” .
In recent days , though , Mr Eikenberry has pitched in forcefully with messages expressing his opposition to a troop surge .
The details of his messages are not known , but Mr Eikenberry is said to be doubtful about Mr Karzai 's reliability as a partner and his willingness to curb corruption .
In the weeks of political wrangling that followed last August 's fraud - riddled election , Mr Karzai was first forced to accept a second round of voting ( after nearly 1 m ballots were deemed to be fraudulent ) .
He was then declared the winner after the withdrawal of his main opponent , Abdullah Abdullah .
Mr Karzai is due to be sworn in on November 19th , with several Western foreign ministers in attendance .
Despite the West 's seal of approval for the election result , support for Mr Karzai in the long term is ambivalent and conditional on his doing a better job of running a clean and competent government .
It is unclear whether Mr Eikenberry 's call to refrain from sending more troops is intended as a short - term tactic to increase pressure on Mr Karzai to make bolder reforms , or as an expression of the hopelessness of the Afghan venture .
Nevertheless , Mr Eikenberry 's 11th - hour intervention could tip the scales in the White House .
Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , Hillary Clinton , the secretary of state , and Robert Gates , the defence secretary , are said broadly to support General McChrystal 's call to add substantially more troops to the roughly 68,000 American and 35,000 allied forces in Afghanistan .
Against them have stood Joe Biden , the vice - president , who is reckoned to favour a narrower focus on counter - terrorism operations , and Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , who is thought to be worried about the impact of the deepening war on Mr Obama 's prospects for re-election .
Mr Obama is said to be weighing four options .
These range from a minimal increase of 10,000 - 15,000 troops focusing mainly on intensifying the training of the Afghan army , to General McChrystal 's favoured option of about 40,000 troops to conduct a more fully - fledged counter - insurgency campaign focused on “ protecting the population ” to isolate insurgents .
Mr Obama has now put off his decision until after he returns from his trip to Asian countries beginning this week , and may not make a choice until December .
Many accuse him of dithering , and even close allies such as Britain are expressing exasperation with the delay in Washington .
But others think Mr Obama 's caution has proven wise , given the political mess in Kabul .
What is undeniable is that the protracted debate within the administration is increasingly being fought in public .
It is also apparent that the hope of recreating the dream - team that oversaw the successful surge in Iraq — with General David Petraeus , the military commander , working in lock - step with Ryan Crocker , the ambassador in Baghdad — has not been realised in Afghanistan .
Is the international summit torn now between resolutions saying global warming is a moral imperative or a dastardly hoax ?
Hardly .
From Grist , part of the Guardian Environment Network
Today 's Politico headline from Copenhagen is : " Climategate distracts at Copenhagen . "
This seems based on a very low bar for what constitutes a distraction .
Is the international summit torn now between resolutions saying global warming is a moral imperative or a dastardly hoax perpetrated by the sinister scientist conspiracy ?
Hardly .
Is there one country that previously was open to a climate agreement , and now is suddenly abandoning it ?
Nope .
Is there one U.S. Senator changing his or her position on a cap - and - trade bill after the ginned up right - wing hysteria ?
Not a one .
Politico's basis for the headline is : " ' Climategate ' has muddied the good green message that was supposed to come out of the United Nations climate change talks here , forcing leaders to spend time justifying the science behind global warming when they want to focus on ending it . "
That 's evidence for summit participants being distracted by bored reporters waiting for real news to materialize as negotiators do their work .
Much like the " Swift Boat " attack against Sen.
John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , even after the Climategate allegations have been debunked , much of the media still keeps recycling the charges in unprofessional he - said - she - said style .
But I do n't want to malign the media too broadly .
Most the news coverage out of Copenhagen I 'm seeing is about the jockeying between the countries .
" Climategate " is , literally , a sideshow .
The criminals who stole the emails and the right - wingers who then blatantly took the contents out of context have had a good media run the past few weeks — many reporters are suckers for right - wing bait .
But the Right has little to show for it .
Conservatives have not derailed the possibility of international agreement .
If negotiators do come up short it will be because of aid to poor nations , not because of sudden doubts about climate science .
Conservatives have not derailed the possibility of American legislative action following Copenhagen .
Rare conservative realist Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) is still working on legislation with President Obama and Sen. Kerry .
And American public opinion polls still show strong majorities in favor of a carbon cap .
There is a bump in global warming denial , but that happened before the climate scientists ' emails were stolen , and it only reflects a consolidation of opinion among the right - wing minority .
The " Climategate " cranks will surely be an annoyance throughout Copenhagen , but they have yet to become a substantive distraction .
A better headline from Politico would have been : " Debunked Psuedo - Scandal Sputters Out At Copenhagen . "

A mushroom weighing more than 20 kilograms has been picked in a forest in Mexico 's southernmost state of Chiapas , university officials say .
The white mushroom , macrocybe titans , measured a towering 70 cm tall , was found near Tapachula , near the Guatemalan border , according to the Southern Border University Centre .
There is no word as to what the researchers plan to do with the specimen .

There are currently 1,595 people claiming unemployment benefit and stating their usual occupation to be ‘ architect ’ .
This compares with 1,765 in October .
According to the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) figures for November , 460 fewer architects are claiming unemployment benefit than at the peak of the recession in August this year , when 2,055 were on the dole .
This was the highest figure ever recorded for the profession and equated to just over six per cent of all registered architects .
However , the most recent November figures show just below 5 per cent of all registered architects are now unemployed .

There are still over twice as many unemployed architects than there were this time last year when 680 were claiming benefit .
A police handout picture shows criminal Peter Paul Michalski .
Michalski , who managed to escape from the prison in the German city of Aachen last Friday was captured by police in Schermbeck , western Germany December 1 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Polizei des Landes Nordrhein - Westfalen
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Germany ’s most wanted fugitive was captured Tuesday after a five - day manhunt , when police knocked the escaped murderer off the woman ’s bicycle he was riding along a rural road near the Dutch border .
Peter Paul Michalski surrendered without a fight after an unmarked police car deliberately crashed into him , knocking him off the bicycle onto the grassy shoulder of the road .
The 46 - year - old , who was serving a life sentence when he escaped from prison last week , was carrying a pistol .
Heavily armed police commandos had raided a number of buildings in the state of North Rhine - Westphalia searching for Michalski following his escape from a high - security prison in Aachen .
An accomplice in the escape was captured Sunday .
They made a copy of a key inside the jail and simply unlocked several doors to escape , according to German media reports .
They even stopped to wave good - bye to a security camera outside the front gate before getting into a taxi .
“ Bad luck for you -- we just broke out of jail , ” the accomplice Michael Heckhoff was quoted telling the taxi driver in his testimony to police , according to a report in Bild newspaper Tuesday .
“ He said that was no problem for him . ”
Thousands of police were involved in the hunt and authorities in neighboring countries were also alerted .
Police warned the public the two were extremely dangerous .
They stole a car and robbed several people along their escape route through several western German towns and cities .
Jim ’s already done an extensive round - up of the more interesting mods for Stalker : Clear Sky , but me , I ’m happy sticking to the original Stalker : Shadow of Chernobyl .
While the Oblivion Lost mod and its million features is the most renowned fan - tweak , there ’s much to be said for retaining the game ’s original structure rather than necessarily embracing such sweeping changes .
With that in mind , I ’m very much enjoying replaying SHOC with the Stalker Complete 2009 modpack .
Primarily , it simply makes the game much , much prettier .
How pretty ?
This pretty :
More shots below .
There is an argument to be made that we should n’t get so hung up about graphics , but in a game so based around exploring a unique environment , graphics are truly part of the experience .
And this mod definitely improves that experience .
Despite the size of the overhaul ( some 900 new textures , a whole new sky and weather system … )
It ’s impressively subtle – you ’re not slapped around the face with new ! new ! new !
but rather no longer feel as though you ’re playing a game from 2007 .
It looks and feels fresh and modern .
Lighting – the new day - night cycle ’s particularly spectacular – and textures are what ’s most lovingly touched by the hand of mod , but on the non-graphical front much of the in - game text gets a more grammar - friendly rewrite and the HUD receives a much - needed overhaul .
There ’s also a ton of bugfixes in there .
So , perversely , it ’s an amateur effort that makes the host game more professional .
Highly recommended for Stalker vets and newbies alike .
Go get .
Oh – and you can also ‘ dress ’ NPCs by giving them new clothes .
Fashion parades in the Zone : whoda thunk it ?
The founders envisioned a federal government constitutionally limited to defending our rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
For that to happen , we must have at least one political party that strongly advocates limiting the power of government .
For much of the 19th century , that party was the Democrats .
For the early part of the 20th century and from the early 1960s through 1988 , that party was the Republicans .
Today , it is difficult to find noninterventionists in either party .
The Democrats demonstrate a disdain for capitalism , free trade and the validity of contracts .
They cheer the restriction of certain types of speech on campus and in federal law , and think nation - building is our moral obligation , even when there is no discernible U.S. interest involved .
Lately , the Democrats have been popularly associated with principled opposition to waging war in far - flung corners of the globe .
But evidence on the ground today tells a somewhat different tale .
As for the GOP , it has outwardly abandoned the limited - government principles of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan .
Little other evidence is needed than the Medicare prescription drug benefit -- with its $ 13 - trillion unfunded liability -- passed with a strong - arm campaign by the Bush White House and a Republican congressional majority .

What happened to the Republicans ?
Well , the two Bush presidencies did n’t help .
Neither did the supply - side movement , focused on tax cuts and economic growth .
Supporters of those ideas did n’t talk about spending cuts , much less the proper role of government .
They had the effect of replacing “ liberty ” as the motivating force behind the GOP with “ growth , ” a somewhat less - inspiring ideal .
But perhaps most pernicious has been the role played by the neoconservatives .
The late William F. Buckley used his conservative flagship publication , National Review , to make anti-communism the litmus test for joining the conservative movement .
Dealing with the Soviets during the Cold War was clearly an important task , but it should not have opened the door of the limited - government movement to the neoconservatives , who are now -- and always have been -- advocates of big government .
With the neocon foot in the policymaking door after the Cold War ended , the drumbeat for war in Iraq began in earnest a decade before 9/11 .
It is important to realize that neocons are not just nation - building , America - first advocates .
They like big government across the board .
No Child Left Behind , the thinly disguised effort to nationalize education in America , was principally a neocon initiative .
Consider this comment from the late Irving Kristol , self - described “ godfather ” of the neoconservative movement : “ Neocons do not feel that kind of alarm or anxiety about the growth of the state in the past century , seeing it as natural , indeed inevitable . ”
Indeed .
There is an insidious philosophy underlying this acceptance of the “ natural ” growth of statism .
Neoconservative columnist David Brooks wrote in the late 1990s that we need “ a vigorous One Nation Conservatism that will connect a revived sense of citizenship with the long - standing national greatness Americans hold dear . ”
In another essay , he wrote : “ Ultimately , American purpose can find its voice only in Washington .
... Individual ambition and willpower are channeled into the cause of national greatness .
And by making the nation great , individuals are able to join their narrow concerns to a larger national project . ”
A frightening worldview .

Which brings us to the war in Afghanistan .
The neocons are predictably enthused about the prospect of a prolonged U.S. occupation there .
A dozen or so of them recently sent a letter to President Obama urging him to up the ante .
Astonishingly , the president who was elected as the antiwar left ’s protest candidate appears poised to take the neocons ’ advice and commit tens of thousands more troops to a conflict in which immediate U.S. interests are unclear at best .
Meanwhile , Obama ’s domestic agenda is in shambles .
Americans are outraged at the prospect of trillion - dollar deficits , auto bailouts and the subsidies to irresponsible bankers .
And they do n’t want socialized medicine .
The “ tea parties ” and town hall meetings are essentially libertarian .
There is no conservative policy agenda -- only a demand that the government stop trying to run our lives .
Republicans should take this opportunity to return to their traditional noninterventionist roots and throw their neoconservative wing under the bus .
The Republicans have a chance at this moment to reclaim the mantle of the party of nonintervention -- in your healthcare , in your wallet and in the affairs of other nations .
In addition , an Afghan Alumnus and nephew of Noordin Top ’s father - in - law was being pursued by the police for his role in a failed plot to blow up a tourist cafe on Sumatra .
Unfortunately , Noordin
Top struck the hotels before the Indonesian police could penetrate the entire network , in part because another family group was still operating under the police radar .
This group included a florist who smuggled the bombs into the hotels and a man whose eventual arrest led to discovery of the plot against the president .
Both terrorists were married to sisters of a Yemeni - trained imam who recruited the hotel suicide bombers , and of another brother who had infiltrated Indonesia ’s national airline .
Had the police pulled harder on the pieces of social yarn they had in hand , they might have unraveled the hotel plot earlier .
Still , their work thwarted attacks planned for the future , including that on the president .
Similarly , security officials in the Philippines have combined intelligence from American and Australian sources with similar tracking efforts to crack down on their terrorist networks , and as a result most extremist groups are either seeking reconciliation with the government  including the deadly Moro Islamic Liberation Front on the island of Mindanao  or have devolved into kidnapping - and - extortion gangs with no ideological focus .
The separatist Abu Sayyaf Group , once the most feared force in the region , now has no overall spiritual or military leaders , few weapons and only a hundred or so fighters .
So , how does this relate to a strategy against Al Qaeda in the West and in Afghanistan and Pakistan ?
Al Qaeda ’s main focus is harming the United States and Europe , but there has n’t been a successful attack in these places directly commanded by Osama bin Laden and company since 9/11 .
The American invasion of Afghanistan devastated Al Qaeda ’s core of top personnel and its training camps .
In a recent briefing to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Marc Sageman , a former C.I.A. case officer , said that recent history “ refutes claims by some heads of the intelligence community that all Islamist plots in the West can be traced back to the Afghan - Pakistani border . ”
The real threat is homegrown youths who gain inspiration from Osama bin Laden but little else beyond an occasional self - financed spell at a degraded Qaeda - linked training facility .
The 2003 invasion of Iraq encouraged many of these local plots , including the train bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005 .
In their aftermaths , European law and security forces stopped plots from coming to fruition by stepping up coordination and tracking links among local extremists , their friends and friends of friends , while also improving relations with young Muslim immigrants through community outreach .
Morocco , Saudi Arabia and Turkey have taken similar steps .
Now we need to bring this perspective to Afghanistan and Pakistan  one that is smart about cultures , customs and connections .
The present policy of focusing on troop strength and drones , and trying to win over people by improving their lives with Western - style aid programs , only continues a long history of foreign involvement and failure .
Reading a thousand years of Arab and Muslim history would show little in the way of patterns that would have helped to predict 9/11 , but our predicament in Afghanistan rhymes with the past like a limerick .

A key factor helping the Taliban is the moral outrage of the Pashtun tribes against those who deny them autonomy , including a right to bear arms to defend their tribal code , known as Pashtunwali .
Its sacred tenets include protecting women ’s purity ( namus ) , the right to personal revenge ( badal ) , the sanctity of the guest ( melmastia ) and sanctuary ( nanawateh ) .
Among all Pashtun tribes , inheritance , wealth , social prestige and political status accrue through the father ’s line .

Yesterday , Senior AccuWeather meteorologist Joe Bastardi let loose with this stunning prediction on the AccuWeather premium web site via Brett Anderson ’s Global warming blog :
What is facing the major population centers of the northern hemisphere is unlike anything that we have seen since the global warming debate got to the absurd level it is now , which essentially has been there is no doubt about all this .
For cold of a variety not seen in over 25 years in a large scale is about to engulf the major energy consuming areas of the northern Hemisphere .
The first 15 days of the opening of the New Year will be the coldest , population weighted , north of 30 north world wide in over 25 years in my opinion .
The Climate Prediction Center discussion for their forecast also concurs with both of the above :
THE AO INDEX WHICH RECENTLY HAS BEEN VERY STRONGLY NEGATIVE IS FORECAST TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY IN VALUE BUT REMAIN STRONGLY NEGATIVE THROUGH DAY 14 .
TODAYS BLEND CHART INDICATES BELOW NORMAL HEIGHTS ACROSS ROUGHLY THE SOUTHEASTERN TWO - THIRDS OF THE CONUS , AND ABOVE NORMAL HEIGHTS OVER THE NORTHWESTERN THIRD OF THE CONUS , CONSISTENT WITH A STRONGLY NEGATIVE AO .

The landscape of CG applications is vast and very confusing to 3D graphics newbies .
These apps span the gamut from free modelers to beefy , Python - scriptable animation packages , standalone renderers and a lot of little programs that glue them all together into a complex and intimidating workflow .
People looking to get into game development know that ZBrush is popular , but Mudbox looks good , too , so they 're at a loss over which to learn .
Program X looks like it does everything , but does it ?
What 's “ ambient occlusion ” and why would I ever need it ?
These questions and more will complicate life for the aspiring 3D newb .
3D magazines provide helpful tutorials , but since every application is also a potential advertiser , they tend to avoid saying that one package is best for a particular task , or that program X really sucks at particle animation , and so on .
This two - part series will cover these differences while discussing specific workflows where these packages are used in areas like character modeling , motion graphics for TV or photorealistic rendering for architectural visualization .
By the end of this first article , you should have an idea of how to approach modeling , sculpting , and texturing to achieve professional - looking results ; the second article will focus on animation and rendering .
You will still have lots of questions at the end , but 3D is inherently complex so there 's not much getting around that .
Think of this article as an introduction to the very basics .
Since this is a very broad approach , I have to limit the scope a bit .
Attempting to review all the 3D programs on all platforms would be too ambitious .
I do have a very good knowledge of where most 3D packages excel and which fall flat for certain aspects but we 'll be covering them within the context of a 3D workflow .
Often , it may look like I 'm recommending very expensive packages , but I will try to make clear the benefits of pro options while mentioning the base feature set you should look for in a 3D program .
I 've made my own choices that fit my work , but I 'm not going to insist those choices are right for everyone .
Part II of this series can be found here .

A bit about my 3D background : Handsome Boy Modeling School
You 're probably wondering , based on my Ars article history , how I could purport to know all about 3D and animation when I 'm just a design guy with some virtualization chops .
While it 's true that I 'm a print designer / magazine art director by trade , building 3D skills was always a pet project and 3D has become a staple of my print work over the last five years .
I 'm also a gamer and , in a slow time work - wise , I designed a level for Quake 3 ( on OS X , no less ) .
Even though that was before normal maps , GLSL and deferred rendering , I know my way around most facets of 3D technology .
And despite the still nature of my work , I often use animation and compositing to build images :
I 'm no stranger to the command line either , and I grow a nerdy smile by using screen and ssh to check render progress on my home server .
So there 's my 3D resum ?— did I get the job ?
3D on the Mac ?
Since many people probably scoffed at the idea of the Mac as a 3D platform when they read it above , I thought I 'd provide a macro - review of OS X as a 3D platform before starting on the workflow article .
My Maya 3D skills were picked up on a Windows 2000 Athlon and , at the time , there was no other option .
Until OS
X came out , the Mac just was n't a feasible platform for high - end 3D artists .
Despite having a few competent programs , the stability problems of OS 9 , combined with the terrible multitasking ( who'd want their render to stop every time you clicked on a menu ? ) and the lack of a command line made the Mac more of a chuckle than a consideration for any high - end 3D animator .
The video card choices were almost as bad as the 3D technology , and watching Apple fumble its way through Quickdraw 3D ( roller - coasters and RAVE ! ) was awful .
Then Steve came riding back in on his turtlenecked stallion and things started to change .
OpenGL was officially adopted thanks to the gentle nudges of John Carmack ; the popular API even made it into OS 9 but that still would n't have been enough to make the system palatable for 3D pros .
After OS X and the Intel transition , the situation greatly improved for 3D on the Mac .
Today , the parts are finally all there for a mature 3D platform : the OS , the video hardware , and , most significantly , the software .
In the course of doing research for this article , so many Windows 3D application ports were announced for OS X that it no longer surprises me when important niche products like Topogun , Headus UV Layout , or CrazyBump announce an OS X version .
But Apple can't take all the credit — OS X got more than a bit of help from Linux .
With animation studios moving from Irix to Linux or Windows , there was a need for cross-platform development in 3D and VFX .
Today , cross- platform development tools like Qt are ubiquitous in the 3D world .
Qt alone is behind many professional 3D and compositing applications that appear on the Mac : Mudbox , Nuke , Toxik , Maxwell Render , Imagemodeler and Realflow to name a few .
Nuggets of OS X's CG maturity abound .
32 - bit EXR / HDR files support across the OS :
No one doubts that OpenCL will be a significant technology in the future of 3D apps .
Even Collada files — the open standard 3D format for game engines like UT3 — display and rotate in 3D within Preview.app and Quicklook :
You could send a model to a client for approval and they would n't need a 3D program to view it — just Snow Leopard .
It seems that 3D users are feeling the OS X love too .
In a recent poll of Maya users on CGSociety , the largest online community for 3D and animation , OS X turned up a good showing :
While I do n't think that reflects the 3D industry as a whole , it 's definitely encouraging .
The word almighty , used in connection with God , appears
57 times
in the King James Version of the Bible .
Starting in the Book of Genesis , God is variously referred to as “ the Almighty God , ” “ God Almighty ” and , most often , simply as “ the Almighty . ”
The English idiom “ the almighty dollar , ” which is commonly used to mock the worship of wealth and money , does not come from the Bible .
It was coined in 1836 by the American author Washington Irving , whose best known works include the short stories “ The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ” and “ Rip Van Winkle . ”
There is an earlier , similar term .
In 1616 , the English playwright and poet Ben Jonson used the term “ almighty gold ” in his poem “ Epistle to Elizabeth , Countess of Rutland . ”
But the more familiar “ almighty dollar ” first appeared in a travel story Irving wrote about a steamboat trip he took through the Louisiana bayous .
The story , titled “ The Creole Village , ” was originally published in the November 12 , 1836 issue of Knickerbocker Magazine .
Irving was impressed by the laid back lifestyle of the Creole people who lived in Louisiana ’s bayou country and by how unconcerned they seemed ( at least to him ) about making or having money .
He wrote in his travel piece :
“ The inhabitants , moreover , have none of that eagerness for gain and rage for improvement which keep our people continually on the move ...
In a word , the almighty dollar , that great object of universal devotion throughout our land , seems to have no genuine devotees in these peculiar villages ; and unless some of its missionaries penetrate there , and erect banking houses and other pious shrines , there is no knowing how long the inhabitants may remain in their present state of contented poverty . ”
Near the end of the piece , Irving opined :
“ As we swept away from the shore , I cast back a wistful eye upon the moss - grown roofs and ancient elms of the village , and prayed that the inhabitants might long retain their happy ignorance , their absence of all enterprise and improvement , their respect for the fiddle , and their contempt for the almighty dollar . ”
I suspect this romantic vision overestimated how content the locals were to be poor .
Of course , in 1855 , when “ The Creole Village ” was included in a collection of his stories called Wolfert ’s Roost , Irving made it clear that he had meant no offense — to the almighty dollar , that is .
In a satirical footnote in that book ( later included in larger Irving anthologies like The Crayon Miscellany ) , Irving wrote :
“ This phrase [ the almighty dollar ] , used for the first time in this sketch , has since passed into current circulation , and by some has been questioned as savoring of irreverence .
The author , therefore , owes it to his orthodoxy to declare that no irreverence was intended even to the dollar itself ; which he is aware is daily becoming more and more an object of worship . ”

The evolutionary march of the penguins happened in double time , according to new genetic calculations .
A study of DNA from ancient and modern Adélie penguins suggests that scientists may have miscalculated the rates at which genetic clocks tick off evolutionary time in other species as well .
A team of researchers collected mitochondrial DNA from penguins currently living in rookeries in Antarctica and from bones of penguins that had lived in the same spot as long as 44,000 years ago .
Analysis of the DNA reveals that the penguins are evolving on a molecular scale two to six times faster than standard calculations indicated , the team reports in the November Trends in Genetics .
Mitochondria are small structures that generate power inside cells .
The organelles were once free - living bacteria and have kept their own circle of DNA , which encodes many of the proteins needed for power production .
The function of mitochondria is so crucial to the cell that any changes to mitochondrial genes are likely to throw a wrench into a cell ’s energy - generating capabilities .
As a result , the mitochondrial DNA has evolved slowly .
Scientists can use the number of changes in mitochondrial DNA between different species to calculate a molecular rate of evolution and estimate how long ago the species shared a common ancestor .
One of the most basic assumptions is that the rate of evolution is the same in all species , says Stephan Schuster , a genomicist at Pennsylvania State University in State College .
But some scientists have begun questioning that assumption .
Now , the new study provides evidence that , at least for Adélie penguins , evolution is happening faster than previously thought .
“ This is a beautiful study , ” says Schuster , who was not involved in the work .
“ Some people have been saying this for a long time , but no one has shown this in such a systematic way . ”
Most calculations of the rate of evolution are based upon changes in a part of the mitochondrial DNA called the hypervariable region , where change happens at a relatively fast pace .
The new study decoded the entire mitochondrial genome , not just the hypervariable region , and compared the rate of change among penguin generations for all parts of the DNA circle .
Usually , ancient DNA is badly degraded , but because Antarctica is so cold , specimens were well preserved .
The team was able to extract DNA from several penguin generations , including 12 modern penguins and eight ancient penguins that ranged from 250 to 44,000 years old .
Using the ancient DNA allowed the researchers to track all of the changes in the mitochondrial genome , a process that is normally invisible when scientists compare DNA between two modern species , says Dee Denver , an evolutionary geneticist at Oregon State University in Corvallis and a coauthor of the study .
Each difference in the DNA between two species is calculated as a single change when , in fact , multiple changes might have happened .
The team was able to see all of these steps by comparing the modern birds to several generations of their ancestors .
Overall , the whole mitochondrial genome was experiencing more changes per unit time than previous methods had predicted .
But each part of the circular mitochondrial genome evolves at different rates , the team found .
Protein - coding genes change more slowly than the hypervariable region , and genes that encode transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs change even more slowly than protein coding regions .
These data indicate that scientists should calculate evolutionary rates on the basis of the entire mitochondrial genome , not just a small part , Denver says .
Using only the hypervariable region might also throw off estimates of human migrations as well as broader evolutionary time scales , he says .
And each species may have its own rate that ca n’t be generalized to other species , even if closely related .
“ When you ’re extrapolating these rates to another group , there ’s a very good chance it ’s an underestimate , ” Denver says .

Gallup ’s monthly economic survey breaks down the employment situation by region in the U.S. .
No region is doing great , but the West is doing the worst and the situation is getting worse .
Here is what they say :
During a week of intense government focus on jobs , punctuated by the president ’s jobs summit , the Gallup Job Creation Index — based on U.S. employees ’ self - reports of hiring and firing activity at their workplaces — shows that November job - market conditions nationwide failed to match even the modest job - market improvements of recent months .
As a result , they remain about where they were in October .
The South continues to be the strongest region while the West remains the weakest and is worsening .
Job conditions also deteriorated in the East during November and were unchanged in the Midwest .
Nationwide , job - market conditions are much better than they were earlier this year .
However , Gallup ’s Job Creation
Index also shows that the job situation remains much worse than it was just after the recession began , in January 2008 .
The lack of improvement in jobs during November tends to emphasize the dire situation facing policymakers as they contemplate job creation in 2010 .
The article shows a lot other charts which I found useful in getting a more granular view .

While Wall Street has surged 60 % since its March low , Gallup ’s Job Creation Index shows hiring has increased two points , from 23 % to 25 % , during that time .

Some recent findings seem to run counter to the view glaciers are retreating
A scientific debate has been triggered over the state of glaciers in the Himalayas .
Some recent findings seem to contradict claims that the glaciers are retreating rapidly .
Some glaciers are even said to be advancing .
There are clear signs of glacial retreat and ice melt from other parts of the world , but few field studies have been carried out in the Himalayas .
Its glaciers too were widely believed to be receding fast .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) had said that Himalayan glaciers were receding faster than in any other part of the world .
The panel observed : " If the present rate continues , the likelihood of them disappearing by 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high if the Earth keeps warming at the current rate . "
This report sparked concerns that there could be increased flooding in the short term , as glacial lakes suddenly overflowed .
In the longer term , major glacier - fed rivers , it was feared , would run dry , affecting millions in the region .
Glacial conflict
But some scientists claim that glaciers in the Himalayas are not retreating as fast as was believed .
Others who have observed nearby mountain ranges even found that glaciers there were advancing .
Reports sparked concerns about increased flooding Kenneth Hewitt , a glaciologist from Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario , Canada , is one of these scientists .
He has been doing field studies in Pakistan 's Karakoram Mountains at the western reaches of the Himalayan range for the last 40 years .
Just back from that region , he told BBC News that he saw at least half a dozen glaciers that had been advancing since the last time he saw them - five years ago .
" Dozens of smaller , high altitude tributary glaciers have advanced including seven of Biafo Glacier and four of Panmah , " he says .
" It means climate change is happening here too , but with different consequences . "
Scientists have also described a phenomenon called glacial " surge " .
This is thought to be caused by melt water underneath the glacier lubricating its ground contact and causing it to move forward .
This is different from a real advance of a glacier , which is caused by an increase in the volume of ice .
" Rapid , surge - type advances have occurred in at least 17 glaciers since 1985 , at least eight since 2000 [ in the Karakoram ] , " says Dr Hewitt .
Out of date data ?
In the western Himalayas , some scientists have also reported findings that conflict with the long - held view that glaciers are retreating .
The Indian government has issued a discussion paper based on these findings .
It says : " Himalayan glaciers , although shrinking in volume and constantly showing a retreating front , have not in any way exhibited ... an abnormal annual retreat , of the order that some glaciers in Alaska and Greenland are reported to have done .
" It is premature to make a statement that glaciers in the Himalayas are retreating abnormally because of global warming . "
Scientists say ground - level work is needed to validate findings
But noted Indian glaciologist Syed Iqbal Hasnain told BBC
News that the data referred to in this paper are from the 1970s .
" I [ was ] asked to review the paper and clearly it does not reflect the current situation , " he said .
" Things have changed in the last four decades . "
Professor Hasnain has studied the Chhota Shigri glacier in Himachal Pradesh for four years and has found it to be retreating by 0.8 m a year .
" ( There is ) no benchmark glacier in India which has been studied for many years , " he says .
" Those that have been studied once or twice by some institutes are showing negative mass balance [ or losing ice ] . "
He explained that precipitation and temperature were the main factors affecting whether glaciers retreat or advance .
All data , he says , show that precipitation is falling .
And less precipitation means less accumulation of snow and ice .
In retreat ?
The gradual disappearance of glaciers is causing huge concern .
Indian newspapers recently reported that some glaciers were retreating alarmingly quickly in Indian - administered Kashmir .
In China , glaciologists have also repeatedly warned of glaciers in Tibet retreating significantly .
But some experts argue that these conclusions often come from studies carried out in the snouts of glaciers , and that they do not represent the complete picture .
Richard Armstrong , a glaciologist with Colorado University in the US who also works for Nasa , says : " Retreat at the local point of the terminus does n't describe what 's going on in the entire glacier system that involves thousands of metres of elevation difference . "
I do not know of any scientific study that supports a complete vanishing of glaciers in the Himalayas within this century
Michael Zemp
World Glacier Monitoring Service Having studied glaciers in the Nepalese Himalayas recently with the help of ground data and satellite imagery , Professor Armstrong said the upper air and surface station data indicated that above 5,400 m there was no melting .
" It turns out [ that ] about half of the surface area of the glaciers that we studied in Nepal do n't experience melt at any time of year . "
Another scientist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha , Dr Michael Bishop , echoed Professor Armstrong 's argument that the state of Himalayan glaciers was being overly generalised .
Dr Bishop has carried out glacier research funded by Nasa .
He says : " Some people are making extrapolations based upon one or two glaciers .
" In the Himalayas , that can't be done because of the influence of topography and climate dynamics . "
But Professor Hasnain says that those who criticise the finding that glaciers are retreating are often researchers who never go into the field and who rely too heavily on satellite images .
" When you are measuring from 35,000 km ( 22,000 miles ) above , the data cannot be accurate and so there needs to be [ verification on the ] ground , " he told BBC News .
" But people do n't do that . "
He says the argument that glaciers are not retreating remarkably is based on " flimsy ground " .
Those who come to that conclusion , says Professor Hasnain , use Nasa 's data .
" But [ the US space agency ] itself says that its own data is quite [ different ] from the ground data .
That is why it is willing to work with us , " he says .
Some researchers say satellite data is needed for a fuller picture
William Lau , who heads the atmospheric sciences branch at Nasa 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland , says : " Nasa products are very useful in providing a broad picture of what is happening regarding the seasonal snow melt , and short term variations .
" [ But ] all satellite products have inherent uncertainties , and need to be calibrated and validated against ground observations .
Meanwhile , experts at the World Glacier Monitoring Service ( WGMS ) , based in Zurich , Switzerland , say both in - situ measurements and remote sensing data are needed in order to get a complete image of glacier distribution and the changes throughout an entire mountain range .
Michael Zemp , a glaciologist at WGMS says : " There is a general centennial trend of glacier retreat from the moraines of the Little Ice Age ( also ) in the Himalayas . "
But , he adds , " I do not know of any scientific study that supports a complete vanishing of [ Himalayan ] glaciers within this century . "
The Kathmandu - based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development has carried out some studies on glaciers .
It says that the general behaviour of the Himalayan glaciers is clear - overall they are currently in a state of rapid and substantial retreat .
" A few glaciers may be acting differently as a result of their different individual physical ' character ' , " it adds .
It appears that the impact of climate change in the region could be far more complicated than previously thought .
And despite varying observations , experts do agree on one thing : there has to be an increased level of scientific observation to record the changes in Himalayan glaciers and make reliable predictions .
The absence of this data could make the issue of Himalayan glaciers a knotty one during the international climate negotiations in Copenhagen in December .

NASA is sure to get an injection of cash to rescue its faltering human space exploration programme , says a well - connected space policy analyst .
In October , a report by a White House panel headed by former Lockheed Martin CEO Norman Augustine said NASA would be unable to support meaningful human space exploration without at least $ 3 billion more per year .
More recently , there have been rumours that the Obama administration is set to cut NASA funds as part of an overall tightening of the US federal budget .
But John Logsdon , former head of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University in Washington , DC , and a Washington insider , said he believes the White House will give NASA a budget boost .

“ There will be more money , ” he told reporters following a forum on the Augustine report at MIT on Friday .
“ It is becoming clear that the White House is willing to put some more money into the space programme , ” he continued .
“ That ’s derivative of the fact that [ President ]
Obama does not want to be the person that abandons a future - oriented programme . ”
Middle ground
In his comments during the forum , however , he said the space agency would not get the full $ 3 billion increase suggested in the Augustine report .
“ There ’s no inclination in the current economic and political situation to put NASA on a path of that much of a budget increase , ” he said .
“ NASA is intensely working on options somewhere in between ” its current budget and one with a $ 3 billion increase .
A decision on NASA ’s future is likely to be made in the next few weeks , he added .
The decision would have to be made before the proposal for the 2011 federal budget is sent to printers at the end of December , he said .
It is not yet clear whether the decision would be announced before the budget proposal is made public in early February .
“ That could come as a separate statement , it could come in the State of the Union [ address to Congress ] , but all the readings I ’m getting is that this will be a presidential decision … and the president will want to take credit for it , ” said Logsdon .
If NASA gets less than the $ 3 billion needed according to the Augustine committee , it might still manage to engage in human space exploration by working cooperatively with international partners , Logsdon said .

Can Canada be trusted ?
In the midst of what turned out to be a bogus espionage scare over commemorative coins , senior Pentagon officials in Washington , D.C. , speculated whether Canadians — widely considered to be among the United States ' closest allies — might be " bad guys " involved in the spy caper .
" Who knows ? " one official wrote in secret emails obtained this week by The Associated Press .
In sensational warnings that circulated publicly in late 2006 and early 2007 , the Pentagon 's Defence Security Service said coins with radio transmitters were found planted on U.S. army contractors on at least three occasions between October 2005 and January 2006 as the contractors travelled through Canada .
In January 2007 , the government abruptly reversed itself and said the warnings were n't true .
But the case remained a mystery until months later , when AP learned that the flap had been caused by suspicions over the image of a poppy on the Canadian quarter .
What suspicious contractors believed to be " nanotechnology " on the coins actually was a protective coating the Royal Canadian Mint applied to prevent the poppy 's red colour from rubbing off .
But at the height of the mystery , senior Pentagon officials speculated about Canada 's involvement , according to emails marked " Secret / NoForn " and obtained by AP under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act .
The messages reflect the no-holds - barred attitudes over an inherent lack of trust within U.S. spy agencies .
" I do n't think it is an issue of the Canadians being the bad guys , " the Pentagon 's counterintelligence chief wrote , " but then again , who knows . "
Names blacked out
In the emails , released to AP with names blacked out but job titles disclosed , Pentagon officials question whether they should warn military officers in the U.S. Northern Command , who regularly met Canadian counterparts about classified subjects inside bug - proof , government meeting rooms .
The rooms are known as secure compartmentalized information facilities , or SKIFs .
" Is n't the Canadian piece something that should be briefed to Northcom since the Canadians sit in their SKIFs ? " asked the Pentagon 's deputy director for counterintelligence oversight .
" Good point , " replied the Pentagon 's acting director for counterintelligence .
" It is possible that DSS [ the U.S. Defence Security Service ] sent their report to Northcom .
Then again , I do n't think it is an issue of the Canadians being the bad guys , but then again , who knows . "
' Put Humpty together again '
One email included a curious message on the same day the Defence Security Service publicly disavowed its warning about the spy coins .
" I am guessing y'all know the status of the Canadian coin situation , " it read .
It called for an internal meeting " to chat about the next step to put Humpty together again " and suggested notifying the media — and the Canadians .
The State Department , with tongue in cheek , reiterated Thursday that the U.S. trusts Canada .
" From the State Department 's point of view , Canada is a trustworthy ally , " spokesman Mark Toner told reporters .
" I 'd refer you to the Pentagon for anything else . "
It looks like " X " is n't gon ' give it to ya ' after all .
The rapper - turned - actor - turned - inmate known as DMX was scheduled to fight celebrity wannabe Eric Martinez at the upcoming " Alabama Pride " event put forth by Thunder Promotions .
The event , headlined by a " superfight " between Butterbean and the barely upright Tank Abbott , is still threatening to take place at the Birmingham Jefferson Convention Complex in Birmingham , Alabama , on Dec. 12 .
It seems as though DMX got cold feet and submitted an addendum to his contract that called for a guaranteed outcome .
That outcome would peg him as the winner no matter what transpired during the " fight . "
The " X " camp also insisted that their client is not a professional boxer but an entertainer , and that the event should ( secretly ) be held in good , clean fun .
Laymen have also been known to refer to that practice as " fixing fights . "
According to SixShot.com , Thunder Promotions balked at the last - minute request , prompting DMX to jump ship and allowing fellow rapper Coolio to step up and take his place .
Coolio it seems , is taking this fight very seriously .
Outside of Alabama , he might be the only one .

Former UFC middleweight Dan Henderson signed a four - fight , 16 - month deal with Strikeforce on Saturday .
Aaron Crecy , the fighter ’s business partner and manager , confirmed that the deal has been inked but would not divulge any further specifics of the agreement .
Henderson had been in negotiations with both the UFC and Strikeforce since his UFC contract expired this fall .
“ Dan chose to sign with Strikeforce after careful consideration , " Crecy told Sherdog.com via e-mail on Monday .
" He approached the process with an open mind , and over the course of the past couple months became increasingly impressed with the Strikeforce organization .
It was not a decision that Dan took lightly .
" Henderson could debut for Strikeforce as early as April on a tentatively planned CBS event , Sherdog.com has learned , and might face the promotion ’s middleweight champion , Jake Shields , right out of the gate .
Henderson , who also fights at light heavyweight , is being eyed for matchups against Strikeforce light heavyweight champion Gegard Mousasi and the world ’s No. 1 heavyweight , Fedor Emelianenko , said a source with knowledge of the deal .
“ Dan has always been motivated by the challenge of competing above his natural weight class , and he would certainly be honored to square off with Fedor at some point , " said Crecy .
Henderson , who is Sherdog.com ’s No. 3 ranked middleweight , and the UFC had stalemated on a new five - fight agreement since late July , following the two - time Olympic wrestler ’s second - round knockout of Michael Bisping at UFC 100 .
( Henderson earned $ 350,000 for the win , which included a $ 100,000 performance bonus from the promotion . )
Henderson was first announced to rematch Rich Franklin at UFC 103 last September in Dallas , though he was later replaced by Vitor Belfort as the 39 - year - old California native ’s renegotiations continued .
During a July 31 teleconference call , UFC President Dana White said Henderson was “ next in line ” to challenge middleweight titleholder Anderson Silva in a rematch of their March 2008 bout at UFC 82 .
However , the bout would never come to fruition .
Henderson met face - to - face with UFC owners Dana White and Lorenzo Fertitta at the end of September in Las Vegas , but could not hash out a new contract .
In November , Strikeforce joined the negotiation table after Henderson ’s two - month non-compete period had expired with the UFC .
Unlike other standard UFC contracts , Henderson ’s did not include a matching period in which the UFC could review and match outside offers , said the source .
Jordan Feagan , Henderson ’s lawyer , continued to converse with both promotions as late as Friday , according to the source .
The source said that Henderson was even offered a bout on Friday to face top - ranked middleweight Nate Marquardt at UFC 109 on Feb.
6 in Las Vegas , a matchup the promotion had previously tried to lock up for November ’s UFC 105 in Manchester , England .
A bout between Marquardt and Henderson ’s former teammate , Chael Sonnen , had already been reported independently for that date , though not officially announced yet by the promotion .
Henderson won the UFC ’s under 200 - Pound tournament at UFC 17 in 1998 , before joining the ranks of RINGS and Pride Fighting Championships in Japan .
The only fighter ever to hold two division titles for Pride simultaneously , Henderson owns victories over standouts Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira Murilo Bustamante , and Rich Franklin During his second stint with the UFC from 2007 - 2009 , Henderson co-headlined four of the five events that he appeared in .
Crecy said Henderson was “ very pleased ” with the terms of his new contract and that money was not the fighter ’s sole objective in his decision to move to the newer promotion .
“ Dan likes to be a maverick , and I think part of the attraction to Strikeforce was to be a part of something that broadens the growth of the sport within the U.S. and globally , ” said Crecy .
“ The fact that Strikeforce offers a network television platform in CBS as well as a premium cable partner in Showtime was particularly appealing to him .
It delivers an incredible opportunity for Dan to perform live before an audience of millions of present and future MMA fans .
Also , ( Strikeforce CEO ) Scott Coker treated Dan with a great deal of respect and integrity throughout the negotiations , and that certainly affected his decision .
Dan is very excited to be a part of the Strikeforce family . "

Experts are concerned that too many teenagers are drinking Parents who allow their children alcohol at home may be increasing the chances of future drinking problems , says England 's chief medical officer .
Sir Liam Donaldson accused some parents of a " laissez - faire " approach and said letting children taste alcohol to ready them for adulthood was " misguided " .
Evidence showed that this could lead to binge drinking in later life , he said .
New official guidance says under - 15 s should drink no alcohol , with under - 18s drinking only under supervision .
Legally , parents and carers can give their children alcohol at home from the age of five onwards .
' Middle - class obsession '
However , Sir Liam described the idea of a glass of watered - down wine for a child as a " middle - class obsession " , and criticised the approach among some parents towards their children getting drunk .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He said : " Across England , 500,000 children between the ages of 11 to 15 years will have been drunk in the past four weeks .
" The science is clear - drinking , particularly at a young age , a lack of parental supervision , exposing children to drink - fuelled events and failing to engage with them as they grow up are the root causes from which our country 's serious alcohol problem has developed . "
He added : " The more [ children ] get a taste for it , the more likely they are to be heavy drinking adults or binge drinkers later in childhood . "
Send us your comments
He announced a major publicity campaign on the subject in England , which will get under way in January 2010 .
Similar advice is expected in Scotland at around the same time .
In Wales , a health spokesman said work was already under way to tackle drinking among young people .

The advice was welcomed by alcohol campaign groups , although Alcohol Concern said that the availability of alcohol at " pocket money prices " was a key factor in abuse and should be addressed by ministers .
Sir Liam said that he wanted to address the " ready availability " of cheap alcohol and called on supermarkets and corner shops to " take a stand " .
SIR LIAM'S ACHIEVEMENTS Knighted in 2002 Championed swine flu strategy Pushed for smoke - free public places Recommended a minimum alcohol price Made changes to organ retention / consent post - Alder Hey Set up the Health Protection Agency
He said that he would be able to " shout louder " about his suggestion for a 50 p minimum price for alcohol - rejected by Prime Minister Gordon Brown - after he steps down next year .
Jeremy Todd , chief executive of the parenting charity Parentline Plus , praised the guidelines .
He said : " Parents can have a huge influence on their child 's drinking choices .
Parental influence " Rates of teenage drunkenness are higher amongst both the children of parents who drink to excess and the children of parents who abstain completely .
" Whilst parents have a greater influence on their children 's drinking patterns early on , as they grow older their friends have a greater influence .
" It is therefore crucial for parents to talk to their children about alcohol and its effects . "
Professor Ian Gilmore , president of the Royal College of Physicians and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance , said : " We know that adults who drink sensibly tend to pass these habits on and that some families choose to introduce alcohol to their children younger than 15 in a supportive environment . "
He stressed that not drinking alcohol at all remained the " healthiest option " for children .
Alison Rogers , chief executive of the British Liver Trust , said : " While Sir Liam 's statement is very strong and gives clear clinical guidance , the issues of pocket - money pricing and easy availability of alcohol need to be addressed if it is to have any impact on the life - style choices we are making .

Since 2002 , the dollar has lost about a third of its value compared with other currencies .
That does n't sound good — and it's not , if you 're a Japanese exporter or an American tourist .
But it is potentially great news for American workers .
Experts argue about the many effects of the dollar 's fall and what it says about confidence in the American economy , with its decades - old trade deficit and mounting national debt .
But there are also more predictable effects replayed in each decline .
Last week , as President Obama convened a summit meeting on unemployment , the devalued dollar was already doing its part to create jobs by making American goods cheaper abroad .
" I do n't think anything they can come up with is as powerful as the dollar declining , " said Kenneth S. Rogoff , a Harvard economist .
" It 's a good short - term boost .
Every country 's manufacturing sector loves it when the currency has a moderate depreciation . "
But the benefit to American exporters goes only so far .
Some economists say it hurts industry in the long run : companies can reap the rewards of the falling dollar without improving products or productivity .
When the dollar rebounds , they falter anew .
( And on Friday , the dollar did rebound a bit .
A suprisingly strong jobs report prompted the currency 's biggest rally since January . )
A falling dollar " might slow the rate of deindustrialization , but not much , " Mr. Rogoff said .
And too much currency decline will start to raise prices , then wages — a dependable recipe for inflation .
Here , a falling dollar scorecard :
When physicist Vitaly Efimov heard his theory had finally been proven , he ran up to the younger scientist who had verified it and gave him a high five .
Efimov had predicted a quantum - mechanical version of Borromean rings , a symbol that first showed up in Afghan Buddhist art from around the second century .
The symbol depicts three rings linked together ; if any ring were removed , they would all come apart .
Efimov theorized an analog to the rings using particles :
Three particles ( such as atoms or protons or even quarks ) could be bound together in a stable state , even though any two of them could not bind without the third .
The physicist first proposed the idea , based on a mathematical proof , in 1970 .
Since then , no one has been able to demonstrate the phenomenon in the lab — until recently .
A team of physicists led by Randy Hulet of Rice University in Houston finally achieved the trio of particles , and published their findings in the online journal Science Express .
" It was very exciting , because after 40 years of this prediction being out there , it was finally verified , " Hulet told LiveScience .
Hulet presented his work at a meeting in Rome in October that Efimov also attended .
" He gave me a high five after my talk , " Hulet recounted .
" He was so enthusiastic and so excited to see this prediction become true . "
Efimov had calculated that the triplet of bound particles was possible , and that it was repeating :
New bound states could be achieved at higher and higher energy levels in an infinite progression .
All of the bound states would occur at energy levels that were multiples of 515 .
To prove that they had really created the trios , called Efimov trimers , the researchers produced one set of three lithium atoms bound together , and then reproduced it with a binding energy 515 times the first one .
( Essentially , binding energy indicates how tightly the particles hold onto one another and how much energy it would take to pull them apart . )
The researchers used a setup called a Feshbach resonance that allowed them to tweak the energy levels of their atoms .
They found that when they hit multiples of 515 , the particles would bind , but at other energies they would n't , proving that the trios really were Efimov trimers .
" It 's an amazing effect , really , " Hulet said .
" A lot of people did n’t believe [ Efimov ] at first .
It was a very strange prediction . "
The theory is unique because it's a solution to a special case of what 's called the " three - body " problem .
Scientists have solved the " two - body " problem — that is , they have calculated exactly how two objects should move based on their starting positions , masses and velocities .
Scientists can also calculate this scenario for many masses , but a pure solution to the general three - body problem has been elusive .
" Physicists can handle two - body problems quite well , and many - body problems fairly well , but when there are just a few objects , like the three bodies in these Efimov trimers , there are just too many variables , " Hulet said .
The Efimov calculation is n't the solution to the general case , but rather a solution to a specific case of three bodies .
Thus , discovering a real - life example of three particles fulfilling his prediction is an important step to learning more about few - body physics .
This USB hub has 24 ports .
Who could possibly use such a thing ?
I regularly have to re-jig my USB setup to fit in everything I use ( not to mention the gear I test ) and I can’t ever see myself needing almost a quarter - century of sockets .
We suppose it could be good for those who need to write a whole lot of thumb - drives at once , although there are purpose built devices for that which do n’t make your peripherals radiate from the center like some demented electronic sunburst .
The Super USB 24 - Port Hub will set you back $ 70 , and comes ( of course ) with a power adapter .
I have another concern about having so may gadgets hooked up to just one port on your computer .
Unlike FireWire , USB communication is controlled by your computer and not the peripheral itself .
Would n’t having 24 gizmos running concurrently drain the resources of even a powerful modern machine ?

Now that the public option has been removed from the Senate healthcare reform bill , Sen .
Joe Lieberman has turned his attention to getting the Medicare buy in out of the bill .
On CBS News ’ Face The Nation , he said , “ You got to take out the Medicare buy - in .
You got to forget about the public option . ”
Here is the video :

Lieberman claimed that in order for the bill to get 60 votes more changes have to be made , “ You got to take out the Medicare buy - in .
You got to forget about the public option .
You probably have to take out the CLASS Act , which was a whole new entitlement program that will in– in future years put us further into deficit .
And you got to adopt some of the cost containment provisions that will strengthen cost containment that all of us favor .
If you did that , you ’d have an enormous accomplishment .
Thirty million Americans who ca n’t afford insurance today would get it .
Insurance companies out to be more aggressively regulated and costs would be bent down .
So it ’s time to get reasonable . ”
If the Senate Democratic leadership thought that all it would take to get Lieberman ’s vote is the removal of the public option , they were wrong .
Lieberman is making it plain that he will oppose any kind of healthcare reform bill that is put up for a final vote .
What Lieberman supports is health insurance reform , not healthcare reform .
It is time for Senate Democrats to stop giving concessions to Lieberman , because he is never going to support healthcare reform .
The more the Democratic leadership gives him , the more he demands .
Lieberman wo n’t be happy until there is nothing meaningful left in the healthcare reform bill .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was named Person of the Year by Time magazine on Wednesday , giving him a high - profile boost as he tries to fend off proposals that might weaken the Fed ’s independence .
The selection puts the mild - mannered Bernanke , a former professor , in the company of U.S. President Barack Obama , Pope John Paul II and Russian President Vladimir Putin , among other prominent world figures the magazine has picked in past years .
The Senate is considering Bernanke ’s nomination to a second term to head the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- and while he is expected to win confirmation , criticism of the Fed among the public and members of Congress is at its highest in decades .
The Fed ’s role in bailouts of Wall Street has prompted criticism from both Republicans and Democrats .
Some lawmakers are pushing proposals to curb the Fed ’s regulatory powers and open up its interest rate decision to congressional audits .
The Fed worries that congressional second - guessing of its policy decisions would compromise its fiercely - guarded independence .
One poll by Rasmussen Reports this month showed public support for Bernanke ’s nomination at a scant 21 percent , with 41 percent stating opposition , but he continues to enjoy support on Wall Street and among many lawmakers .
“ Ben is the person that kept us from going over the edge of the precipice and into the abyss , ” said former Fed Governor Lyle Gramley , now a senior economic adviser at Soleil Securities .
But Republican Senator Jim Bunning , one of the Fed ’s sharpest critics , said Time ’s pick was a reward for “ failure . ”
“ Many of the problems our markets are facing right now could have been avoided had Chairman Bernanke not been asleep at the switch , ” Bunning said in a statement .

Time credited the 56 - year - old Bernanke with creative leadership that helped set the U.S. economy on a path to recovery even as he and other policy makers remain concerned about a high unemployment rate of 10 percent .
Double - digit unemployment is one reason the Fed , which cut benchmark interest rates to near zero percent a year ago , on Wednesday repeated a vow to keep rates exceptionally low for “ an extended period .
Bernanke “ knows the economy would be much , much worse if the Fed had not taken such extreme measures to stop the panic , ” Time said in its cover story on the central bank head .
The magazine noted he had greatly expanded the Fed ’s power through his efforts to fight the financial crisis .
BERNANKE STEPS INTO LIMELIGHT
Time ’s Person of the Year selection , widely watched in U.S. media , is not meant to be celebratory but rather to focus on a world figure who has been highly influential in the past year .
Still , the distinction is one that analysts said would probably help Bernanke , an expert on the Great Depression who succeeded Alan Greenspan in 2006 .
In picking Bernanke , Time passed over runners - up including House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , who riveted Washington for months with his troop - increase request .
For the first several years of his tenure , Bernanke , known for his low - key , analytical manner , had a much lower profile than Greenspan , who was considered a rock star on Wall Street and was extremely popular with the public during his tenure .
The criticism of the Fed has prompted Bernanke to step into the limelight this year , including granting an interview to the CBS news program “ 60 Minutes ” and appearing at a nationally televised town - hall meeting in Kansas City , Missouri .
Bernanke , a Republican , was first named to the Fed by Republican President George W. Bush .
Obama , a Democrat , nominated him for a second four - year term in August , praising his deft handling of the economic crisis .
The Senate Banking Committee is due to vote on the nomination on Thursday , although the full Senate is not expected to act until sometime next month .
His first term as Fed chief expires on January 31 .
The Fed has not faced the same pitch of public acrimony since the 1980s , when then - chairman Paul Volcker ’s interest - rate increases aimed at breaking double - digit inflation threw the economy into two back - to - back recessions .
Gramley , the former Fed governor who served under Volcker , said he thinks the anger at the central bank may even be greater than it was then .
“ Then the problem was the public did n’t like high interest rates but there was an understanding on the part of the public that we had a terrible inflation problem that had to be defeated , ” he said .
Now , “ the public does n’t understand why ( the Fed ) had to bail out Bear Stearns or AIG ” , Gramley said , referring to insurer American International Group .
Douglas Elliott , a scholar at the Brookings Institution , said there ’s a good chance the tensions over the Fed will wane as the economy begins to improve .
But he said the increasingly tough political atmosphere for the Fed will be watched closely by investors and in countries such as China that have big holdings of government securities and want to see vigilance by U.S. authorities on inflation .
“ We have a huge amount of foreign investment in our government securities as well as private securities , ” Elliott said .
“ Many foreigners are very worried that we ’re going to solve our deficit problems by inflation . ”
The couple 's lovemaking was described as ' unnatural '
A woman who was given an anti-social behaviour order banning her from making loud noises during sex has admitted breaching the order .
Caroline and Steve Cartwright 's love - making was described as " murder " and " unnatural " at Newcastle Crown Court .
Neighbours , the local postman and a woman taking her child to school complained about the noise .
Cartwright , 48 , from Washington on Wearside , pleaded guilty to three counts of breaching the Asbo .
She will be sentenced on 18 January .
At an earlier hearing , next door neighbour Rachel O'Connor told the court she was frequently late for work because she overslept having been awake most of the night because of the noise .
She said : " The noise sounds like they are both in considerable pain .
I cannot describe the noise .
I have never ever heard anything like it . "
Neighbour Rachel O'Connor said the couple sounded like they were in pain
In November , Cartwright appealed against a noise abatement notice imposed in 2007 , as well as the subsequent Asbo , which banned the couple from " shouting , screaming or vocalisation at such a level as to be a statutory nuisance " .
Her bid was rejected by Recorder Jeremy Freedman , who said : " It certainly was intrusive and constituted a statutory nuisance .
" It was clearly of a very disturbing nature and it was also compounded by the duration - this was not a one - off , it went on for hours at a time .
" It is further compounded by the frequency of the episode , virtually every night . "
Sunderland City Council told the court they had recorded noise levels of up to 47 decibels using equipment installed at Cartwright 's neighbour 's house .
World Health Organisation guidelines state that 30 decibels is enough to cause sleep disturbance .

Robert Enke , the Hannover and Germany goalkeeper who was expected to be part of his country 's World Cup squad next summer , has died after being hit by a train close to a level crossing near his home .
Police said on Wednesday that Enke left behind a suicide note , but would not say where the note was found .
Jörg Neblung , a close friend and adviser of Enke , confirmed that the 32 - year - old had killed himself .
" I can confirm that it was suicide , " he said .
" Robert took his own life .
A press conference in Hanover will reveal more details . "
" We are all shocked , " said the national team 's general manager , Oliver Bierhoff , who cancelled today 's planned training session .
" We are lost for words . "
A police statement confirmed that the incident happened in Neustadt - Eilvese and Enke died at the scene .
Hannover 's president , Martin Kind , said the goalkeeper had been " unstable " recently but that it had not been publicly noticed .
" This is a tragedy , " Kind added .
Enke 's car was found near the scene , unlocked , with his wallet on the seat .
The two train drivers reported seeing a man on the tracks and applied the brakes while travelling at about 100 mph but could not stop in time , police reported .
Enke 's daughter Lara died in 2006 of a rare heart condition when she was two and he leaves a wife , Teresa , and an eight - month - old daughter they had adopted .
Germany 's players and staff were informed after training in Bonn .
Enke 's death may bring about the cancellation of Saturday 's friendly against Chile .
Enke had been diagnosed with a bacterial stomach virus several weeks ago and did not play for Hannover for two months , although he reappeared for Sunday 's 2 - 2 draw with Hamburg .
He was not selected for the friendlies against Chile and Ivory Coast next Wednesday although Germany 's coach , Joachim Löw , had said Enke – who won eight caps after making his debut in 2007 , the last of them against Azerbaijan in August – remained the leading candidate to be his No1 in South Africa .
Understudy to Jens Lehmann at Euro 2008 , he was in line to secure the starting place before falling ill and missing the last three qualifiers .
In that time Rene Adler increased his chances of taking the role .
Enke made 196 Bundesliga appearances , also playing for Borussia Mönchengladbach after starting in East Germany with Jena .
He had spells at Tenerife , Fenerbahce , Barcelona and Benfica .
Barcelona had a minute 's silence in his honour before their Copa de Rey match against Cultural Leonesa , while Tenerife paid tribute to their former player .
" Tenerife want to convey their condolences and sympathy following the recent death of the German goalkeeper Robert Enke , " a statement said .
" Tenerife will have a minute 's silence in the next game against Sevilla and will wear black armbands . "
Fans gathered at Hannover 's stadium to lay flowers and light candles at the gates in memory of their captain , who had been with the club since 2004 , while other high profile figures from Enke 's career also paid tribute .
Former Germany captain and coach Franz Beckenbauer said on the DFB 's official website : " I am infinitely sad .
When you receive news like this all other problems pale into insignificance . "
Schalke striker Kevin Kuranyi told Bild newspaper : " This can and must not be true .
Robert was such a great bloke .
I do n't know how I will tell my wife .
She is very good friends with Robert 's wife .
I feel for his family . "
Hamburg captain David Jarolim added : " I can hardly breathe because I 'm so upset .
This is a real tragedy , I can hardly believe it .
First his little daughter dies and then this . "
Alan Moore , the influential comics visionary who wrote Watchmen and V for Vendetta , has taken up a new mission for our age of global depression : Bringing back the underground fanzine .
The first issue of Moore 's print zine Dodgem Logic , released last month in the United Kingdom , is an engaging , educational and often hilarious read .
The new publication is stuffed with subcultural snark as well as post - civilization how - tos on guerrilla gardening , Dumpster diving and surviving the econopocalypse .
Perhaps most promising , Dodgem Logic 's spirit of triumphant creative individualism celebrates Moore 's individualist philosophy , delivering a perfectly timed message for a world filled with failing states and superpowers .
" This might be the time in which big , centralized authorities prove that they are no longer capable of running the show , or even pretending to run the show , " the always eloquent Moore told Wired.com by phone from his home in Northampton , England .
" Increasingly , it is going to be up to us if our culture gets through these next couple of decades in any shape at all . "
Moore recruited local Northampton talent to contribute to his zine , and added selections from artists outside his neighborhood .
Dodgem Logic 's modest sales already have allowed Moore and crew to hand out food parcels to Northampton 's financially depressed elderly and buy the local basketball team cool uniforms .
It 's the type of immediate reward Moore finds lacking in most mainstream cultural and sociopolitical production , and an antidote to the type of pure escapism haunting politics , cinema , celebrity , music and especially comics .
" I have largely , completely given up on the comics industry , " Moore said .
" I really do n't believe it is going to do anything to address the modern world . "
Moore held forth on that graphic letdown and much more , including the rumored opera with Gorillaz ( not happening ) , print media ( not dead yet ) , the perils of post - civilization ( not fun ) and his Pynchonian tome Jerusalem ( not short ) , in our extensive interview below .
Wired.com :
You explain in Dodgem Logic 's first issue that the publication is neither global or local , but lobal .
Alan Moore : Everywhere is both local and also global .
It 's that kind of world .
We 're hooked up in a way we were not hooked up previously .
The world has changed .
Now , we all have an individual neighborhood and locale , but we are also bombarded by information from every other neighborhood and locale in the world .
We 're connected in a different way .
I wanted to deal with what is basically my neighborhood , the area which I was born in , and treat it exactly the same as other people 's neighborhoods .
Yes , the neighborhood I grew up in is still a particularly distressed neighborhood , but there 's one in every town in every country , I 'm sure .
There is a wrong side of the tracks .
Wired.com :
How is it going so far ?
Moore :
Well , one of the best things about Dodgem Logic is that we 've been able to use the sales of the first issue to give out food parcels for Christmas to all of the old people in sheltered housing in that particular neighborhood .
We 're also sponsoring a local basketball team , to get them some really cool , beautifully designed vests to kit them out nicely .
Wired.com : Sounds like a great way to make a local impact .
Moore :
That 's the kind of thing we 're interested in .
We do n't need to make a huge amount of profit on the magazine ; that 's not what we 're looking to do .
We 're looking to make enough to plow it back into our local area , and hopefully if other areas take up the idea , then they can do the same with their own areas .
It 's not particularly sophisticated , but it seems to be working out OK so far .
Wired.com : Starting a print magazine in a global economic depression seems crazy , but it also makes sense to band one 's community together around a set of common artistic and social goals and put them into print .
Moore : Absolutely .
I 'm sure there have been a lot of underground magazines and things like that on the net .
But I think there is much to be said from having an artifact that you can hold in your hands .
That is perhaps a mark of the generation that I grew up in , but I believe it 's true .
In an increasingly virtual world , artifacts , beautifully made things , are at a premium .
We wanted to be able to bring out a magazine that was n't so ephemeral and transient , that people would want to keep .
We enjoyed the idea of having little free gifts with each issue .
We 've got the CD in the first issue , which I was very pleased with .
And we 've got an eight - page mini-comic coming up in the second issue , which is the first comic that I have done completely myself – ever .
So that should have a certain collector 's value , I 'm sure .
And we 're still doing all of this for 2 pounds 50 .
But it 's all working out fine .
As long as we 're not going for ridiculous profits , we can pay all our contributors , put some money back into the community , and have fun while we 're doing it .
It seems to be a reasonable agenda .
Wired.com :
That spirit of fun is certainly there in the first issue .
But there also seems to be a collective purpose in downsizing the kind of hyperconsumption we 've had in the last few decades .
Moore :
Well , yes .
I think there has been a growth in awareness that individuals do have a say in how their lives go .
What we 're interested in doing is empowering people by whatever means we can .
We 've got articles coming up about the squatters movement in Britain .
If you are homeless and there is a vacant property just standing empty , as long as you 're willing to pay rent you have a right to squat on that property .
There are hundreds of people being made homeless every day in this town .
And with the current credit nightmare and financial plunge into the abyss that we 're all going through , it 's becoming particularly difficult for a lot of people .
So we want to address that .
We 've got an excellent article coming up in the second issue by Magpie , Margaret Killjoy , who was formerly an editor for the excellent Steampunk Magazine .
She also helped bring out The Steampunk 's Guide to the Apocalypse , which was very useful .
It included , and I think she designed it herself , a design for a desalination unit based upon a completely new principle , which was effective and easy to put together .
She 's moved on from that to the post - civilization movement , which is arguing that increasingly it is not becoming a matter of if civilization breaks down , it 's becoming a matter of when civilization breaks .
She 's saying that when that happens , we 're probably going to have to do a lot of work to get things going again .
She suggests that perhaps it will be a good idea to start doing this work before civilization has broken down , so that we still have some resources [ laughs ] !
It 's just new ways of thinking about the human situation .
Like the guerrilla gardening column , which suggests ways for people to reclaim the environment around them .
It is being neglected and misused by the people who govern us , who very often have n't got any real concern whether a little grass verge remains a yellowed and neglected strip , or whether it becomes a thriving vegetable garden .
It 's just that there is a certain way they 've always done things , and they 're resistant to change .
But if enough people simply take things into their own hands and do things that are obviously beneficial , then in our current time of crisis I somehow think our leaders are going to have bigger problems on their hands than people growing potatoes or carrots on a motorway roundabout .
On the one hand , we want to give people the kind of information they need in this current climate , and on the other hand we want to cheer them up and entertain them .
Kick their spirits up in this new era .
Wired.com :
What else do you have on tap for the second issue ?
Moore :
We 've got a lead article that Melinda Gebbie is writing about the new burlesque , comparing it with her memories of the old , unreconstructed burlesque that she saw back in San Francisco .
We 've also got Mitch Jenkins , an absolutely marvelous photographer who is world - class but happens to live just around the corner from us , who has done a wonderful photo shoot accompanying Melinda 's article featuring enigmatic , beautiful pictures of strange women in sort of exotic costumes .
Because everybody likes that ; it sort of lifts people 's hearts during these lean times .
Wired.com :
That type of artistry is usually nascent in eras like these , where economic , political and psychological depression is rampant .
Moore :
Well , it has to be always remembered that it was during the '30s that Snow White was released , which I think was at the time the highest - grossing picture in history .
Because no matter if people were starving on bread lines , they wanted to be able to escape from that for an hour or two .
It 's always been that way .
There is a particular line I remember from The Sopranos where I think Tony Soprano says , " There are only two businesses that are recession - proof .
There are certain elements of the entertainment industry , and this thing of ours " [ laughs ] .
I believe that it 's largely the fantastical elements of the entertainment industry that , when people are absolutely sick of this world , they are looking to escape into in their heads .
I 'm not a fan of pure escapism , because that does n't really help us to do with the problems that are besetting us at the moment .
But it does us all a bit of good to have a break from reality just for a while , in a positive way that leaves us refreshed and ready to face to the world again .
The lesson of the legendary Watchmen , says Moore ?
Fix the dystopia yourself .

Wired.com :
How do you think comics should interrogate the post - civilization world , as you see it ?
Moore : I have largely , completely given up on the comics industry .
I really do n't believe it is going to do anything to address the modern world .
Perhaps that 's a very pessimistic view ; there are some great comics out there still .
But for the large part I do n't think the comics industry has got any new ideas .
I do n't think it 's had any new ideas for 20 or 30 years .
Wired.com :
It seems now to be more about the type of pure escapism you mentioned earlier .
Moore :
That 's basically it .
It 's so mannered these days .
There are so few original voices , and it all seems to be stylistically the same stuff .
It 's comfort reading .
People are going to be getting the same stuff every month , and that 's why they like it .
If you go out for a Big Mac , it 's going to taste exactly the way it did last month .
It 's hamburger reading .
I think the comics medium could play a big part in addressing our problems .
It 's such a wonderful medium .
You can talk about anything , and talk about it in a very powerful and informative way .
I 'd like to see comics become a medium in which new ideas could be expressed in new , compelling forms , but I do n't really see that coming from the industry .
Wired.com
Are there particular movements in comics that you still find relevant ?
Moore :
Where comics are starting to score heavily is in the documentary approach .
People are starting to tell coherent stories that are autobiographical or documentary comics dealing with a particular situation .
There has been a heartening surge of those , and they are largely coming from outside the comics industry .
The comics industry , meanwhile , seems to be going down the tubes , as far as I can see .
And it 's largely their own fault , that they did not embrace change heartily enough , that they did n't have any new ideas , that they did n't have a clue .
Wired.com :
It seems like it should be the other way around , given advances in technology and distribution .
Moore : I would like to think that in our present time , not just in comics but in almost every form of the arts , I think that creative expression is within the reach of more people that it ever has been .
Now , that is not to say that there are more people with something to say than there ever have been before .
But I would like to see a situation where people finally got fed up with celebrity culture .
Where people started this great democratic process in the arts where more and more people were just producing individually according to their own wants or needs .
It is possible in this day and age to make very low - budget films , using technology that the pioneers of cinema would have killed for that is relatively cheaply available down at your local electronics store .
The means of making music or art are more in the hands of the people than they ever have been before .
I think it would be great to see an end to the big entertainment companies in whatever industry , whether it be music , cinema or comic books .
I 'd like to see people actually get angry about the quality of the material that they are having shoved down their throats .
It ca n't be good for us .
And I would like to see people responding to that by basically following the old maxim that if you want a job done right you do it yourself .
And this could not apply only to the arts but also politics .
In the 21st century , if you see some situation you are not happy with , it 's probably not the best idea to vote for somebody who tells you that they are going to do something about that situation if elected , because frankly they 're not .
Historically , they never do .
If there is something that genuinely upsets you , do n't vote for somebody who tells you that they are going to fix it .
Try and fix it yourself ; that 's the only way it is going to get fixed .
And it does n't matter if it's on the other side of the world .
This , I think , is the face of politics in the 21st century .
And the face of art , and probably of spirituality and everything :
It is down to the individual .
If individuals do not like the world that we happen to be living in – and who could blame them ?
– then I suggest it is up to them to change it .
Wired.com :
That message resonates throughout much of your work .
Moore :
It was the message of V for Vendetta , and in fact most of my comic books from those early days .
I think Watchmen ended with the line , " I leave it entirely in your hands , " which is pretty much the way I feel about it .
I think that this might be the time in which big , centralized authorities prove that they are no longer capable of running the show , or even pretending to run the show .
Increasingly , it is going to be up to us if our culture gets through these next couple of decades in any shape at all .
It is going to be down to us .
Wired.com : Dodgem Logic is that theory put into practice .
Moore : Yes .
On a simple level , I distinctly missed the underground magazines of the '60s and ' 70s .
I thought that it was a pity that there was n't anything like that around today .
And then I found myself in a position where it occurred to me that I should just do one .
So we put it together according to basic hippie , anarchist principles , where we just asked a load of friends , whether that was people we happened to know locally or more famous people we knew professionally , to contribute .
And the response has been fantastic .
We 've got Damon Albarn 's Gorillaz doing something in issue three , I think .
Wired.com : Right .
You were writing an opera or something with them , were n't you ?
Moore :
Well , that is a bit premature .
We were having talks , but it was much too early to be talking about it .
It got onto a website and then it went all over the place and got incredibly inflated .
There 's a possibility of us working together on a project , but it would n't be for a long , long time .
But they are hopefully going to be doing something for Dodgem Logic 's third issue .
And we 've got some other fine people lined up for the future .
Wired.com :
It sounds like you are going with the flow .
Moore :
It is being done on this very haphazard basis , which I suppose is the meaning of the title Dodgem Logic .
You know , I was never sure exactly what that title meant , when I first came up with it in 1975 , when I was first attempting to get a fanzine off the ground at the age of 22 or 23 .
It never happened back then , but I 've still got the title , although I 'm still not entirely sure what it means .
But it does sound good , and it could mean a number of things .
Perhaps a random approach to thinking , recognizing that although rationality is a marvelous tool , it has its limits .
Sometimes intuition can yield equally powerful and impressive results .
But the title suggests having fun .
I believe in America they call them " bumper cars ? "
Wired.com : Yeah , exactly .
Moore :
Well , over here , they 're called " dodgem cars , " but it 's the same principle .
It suggests lots of colored vehicles bumping around chaotically , everybody having fun and nobody getting hurt , with the faint smell of carbonized ions in the air .
So while I 'm still not entirely sure what the title means , it feels more appropriate with each passing day .
Wired.com :
Now that the Gorillaz rumor has been put to bed , would you like to let us know what else you 're up to next ?
Moore :
In the real world ?
Well , I 've just finished writing the third part of book three of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , which takes place in 2009 .
And I 'm just looking at Kevin O'Neill 's artowrk for the second part , which takes place in 1969 , and I 'm very pleased with that .
It 's just marvelous ; I 'm very pleased with that .
You 're going to have to wait awhile before you see it , but it will be very worth the wait .
When I get a break from doing the next issue of Dodgem Logic , including the eight - page strip , then I will be catching back up to my Bumper Book of Magic , which will be coming out from Top Shelf when we get it finished .
But it 's looking very good so far .
I 'm working on that with Steve Moore , and we 're trying to make it a comprehensive guide to magic 's history , theory and practice in language that is clear and not ridiculously Gothic .
Then , once I 've caught up on that , I should be getting back to finishing the last nine chapters of my second novel , Jerusalem .
I 'm still finishing it ; at the moment , I 'm paused on Chapter 26 .
I 'm hoping to get back to that sometime in spring .
After that , I 'll get into the rewriting and revising , and drawing the front cover , which I am determined to do .
That will take a while and in fact , it 's taken me quite a few years to write it .
Then again , it will probably take everyone a few years to read it .
So it 's fair [ laughs ] .
Wired.com :
That 's fair indeed .
At 35 chapters , it sounds like a tome along the lines of Thomas Pynchon 's Gravity 's Rainbow , which took me a few years to fully read .
Moore : I got through that in a month .
Normally , I get through books in a day or two , but that was the densest thing I have ever read .
And also I decoded the scrap of newspaper that is blowing down the street in the last couple of pages , which is actually , as far as I can see , the whole point of the novel .
And if you missed that , you perhaps missed the whole point of the novel [ laughs ] .
It 's just this bit of burnt paper that , if you put it together , talks about America dropping the atom bomb on Hiroshima .
Which is of course , the end of the V bomb , which has been made obsolete .
Gravity 's got a new rainbow .

By George Friedman
We are now at the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the beginning of the collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe .
We are also nearing the 18th anniversary of the fall of the Soviet Union itself .
This is more than simply a moment for reflection — it is a moment to consider the current state of the region and of Russia versus that whose passing we are now commemorating .
To do that , we must re-examine why the Soviet empire collapsed , and the current status of the same forces that caused that collapse .
Russia 's Two - Part Foundation
The Russian empire — both the Czarist and Communist versions — was a vast , multinational entity .
At its greatest extent , it stretched into the heart of Central Europe ; at other times , it was smaller .
But it was always an empire whose constituent parts were diverse , hostile to each other and restless .
Two things tied the empire together .
One was economic backwardness .
Economic backwardness gave the constituent parts a single common characteristic and interest .
None of them could effectively compete with the more dynamic economies of Western Europe and the rest of the world , but each could find a niche within the empire .
Economic interests thus bound each part to the rest :
They needed a wall to protect themselves from Western interests , and an arena in which their own economic interests , however stunted , could be protected .
The empire provided that space and that opportunity .
The second thing tying the empire together was the power of the security apparatus .
Where economic interest was insufficient to hold the constituent parts together , the apparatus held the structure together .
In a vast empire with poor transportation and communication , the security apparatus — from Czarist times to the Soviet period — was the single unifying institution .
It unified in the sense that it could compel what economic interest could n't motivate .
The most sophisticated part of the Russian state was the security services .
They were provided with the resources they needed to control the empire , report status to the center and impose the center 's decisions through terror , or more frequently , through the mere knowledge that terror would be the consequence of disobedience .
It was therefore no surprise that it was the security apparatus of the Soviet Union — the KGB under Yuri Andropov — which first recognized in the early 1980s that the Soviet Union 's economy not only was slipping further and further behind the West , but that its internal cohesion was threatened because the economy was performing so poorly that the minimal needs of the constituent parts were no longer being fulfilled .
In Andropov 's mind , the imposition of even greater terror , like Josef Stalin had applied , would not solve the underlying problem .
Thus , the two elements holding the Soviet Union together were no longer working .
The self - enclosed economy was failing and the security apparatus could not hold the system together .
It is vital to remember that in Russia , domestic economic health and national power do not go hand in hand .
Russia historically has had a dysfunctional economy .
By contrast , its military power has always been disproportionately strong .
During World War II , the Soviets crushed the Wehrmacht in spite of their extraordinary economic weakness .
Later , during the Cold War , they challenged and sometimes even beat the United States despite an incomparably weaker economy .
The Russian security apparatus made this possible .
Russia could devote far more of its economy to military power than other countries could because Moscow could control its population successfully .
It could impose far greater austerities than other countries could .
Therefore , Russia was a major power in spite of its economic weakness .
And this gave it room to maneuver in an unexpected way .
Andropov's Gamble
Andropov proposed a strategy he knew was risky , but which he saw as unavoidable .
One element involved a dramatic restructuring of the Soviet economy and society to enhance efficiency .
The second involved increased openness , not just domestically to facilitate innovation , but also in foreign affairs .
Enclosure was no longer working : The Soviet Union needed foreign capital and investment to make restructuring work .
Andropov knew that the West , and particularly the United States , would not provide help so long as the Soviet Union threatened its geopolitical interests even if doing so would be economically profitable .
For this opening to the West to work , the Soviet Union needed to reduce Cold War tensions dramatically .
In effect , the Soviets needed to trade geopolitical interests to secure their economic interests .
Since securing economic interests was essential for Communist Party survival , Andropov was proposing to follow the lead of Vladimir Lenin , another leader who sacrificed space for time .
In the Brest - Litovsk Treaty that ended Russian participation in World War I , Lenin had conceded vast amounts of territory to Germany to buy time for the regime to consolidate itself .
Andropov was suggesting the same thing .
It is essential to understand that Andropov was a Party man and a Chekist — a Communist and KGBer — through and through .
He was not proposing the dismantling of the Party ; rather , he sought to preserve the Party by executing a strategic retreat on the geopolitical front while the Soviet Union regained its economic balance .
Undoubtedly he understood the risk that restructuring and openness would create enormous pressures at a time of economic hardship , possibly causing regime collapse under the strain .
Andropov clearly thought the risk was worth running .
After Leonid Brezhnev died , Andropov took his place .
He became ill almost immediately and died .
He was replaced by Konstantin Chernenko , who died within a year .
Then came Mikhail Gorbachev — the true heir to Andropov 's thinking — who implemented Andropov 's two principles .
He pursued openness , or glasnost .
He also pursued restructuring , or perestroika .
He traded geopolitical interests , hard - won by the Red Army , for economic benefits .
Contrary to his reputation in the West , Gorbachev was no liberal .
He actually sought to preserve the Communist Party , and was prepared to restructure and open the system to do so .
As the security apparatus loosened its grip to facilitate openness and restructuring , the empire 's underlying tensions quickly went on display .
When unrest in East Germany threatened to undermine Soviet control , Gorbachev had to make a strategic decision .
If he used military force to suppress the uprising , probably restructuring and certainly openness would be dead , and the crisis Andropov foresaw would be upon him .
Following Lenin 's principle , Gorbachev decided to trade space for time , and he accepted retreat from East Germany to maintain and strengthen his economic relations with the West .
After Gorbachev made that decision , the rest followed .
If Germany were not to be defended , what would be defended ?
Applying his strategy rigorously , Gorbachev allowed the unwinding of the Eastern European empire without intervention .
The decision he had made about Germany amounted to relinquishing most of Moscow 's World War II gains .
But if regime survival required it , the price had to be paid .
The Crisis
The crisis came very simply .
The degree of restructuring required to prevent the Soviet Union 's constituent republics from having an overarching interest in economic relations with the West rather than with Russia was enormous .
There was no way to achieve it quickly .
Given that the Soviet Union now had an official policy of ending its self - imposed enclosure , the apparent advantages to the constituent parts of protecting their economies from Western competition declined — and with them , the rationale for the Soviet Union .
The security apparatus , the KGB , had been the engine driving glasnost and perestroika from the beginning ; the advocates of the plan were not going to shift into reverse and suppress glasnost .
But glasnost overwhelmed the system .
The Soviet Union , unable to buy the time it needed to protect the Party , imploded .
It broke apart into its constituent republics , and even parts of the Russian Federation seemed likely to break away .
What followed was liberalization only in the eyes of Westerners .
It is easy to confuse liberalism with collapse , since both provide openness .
But the former Soviet Union ( FSU ) was n't liberalizing , it was collapsing in every sense .
What remained administratively was the KGB , now without a mission .
The KGB was the most sophisticated part of the Soviet apparatus , and its members were the best and brightest .
As privatization went into action , absent clear rules or principles , KGB members had the knowledge and sophistication to take advantage of it .
As individuals and in factions , they built structures and relationships to take advantage of privatization , forming the factions that dominated the FSU throughout the 1990s until today .
It is not reasonable to refer to organized crime in Russia , because Russia was lawless .
In fact , the law enforcement apparatus was at the forefront of exploiting the chaos .
Organized crime , business and the KGB became interconnected , and frequently identical .
The 1990s were a catastrophic period for most Russians .
The economy collapsed .
Property was appropriated in a systematic looting of all of the former Russian republics , with Western interests also rushing in to do quick deals on tremendously favorable terms .
The new economic interests crossed the new national borders .
( It is important to bear in mind that the boundaries that had separated Soviet republics were very real . )
The financial cartels , named for the oligarchs who putatively controlled them ( control was much more complex ; many oligarchs were front men for more powerful and discreet figures ) , spread beyond the borders of the countries in which they originated , although the Russian cartels spread the most effectively .
Had the West — more specifically the United States — wanted to finish Russia off , this was the time .
Russia had no effective government , poverty was extraordinary , the army was broken and the KGB was in a civil war over property .
Very little pressure could well have finished off the Russian Federation .
The Bush and Clinton administrations made a strategic decision to treat Russia as the successor regime of the FSU , however , and refused to destabilize it further .
Washington played an aggressive role in expanding NATO , but it did not try to break up the Russian Federation for several reasons .
First , it feared nuclear weapons would fall into the hands of dangerous factions .
Second , it did not imagine that Russia could ever be a viable country again .
And third , it believed that if Russia did become viable , it would be a liberal democracy .
( The idea that liberal democracies never threaten other liberal democracies was implanted in American minds . )
What later became known as a neoconservative doctrine actually lay at the heart of the Clinton administration 's thinking .
Russia Regroups — and Faces the Same Crisis
Russia 's heart was the security apparatus .
Whether holding it together or tearing it apart , the KGB — renamed the FSB after the Soviet collapse — remained the single viable part of the Russian state .
It was therefore logical that when it became essential to end the chaos , the FSB would be the one to end it .
Vladimir Putin , whom the KGB trained during Andropov 's tenure and who participated in the privatization frenzy in St. Petersburg , emerged as the force to recentralize Russia .
The FSB realized that the Russian Federation itself faced collapse , and that excessive power had fallen out of its hands as FSB operatives had fought one another during the period of privatization .
Putin sought to restore the center in two ways .
First , he worked to restore the central apparatus of the state .
Second , he worked to strip power from oligarchs unaligned with the apparatus .
It was a slow process , requiring infinite care so that the FSB not start tearing itself apart again , but Putin is a patient and careful man .
Putin realized that Andropov 's gamble had failed catastrophically .
He also knew that the process could not simply be reversed ; there was no going back to the Soviet Union .
At the same time , it was possible to go back to the basic principles of the Soviet Union .
First , there could be a union of the region , bound together by both economic weakness and the advantage of natural resource collaboration .
Second , there was the reality of a transnational intelligence apparatus that could both stabilize the region and create the infrastructure for military power .
And third , there was the reversal of the policy of trading geopolitical interests for financial benefits from the West .
Putin's view — and the average Russian 's view — was that the financial benefits of the West were more harmful than beneficial .
By 2008 , when Russia defeated America 's ally , Georgia , in a war , the process of reassertion was well under way .
Then , the financial crisis struck along with fluctuations in energy prices .
The disparity between Russia 's politico - military aspirations , its military capability and its economic structure re-emerged .
The Russians once again faced their classic situation :
If they abandoned geopolitical interests , they would be physically at risk .
But if they pursued their geopolitical interests , they would need a military force capable of assuming the task .
Expanding the military would make the public unhappy as it would see resources diverted from public consumption to military production , and this could only be managed by increasing the power of the state and the security apparatus to manage the unhappiness .
But this still left the risk of a massive divergence between military and economic power that could not be bridged by repression .
This risk re-created the situation that emerged in the 1970s , had to be dealt with in the 1980s and turned into chaos in the 1990s .
The current decisions the Russians face can only be understood in the context of events that transpired 20 years ago .
The same issues are being played out , and the generation that now governs Russia was forged in that crucible .
The Russian leadership is trying to balance the possible outcomes to find a solution .
They cannot trade national security for promised economic benefits that may not materialize or may not be usable .
And they cannot simply use the security apparatus to manage increased military spending — there are limits to that .
As a generation ago , Russia is caught between the things that it must do to survive in the short run and the things it cannot do if they are to survive in the long run .
There is no permanent solution for Russia , and that is what makes it such an unpredictable player in the international system .
The closest Russia has come to a stable solution to its strategic problem was under Ivan the Terrible and Stalin , and even those could not hold for more than a generation .
The West must understand that Russia is never at peace with itself internally , and is therefore constantly shifting its external relationships in an endless , spasmodic cycle .
Things go along for awhile , and then suddenly change .
We saw a massive change 20 years ago , but the forces that generated that change had built up quietly in the generation before .
The generation since has been trying to pull the pieces back together .
But in Russia , every solution is merely the preface to the next problem — something built into the Russian reality .
TRENTON -- Legislation to allow same - sex marriage in New Jersey cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee tonight after more than seven hours of emotional debate and testimony , setting the stage for a showdown in the full Senate .
Cheers erupted in the packed hearing room when the committee approved the bill 7 to 6 .
The 10:06 p.m. vote came after more than 1,000 people flooded the Statehouse today in an effort to sway lawmakers ’ opinions on one of the most controversial bills of the decade .
" The marriage equality movement in America starts again here , right here , " Steven Goldstein , chair of the gay rights advocacy group Garden State Equality , said after the vote .
During the marathon hearing , opponents — including Orthodox Jews and Catholic officials — argued that same - sex marriage would damage religious freedom and is not needed because the state already permits civil unions .
Supporters -- including civil rights leaders and legal experts -- said gay couples do not have equal rights without being allowed to marry .
" Like race , our sexuality is n’t a preference , " said Julian Bond , chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , who traveled from Washington , D.C. , to testify .
" It ’s immutable , unchangeable and the Constitution protects us all from discrimination . "
Senate committee hears emotional testimony on same - sex marriage bill
Weinberg said lawmakers should not base their votes on religious texts .
" We are a country governed by laws that ensure equality and fairness for every individual , " she said .
Pat Branigan of the New Jersey Catholic Conference said it ’s the state ’s responsibility to enforce the civil union statute , enacted in 2006 , and investigate whether any " unfounded allegations " of discrimination against gay couples are true .
" The state of New Jersey should educate the public and should enforce state laws that provide protection for same sex " couples , Branigan said .
Same - sex marriage advocates have mounted a last - ditch effort before Gov.-elect Chris Christie , who opposes the measure , takes office .
Sen. Gerald Cardinale ( R - Bergen ) , who opposes the bill , said if Corzine signs it before leaving office , he " would be turning a deaf ear to the voice of the electorate . "
If the measure is enacted , New Jersey would be the sixth state to allow gay marriage .
Residents in 31 states , most recently Maine , have rejected same - sex marriage in referendum votes .
In 2006 , the state Supreme Court ruled that committed same - sex couples deserve the same rights and obligations as married people .
Lawmakers legalized civil unions later that year , and gay rights organizations continued their push for same - sex marriage .
The New Jersey State Bar Association , the state ’s largest lawyers organization , has said civil unions were " second - class legal status " for gay couples .

Americans are stressed out .
No surprise there , I suppose .
The question is , what are we doing about it ?
The answer , according to a new survey from the American Psychological Association , is not enough .
Fewer people are utilizing stress - management techniques to cope with their burdens , according to the annual survey released yesterday .
Among the techniques asked about — from exercising to reading , praying or shopping — nearly all were being used less in this year ’s survey compared with 2008 .

Synthetic vitamins and loads of sugar
Eat more sugar as a defense against swine flu ?
Nutritional illiteracy remains widespread
( Natural News )
The world of bizarre nutritional claims by sugary cereal makers just got a little more weird this week when Kellogg 's began shipping boxes ofemblazoned with the ridiculous claim , " Now helps support your child 's IMMUNITY .
" If processed white sugar , partially - hydrogenated trans fat oils and synthetic chemical vitamins could enhance human immunity , Kellogg 's would be King of the Hill , but in reality , of all the many foods for boosting human immune function , somehow is n't even on the list .
In fact , you might say that Kellogg 's claim of boosting immunity with a sugary cereal sprayed with synthetic vitamins is one of the most hilarious claims yet floated by a cereal company , but what 's definitely not funny is the fact that the FDA openly allows this deceptive , fraudulent food labeling to continue even while threatening , arresting or prosecuting nutritional supplement companies that make similar but true claims .
For example , it 's illegal in America to claim that ( even though it does ) , but it 's perfectly allowable for Kellogg 's to claim their sugared - up Cocoa Krispies boosts immunity ( even though it does n't ) .
What 's wrong with this picture ?
Why does n't the FDA ( or the FTC ) send threatening letters to the CEO of Kellogg 's , threatening them with arrest and prosecution while confiscating Kellogg 's cereal inventory for " misleading labeling ? "
This is exactly what the FDA would do if the product in question were an herb or a bottle of vitamins .
Somehow , Kellogg 's gets away with outright labeling fraud while regulators twiddle their thumbs and pretend to be doing their jobs .
By the way , you might be curious why Kellogg 's thinks they can make such a claim on a box of Cocoa Krispies .
The front of the box loudly proclaims " 25 % daily value of antioxidants & nutrients , vitamins A , B , C & E . "
This , apparently , is the basis for their claim .
Except they are n't using actual food - based vitamins A , B , C and E. Instead , they 're using synthetic , artificial chemicals that have been given the names " Vitamin B12 " or " Vitamin C " and so on .
These are n't holistic vitamins like the ones found in nature .
They 're synthetic , sprayed - on nutrients concocted in a chemical factory somewhere .
To even call them vitamins is an insult to real vitamins found in real food .
Cocoa Krispies is n't even real food , if you ask me .
It 's a nutrient - deficient , highly - processed , sugar - laden source of empty calories .
To claim it " supports IMMUNITY " is so far - fetched that you 'd have to be living in some alternate universe to even think about believing it .
As one person quoted in USA Today said about this , if Kellogg 's can claim their vitamin - sprayed sugared - up puffed rice boosts immune function , then you could spray synthetic vitamins on a pile of leaves and make the same immune boosting claims about them , too !
Highly - processed sugary cereals are not medicine .
They do not enhance or increase human immune function .
If anything , the high acidity of the sugar used in the product causes the body to become more acidic , which suppresses immune function .
I 'm willing to bet that if you take a hundred people with the healthiest immune systems in the world , It 's clear that this package claim by Kellogg 's is aimed at all the flu- conscious parents who are worried that little Johnny might get infected and die from swine flu if he does n't get his vaccine shot and eat his Cocoa Krispies .
Then again , if Cocoa Krispies can boost immune function , we do kids need vaccines at all ?
The H1N1 vaccine itself , by the way , is just as ridiculous as this Cocoa Krispies claim .
Neither one offers any real protection against the flu , but both are being hyped up as strong solutions .
Maybe they should give away a free box of Cocoa Krispies with every swine flu shot just to double up on the protection , huh ?
For years , the FDA has betrayed the American people by allowing ridiculous health claims on the packages of processed dead foods that have been chemically augmented with synthetic vitamins .
Meanwhile , like broccoli , blueberries and citrus fruits are n't allowed to make any health claims whatsoever .
Is it any wonder that America has so many sick people ?
Most of the information presented to consumers at the grocery store isJunk food is good for you !
Living foods are dangerous !
Raw milk might kill you , but drink this pasteurized homogenized processed milk because it builds strong bones !
Here , buy this " Smart Choices " processed food , it 's healthy !.
It 's like in the moviewhere the population is convinced that water is " for toilets " and that only sports drinks beverages are safe for human hydration needs .
It also makes you wonder about the intelligence of the consuming population :
Are there really moms out there who think that buying Cocoa Krispies will boost their childrens ' immune function ?
If so , we do n't merely have a problem with misleading food labeling in America today ; we have a problem withAnd it 's caused in part by the fact that our kids can't learn well in school these days because they 're being fed processed , sugary junk foods like Cocoa Krispies for breakfast .

The Obama ’s administration ’s decision to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other alleged 9/11 plotters in New York City has sparked a great number of heated expressions of offense from Republicans — and may now have landed President Obama in legal hot water .
Obama defended his decision on Wednesday by telling MSNBC ’s Chuck Todd , “ I do n’t think it will be offensive at all when he ’s convicted and when the death penalty is applied to him . ”
When Todd expressed surprise at the remark , Obama hastily corrected himself , insisting , “ What I said was people will not be offended if that ’s the outcome .
I ’m not pre-judging it . ”

Constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley chuckled over Obama ’s predicament on MSNBC ’s Countdown , telling substitute host Lawrence O’Donnell , “ He certainly came across as the Queen of Hearts , calling for a sentence first and a verdict later . ”
“ He knows that ’s a problem , ” Turley went on , more seriously .
“ The great irony is that in defending this noble decision of his to give a fair trial to these men , he then crossed the line and is likely to be cited by the feds that it ’s not quite so fair . ”
The Obama administration has been fairly cavalier so far in brushing off the possibility that any of the defendants might be found innocent .
According to Attorney General Eric Holder , “ ” I would not have authorized the bringing of these prosecutions unless I thought that the outcome — in the outcome we would ultimately be successful . ”
Last summer , however , press secretary Robert Gibbs responded to a question about a possible not - guilty verdict in a non-9/11 terrorism trial by saying , “ We will talk about what happens about a verdict when a verdict comes . ”
A few weeks later , an administration representative announced that the US might continue to hold terrorism detainees who posed a “ threat ” indefinitely , even if they were found non -guilty .
O’Donnell went on to note that some Republicans seem to be overly eager not to offend al Qaeda in any way that could goad them to retaliate .
“ If Republicans really want to do whatever will be the least offensive approach … why not just set Khalid Sheikh Mohammed free ? ” he asked sarcastically .

“ I find that the most amazing line of rhetoric , ” Turley laughed .
“ If you really want to make al Qaeda mad , then do n’t be a hypocrite . …
Show that we brought one of their members to the rule of law and applied it fairly . ”
Turley also contrasted current Republican outrage with President John Adams ’ pride in having provided the legal defense for British soldiers who had killed American rioters in the Boston Massacre of 1770 .
“ It makes you wonder , when you listen to these critics , whether we were n’t a better people when we had less power but more principles , ” Turley concluded .

New research results show the controversial plastics additive bisphenol A , or BPA , is commonly found in a wide range of canned foods , including some marked " BPA free " or organic .
" The findings are noteworthy because they indicate the extent of potential exposure , " said Urvashi Rangan at Consumers Union , which publishes Consumer Reports and released the results yesterday .
The survey examined 19 packaged foods and found the highest BPA levels in soups and green beans .
BPA was found at levels ranging from traces to 32 parts per billion .
Furthermore , the group found that some nonmetal containers -- including plastic containers or bags -- also contained BPA .
BPA is a high - protein industrial chemical that has been used for decades to make polycarbonate plastics and the epoxy linings of tin cans .
It is commonly used because of its durability and ability to withstand high temperatures .
Public health groups have raised concern in recent years because BPA mimics estrogen and has been shown to cause developmental problems and precancerous growth in animals .
Consumers Union pointed to several animal studies showing adverse effects at exposures of 2.4 micrograms of BPA per kilogram of body weight per day , so its scientists are recommending that daily exposure to BPA be limited to one - thousandth of that level , or 0.0024 micrograms per kilogram of body weight , significantly lower than FDA 's current safety limit of 50 micrograms .
The group has called on the Food and Drug Administration to ban BPA in materials that come in contact with food .
FDA has said it is reviewing scientific data about BPA and plans to make a final decision about the chemical 's safety by the end of this month .
Industry groups dispute that people are exposed to levels of BPA that could cause harm .
A recent rodent study by U.S. EPA found that low dose exposure to the chemical did not result in significant reproductive or behavioral changes .

Or so claims none other than bailout abuser extraordinaire , the International Monetary Fund .
As the TimesOnline reports : " Dominique Strauss - Kahn told the CBI annual conference of business leaders that another huge call on public finances by the financial services sector would not be tolerated by the “ man in the street ” and could even threaten democracy . "
Yet the man on the street is oddly mesmerized by recurring appearance of solemn - looking political leaders on their daily TV jaunt , so perhaps Mr. Strauss - Khan is unfortunately overestimating the ordinary citizen 's attention span or interest in anything more than being able to procure the latest 50 inch plasma TV at sub $ 500 .
Or the fact that instead of a formal " Second " bailout ( which will still undoubtedly occur " when needed " courtesy of trillions and trillions of new pieces of still unprinted paper , the Obama 's latest plan is to have rolling bailouts / stimuli / Cash for Cxxx / dollar plunge enforcement sorties from now until Wall Street bonuses are paid for the 2009 and potentially 2010 calendar year .
After all , someone from 85 Broad has to confirm daily that the economic policies are certainly working , contrary to what every Tom , Dick and Harry is seeing after a 5 minute walk on any given street .
More observations from the IMF head :
" Most advanced economies will not accept any more [ bailouts ] ...
The political reaction will be very strong , putting some democracies at risk , " he told delegates .
" I do believe that the financial sector needs to contribute both to the costs of the financial crisis and to reduce recourse to public funds in the future , " he said .
Mr Strauss - Kahn said that imposing high capital ratio requirements on banks was one price the financial services sector must pay to prevent the threat of further multi-billion dollar bailouts .
He pointed to the debate in the US over the Troubled Asset Relief Programme and said that in many countries , including France and Germany , he doubted that politicians would secure the mandate needed to secure any further bail - outs if banks got in to trouble again , in several years ' time .
Europe is in dispute over the spiralling cost of the global economic bailout , with Germany and France calling for a reduction in state support as their economies have shown signs of an upturn .
Little does anyone care that the only reason these economies are " upticking " is courtesy of a sympathetic movement in stock markets that mimic what the flailing dollar is doing to US stocks .
That , and roughly 5 % of world GDP being redirected to promote various one - time stimuli .
In tried and true chatterbox fashion Dominique warns about the dangers of an incipient bubble even as he advocates " exiting later rather than earlier . "
Mega bubble 2.0 - here we come .
Mr Strauss - Kahn said that while the global economy had made " remarkable " progress in exiting recession , and was on the cusp of recovery , it remained " highly vulnerable " to shocks .
He said state support for the world 's battered economies must remain in place if a smooth recovery is to be achieved .
" We recommend erring on the side of caution as exiting too early is costlier than exiting too late . "
Mr Strauss - Kahn is one of a series of high - profile speakers at the CBI conference , in Central London .
Gordon Brown , David Cameron and Nick Clegg will all speak at the event as they seek to sway influential business leaders before a general election next year .
In his speech , Mr Strauss - Kahn also warned that the huge amounts of capital being pumped into China could fuel a pan-Asian bubble .
And US consumers - relax , you do n't have to do what CNBC is telling you and max out all your credit cards ( just to make JPM a nickel and dime here and there ) : you have now been demoted to a second grade economic factor :
Mr Strauss - Khan said that the old paradigm of growth generation based on households in the US was dead .
The future sources of growth and the recovery will " depend on a new balance between the US and deficit countries on one hand and emerging markets and surplus countries on the other " .
Good luck with that if China indeed , as Albert Edward contends , truly ends up devaluing its currency .
A WOMAN suffers from a mysterious disorder which turns her into a sex addict - when she is asleep .
Belle Floor is a Sexsomniac - meaning she engages in sexual acts while she is sleeping - and cannot remember anything the next day .
Her condition means she is too afraid to let boyfriends stay over in case she embarrasses herself at night .
Ms Floor , 32 , from Almelo , Holland , set up her own support website six years ago after doctors failed to work out what was wrong with the pretty blonde .
The condition , which causes her to touch herself intimately , is so rare that at first she struggled to convince anyone she had no control over it .
Her ex-boyfriend Justin , 47 , a construction worker , could not accept it was happening without her knowledge and eventually it caused them to separate .
Ms Floor said : " He never really believed I had no control over it and took it as a slur on his sexual prowess .
" I 've been on a few dates since but I have n't had men stay over with me , because I do n't want to get serious with them . "
Ms Floor first discovered her disturbing disorder in 1999 when Justin confronted her .
The softly spoken school administrator said : " Out of the blue one evening he asked me why I played with myself at night .
" I denied it because I could n't remember ever doing it . "
Ms Floor went to a series of doctors and psychologists , who told her there was nothing they could do as they had never heard of anyone with a similar condition .
Doctors offered her medication , and she also tried hypnotherapy , sex counselling and an EEG brain scan in an attempt to stop the sexsomnia incidents .
Muscle relaxant drugs helped for a while but she did not want to spend the rest of her life on medication .
Ms Floor has since found solace by speaking to other sufferers online and she set up her own website offering advice and support .
She said : " Knowing I was n't alone was a huge relief and speaking to others has brought me enormous comfort .
" There are no official figures on how many people suffer from sexsomnia but I 've spoken to hundreds of men and women from all walks of life with the same condition . "
She said : " I now have my self - confidence and self esteem back .
I have great friends , a great job and I really enjoy my life . "

In an age of nuclear bombs , the human race will not be safe until we abolish these states ( especially the big , imperial , ones such as those of North America , Western Europe , and Japan ) and replace them with a federation of self - managing associations of working people .
After 3 months of consulations and deliberation , President Obama has announced that he is going to do what he had promised to do during his campaign for presidentnamely to expand the US attack on Afghanistan and Pakistan .
This may not have been inevitable ( since he broke many of his campaign promises already , such as ending overseas prisons , openness in government , ending dont ask , dont tell ,  a health care plan which covers everyone , an economic plan for working people , etc. ) .
But it was probable .
As has been pointed out , his stated reasons for the war do not make much sense : in order to get out of Afghanistan , the US will send more troops into Afghanistan .
The US needs to fight Al Queda , even though there are now only about 100 Queda militants left in Afghanistan ; the Queda base is mostly in Pakistan ( which Obama slurred over by speaking of  the border ) but the US will not be sending troops there ( just secret attacks by drone missiles and CIA operatives ) .
More generally , the US supposedly has to strengthen the resolve of the government of Pakistan by sending more troops to Afghanistan .
The US hopes to win over the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan by sending more non-Muslim , only - English - speaking , troops , which is sure to antagonize the people of the region .
In 18 months , the US forces are supposed to transform the Karzai regime from one of the most corrupt , incompetent , and illegitimate states on earth , to a stable government ( never mind a democracy ) .
The effects of the mistaken US policies of 8 years can be reversed in 18 months ( on the assumption that US forces will really start to withdraw in 18 months ; promises are cheap ; the US is still in Iraq ) .
All of this is simply unbelievable and it is hard to think that an intelligent man such as Obama believes any of it .
Why then , really , is the US sending more troops into the region ?
Closer to Obamas thinking are the expressions in his December 1 , West Point , address , when he announced his program , where he spoke about the US as a global power with an economy which competes on the world market .
Thus he remarked that competition within the global economy has grown more fierce .
Our prosperity will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the past .
Implicit in these statements is an awareness that the US is no longer the economic power it was in the past .
While still having the largest national economy , the US is now a de-industrializing debtor nation , losing out in world competition to Europe and Asia .
This has been made worse by the global Great Recession , which has exposed the decay of the whole international capitalist system .
The US ruling class , its layer of rich people , is not happy about this .
So they turn to the one asset they still have , which is the mighty military force of the US state more powerful than any potential combination of opponent states .
By throwing its weight around , the US hopes to re-achieve world dominance , or at least to slow its decline in world power .
Obama reminded his listeners that the US has long been the dominant world power .
 Our country has borne a special burden in global affairs .
More than any other nation , the United States of America has underwritten global security for six decades 
This is modified by the hypocritical words ,
But unlike the great powers of old , we have not sough world domination . 
He can say this because the US has not ruled through open ownership of colonies ( leaving aside Puerto Rico and a few other places ) but by economically dominating the world market , so that all must buy and sell on the US  terms ( neocolonialism ) .
But whenever necessary ,  this has been backed up by military force , as shown in two imperialist world wars and a large number of invasions of smaller , weaker , nations .
Therefore it cannot accept being kicked in the teeth by small groups of terrorists living in caves , nor let petty dictatorships thumb their noses at the US .
Nor can they afford to let regions which dominate the world petroleum supply fall into chaos , or at least outside of US rule , given the centrality of oil for the capitalist industrial economy .
This includes both the Middle East and Northwest Asia ( which may have important oil pipelines go through it ) .
Irrational behavior will result from being in situations which cannot be rationally dealt with .
The US ruling class must try to dominate the world , economically and therefore politically and militarily , due to world competition .
But it cannot dominate the world and is losing out in international competition .
It must try to control the oppressed nations of Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan , but it cannot control them .
The result is a contradictory and irrational foreign policy .
This was apparent under the stupid George W. Bush , with his ideologically fanatic advisors .
It is still obvious under the intelligent and reasonable Barack Obama .
The result is likely to be disasterous ( as it was in the Vietnam war , also waged by moderate Democrats in fact most US wars have been waged by Democrats , starting with World War I ) .
In Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan , many people have been killed or wounded or their lives disrupted mostly the nationally - oppressed people but also many US soldiers .
Now very many more will be killed .
Not to speak of the wealth which will be destroyed , both in the attacked countries and in the US ( Obama says the war will cost $ 1 trillion ) .
And in the background is the threat of nuclear war not only does the US have nuclear weapons but so does Pakistan and its long - time opponent and neighbor India .
Also , in the same region , the US is threatening to attack Iran , for supposedly working toward nuclear weapons , and there are similar threats by the US ally Israel , which does have nuclear weapons .
Will nuclear bombs be used in the near future ?
I doubt it ; but time marches on and sooner or later they will be used .
( The Bush administration made an effort to make smaller bunker - blasting  nuclear bombs , which could be used in small wars such as in Iraq .
These would have erased the gap between nuclear and conventional weapons .
I do not know where this stands at the moment . )
Liberals have called on the US to lead a world - wide crusade to abolish all nuclear weapons .
Obama has given lip service to this idea , but nothing will come of it because the US state cannot give up any of its power to threaten the rest of the world .
We revolutionary anarchists must oppose these wars will all our might .
While the system cannot stop making wars , it can be forced to end particular wars .
This can be done by raising the price which the state must pay for that war .
If the capitalist politicians feel that young people are becoming radicalized and militant , that labor is becoming restless , that soldiers are potentially mutinous , and that the local peoples will not stop resisting -- then they will finally decide to end the war ( as in Vietnam ) .
We should participate in broader peace movement , joining it in its mass marches and demonstrations .
Often we radicals get tired of demonstrations , seeing how little they accomplish ; but we should not forget how exciting they can be for newer layers of antiwar activists .
However this does not mean that we cover up our program .
In particular we must oppose the leaders of this movement ( liberals , social democrats , and Marxist - Leninists ) for their capitulation to the Democratic Party .
For years now , they have held back the movement by focusing on electing and supporting liberal Democrats .
We need to point to those who have the real power to end the war : the soldiers and other military forces and the working class .
There has been increasing discontent among rank - and=file military and their families about the war .
We should have a positive attitude toward this , as opposed to a moralistic superiority toward ordinary soldiers , who are usually victims of the poverty draft ..
Similarly , there has been much discontent with the wars among working people and their families .
We can at least support the idea of strikes against the war , war production , and the transportation of war material .
We should oppose any use of the war as an excuse for union - busting or wage - lowering .
The force most directly opposing US imperialism in these regions are the people .
We should make clear our solidarity with the nationally oppressed people ( who are mostly workers , peasants , and small businesspeople ) .
We should defend their right to resist US aggression .
We should not be neutral between the mightiest imperial power and the oppressed people of Afghanistan .
But this does not require any support or endorsement for any particular organization or leadership .
We are certainly not for the Taliban , which is viciously misogynist , anti-labor , and statist .
We do not want them to get their state again .
However , that is a matter for the Afghan people to decide , not for the US state nor for Western anarchists .
We should be willing to work with anyone who will oppose the wars , while openly expressing our own program : the end of the state , of international capitalism ( imperialism ) , and of all forms of oppression .

TEL AVIV 
In the year since Israel launched its devastating military offensive against Hamas in Gaza , the country ’s political and military leaders have faced intense international condemnation and accusations of possible war crimes .
But Israel seems to have few qualms .
Officials and experts familiar with the country ’s military doctrine say that given the growing threats from Iranian - backed militant organizations both in Gaza and in Lebanon , Israel will probably find itself fighting another , similar kind of war .
Only next time , some here suggest , Israel will apply more force .
“ The next round will be different , but not in the way people think , ” said Giora Eiland , a retired major general and former chief of Israel ’s National Security Council .
“ The only way to be successful is to take much harsher action . ”
Such talk has raised alarm among some critics in Israel , but so far it has stirred little public debate .
As a result of the New York Times article on December 6 2009 which I posted on yesterday ( see ) , I have been e-mailed by several colleagues who are unclear of my perspective on the science of climate change .
I am writing this e-mail to make sure my viewpoint is abundantly clear .
I have concluded that of three possible hypotheses of the role of humans in the climate system , the only one that has not been refuted is
Although the natural causes of climate variations and changes are undoubtedly important , the human influences are significant and involve a diverse range of first - order climate forcings , including , but not limited to , the human input of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
Most , if not all , of these human influences on regional and global climate will continue to be of concern during the coming decades .
This consequences of this finding include the following :
1 . The human addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by human activities is a signficant contributor to climate change .
Its effect is both radiative and biogeochemical .
2 . However , there are also other human contributions to the climate system that are as , or are more important , than the addition of CO2 .
These include
The influence of human - caused aerosols on regional ( and global ) radiative heating the effect of aerosols on clouds and precipitation , the influence of aerosol deposition ( e.g. soot ; nitrogen ) on climate , and the effect of land cover / land use on climate .
3 . All of these human climate contributors affect the climate on local , regional and global scales .
4. Atmospheric and ocean circulation variability and changes result from these climate forcings .
Since it is these circulations which cause our weather patterns , including drought , floods , tropical cyclones , and blizzards , circulation pattern changes are a much more appropriate metric to monitor with respect to climate change , than a focus on global average radiative forcing changes .
5 . For this reason , climate change involves very much more than global climate system heat changes ( global warming or cooling ) .
5 . The 2007 IPCC report , the Copenhagen meeting currently underway , and the EPA Endangerment Finding are based on a scientific hypothesis which is straightforward to refute ( e.g. see ) .
Inadequate , and likely seriously flawed policy inevitable will result .
6 . The released CRU e-mails documents that a culture in the leadership of the climate science community to suppress and / or ignore viewpoints which differ from the 2007 IPCC view .
This has resulted in a failure of the science community to properly present to policymakers the actual diversity of viewpoints on climate science .
UPDATE : I have been asked my viewpoint on policies related to greenhouse gas emissions .
As I wrote in my post yesterday ( see ) ,
“ Thus the plans being made in Copenhagen will necessarily be inadequate to address the diversity of the climate issues that society and the environment face in the coming decades .
What are needed is a multiple pronged approach to address the different types of natural and human climate forcings as articulated in one of my son ’s posts ( see ) where he wrote
“ As the community begins to realize these significant , multi-faceted and hideous complexities , it would not be a surprise to learn that a policy framework design 20 years ago is now somewhat out of step with current scientific understandings .
The upshot is that as presently designed , international climate policy is both too complex and too simplistic .
It is too simplistic because it is built upon a set of scientific perspectives on climate change that are increasingly seen as outdated and appropriate only for dealing with a narrow set of very important human influences — long - lived greenhouse gases .
It is too complex because in trying to deal with added complexity it has become unwieldy and clearly impractical from the standpoint of not just implementation but the politics of even reaching an agreement about implementation .
Climate policy can be improved by reconstructing climate policy from the bottom up .
This process should begin by recognizing that no single policy instrument will ever deal with “ climate change ” ( human caused or otherwise ) .
An approach to climate policy that is decentralized and more focused in its elements will be better able to adjust as science evolves ( and it will continue to evolve , to be sure ) and allows for progress to be made incrementally along a set of parallel paths .
The all - or - nothing approach to climate policy that dominates the present agenda is incapable of keeping pace with evolving scientific understandings as they relate to policy implementation , and from a pragmatic perspective , pretty much guarantees the “ nothing ” outcome . ”
For further discussion of my views on this issue , please see , for example , RA Pielke Sr. Position Statements and Summary Of Roger A. Pielke Sr’s View Of Climate Science .
Lieberman 's shift ?
His office 's explanation of his new opposition to allowing people older than 55 to buy into Medicare , something he seemed to support quite recently :
Senator Lieberman's [ support of a Medicare expansion ] reported by the Connecticut Post in September was made before the Finance Committee reported out the Baucus bill , which contained extensive health insurance reforms , including a more narrow age rating for pricing health insurance premiums and extensive affordability credits that would benefit this specific group of individuals .
These health insurance reforms and affordability credits have been strengthened in Senator Reid 's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and will provide even greater relief for those 55 - 65 years old .
Any inclusion of a Medicare buy - in for that same age group would be duplicative of what is already in the bill , would put the government on the hook for billions of additional dollars , and would potentially threaten the solvency of Medicare , which is already in a perilous state .
The question of Medicare 's solvency is n't new , so Lieberman 's central point seems to be that he prefers the way the Baucus bill deals with people 55 and over .
( Newser ) – It was n't a state dinner , and they did n't crash it on purpose .
Still , a Georgia couple who showed up at the White House a day early for a tour somehow wound up at an invitation - only breakfast with President Obama .
The White House and Secret Service said Harvey and Paula Darden went through the appropriate security screenings and were allowed int as a courtesy because there were no public tours that day , Nov. 11 .
That explanation was news to Harvey Darden , 67 , who thought they were simply starting their tour until they were ushered into the East Room , offered a buffet spread and told they'd be meeting the president .
They approached a White House aide with their concern that they had veered off course but were told to " just go with the flow , " Darden said .
" I felt kind of funny because I was the only man in the room that was n't dressed in a coat and tie , " he added .
" I was just a plain tourist . "

Senate Bill .
These estimates are straightforward -- they 're taken directly from the CBO 's report on premiums for people at different income levels .
A family of four earning an income of $ 54,000 would pay $ 4,000 in premiums , and could expect to incur another $ 5,000 in out - of - pocket costs .
The $ 4,000 premium represents a substantial discount , because the government is covering 72 percent of the premium -- meaning that the gross cost of the premium is $ 14,286 , some $ 10,286 of which the government pays .
One caution : this reflects the situation before the public option was removed from the bill .
But , provided that the subsidy schedule is n't changed as well , that should n't change these numbers much .
Status Quo .
In 2009 , the average premium for a family in the individual market was $ 6,328 , according to the insurance lobbying group AHIP .
However , this figure paints an optimistic picture for two reasons .
Firstly , the average family size in the AHIP dataset is 3.03 people ; for a family of four , that number would scale upward to $ 7,925 , by my calculations .
Secondly , the CBO 's estimates are based on 2016 figures , not 2009 , so to make an apples - to - apples comparison , we have to account for inflation .
According to Kaiser , the average cost of health coverage has increased by about 8.7 percent annually over the past decade , and by 8.8 percent for family coverage .
Let 's scale that down slightly , assuming 7.5 annual inflation in premiums from 2009 through 2016 inclusive .
That would bring the cost of the family 's premium up by a nominal 66 percent , to $ 13,149 .
And remember : these are based on estimates of premiums provided by the insurance lobby .
I have no particular reason to think that they 're biased , but if they are , it 's probably on the low side .
Not only , however , would this family paying a lot more under the status quo , but they'd be doing so for inferior insurance .
According to the CBO , the amount of coverage in the individual market would improve by between 27 and 30 percent under the Senate 's bill .
Taking the midpoint of those numbers ( 28.5 percent ) , we can infer that there would be about $ 1,427 in additional cost sharing to this family in the status quo as compared with the Senate bill ; this would bring their cost sharing to $ 6,427 total .
Add the $ 6,247 to the $ 13,149 and you get an annual cost of $ 19,576 -- for a family earning $ 54,000 !
Obviously , very few such families are going to be able to afford that unless they have a ** lot ** of money in the bank .
So , some of these families will go without insurance , or they 'll by really crappy insurance , or they 'll pay the premiums but skimp on out - of - pocket costs , which will negatively impact their fiscal and physical health .
But if this family were to want to obtain equivalent coverage to that which would be available to them for $ 9,000 in the Senate bill , it would cost them between $ 19,000 and $ 20,000 , according to my estimates .
Status Quo with SCHIP .
Fortunately , some families in this predicament do receive some relief via the SCHIP program .
SCHIP eligibility varies from state to state ; a family earning income at 225 percent of the poverty line , as this family does , is eligible for SCHIP in about half of the country .
Premiums are fairly cheap under SCHIP -- for a family at 225 percent of poverty , generally on the order of about $ 60 per month to cover two children .
We 'll assume that this will inflate slightly to $ 75 per month , or $ 900 per year , by 2016 .
The two adults in the household will still have to buy insurance in the individual market , which will cost $ 7,684 by 2016 .
That makes the family 's total premium $ 8,584 .
For the adults , we assume that the cost sharing component runs proportional to premiums , and totals $ 3,756 .
For the children , this calculation is a little bit more ambiguous .
Out - of - pocket costs under SCHIP are capped at 5 percent of family income , which would be $ 2,700 for this family .
But that 's a cap and not an average -- we 'll assume that the average is half of the cap , or $ 1,350 .
Total cost - sharing , therefore , is $ 5,106 between the adults and the children .
This means that premiums plus out of pocket costs will equal $ 13,690 for this family .
I estimate the subsidy by subtracting this figure from the cost of unsubsidized insurance in the individual market ; the difference is $ 5,885 .
Caveat / Disclaimer .
There are , obviously , some simplifying assumptions here , especially with regard to SCHIP .
The only thing I can promise you is that I'm " showing my work " .
I would actively encourage people to pick apart these numbers and come up with their own , more robust estimates .
One thing that should probably be accounted for is that the families in both the status quo and the status quo +
SCHIP cases will frequently be able to deduct their health care expenses from their taxable income , especially if they 've incurred substantial out - of - pocket costs .
That means that the difference in net costs is slightly exaggerated by my figures .
* * *
Nevertheless , it 's clear that this family would be receiving a very substantial subsidy , on the order of $ 10,000 in pretax income , under the Senate 's bill .
The reason I picked this particular family is because it provides a reality check against the example selected by the great Darcy Burner , who argued in an article at Open Left :
Affordable coverage for everyone : FAIL .
The latest CBO estimates for the Senate bill say that a family of four with a household income of $ 54,000 / year should expect to pay 17 % of their gross income on healthcare - about $ 9,000 / year .
( And that was when there was a public option to hold down costs ! )
That 's more than they 'll spend on federal taxes .
That 's more than they 'll spend on food .
I 'm guessing if you took a poll , very few Americans would consider that affordable .
And because of the way they 've approached this , there 's no effective cost cap on premiums and nothing providing downward pressure , so this is a problem that would get worse rather than better over time .
We can debate whether $ 9,000 for a family earning $ 54,000 is " affordable " ; what we know is that it 's a hell of a lot more affordable than the status quo , under which the family might have to pay more than twice as much to receive equivalent coverage .
In fact , Burner 's example is unfortunately chosen ; she picked one of the groups -- a low - income family in the individual market -- that would benefit the ** most ** under the Senate package .
Other groups would not be so beneficially impacted .
Premiums are projected to rise slightly , for instance , for high - income earners in the individual market , although this is a small fraction of people and they'd get better health coverage as a result .
And people in the employer market would not be much affected , except those with generous benefits packages subject to the excise tax ; these folks would have to pay more out of pocket , although probably in exchange for more cash income .
On the other hand , there are those who have a pre-existing condition and who are not able to buy health coverage at all , and for whom the benefit is almost incalculably large .
I understand that most of the liberal skepticism over the Senate bill is well intentioned .
But it has become way , way off the mark .
Where do you think the $ 800 billion goes ?
It goes to low - income families just like these .
Where do you think it comes from ?
We wo n't know for sure until the Senate and House produce their conference bill , but it comes substantially from corporations and high - income earners , plus some efficiency gains .
Because I 'm primarily a political analyst , I think people tend to assume that I 'm lost in the political forest and not seeing the policy trees .
In fact , the opposite is true .
For any " progressive " who is concerned about the inequality of wealth , income and opportunity in America , this bill would be an absolutely monumental achievement .
The more compelling critique , rather , is that the bill would fail to significantly " bend the cost curve " .
I do n't dismiss that criticism at all , and certainly the insertion of a public option would have helped at the margins .
But fundamentally , that is a critique that would traditionally be associated with the conservative side of the debate , as it ultimately goes to mounting deficits in the wake of expanded government entitlements .
And please do pick apart my numbers : I 'm sure that you will find some questionable assumptions and possibly some outright errors .
But if you found a persuasive , progressive policy rationale against the bill , I 'd be stunned .
UPDATE --
Another important point or two :
To the extent that there are persuasive ( IMO ) critiques about this post , they revolve around the fact that $ 9,000 is not so affordable for our not - so - imaginary family .
Two things to note on this :
Firstly , in most years , the family will not be paying $ 9,000 .
They 'll be paying closer to $ 4,000 -- the base cost of the premium -- or maybe $ 5,000 for a few meds and doctors ' visits and so forth .
The costs will be much higher in those years when a member of the family gets sick .
But the alternative in those years would be not having health insurance at all -- and in that case , either the the family member might die from the condition or the family will go bankrupt trying to prevent that .
Also , frankly , the individual mandate penalty is not very harsh , especially for lower - income people , so there 's some potential for gaming the system in a way that is n't economically optimal but would give this particular family a better deal than suggested above .
Secondly , the critiques over the level of subsidies are rather tangential to where the locus of progressive energy has been -- on the public option .
The presence of a watered - down public option would make very little difference in terms of this family 's cost structure -- and yet , this same bill with a public option is one that most (? ) liberals would be head - over - heels for .
I happen to agree that the cost subsidies need to be improved somewhat for this type of family and indeed I wish that this is where more of the left 's energy had been directed .
Fortunately , I think this is something that really can ( still ) be improved in conference committee or on the floor .
For instance , if you adopted the House bill 's subsidies for families at under 250 % of poverty , and the Senate 's ( which actually become more generous ) for people at greater than 250 % of poverty -- perhaps in exchange for a harsher ( not weaker ! ) individual mandate penalty -- you 'd have a pretty reasonable compromise .

“ I ’m Cecil Williams and I am pissed ! ”
This was how Rev. Williams of Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco greeted volunteers -- many of them attending a conference for lesbian and gay politicians which begins in San Francisco today -- who had gathered in Glide ’s lunchroom to help with food distribution at Thursday ’s lunch service .
“ I ’m pissed at the Mayor of Vallejo , California , " Williams explained to a smattering of applause and cheers .
" I will not let him define who I am with [ nor ] whether I ’m going to heaven or hell .
He can not determine my destiny nor yours either . "
Rev. Williams was referring to comments made by Vallejo Mayor Osby Davis that gay people would not go to heaven , and he was addressing a group from the Gay and Lesbian Leadership Conference who ’d come to help the hungry .
Denis Dison , Vice President at the Gay and Lesbian Leadership Institute , traveled from Washington D.C. to help out with the conference that brings together openly LGBT politicians from around the world .
“ There are about 450 openly LGBT elected officials in the United States .
When this conference first began 25 years ago there were maybe a dozen , ” Dison said .
“ So , we ’ve really come a long way but there are still half - a- million elected officials in the United States so we have a long way to go still . ”
While Vallejo might not have a gay - friendly mayor , in the South Bay , openly - gay 26 - year - old Evan Low was recently selected by the City Council of Campbell , Calif. , to be that city ’s youngest openly gay mayor and the youngest Asian American mayor in the country .
And State Assembly member John Perez 's name is being bruited about as the leading contender to become the state 's next speaker .
“ It ’s great that people like Evan Low are being elected as Campbell 's mayor , " said Dison .
" It ’s wonderful that John Perez is being considered to be Speaker for the Assembly in California .
I think when people see openly gay and lesbian elected officials working for their entire communities it really changes their perception of who we are as a community . ”
Dison continued , “ I think that the more young people see that gays and lesbians can get involved in politics and their own government younger in their lives it gives them hope that they can actually change things in their own government without waiting for our straight allies to get things done . ”
The 25th International Gay & Lesbian Leadership Conference is scheduled to welcome people from all over the world this weekend , including Berlin , Germany Mayor Klaus Wowereit , U.S. Representatives Tammy Baldwin ( D - Wis. ) and Jared Polis ( D - Colo . ) and former U.S. Ambassador to Romania Michael Guest as well as hundreds of others .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom -- who 's proved hard to keep track of recently -- is scheduled to attend the opening reception .
Still , in the months since the killing , Dr. Carhart has made changes at his clinic and to his lifestyle as he has openly moved to take up Dr. Tiller ’s cause .
Visitors to the clinic here must pass through a metal detector , new security cameras scan outside the building and a security consultant is employed full time .
Dr. Carhart says he goes out publicly only on short , unscheduled trips and rarely eats out ( and when he does , he says he stays less than 30 minutes ) .
Dr. Carhart , an Air Force veteran , said his daughter was wed this fall on a nearby military base , mainly for security and privacy .
“ We do everything differently now , ” he said .
Dr. Carhart declined to provide specifics on how late in a pregnancy he would be willing to perform an abortion .
Dr. Tiller performed them , in some cases , as late as in the third trimester of pregnancy .
Dr. Carhart ’s fee schedule lists prices for abortions up to 22 weeks and 6 days ( at that point , $ 2,100 in cash or $ 2,163 on a credit card ) , but notes that abortions after 23 weeks are available “ after consultation with our doctor , ” and that abortions after the 27th week may take four days .

At his clinic in the past , Dr. Carhart said , he had performed abortions up to about 22 weeks into gestation  considered by some to be near the earliest point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb , a notion known as viability and one that is cited in many laws related to abortion .
Dr. Carhart ’s opponents insist that late - term procedures violate state and federal statutes as well as professional rules .
They have approached officials in Nebraska seeking an investigation .
Mr. Newman , who had regularly called for investigations into Dr. Tiller ’s work but strongly denounced his killing , has submitted a complaintabout Dr. Carhart to Jon Bruning , Nebraska ’s attorney general .
In it , Mr. Newman accuses Dr. Carhart of using improper operating procedures under shoddy conditions .
Representatives of Mr. Bruning would not comment on whether an investigation was taking place .
Marla Augustine , a spokeswoman for the State Department of Health and Human Services , which regulates physicians , said Dr. Carhart had no formal disciplinary actions on his record .
If you enjoy photography , do n't make the mistake I did .
Using my then - new SLR in 2005 and 2006 , I photographed everything from my new son to otherworldly canyons we visited in Utah .
The only problem : the photos were taken only in JPEG format .
Advertisement
JPEG is fine as far as it goes , and indeed for most folks it will suffice .
But having rediscovered my enjoyment of photography in the digital era , I wish I 'd used the raw image format that comes with SLRs and higher - end compact cameras .
Advertisement
My initial regret was from the realization that raw photos , although taking up about three times the storage space as a JPEG and requiring manual processing , offer higher quality and more flexibility .
But what I 've come to understand since then is a second advantage of raw : because processing software improves over time , raw photos in effect can get better with age .
For that reason , I 've begun recommending friends who show some enthusiasm for photography that they should think about shooting important events in raw format alongside JPEG .
You do n't have to mess with the raw files today , but if it 's an important event like a wedding , you might want them for later .

I 've included below some samples of a noisy image shot in near - darkness at ISO 25,600 from my SLR .
They may not convince you that shooting raw is a miracle cure for photo quality , but they do illustrate some differences with the camera 's JPEG and that the raw - processing software is n't standing still .
Raw ?
What 's that mean anyway ?
But first , a little background .
What exactly are raw images ?
Advertisement
A digital camera 's image sensor is a grid of pixels that captures light from a scene .
Cameras can interpret this image , processing it in various ways to produce a JPEG .
A raw file , though , is the unprocessed data from the image sensor .
However , there 's no raw standard ; each digital camera has its own , usually proprietary , raw format , though they 're sometimes related .
Advertisement
Although cameras can produce JPEGs , a subset of the image - editing industry serves those who shoot raw .
Options include Adobe Systems ' Photoshop and Photoshop Lightroom , Apple 's Aperture , DxO Labs ' Optics Pro , Phase One 's Capture One , and a handful of others .
The variety of proprietary formats means these applications must be constantly updated for the newest cameras .
All SLRs can produce raw images , as can a variety of higher - end compact cameras such as Panasonic 's LX3 and GF1 , Canon 's S90 and G11 , and Olympus ' E - P1 and E - P2 .
Advertisement
Raw files vary from JPEG in several ways .
Here are some of the nitty - gritty details .
Let 's start at the individual pixel .
Each one you see on a computer screen has a mixture of three colors of light : red , green , and blue .
But with most cameras ' image sensors , each pixel captures only one of those colors .
A process called demosaicing converts this checkerboard - like arrangement of colors , called a Bayer pattern , so each pixel in the final image gets all three colors instead of just one .
Advertisement
Another difference is in white balance .
Unlike film cameras of yore , digital cameras can make a snap judgment whether a shot is being taken under yellowish incandescent light , under white sunlight , or in bluish shade , then try to correct the image so white looks white .
This processing change is baked into a JPEG image , but it 's just a recommendation in a raw shot .
Finally , each color in a JPEG pixel is stored with an 8 - bit value , providing 256 steps between , the darkest and lightest green , red , or blue .
With raw , most cameras today record 12 or 14 bits per color , providing 8,192 or 16,384 levels , respectively .

What does raw get you ?
The big drawbacks of raw images are that the files are larger and that you can't share them easily until you 've edited them with some kind of software .
But here are some of the first advantages I found shooting raw .
Some professionals with lots of experience and time to set up shots get everything right .
For the rest of us , shots often are overexposed or underexposed .
One of the main advantages of shooting raw is better flexibility to correct such problems — in part because of that better color depth than JPEG affords .
Advertisement
" Shooting in raw is usually more forgiving than just shooting jpeg files , so should you make a mistake when capturing an image you have a better opportunity with a RAW file to go back and correct any mistakes , " said Richard Pelkowski , product manager of digital SLRs for Olympus Imaging America .
" We typically encourage our Olympus consumers to shoot in both raw plus JPEG mode so they immediately have both a JPEG file you can easily share and use instantly and a more forgiving raw file that you can go back to later for post processing . "
Take the example of Jonathan Machen , an artist I know in Boulder , Colo. , who embraced raw as he moved from point - and - shoot cameras to an SLR .
Advertisement
" While I strive to understand my camera completely and hope to take images that approximate the balance of light that my eye sees , it 's not always possible , especially in fast - moving family situations .
I love to take pictures of the kids in unusual lighting and compositional situations , but it can be a distracting combination trying to watch them and trying to take a good picture , " he said .
Case in point : at dinner in a restaurant recently , a kid- friendly lap dog appeared , but Machen 's camera was set wrong .
" I got the shot , but the image was almost black , " he said .
" Later , editing the raw file , I brought it back to a place that brought a smile to my face as well as that of my wife . "
Advertisement
Even if you do n't make mistakes , raw images offer more flexibility in editing to bring out details otherwise lost in murky shadows or bright highlights .
This is the particular ability I wish I had for shots of my newborn son held under bright heat lamps and of a twisty narrow canyon in both sun and shade .
Adjustable white balance is another nicety .
On many occasions I 've fixed the colors of conference speakers whose faces were turned to yellow putty by stage lights or of a friend 's darling daughter whose position in the shade made her look like an ice queen in the making .

Computers also get more power to compensate for lens shortcomings or reduce the sensor noise that speckles images , said Cyrille de la Chesnais , director of sales and marketing for photography at the Paris - based DxO Labs .
" Optical corrections and noise removal are much more precise and effective on raw files than on JPEG files , " he said .
Many cameras let you adjust noise reduction levels when you take the photo — but again , with a JPEG , your choice is baked permanently into the image .

Moore 's Law and the subtler promise of raw
Here 's where I had n't appreciated raw 's advantages : computers get faster .
Demosaicing is a complicated process that benefits from more computing horsepower , and unlike many computing tasks , it happens to be one that can easily benefit from multicore processors .
Advertisement
When you take a photo with your camera , it uses a relatively feeble image - processing chip to produce the JPEG .
It 's remarkable to me how well those chips can perform the task , but even with the best quality on the market today , your camera will only have one chance to make that JPEG .
But if you 're converting a raw image with software , you not only get more computing horsepower than a camera offers , you get algorithms that are updated .

" You can revisit this digital negative and reprocess it as technology improves , " said Tom Hogarty , Adobe 's product manager for Lightroom .

Hogarty likens the situation to what he saw looking at prints in a museum by the famed landscape photographer Ansel Adams .
" You could tell the earlier prints did n't stand out .
They did n't have same kind of depth that the later prints did .
The printing technology and chemicals were getting better , " Hogarty said .
" Imagine if all you had was original print and you could n't improve it going forward . "

DxO Optics Pro 6 , released in November , and the beta version of Lightroom 3 , introduced in October , both are designed to extract a better image from the raw data .
De la Chesnais said DxO Optics
Pro improves noise reduction so that one F - stop 's worth of noise can be fixed .
That means that if you previously were happy shooting photos at ISO 800 , you could push your camera to ISO 1600 for better low - light performance , for example .
Noise reduction is a complicated problem .
In addition to getting rid of the color and brightness variations from pixel to pixel , lower - frequency noise patterns often lead to blotches of red or blue that span many pixels .
Good noise reduction preserves original colors and fine details and does n't give the image a smeary watercolor - painting look up close .

Another software matter : software can take its best guess what sort of editing settings to apply .
In my experience , that 's a good starting point if not always a good final result , but I expect improvements here , too , just as cameras are generally getting better at automatically gauging the right exposure , focus , and other settings .
Is raw for everyone ?
No , but I think it 's for more people than use it today .

If you 're just uploading photos of your smiling friends to Facebook , chances are the core value of the image easily transcends a little pesky noise or skewed colors .
Robert Balousek , from the San Francisco Bay Area , shoots raw — but mostly because Adobe Lightroom corrects some defective pixels in his SLR image sensor .
" Auto - fix is a gamble , " he said .
" I do n't apply it to all photos , just ones that I would like to use but are a little off .
Sometimes it does what I want , but more often than not I tweak a few knobs until it looks how I expect .
I do n't claim to be an expert , I just know what seems right to me . "

If you 're a bit more serious , though raw could be worth sampling .
Give it a serious thought if you 're an experimental students , a tourist who wants to compile memories in a photo book , a photo enthusiast sharing shots on Flickr , or a parent printing poster - size prints of your children .
I believe software will ease today 's manual pains of handling raw photos .
Aperture and Lightroom have made it easier to process large numbers of shots , though there 's plenty of work to be done .
Automatic adjustments will steadily improve , and perhaps Windows will get the better built - in support Mac OS X has so people looking at a folder full of raw files see thumbnail images rather than a list of filenames with generic icons .
Advertisement
It 's true raw shots take up more space on your flash card , hard drive , and backups .
But storage is cheap these days with 1.5 terabyte hard drives costing less than $ 100 and 8 GB SD memory cards costing about $ 20 .
Today 's large image files will look gradually more ordinary as storage technology gets roomier .
Standardization could help
One big change that could help raw catch on is standardization of the file formats .
Today 's profusion of formats ensures that operating systems or editing software have a hard time keeping up .
The most promising avenue here is Adobe 's Digital Negative format , which the company controlled for years but more has submitted to the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) as a proposed standard .
Advertisement
DNG has been improved to address a number of earlier shortcomings , for example by adding profiles that can mirror camera tonal settings such as neutral , landscape , or portrait .
Another more recent example are " opcodes " that can register lens settings used to so software can automatically correct optical problems such as vignetting or barrel distortion .
DNG already could gracefully accommodate metadata such as copyright notices or editing instructions , and it for those worried about how well a specific raw format is converted into a generic format , the DNG can house the original raw file , too .
Advertisement
Pentax is the most prominent company to build DNG support into its cameras , but SLR leaders Nikon and Canon still do n't .
Hogarty hopes the standardization process will improve its prospects .
" I believe the gating factor in camera manufacturer adoption is the fact it is a format controlled by Adobe , " Hogarty said .
" Clearly it 's not available in the majority of cameras shipped in the world today .
That 's why we 're pursuing the ISO standard , so other companies can feel comfortable with the standard format . "
Advertisement
Ultimately , Hogarty believes raw usage will spread more widely
" If you look at images shot by the mainstream market , they need the most latitude in editing and correction capabilities .
They 're not as passionate about getting the perfect image , " Hogarty said .
" I think they'd be able to take that raw product to a finished product that would make them happier . "
Advertisement
I suspect it 'll be a long time before raw processing is simple enough that mainstream snapshooters will embrace raw .
But the trajectory is clear : the technology is improving .
So if you care about your shots and have a camera that 'll do it , set it to shoot raw +JPEG next time you 're photographing something important .
You may not want to mess with the raw shots today , but why curtail your options if you do n't have to ?

USA Today looks at how many folks will choose to be uninsured despite mandates to buy insurance or …pay a fine that for several years at least will be far less than the cheapest plan out there .
Under the Senate bill , people who do n't buy coverage would face a maximum penalty of $ 95 beginning in 2014 .
That would jump in 2016 to $ 750 or 2 % of their annual income up to the cost of the cheapest health plan , whichever is greater .
In the House bill , violators would pay as much as 2.5 % of their annual income up to the cost of the cheapest plan beginning in 2013 .
When people buy health insurance on their own rather than through employers , the average cost in 2016 is projected to be $ 5,500 for an individual policy and $ 13,100 for family coverage , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
Both bills would provide a sliding scale of subsidies to individuals who earn less than $ 43,320 or families of four who earn less than $ 88,200 .
The bills also exempt millions of people from the mandate , including for financial hardship .
Incidentally , using 2007 figures , household income of $ 88,000 puts a household in the second - highest income quintile , which included households making between $ 60,000 and $ 97,000 .
So if in fact the government will be subsidizing people in that income bracket , it will be subsidizing upper - middle - class earners .
Anyhoo , USAT notes that when Massachusetts created its involuntary coverage mandate , the percentage of uninsured declined from 7 percent to 4 percent .
It also cites Congressional Budget Office numbers on the percentage of Americans who resolutely fail to do what they are told to do by law :
• Most states have required seat belt use for about two decades , yet 18 % of Americans still do n't buckle up .
•
Schools have required children to get immunized for chickenpox since the 1990s , but 15 % do n't get vaccinated .
•
Nearly all states require drivers to buy car insurance , but 15 % do n't comply .
Whole story here .
So what percentage of Americans wo n't buy mandated insurance ?
It 's not clear , though it seems a no - brainer that if the penalty is only $ 95 , many wo n't , at least at first .
And the non-compliants ( a term with Philip K. Dickian resonance and one that I 'm sure will become common parlance if and when the current miscarriage of health care reform passes ) will be concentrated among the relatively young and healthy , precisely the demographic that the government wants to pull into the pool to lower costs and raise revenues .
But that 's OK , because we have ways of making them work , right ?
Gaze upon the folks you need to convince that mandatory health insurance ( not care , mind you , insurance ) is , well , mandatory :
You read that right .
Sony 's PlayStation 2 , which the great majority of the world has been enjoying since 2000 , is just now officially touching ground in Brazil .
We 're pretty sure it 's been making its way into the country for many years by not - so - official means , but if you 've gone the legit route , last - generation 's game console king can be yours for just 799 Brazilian Real , which we 're sad to say translates to about $ 461 in US currency .
Yeah , we 're expecting this to just fly off the shelves .
Hey , remember those MIDI backgrounds so popular on some websites over the years ?
Sometimes the songs were great .
Sometimes they really were n’t .
For some people , the sound of “ My Heart Will Go On ” playing over a memorial site or “ Crazy ” ( by Patsy Cline ) playing over your personal weblog page was the height of tacky .
For others , it was an initiation to tearing up and smiling while you read .
Without a doubt , it certainly has led to millions of times , all throughout the world , of someone finding out the hard way how high their sound systems were turned up .
Naturally , a lot of the people using Geocities would have been partial to using MIDI , just as they were partial to using backgrounds or flashing animated GIFs or , for that matter , anything striking that got their page to be unique and special .
In the interim period of time , we ’ve had lots of ‘ designers ’ and aesthetic princes declare what we “ should ” and “ should n’t ” do , but back when anything went , anything did .
I ’ve been putting a bunch of runs through on the Geocities data acquired so far , and pulling out thematic collections .
I ’ve assembled one of all these MIDI songs .
Update : I ’ve been informed some of this archive ( a handful ) are mp3 files mis-labelled .
Sorry about that !
Consider them a bonus .
MIDI is a very interesting format , with a very cool history , one told by others with great ability .
I wo n’t duplicate those efforts .
Like most formats , when done well , it can be done really well .
When not done well , it ’s easier to do but your audience pays for it and you bring the general quality down .
Some of the files in this collection are great .
Some are really awful .
All are historical to some degree .
Here ’s the link to a Pirate Bay Torrent .
I ’ve railed about how torrents are not the be -all end - all of file distribution , but for short - term bursts , it ’s a great way to go .
This collection ’s about 370 mb , compressed .
It ’s about 1.5 gigabytes uncompressed .
It would take , I think , months to play all this music .
Let the songs begin .
EXTRA BONUS SECTION
Since I had the thousands of duplicated MIDI files in one place , I decided to find out which ones were most popular .
With the caveat that I only worked with the Neighborhoods - era ( pre- Yahoo ) set , and of course many sites had disappeared before I ran my scripts , here are the top ten most popular songs that you could have show up on a Geocities site !

Though Americans can't buy Sarah Palin 's memoir " Going Rogue " until November 17 , excerpts leaked via the Associated Press are already provoking a furor — not to mention suggestions that the former Governor is using this book ( and its ambitious Iowa - heavy promotional tour ) as a pretext to kick - start a 2012 presidential campaign .
Here 's a quick guide to some of the Palin autobiography 's most controversial assertions .
THE MCCAIN CAMPAIGN RIPPED PALIN OFF
" Going Rogue " asserts that : The John McCain campaign charged Palin $ 50,000 for vetting her as a VP candidate .
When Palin asked if the McCain campaign would cover it , she was told no , because McCain lost .
Reactions :
The claim “ is 100 percent untrue , ” an unidentified senior McCain adviser told CNN .
“ All those bills are from her personal attorney Thomas Van Flein , mostly relating to the Troopergate investigation and other ethics investigations . ”
McCain 2008 general counsel Trevor Potter told The Atlantic , “ I can confirm that she was not billed for any vetting costs by the campaign . ”
But , asks Glynnis MacNichol in Mediaite , does n't this claim also “ beg the question : what vetting ? ”
PALIN WAS TRICKED INTO TALKING TO KATIE COURIC
" Going Rogue " asserts that :
The McCain campaign convinced Palin to submit to a series of interviews with CBS 's Katie Couric by claiming the anchorwoman had low self - esteem and wanted to help .
Not so , Palin writes : " Couric " badgered " her and used " gotcha " tactics to advance a " partisan agenda . "
Reactions :
This is true , says Josh Painter at Texas for Sarah Palin :
The “ Couric interview was a setup by Nicole Wallace , ” a McCain aide with whom Palin had a testy relationship .
Nonsense , says Geoffrey Dunn in The Huffington Post .
“ Palin refused to prep for the Couric debate , ” and besides , “ was it really badgering to ask what books or periodicals Palin read ? ”
Palin herself told Oprah Winfrey she knew right away that " it was n’t a good interview . ”
PALIN WAS ABRUPTLY DENIED A CHANCE TO SPEAK AT MCCAIN'S CONCESSION
" Going Rogue " asserts that : Palin was barred from speaking at McCain ’s election - night concession only minutes before she was scheduled to go on .
( Watch a report about Sarah Palin being " bottled up " by the McCain campaign )
Reactions : “ McCain and his aides believed this would be unprecedented , and a generally bad idea , given her tendency for , as the book ’s title puts it , ‘ Going Rogue , ’ ” say Motoko Rich and Kate Zernike in The New York Times .
Furthermore , says Geoffrey Dunn in The Huffington Post , even though Palin “ had been told at least three times " that she would n't be addressing the crowd , she " kept lying about it in the hopes of creating some last - minute chaos that would allow her to assume the dais . "
ABC'S CHARLES GIBSON PATRONIZED PALIN WITH SOFTBALL QUESTIONS
" Going Rogue " asserts that : ABC News anchor Charles Gibson , bored by truly “ substantive issues ” relating to her experience as Alaska governor , “ peered skeptically ” at her over his glasses like a disapproving principal during their interview .
Reaction :
The AP leaks are trying to make " Going Rogue ” look “ full of self - serving whining , ” says John Ziegler in Mediaite .
But if you read the book , “ Palin ’s analysis of what really happened with the now infamous ( and totally misunderstood ) Couric and Gibson interviews could not be less whiny . ”

The recession in Italy has led to fierce competition between retailers , who are battling harder than ever to capture the attention of potential customers .
One shop in Rome has gone to the length of hiring a ' human mannequin ' to live on a bed amongst customers .
The shop in question , ' 7 camicie ' in Via del Corso , which sells shirts , has hired professional model and actor Paul Lahmiesc to ply their trade .
Tim Allman reports .
Theo Fleury told The Post this afternoon that he will indeed file criminal charges against Graham James , the junior hockey coach who the one - time Ranger alleges sexually abused him as a teenager .
“ That decision has been made , ” Fleury said during a conversation at a Midtown restaurant .
“ I ’ve hired Hersh Wolch , who might be the best criminal attorney in North America , and he ’s going through the process of doing the necessary preparation . ”
LARRY BROOKS ON TWITTER
Fleury is in New York promoting his autobiography , “ Playing With Fire , ” in which he charges that the abuse from James began when he was a 14 - year - old in Winnipeg and continued once or twice a week for years .
The book marks the first public acknowledgment from Theory that he was a victim of abuse .
“ That made me who I was , ” said Fleury , who is a recovering addict following a lifetime of alcohol , drug and gambling issues .
“ You saw the anger on the ice .
It was uncontrollable .
I cringe when I see it .
“ Never in my life did I want to be like that but that ’s the person that the abuse turned me into ; an alcoholic , doing drugs and completely out of control . ”
Fleury remained silent when junior teammate Sheldon Kennedy made similar allegations against James in 1997 .
James was later convicted of molesting two teenage players on the WHL Swift Current Broncos and served 42 months in prison .
“ I was not psychologically prepared to come forward then , I was not strong enough , ” said Fleury , sober since Sept. 18 , 2005 .
“ But I am now , and I will do whatever it takes , no matter what the repercussions might be .
“ I will follow my attorney ’s instructions as we go forward , but I am prepared to testify in court under oath if that becomes necessary .
I will do whatever it takes .
“ What if there ’s another kid out there ? ”

Stung by criticism over delayed unemployment extension checks , the Schwarzenegger administration acted to speed up payments to 121,000 long - term jobless Californians , many of whom have been without benefits for more than a month .
Checks could arrive as early as midweek , with filings possibly starting Sunday , said Loree Levy , spokeswoman for the state Employment Development Department .
The jobs agency had said days earlier that the payments from a federally approved extension of at least 14 weeks could be delayed until the week of Christmas -- or even into the new year .
The rapid response came as the agency decided to work around its usual paperwork and begin sending checks out right away , with agency staffers working through the weekend to prepare filings in advance of mailing the payments .
Even before the agency said the checks would be more than a month late , complaints had been pouring in from lawmakers , social service advocates and the jobless , many of whom had exhausted their maximum 79 weeks of benefits .

An additional 14 weeks of checks went into effect Nov. 8 after being approved by Congress and President Obama , but the payments in California never went out .
The jobs agency had blamed its antiquated 30 - year - old computer system for complicating programming that needed to be updated to administer the new extension .
But things changed in the last few days as criticism mounted .
News of the accelerated checks came Friday after a blunt letter sent to EDD Director Patrick Henning from his boss , Labor and Workforce Development Agency Secretary Victoria Bradshaw .
She ordered that extension benefits arrive in mailboxes by the middle of next week and also expressed concern over the EDD ’s drawn - out process of updating its computer programming .
Advertisement
“ I understand the difficulties presented by multiple federal extensions , ” she wrote , “ but ensuring that unemployed Californians receive their benefit checks in a timely manner is of paramount concern to the unemployed and to the economy . ”
The EDD already had the same idea , according to Levy , who said that Bradshaw ’s letter was a “ meeting of the minds ” and a sign that “ everyone in the administration is in agreement about the urgent need to issue the checks as soon as possible . ”
Angie Wei , a lobbyist for the California Labor Federation , said the letter was an attempt at shifting blame , “ a cheap political shot at a time when workers need real relief . ”
“ Rather than pointing fingers , the governor ’s office should be doing a serious review and evaluation and action plan to modernize our broken , dinosaur computer system , ” she said .

In the letter , Bradshaw also directed the EDD to work with career centers , local governments and schools to inform the public of free Internet services to encourage those eligible for an extension to file claims online .
To “ reaffirm ” Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s “ commitment to ensuring the EDD has the resources it needs . . . to ensure benchmarks to a more successful program , ” Bradshaw also wrote that her undersecretary , Doug Hoffner , would serve as a liaison between the agencies .
But state officials have long have been aware of the precarious condition of the EDD ’s archaic computer system , said Maurice Emsellem , policy co-director for the National Employment Law Project , which advocates for the working poor .
“ This is a problem that preexisted this recession and the last recession , ” he said .
“ It ’s no secret to Bradshaw and everybody else that the system is broken .
EDD is now on the firing line , but there are lots of other state officials who had an opportunity to fix this mess . ”

Emsellem added : “ There ’s no state in the country whose system is more out of whack than California . ”
Henning , 63 , who is retiring as the head of the EDD on Thursday without an official replacement , stayed out of the fray .
“ Mr. Henning will follow instructions , ” he quipped .
By Monday , the EDD will automatically file new extension claims for all the 121,000 Californians who have already exhausted their benefits , Levy said .
They will begin receiving their first checks by the end of next week , though some in Northern California may get them as soon as Wednesday .

Though the checks are issued for two - week periods and are normally sent every two weeks , those who have already met their maximum will instead see a “ rapid succession ” of payments to catch up on all the money owed since early November , Levy said .
The jobs agency will also be sending out claim forms and a note about the automatic application to eligible individuals , including 164,000 more Californians expected to use up their benefits by the end of the year , she said .
“ As they ’re working on getting us that claim form , we ’re working on getting them that first check , ” Levy said .
“ We ’re very happy about it .
We ’ve been really , truly committed to getting these checks out the door as quickly before Christmas as possible . ”
The new payment schedule is “ phenomenal news , ” said Christopher Boxley , 27 , of Santa Ana .
The former assistant account executive at a retail marketing agency lost his job in August 2007 , had to move back in with his parents and now pulls in about $ 850 for every two - week unemployment check .

“ If we get the checks in the mail before Christmas , ” he said , “ we might be able to buy presents before Christmas instead of borrowing money from our parents to buy presents for them . ”
The EDD ’s new plan is “ a godsend , ” Boxley said .
“ If I was a decision maker , that ’s pretty much what I would be implementing , ” he said .
“ Those retailers who are being hit hard will have some money , and families wo n’t be worried about paying the bills . ”

We knew Google was part of the liberal mafia when they allowed George W. Bush to come up first when you searched “ miserable failure ” ( but the editors did away with this search result in 2007 ) .
But a conservative at the Red State blog has taken it one further : he believes that Google is manipulating “ auto - suggest ” results to hide an email scandal that skeptics say undermines the science of climate change .

“ Google wants us to believe nobody is searching for Climategate despite it being such a big story , but I have evidence that it ’s merely a coverup for political purposes , ” Red Stater Neil Stevens wrote Thursday .
“ My evidence is in the behavior of the feature itself .
Watch what happens if you type in Climatega , nearly typing in the entire word Climategate . ”
This image follows .
“ Well that ’s odd , ” he continues .
“ Nobody ’s searching for climategate at all .
But wait :
It ’s not showing me words that start with Climatega .
Rather , it ’s showing me words that start with Climategua .
Seems like a bug , right ?
Like those letters got pointed to the wrong place , almost . ”
“ Let ’s back it up a letter , ” he adds , “ and type in Climateg . ”

Stevens reports that he tried one more time — simply typing in climate .
“ Well what do we have here ? ” he remarks .
“ Climate gate scandal .
Oops .
They erased climategate but did n’t erase climate gate .
Somebody did an incomplete job of sending the story down the memory hole .

STEERING CLEAR OF ECONOMIC ‘ SUICIDE ’….
There ’s been no shortage of talk in recent weeks about shifting the economic focus away from recovery efforts and towards deficit reduction .
About two weeks ago , for example , a Washington Post report suggested President Obama and his team want to spur job growth , but they ’re principally concerned with keeping the deficit in check .
Since then , we ’ve seen ample evidence to the contrary .
The president , this week , said , “ [ I ] f we ca n’t grow our economy , then it is going to be that much harder for us to reduce the deficit .
The single most important thing we could do right now for deficit reduction is to spark strong economic growth , which means that people who ’ve got jobs are paying taxes , and businesses that are making profits … are paying taxes .
That ’s the most important thing we can do . ”
This morning , leading members of the White House economic team agreed that job creation and economic growth have to take precedence .
President Barack Obama ’s top economic adviser says creating jobs takes priority over reducing the country ’s red ink in the next year .
Larry Summers says priority No. 1 must be getting people back to work and lowering the country ’s 10 percent unemployment rate .
Summers says only then can the Obama administration begin working to reduce the deficit — a problem he blames largely on the Bush administration .
Specifically , Summers told CNN that “ there ’s no more important issue facing the country than job growth . ”
Republicans , obviously , have made clear they prefer to focus on the deficit they created , but I ’m heartened to hear the administration argue otherwise .
The " dominant sex " — male — is not so dominant after all .
Forming solidarity on the eve of International Men's Day ( IMD ) on Thursday , pro-men activists in Bangalore are set to launch an All India Men 's Welfare Association and demand creation of a Men 's Welfare Ministry , among other things .
The Association has drafted a charter that asks for a holiday on IMD , paternity leave , and a study on the treatment men get in different spheres of socio-economic life .
The Association has asked all male employees in Bangalore to take mass leave on Thursday and " declare their independence and celebrate their freedom ” .
" Man is depicted as a fiend who is out to exploit women .

Virag is rich in details and ladles out examples where men are silent sufferers : " First , discrimination comes in the form of false image of dominance : man should not cry , he should shoulder responsibility for the welfare of women , he must do all risky tasks .
Giving them false values are the scriptures that put man at a psychological disadvantage .
In society , right from the elementary schools to the judiciary , he is suspect till he proves himself otherwise . "
" The government even has an Animal Welfare Board but the sex that gives 82 per cent tax revenue and does all the unpleasant and hazardous jobs , the fruit of which is mainly enjoyed by women , have no place in India 's scheme of things , " regrets the new body 's website aimwa .

For instance , government gives great importance to breast cancer and blood cancer in women , but hardly anything on prostrate cancer , a disease men are prone to .
In advertisements and cartoons , a male is portrayed as stupid , while women are witty and smart .
" Mithun Kumar , one of the leaders , told DNA , " In every step , a man suffers ignominy .
To take the latest example , look at how the media treated the case of a woman who barged into the marriage hall .
The man had no voice , nobody believed him or asked for his view . "
Kumar says even the World Economic Forum keeps harping on the dwindling population of girls without any valid study .
“ It 's unfortunately true that men are becoming victims of ‘ legal terrorism ’ unleashed through laws like Indian Penal Code Section 498A , Protection of Women Against Domestic Violence Act , adultery laws and many other laws , all loaded against men , " says veteran lawyer of many fights , MG Kumar .

Amazing that a ) there appears to have been no means to alert people ( not just officials ) in Cork city in time that the dam were to be let out and b ) that there appear in many cases to have been no local or building specific plans put into effect to deal with a deluge , the Mercy hospital being a notable exception .
In dealing with a ) we should say there is in fact a cell broadcast facility in mobile phone technology that would have allowed everyone with a mobile defined by cells to be notified that the dam was about to let out and to take action accordingly .
Sure , local radio is very popular in more rural areas but the mentality wherever you happen to be that you should be sat by the radio to ensure that you hear about the warning is utterly arse over backwards .
Why the state in awarding mobiles licences does n’t make use of the access to the network in emergencies is beyond me .
As for b ) taking the city library in Cork as an example , what was the action plan that building had for dealing with emergencies ?
Books in boxes moved to higher ground would have taken a few hours with 15 / 20 people and saved tens of thousands .
Its like they say about having your own fire plans for your home , if there is an alarm then know what is it you are going to do when it sounds .

The claim was both simple and terrifying : that temperatures on planet Earth are now ‘ likely the highest in at least the past 1,300 years ’ .

Yet some of the scientists who helped to draft it , The Mail on Sunday can reveal , harboured uncomfortable doubts .
In the words of one , David Rind from the US space agency Nasa , it ‘ looks like there were years around 1000 AD that could have been just as warm ’ .
Keith Briffa from the University of East Anglia ’s Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) , which plays a key role in forming IPCC assessments , urged caution , warning that when it came to historical climate records , there was no new data , only the ‘ same old evidence ’ that had been around for years .
‘ Let us not try to over - egg the pudding , ’ he wrote in an email to an IPCC colleague in September 2006 .
‘ True , there have been many different techniques used to aggregate and scale data - but the efficacy of these is still far from established . ’
But when the ‘ warmest for 1,300 years ’ claim was published in 2007 in the IPCC ’s fourth report , the doubters kept silent .
It is only now that their concerns have started to emerge from the thousands of pages of ‘ Warmergate ’ emails leaked last month from the CRU ’s computers , along with references to performing a ‘ trick ’ to ‘ hide ’ temperature decline and instructions to resist all efforts by the CRU ’s critics to use the Freedom of Information
Act to check the unit ’s data and conclusions .
Last week , as an official inquiry by the former civil servant Sir Muir Russell began , I tried to assess Warmergate ’s wider significance .
The CRU ’s supporters insisted it was limited .
‘ In the long term , it will make very little difference to the scientific consensus , and to the way politicians respond to it , ’ Professor Trevor Davies , the university ’s Pro-Vice Chancellor and a former CRU director , told me .
‘ I am certain that the science is rock solid . ’
He admitted that his CRU colleagues had sometimes used ‘ injudicious phrases ’ , but that was because they kept on being ‘ diverted ’ from their work by those who wished to scrutinise it .
‘ It ’s understandable that sometimes people get frustrated , ’ he said .
The only lesson the affair had for him was that ‘ we have got to get better in terms of explanation .
Some scientists still find it quite it difficult to communicate with the public . ’
Others , however , were less optimistic .
Roger Pielke , Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Colorado , could in no sense be described as a climate change sceptic , let alone a ‘ denier ’ .
‘ Human - caused climate change is real , and I ’m a strong advocate for action , ’ he said .
‘ But I ’m also a strong advocate for integrity in science . ’
Pielke ’s verdict on the scandal is damning .
‘ These emails open up the possibility that big scientific questions we ’ve regarded as settled may need another look .
' They reveal that some of these scientists saw themselves not as neutral investigators but as warriors engaged in battle with the so - called sceptics .
‘ They have lost a lot of credibility and as far as their being leading spokespeople on this issue of huge public importance , there is no going back . ’
Climate science is complicated , and often the only way to make sense of raw data is through sophisticated statistical computer programs .
The consequence is that most lay individuals - politicians and members of the public alike - have little choice but to take the assurances of scientists such as Davies on trust .
He and other ‘ global warmists ’ often insist that when it comes to the IPCC ’s main conclusions - that the Earth is in a period of potentially catastrophic warming and that the main culprit is man-made greenhouse gas emission - no serious scientist dissents from the conventional view .
Hence , perhaps , Gordon Brown ’s recent comment that those who disagree are ‘ behind - the - times , antiscience , flat - Earth climate sceptics ’ .
In fact , there is a large body of highly - respected academic experts who fiercely contest this thesis : people such as Richard Lindzen , Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a disillusioned former IPCC member , and Dr Tom Segalstad , head of geology at Oslo University , who has stated that ‘ most leading geologists throughout the world know that the IPCC ’s view of Earth processes are implausible if not impossible ’ .
These dissenters focus their criticisms on the IPCC ’s analysis of the way the atmosphere works and the models it uses to predict the future .
However , Warmergate strikes at something more fundamental - the science that justifies the basic assumption that the present warming really is unprecedented , at least in the past few thousand years .
Take the now - notorious email that the CRU ’s currently suspended director , Dr Phil Jones , sent to his IPCC colleagues on November 16 , 1999 , when he wrote he had ‘ just completed Mike ’s Nature trick ’ and had so managed to ‘ hide the decline ’ .
For example , some suggest that the ‘ medieval warm period ’ was considerably warmer than even 1998 .
Of course , this is inconvenient to climate change believers because there were no cars or factories pumping out greenhouse gases in 1000 AD - yet the Earth still warmed .
The CRU ’s supporters have protested bitterly about the attention paid to this message .
In the course of an extraordinary BBC interview in which he called an American critic an ‘**** hole ’ live on air , Jones ’s colleague Professor Andrew Watson insisted that the fuss was completely unjustified , because all Jones had been talking about was ‘ tweaking a diagram ’ .
Davies told me that the email had been ‘ taken out of context ’ adding : ‘ One definition of the word “ trick ” is “ the best way of doing something ” .
What Phil did was standard practice and the facts are out there in the peer - reviewed literature . ’
However , the full context of that ‘ trick ’ email , as shown by a new and until now unreported analysis by the Canadian climate statistician Steve McIntyre , is extremely troubling .
Derived from close examination of some of the thousands of other leaked emails , he says it suggests the ‘ trick ’ undermines not only the CRU but the IPCC .
There is a widespread misconception that the ‘ decline ’
Jones was referring to is the fall in global temperatures from their peak in 1998 , which probably was the hottest year for a long time .
In fact , its subject was more technical - and much more significant .
It is true that , in Watson ’s phrase , in the autumn of 1999 Jones and his colleagues were trying to ‘ tweak ’ a diagram .
But it was n’t just any old diagram .
It was the chart displayed on the first page of the ‘ Summary for Policymakers ’ of the 2001 IPCC report - the famous ‘ hockey stick ’ graph that has been endlessly reproduced in everything from newspapers to primary - school textbooks ever since , showing centuries of level or declining temperatures until a dizzying , almost vertical rise in the late 20th Century .
There could be no simpler or more dramatic representation of global warming , and if the origin of worldwide concern over climate change could be traced to a single image , it would be the hockey stick .
Drawing a diagram such as this is far from straightforward .
Gabriel Fahrenheit did not invent the mercury thermometer until 1724 , so scientists who want to reconstruct earlier climate history have to use ‘ proxy data ’ - measurements derived from records such as ice cores , tree - rings and growing season dates .
However , different proxies give very different results .
For example , some suggest that the ‘ medieval warm period ’ , the 350 - year era that started around 1000 , when red wine grapes flourished in southern England and the Vikings tilled now - frozen farms in Greenland , was considerably warmer than even 1998 .
Of course , this is inconvenient to climate change believers because there were no cars or factories pumping out greenhouse gases in 1000 AD - yet the Earth still warmed .
Some tree - ring data eliminates the medieval warmth altogether , while others reflect it .
In September 1999 , Jones ’s IPCC colleague Michael Mann of Penn State University in America - who is now also the subject of an official investigation -- was working with Jones on the hockey stick .
As they debated which data to use , they discussed a long tree - ring analysis carried out by Keith Briffa .
Briffa knew exactly why they wanted it , writing in an email on September 22 : ‘ I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards “ apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more ” . ’
But his conscience was troubled .
‘ In reality the situation is not quite so simple - I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1,000 years ago . ’
Agenda :
An Iceberg projection highlighting the Copenhagen UN summit shows the high level of political interest in climate change - and why scientists may be desperate to prove it is a man-made problem we can solve
Another British scientist - Chris Folland of the Met Office ’s Hadley Centre - wrote the same day that using Briffa ’s data might be awkward , because it suggested the past was too warm .
This , he lamented , ‘ dilutes the message rather significantly ’ .
Over the next few days , Briffa , Jones , Folland and Mann emailed each other furiously .
Mann was fearful that if Briffa ’s trees made the IPCC diagram , ‘ the sceptics [ would ] have a field day casting doubt on our ability to understand the factors that influence these estimates and , thus , can undermine faith [ in them ] - I do n’t think that doubt is scientifically justified , and I ’d hate to be the one to have to give it fodder !’
Finally , Briffa changed the way he computed his data and submitted a revised version .
This brought his work into line for earlier centuries , and ‘ cooled ’ them significantly .
But alas , it created another , potentially even more serious , problem .
According to his tree rings , the period since 1960 had not seen a steep rise in temperature , as actual temperature readings showed - but a large and steady decline , so calling into question the accuracy of the earlier data derived from tree rings .
This is the context in which , seven
weeks later , Jones presented his ‘ trick ’ - as simple as it was deceptive .
All he had to do was cut off Briffa ’s inconvenient data at the point where the decline started , in 1961 , and replace it with actual temperature readings , which showed an increase .
On the hockey stick graph , his line is abruptly terminated - but the end of the line is obscured by the other lines .
‘ Any scientist ought to know that you just ca n’t mix and match proxy and actual data , ’ said Philip Stott , emeritus professor of biogeography at London ’s School of Oriental and African Studies .
‘ They ’re apples and oranges .
Yet that ’s exactly what he did . ’
Since Warmergate - broke , some of the CRU ’s supporters have claimed that Jones and his colleagues made a ‘ full disclosure ’ of what they did to Briffa ’s data in order to produce the hockey stick .
But as McIntyre points out , ‘ contrary to claims by various climate scientists , the IPCC Third Assessment Report did not disclose the deletion of the post - 1960 values ’ .
On the final diagram , the cut off was simply concealed by the other lines .
By 2007 , when the IPCC produced its fourth report , McIntyre had become aware of the manipulation of the Briffa data and Briffa himself , as shown at the start of this article , continued to have serious qualms .
McIntyre by now was an IPCC ‘ reviewer ’ and he urged the IPCC not to delete the post - 1961 data in its 2007 graph .
‘ They refused , ’ he said , ‘ stating this would be “ inappropriate ” . ’
‘ Any scientist ought to know that you just ca n’t mix and match proxy and actual data ’
Yet even this , Pielke told me , may not ultimately be the biggest consequence of Warmergate .
Some of the most controversial leaked emails concern attempts by Jones and his colleagues to avoid disclosure of the CRU ’s temperature database - its vast library of readings from more than 1,000 weather stations around the world , the ultimate resource that records how temperatures have changed .
In one email from 2005 , Jones warned Mann not to leave such data lying around on searchable websites , because ‘ you never know who is trawling them ’ .
Critics such as McIntyre had been ‘ after the CRU station data for years .
If they ever hear there is a Freedom of Information Act now in the UK , I think I ’ll delete the file rather than send to anyone ’ .
Yesterday Davies said that , contrary to some reports , none of this data has in fact been deleted .
But in the wake of the scandal , its reliability too is up for grabs .
The problem is that , just like tree rings or ice cores , readings from thermometers or electronic ‘ thermistors ’ are open to interpretation .
The sites of weather stations that were once open countryside become built up areas , so trapping heat , and the type of equipment used changes over time .
The result is what climate scientists call ‘ inhomogeneities ’ - anomalies between readings that need to be ‘ adjusted ’ .
But can we trust the way such ‘ adjustments ’ are made ?
Last week , an article posted on a popular climate sceptic website analysed the data from the past 130 years in Darwin , Australia .
This suggested that average temperatures had risen there by about two degrees Celsius .
However , the raw data had been ‘ adjusted ’ in a series of abrupt upward steps by exactly the same amount : without the adjustment , the Darwin temperature record would have stayed level .
In 2007 , McIntyre examined records across America .
He found that between 1999 and 2007 , the US equivalent of the Met Office had changed the way it adjusted old data .
The result was to make the Thirties seem cooler , and the years since 1990 much warmer .
Previously , the warmest year since records began in America had been 1934 .
CRU ' ca n't be trusted ' says MP Norman Lamb
The MP whose father founded the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia says it is important that trust in the unit ’s work is restored .
Liberal Democrat frontbencher Norman Lamb is the son of Professor Hubert Lamb , who was the first director of the CRU in 1971 .
Under his leadership , it gained an international reputation for authoritative and ground - breaking research .
Last night , Norman Lamb , MP for North Norfolk , said : ‘ My father was always very concerned that the highest possible standards were met .
' The university has done the right thing in calling for an independent investigation .
‘ It is of critical importance that trust is re-established .
We want truth and accuracy , both in small detail and the bigger picture . ’
Prof Lamb died in 1997 , aged 84 .
Now , in line with CRU and IPCC orthodoxy , it was 1998 .
At the CRU , said Davies , some stations ’ readings were adjusted by unit and in such cases , raw and adjusted data could be compared .
But in about 90 per cent of cases , the adjustment was carried out in the countries that collected the data , and the CRU would not know exactly how this had been done .
Davies said : ‘ All I can say is that the process is careful and considered .
To get the details , the best way would be to go the various national meteorological services . ’
The consequences of that , Stott said , may be explosive .
‘ If you take Darwin , the gap between the two just looks too big .
‘ If that applies elsewhere , it ’s going to get really interesting .
It ’s no longer going to be good enough for the Met Office and CRU to put the data out there .
‘ To know we can trust it , we ’ve got to know what adjustments have been made , and why . ’
Last week , at the Copenhagen climate summit , the Met Office said that the Noughties have been the warmest decade in history .
Depending on how the data has been adjusted , Stott said , that statement may not be true .
Pielke agreed .
‘ After Climategate , the surface temperature record is being called into question . ’
To experts such as McIntyre and Pielke , perhaps the most baffling thing has been the near - unanimity over global warming in the world ’s mainstream media - a unanimity much greater than that found among scientists .
In part , this is the result of strongarm tactics .
For example , last year the BBC environment reporter Roger Harrabin made substantial changes to an article on the corporation website that asked why global warming seemed to have stalled since 1998 - caving in to direct pressure from a climate change activist , Jo Abbess .
‘ Personally , I think it is highly irresponsible to play into the hands of the sceptics who continually promote the idea that “ global warming finished in 1998 ” when that is so patently not true , ’ she told him in an email .
After a brief exchange , he complied and sent a final note : ‘ Have a look in ten minutes and tell me you are happier .
We have changed headline and more . ’
Afterwards ,
Abbess boasted on her website : ‘ Climate Changers , Remember to challenge any piece of media that seems like it ’s been subject to spin or scepticism .
Here ’s my go for today .
The BBC actually changed an article I requested a correction for . ’
Last week , Michael Schlesinger , Professor of Atmospheric Studies at the University of Illinois , sent a still cruder threat to Andrew Revkin of the New York Times , accusing him of ‘ gutter reportage ’ , and warning : ‘ The vibe that I am getting from here , there and everywhere is that your reportage is very worrisome to most climate scientists ...
I sense that you are about to experience the “ Big Cutoff ” from those of us who believe we can no longer trust you , me included . ’
But in the wake of Warmergate , such threats - and the readiness to bow to them - may become rarer .
‘ A year ago , if a reporter called me , all I got was questions about why I ’m trying to deny climate change and am threatening the future of the planet , ’ said Professor Ross McKitrick of Guelph University near Toronto , a long - time collaborator with McIntyre .
‘ Now , I ’m getting questions about how they did the hockey stick and the problems with the data .
‘ Maybe the emails have started to open people ’s eyes . ’
Yes , emails came from here - but we did n't do it , say Russians
Tomsk : Emails were sent from this Siberian town
Russian secret service agents admitted yesterday that the hacked ‘ Warmergate ’ emails were uploaded on a Siberian internet server , but strenuously denied a clandestine state - sponsored operation to wreck the Copenhagen summit .
The FSB - formerly the KGB - confirmed that thousands of messages to and from scientists at the University of East Anglia ’s Climatic Research Unit were distributed to the world from the city of Tomsk , as revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week .
Now , it has emerged that IT experts specialising in hacking techniques were brought in by the Russian authorities following this newspaper ’s exposure of the Tomsk link .
They have gathered evidence about how and where the operation was carried out , although they are not prepared to say at this stage who they think was responsible .
A Russian intelligence source claimed the FSB had new information which could cast light on who was behind the elaborate operation .
‘ We are not prepared to release details , but we might if the false claims about the FSB ’s involvement do not stop , ’ he said .
‘ The emails were uploaded to the Tomsk server but we are sure this was done from outside Russia . ’
The Kremlin ’s top climate change official , Alexander Bedritsky , denied the Russian government was involved in breaking into the CRU ’s computer system .
GRUB 2 is the default boot loader and manager for Ubuntu since version 9.10 ( Karmic Koala ) .
As the computer starts , GRUB 2 either presents a menu and awaits user input or automatically transfers control to an operating system kernel .
GRUB 2 is a descendant of GRUB ( GRand Unified Bootloader ) .
It has been completely rewritten to provide the user significantly increased flexibility and performance .
GRUB 2 is Free Software .
In this guide , GRUB 2 is version 1.98 or later .
GRUB legacy ( version 0.97 ) will be referred to as GRUB .
To determine your version , use grub - install - V .
Grub version 1.99 became the default on Ubuntu 11.04 ( Natty Narwhal ) and introduced some major changes in the Grub file contents .
This guide covers the use of Grub 1.98 , the Grub release found in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS ( Lucid Lynx ) . and Grub 1.99 , packaged with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ( Precise Pangolin ) .
Content reflecting other versions of Grub 2 will be noted in the appropriate entry .
Improvements
GRUB 2's major improvements over the original GRUB include :
Scripting support including conditional statements and functions
Dynamic module loading
Rescue mode
Custom Menus
Themes
Graphical boot menu support and improved splash capability
Boot LiveCD ISO images directly from hard drive
New configuration file structure
Non-x86 platform support ( such as PowerPC )
Universal support for UUIDs ( not just Ubuntu )
GRUB vs GRUB 2
GRUB 2's default menu will look familiar to GRUB users but there are a great number of differences beneath the surface .
On a new installation of Ubuntu 9.10 or later with no other installed operating systems , GRUB 2 will boot directly to the login prompt or Desktop .
No menu will be displayed .
Hold down ( right ) SHIFT to display the menu during boot .
In certain cases , pressing the ESC key may also display the menu .
No / boot / grub / menu.lst .
It has been replaced by / boot / grub / grub.cfg .
There is no " / find boot / grub / stage1 " at the grub prompt .
Stage 1.5 has been eliminated .
The main Grub 2 configuration file , normally located in the / boot / grub folder , is grub.cfg .
It is the product of various scripts and should not normally be edited directly .
grub.cfg is overwritten by certain Grub 2 package updates , whenever a kernel is added or removed , or when the user runs update - grub .
The menu list of available Linux kernels is automatically generated by running update - grub .
The user can create a custom file in which the user can place his own menu entries .
This file will not be overwritten .
By default , a custom file named 40 _custom is available for use in the /etc / grub.d folder .
The primary configuration file for changing menu display settings is called grub and by default is located in the /etc / default folder .
There are multiple files for configuring the menu - /etc / default / grub mentioned above , and all the files in the /etc / grub.d/ directory .
Partition numbering has changed .
The first partition is now 1 rather than 0 .
The first device / drive is still hd0 by default ( no change ) .
These designations can be altered if necessary in the device .map file in the / boot / grub folder .
Automated searches for other operating systems , such as Windows , are accomplished whenever update - grub is executed .
Operating systems found will be placed in the Grub 2 menu .
Changes made in the configuration files will not take effect until the update - grub command is executed .
Upgrading to GRUB 2 From GRUB
GRUB 2 is the default bootloader for Ubuntu .
Users who still have Grub 0.97 installed on their Ubuntu systems can upgrade to GRUB 2 by installing the currently - supported releases of Ubuntu or by enabling repositories which contain the GRUB 2 package grub-pc .
Please visit the Grub2 / Upgrading community documentation for more information and instructions .
File Structure
GRUB 2 incorporates a totally revised directory and file hierarchy .
The major GRUB 2 folders include / etc / grub.d , which contains the main GRUB 2 scripts , and / boot / grub , which contains the GRUB 2 modules and menu file ( grub.cfg ) .
User customization 's are normally made to the /etc / default / grub file .
The description of the major GRUB 2 folders and files is located on the Grub2 / Setup community documentation page .
Configuring GRUB 2
Configuration changes are normally made to the /etc / default / grub file and to the custom scripts located in /etc / grub.d .
No changes are made to the GRUB 2 menu until the update - grub command is run as root .
This command runs the GRUB 2 configuration scripts and updates the / boot / grub / grub.cfg file .
Descriptions of the GRUB 2 options and how to change them are presented on the Grub2 / Setup community documentation page .
Boot Display Behavior
GRUB 2 loads before any operating system .
Its modular components are loaded on an as - needed basis .
Menu display behavior is generally determined by settings in /etc / default / grub .
Review the " Configuring GRUB 2 " section above for specific entry and formatting guidance .
Initial Default
If no other operating system is detected GRUB 2 will boot straight into the default operating system and no menu will be displayed .
If another operating system is detected the GRUB 2 menu will display .
Timed Display
The menu is displayed for a predetermined number of seconds .
The default entry is highlighted and other selections may be made by the user until the timeout expires .
The default timeout is 2 seconds .
The timer continues until any key is pressed or the highlighted entry is selected by pressing ENTER .
If no user input is made GRUB 2 boots the default entry at the end of the timeout period .
Once a key has been pressed the timeout is deactivated and the user must make a selection manually .
The default entry is determined by the GRUB_DEFAULT= setting in /etc / default / grub ; the first " menuentry " has a value of " 0 " .
Hidden
Normal Hidden Operations Enabled :
No menu entries are displayed .
The splash screen , if configured , will be displayed .
The time the screen remains blank but available for display is determined by a setting in /etc / default / grub ( GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT )
GRUB 2 can display a countdown timer to provide visual feedback on the time remaining until the default selection is chosen .
The timeout setting is enabled in /etc / default / grub ( GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET )
The user may display the menu by pressing any key .
Once the menu displays , the GRUB_TIMEOUT counter begins .
Pressing any key stops the countdown .
If no key is pressed by the end of the timeout the default entry determined by settings in /etc / default / grub will be selected .
Hidden Menu Operations Not Expected ( Abnormal ) :
The user may be able to display the menu in one or more of the following ways :
Holding down the SHIFT key early in the boot process until the menu displays .
GRUB 2 searches for a depressed SHIFT key signal during boot .
If the key is pressed or GRUB 2 cannot determine the status of the key , the menu is displayed .
Pressing the ESC key during a 3 second window as GRUB 2 runs .
Saved
Saving an OS can be achieved by running sudo grub - set - default if GRUB_DEFAULT =saved is set in /etc / default / grub .
It may also be saved if GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true is also set in /etc / default / grub .
In this case , the default OS remains until a new OS is manually selected from the GRUB 2 menu or the grub - set - default command is executed .
Last Boot Failed or Boot into Recovery Mode
If the last boot failed or after a boot into Recovery Mode the menu will be displayed until the user makes a selection .
To change this behaviour , edit /etc / default / grub and add the variable GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT .
Set the value similar to setting for GRUB_TIMEOUT .
For - 1 , there will be no countdown and thus the menu will display .
For 0 , menu will not display even for a failed startup .
For >=1 , menu will display for the specified number of seconds .
Run update - grub after the change have been made .
In some cases trick with GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT does n't work .
In such a case edit / etc / grub.d/00 _header and change value of timeout in line 236 ( this line is in the make_timeout ( ) function )
set timeout= -
1
to the the value as described above .
Run update - grub after the change have been made .
Special thanks to McCunha on Ubuntu Forums for the above tip .
The above change , however , still causes GRUB2 to boot into text graphics mode .
Thus , an additional change is required .
Edit /etc / grub.d/10_linux and change line 188 to
set linux_gfx_mode=keep
Once again , run update - grub after the change has been made .
Password Protection
GRUB 2 is capable of password - protecting menu editing , access to the GRUB 2 terminal , and specific or all menu entries .
It can also limit access to specific entries for specific users , and can encrypt plain - text passwords for increased security .
Please refer to the Grub2 / Passwords community documentation .
Custom Menu Entries
GRUB 2 allows users to create customized menu selections which will be automatically added to the main menu when sudo update - grub is executed .
A 40 _custom file is available in / etc / grub.d/ for use or to serve as an example to create other custom menus .
Information on building and using custom menus in GRUB 2 is located in the Grub2 / CustomMenus community document .
Troubleshooting
GRUB 2 provides excellent capabilities for troubleshooting and correcting boot problems from the boot menu or GRUB 2 terminal .
Troubleshooting and recovery procedures are detailed in the Grub2 / Troubleshooting community document which also includes a section Selected_Problems_and_Bugs .
Fixing reboot / shutdown freezes
If your machine freezes upon attempts to shutdown or reboot , try modifying / etc / default / grub .
Open the file with gksudo gedit / etc / default / grub ( graphical interface ) or sudo nano / etc / default / grub ( command - line ) .
Any other plaintext editor ( Vim , Emacs , Kate , Leafpad ) is fine too .
Find the line that starts with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and add reboot=bios to the end .
If done properly it should result in something like GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = " quiet splash reboot=bios "
Then save the file , run sudo update - grub and reboot in any way that 's possible for you .
After that , reboots and shutdowns should start working properly .
With certain hardware ( notably DELL ) the kernel parameter that you add needs to be reboot=pci ( instead of reboot=bios ) , the procedure remains the same .
Displays
GRUB 2 can do more than provide a simple black & white menu .
Its menu can be customized by the user to present a more visually - appealing menu by changing font colors , backgrounds and resolutions .
For information on using splash images and changing font colors and menu resolutions , please refer to the Grub2 / Displays community documentation .
Themes
GRUB 2
Theming is still under development , as is integration with gfxmenu .
Theme elements will include colors , fonts , progress indicators , menus , and labels .
Both of these hold great promise but are not ready for release with Ubuntu 9.10 .
Check the Links section at the bottom of this page for references .

Please visit the Grub2 / Installing community documentation .
Information concerning upgrades from GRUB 0.97 ( Legacy ) to GRUB 2 is now located at Grub2 / Upgrading .
Booting an ISO from a Menuentry
Ubuntu ISOs , as well as many utility ISOs and some other Linux operating systems , can be booted from a hard drive via a GRUB menuentry .
This eliminates the need to create a CD / DVD and allows bootable image files to be stored only on the hard drive .
For information on this Grub 2 feature , please visit the Grub2 / ISOBoot community documentation page .
Security
Preventing booting via Grub command - line
The ability to manually boot using the Grub command - line constitutes the biggest security risk in Linux .
Any OS can be booted in this manner from any USB or CD / DVD drive , circumventing BIOS restrictions .
Placing passwords or locking menu items ( in the Grub configuration files ) does not prevent a user from booting manually using commands entered at the grub command - line .
( Once a foreign OS is booted , of course , it can be used to access any part of an unencrypted hard drive ) .
There are currently no options to prevent the command - line usage of Grub .
Doing so would restrict boot - loading to just the menu options and that is not considered wise
Miscellaneous
Booting from a serial console
If you want GRUB to operate over a serial line , you will need to uncomment GRUB_TERMINAL in /etc / default / grub and set it to serial ( instead of the console default ) .
Alternatively , you can add GRUB_TERMINAL =" console serial " to have the grub menu on both serial and local console .
The default serial console settings are to operate on the first serial port ( ttyS0 ) at a 9600 bit /s transfer rate with 8 data bits , 1 stop bit and no parity .
If you want to use another serial port or if your console uses different settings , you must add a GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND line to specify additional parameters to the serial command .
The serial command in GRUB 2 uses the same syntax as its GRUB Legacy counterpart ( documented here ) .
For example , for a very common 9600 bit/s ( baud ) serial line with 8 data bits , 1 stop bit and no parity :
GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND=" serial -- unit=0 --speed=9600 -- word=8 -- parity=no -- stop=1 "
An example is a 4800 bit/s ( baud ) serial line with 7 data bits , 1 stop bit and even parity :
GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND=" serial -- unit=0 --speed=4800 -- word=7 --parity=even -- stop=1 "

An American military officer who served at the border in 2003 and 2004 recalled Taliban fighters waving their rifles from the Pakistani side to taunt the Americans .
“ Our rules said we could n’t follow them and we could n’t shoot at them unless they shot at us , ” the officer said .
“ But when we saw them over the border , we knew we should expect an attack that night .
The only ones who recognized the border were us , with our G.P.S. ”
That has been changing all year , however , and it is about to change even more , as the Americans gear up for an intensified war on both sides of the line simultaneously .
The dispatch of 30,000 additional Americans to the Afghan side of the border will occur simultaneously with more intensive missile strikes from drone aircraft and Pakistani army offensives on the other side .
Ever since Osama bin Laden escaped American forces in December 2001 , crossing the mountains of Tora Bora from Afghanistan into Pakistan , American strategists have spoken of a “ hammer and anvil ” strategy to crush the militants .
Until now , the border has proven so porous , and Pakistani governments so squeamish about a fight , that the American hammer in Afghanistan was pounding Taliban fighters there against a Pakistani pillow , not an anvil .

Now , Mr. Obama ’s added troops are likely to be concentrated in the Taliban stronghold in Helmand and Kandahar in southern Afghanistan , and near Khost in the east .
At the same time , the president has approved a major intensification of drone strikes in Pakistan , even as the Pakistani army continues a campaign against the militants launched this fall in South Waziristan , following on a counterattack that swept militants last spring from the Swat Valley .
“ We finally have an opportunity to do a real hammer - and - anvil strategy on the border , ” said Michael O’Hanlon , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who follows the Afghan war .
“ We ’ve never done it before because we ’ve had insufficient strength on both sides of the border or insufficient political will on the Pakistani side . ”
For years , in fact , Pakistani intelligence has played a double game with Islamist extremists , nurturing them as a force to use against Pakistan ’s archrival India in the disputed territory of Kashmir and helping create the Taliban as a buffer against Indian influence in Afghanistan .
But as the mujahedeen who fought the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s later turned on their American benefactors , so some militants in Pakistan have begun attacking the state that once encouraged them .
Many in the Pakistani elite were stunned by the emergence in 2007 of the Pakistani Taliban and by the subsequent campaign of terrorist attacks against Pakistan ’s power structure , including the assassination of Benazir Bhutto , suicide bombings in cities and an attack on the army headquarters in Rawalpindi in October .
The Command Economy
America is transforming itself , without forethought , debate , or pause , into a command economy .
A command economy is a top - down , state - controlled economy directed by planners and bureaucrats , boards and bodies , administrators and authorities .
A command economy is not characterized by mutuality of interest and agreement between parties .
It relies on edict .
A command economy , as the name implies , orders the affairs of a nation by coercion .
In a free economy goods and services are bought and sold by consent ; business transactions are based on agreement ; contracts depend upon a meeting of the minds of the parties involved .
In a command economy government sets prices , controls and directs resources , and oversees production and consumption .
Free economies produce prosperity ; command economies produce poverty .
The transformation of America is already taking place at breakneck speed , even before the current economic crisis is full blown .
Historical precedents insist that as conditions worsen , the transformation into a command economy will accelerate .
It is astonishing that this should be taking place , especially at a time in which three billion people around the globe have rejected the poverty , want and shortages of their command economies to begin the experience and blessings of abundance .
It is not as though object lessons are wanting .
China ’s stunning economic growth , its modernization and rising living standards are the result of nothing more complicated than freeing the command economy .
Although lessons abound , Americans are choosing — or perhaps failing to choose and therefore letting the choice be made for them — to go in much the same direction as the command economy of postwar Great Britain .
That period saw the nationalization of entire sectors of the British economy , a currency crisis and prolonged economic decline including crippling unemployment and choking inflation .
The reasons that the United States would choose to follow a pattern that hollows out economies the way it did the British are many .
But as a symptom , although not a cause of this self - inflicted harm , look to the modern American politician .
For today ’s breed of politician , power is their very passion .
Their every concern and the entire public debate about politicians centers around the use of power .
How may power best be exploited and aggrandized ?
Who is to be bailed out , who is to be plundered to pay for it ?
Who is to be subsidized , who penalized ?
Who shall be taxed and who shall be paid ?
In contrast , the founders looked upon power very differently : How can it be kept in check ?
In yielding to the former and to their command economy , the current generation of Americans , blessed with so much , will be the shame of the ages .
Anyone believing the evidence for the looming command economy is being overstated need look no further than the speed at which American finance has been nationalized in the current crisis .
Legislators voted an initial $ 700 billion bailout package , but in no time the taxpayers ended up with more than eighteen times that , $ 12.8 trillion in loans , spending , and guarantees .
And to make clear who is really in charge , the giveaways are accompanies by a refusal of the authorities to disclose who is getting what and what kind of collateral , if any , is being given .
The trend was dramatically illustrated in October 2008 .
In a development that played out like a scene from The Godfather , the CEOs of the nine largest banks in America , dealmakers and negotiators in their right , were ushered into a room at the Treasury Department in Washington and handed a one - page document agreeing to sell preferred shares to the government .
They were told by Henry Paulson , according to the New York Times account , that they must sign it before leaving .
The chairman of Wells Fargo protested that his institution did n’t have problems with toxic mortgages and did n’t need a bailout .
Too bad .
“ It was a take it or take it offer , ” said one insider .
An online writer for The Wall Street Journal favorably likened Paulson ’s commandeering of the banks to Reagan at the Berlin Wall .
“ History often carries an air of inevitability , ” he gushed .
If there is inevitability to America ’s becoming a command economy , it is a sorrowful day for human freedom .
The Central Plan of the command economy is incompatible with dissent , disagreement , individual preferences , and your own plan , whatever it may be .
If the Central Plan is to prevent foreclosures on homeowners who can’t pay , then the plans of individuals whose resources will be used to prevent those foreclosures must give way .
If your individual plan and the Central Plan are in conflict , you will have to give up your plan .
As we have noted , a free economy rests on agreement , but a command economy is constructed of coercion .
One of the reasons ( among many to which I refer in my book The Dollar Meltdown ) that a command economy produces poverty has to do with the diversion of productive human effort .
In a free economy people provide services that are sought by others and they are rewarded for doing so .
Each individual ’s own wants and needs are met to the extent he finds ways to serve others .
But in a command economy enormous amounts of human effort are expended in attempts to influence or control the Central Plan .
This activity produces no new wealth .
It only seeks to divide what wealth already exists .
The command economy is not the exclusive province of either the left or the right , Republican or Democrat , Communist or Fascist , Stalinist or Nazi , Pol Pot , Mao , Chávez , or Ahmadinejad .
It is what they all have in common .
Just as war is the health of the state , economic turbulence is the state ’s opportunity for self - advancement .
As the unseen and destructive consequences of each new command and initiative unfold , new plans are created and commands issued to undo the latest harm .
In the current sequence , the Fed used its monetary monopoly to create artificial credit conditions ; the cheap money fueled a housing boom , which , like all bubbles , popped ; the monetary and fiscal authorities rushed in to bail out the banks ; the only means they have of bailing out the banks is to borrow or print more money .

December 23 , 2009
Bookended by Charles Darwin ’s 200th birthday in February and the 150th anniversary of his seminal work , The Origin of Species , in November , the year - long celebration of the great naturalist ’s work demonstrated that the intersection of religion and science continues to draw headlines .
In some cases , the year ’s events beautifully illustrated ways in which faith and reason may be embraced .
On February 15 , ( three days after Darwin ’s birthday ) more than 11,000 church leaders around the country and the world participated in what is now known as Evolution Sunday , in which pastors delivered sermons celebrating evolution ’s role as part of the awesome diversity of life , and Darwin ’s theory of natural selection as part of God ’s overall plan .
But other examples highlight the continued disconnect biblical literalists have regarding the subject of not only evolution , but of scientific thought in general .
By the time the November 24 anniversary of Origin rolled around nine months after Darwin ’s birthday , Young Earth creationist Ray Comfort was grabbing the religion headlines .
Comfort ’s best - known argument against evolution is the cultivated banana because it comes in a biodegradable package and is designed for easy gripping by the human hand .
Accompanied by former child actor Kirk Cameron , Comfort led a crusade at college campuses across the country to distribute altered copies of Origin .
Comfort penned an introduction for the new version in which he quotes from Mein Kampf in order to link Darwin to Adolf Hitler , accuses Darwin of being sexist , and argues falsely that there are no transitional fossils in the fossil record .
So , in the assessment of the top stories that intersect religion and science , there was some good news , some not - so - good news and some downright depressing news .
Of course , no list of the top science / religion stories can be done without first acknowledging the obvious political agenda some religious conservatives have in fostering this divide , and sadly , Rick Santorum is still at it .
The former Pennsylvania senator , who has long led efforts to combat the teaching of evolution in public schools , continues to rehash his failed attempt to insert intelligent design language into the federal No Child Left Behind Act .
In his December 17 column for the Philadelphia Inquirer , Santorum complained that scientists are trying to foist their viewpoints on people , and ( reality be damned ) “ Americans do n’t like being told what to believe . ”
Maybe because we have learned to be skeptical of ‘ scientific ’ claims , particularly those at war with our common sense — like the Darwinists ’ telling us for decades that we are just a slightly higher form of life than a bacterium that is here purely by chance , or the Environmental Protection Agency ’s informing us last week that man-made carbon dioxide — a gas that humans exhale and plants need to live , a gas that represents less than 0.1 percent of the atmosphere — is a dangerous pollutant threatening to overheat the world .
( While the newsroom at the Philadelphia Inquirer has been gutted , Santorum gets paid $ 1,750 per column to foist such misinformation on a poorly informed public . )
In all fairness , Santorum makes one good point : many Americans do n’t like being told what to believe .
The latest Harris poll released last week reveals that despite efforts in the past year to educate the public about evolution , Americans have not changed their views much since Harris ’ 2007 poll .
Forty - five percent of respondents indicated that they believe in evolution , 33 percent indicated that they do n’t believe in it , and 22 percent said they were n’t sure .
Meanwhile , 40 percent said they believe in creationism , 30 percent indicated that they do n’t , and 30 percent said they were not sure .
At times , the stories of 2009 revealed a clash between those defending science and those who would impose their religious views on others .
Sometimes , the stories revealed a connection , a joining together of two ways of looking at the world .
Other times the stories were about science explaining our religious notions ; still others sought to use religion to deny science .
So , in a decidedly unscientific assessment , here are the top religion - meets - science stories from the Year of Darwin :
1. “ Junk Science ” in Texas Classrooms
In April , fundamentalist Christian members of the Texas Board of Education inserted intelligent design code words into its science education requirements .
The wording includes directing students to analyze and evaluate “ sudden appearance ” in the fossil record and analyze the “ complexity of the cell . ”
The language prompted creationist and pro-intelligent design organizations like the Seattle - based Discovery Institute to claim victory “ for science education , ” but science educators say it actually opens the door to junk science .
2. How Do You Solve a Problem Like Religion ( In The Scientific Community ) ?
One of the most heated debates to take place this year did n’t get much attention from the mainstream media , but boiled over on the science blogs .
( And creationists say the scientific community is a monolith . )
The debate , which continues , is over how to reach out to people of religious faith .
At issue is what some have come to refer to as accommodationism , the idea among some scientists that the best way to encourage the acceptance of evolution specifically and science in general is to accommodate the beliefs of those of non-fundamentalist religious faith .
Many of the prominent voices embracing this idea are non-believers themselves , but they stress that one can hold both a belief in God and acceptance of science .
John Wilkins , a science blogger , pointed out the need for pragmatism in a June post on his blog Evolving Thoughts :
This is not just about strategy , but it is in part about strategy …
Making science the enemy of religion is going to have a single outcome , one that we can all predict .
It wo n’t be the death of religion .
Other scientists , such as PZ Myers and Richard Dawkins , say that belief in God is irrational , and accommodating religious faith is compromising science .
Responding to Wilkins ’ post , Myers wrote on his blog Pharyngula that , quite simply , its dishonest as a scientist to say that religion and science are compatible :
Religion is an archaic , failed mode of thinking that continues to demand greater respect than it deserves , and exploits tradition , fear , and emotion to maintain its undeserved position .
Wilkins tries to compare it to two dancers jostling for space on a dance floor , I prefer to think of it as one dancer , humanity , afflicted with lice , religion , and twitching and squirming unpleasantly while struggling with a persistent parasite .
3. Just Say No… To Louisiana
The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology ( SICB ) , one of the nation ’s leading scientific societies , took the unusual step in February to boycott Louisiana due to the state ’s new anti-science law .
In 2008 , lawmakers voted to pass the Science Education Act , which was signed into law by Gov. Bobby Jindal .
The law , based largely on wording from the pro-intelligent design Discovery Institute ’s sample academic freedom bill , explicitly says that teachers are permitted to use supplemental materials to teach critiques of evolution and opens the door to teaching creationism and intelligent design .
In response , SICB chose to hold its annual conference in Utah , whose state Board of Education recently passed a resolution recognizing that “ the Theory of Evolution is a major unifying concept in science . ”
4. Ms. Evolutionary Dead End 2009
When the 47 - million - year - old fossil Ida was first revealed in May , she was originally touted as a direct link from all primates to earlier life forms — in other words , a transitional fossil link of humans to our earlier ancestors .
But now it appears that Darwinius maxillae , as she ’s formally known , may have sat on a divergent branch of the primate family tree and that we are not her direct descendant after all .
Unveiled at a May press conference to much fanfare , Ida was supposed to be , as the media misleadingly referred to her , the “ missing link . ”
But a paper published in the October edition of Nature described her more of an evolutionary dead end .
Religious fundamentalists were quick to celebrate , saying it proves that there is little evidence to support evolution .
But scientists had been skeptical about Ida ’s significance from the beginning and while she may not be a direct ancestor , she does reveal important information about our origins .
Which leads us directly to …
5. Lucy ’s Older Sister
… Ardi .
Ida was n’t the only dramatic fossil unveiled this year .
Formally known as Ardipithecus ramidus , the 4.4 million - year - old Ardi ( for short ) was described in September in a series of papers in Science .
The Ardi find is significant because she likely predates by one million years Lucy , ( Australopithecus afarensis ) the previous fossil contender for earliest human lineage .
Within days , intelligent design supporters and creationists such as the Discovery Institute and the Institute for Creation Research expressed doubt about Ardi ’s significance due to the decomposition of her bones and some disagreement among scientists over whether she was bipedal .
While there is some scientific debate over whether Ardi may have walked upright , what most interests scientists is that she is believed to be more human - like and less chimp - like than expected .
This means that our closest cousins may have evolved or changed more in the past 4.4 million years than us and that our earlier ancestors were more like us than we imagined .
6. Climate - gate , Copenhagen , and the Two Christianities
It goes without saying that the November brouhaha over the hacking of some controversial emails from the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) could n’t have come at a worse time for the scientific community .
But it does n’t mean that the scientific consensus on man-made climate change is anything but clear .
While global climate - change talks were taking place in Copenhagen earlier this month , conservatives and right - wing media outlets crowed that the emails raise doubts about the validity of the science .
And just as fundamentalist Christians deny evolution , many of them also deny climate change .
Matt Frei of BBC World News America provides an interesting assessment of the division among evangelical Christians in a December 10 article :
The evangelical movement is split between those conservative Christians who suspect that climate change is an evil secular plot , concocted by the devil , Al Gore and “ the global government crowd ” — in the words of Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher — and those who passionately believe that good Christians need to be good custodians of the planet .
Two years ago I went to Liberty University in Virginia , the home of the late Jerry Falwell and asked a lecture room full of students if they believed in the threat of global warming .
Not a single hand went up .
I travelled up the road to the Eastern Mennonite College at Harrisonburg and asked a similar number of Christian students the same question .
Almost every hand shot up .
7. An Evangelical to Restore Scientific Integrity in DC ?
In August , much to the chagrin of new atheist Sam Harris , Francis Collins , an evangelical Christian who headed the Human Genome Project , was appointed director of the National Institutes of Health .
As a prominent scientist , Collins speaks often of his ability to embrace both his evangelical faith and the reality of evolution .
His book , The Language of God , expounds on his beliefs and explains how he came to them .
Collins has received criticism from some in the scientific community who say his religious ideas are irreconcilable with being a thinking scientist .
But others celebrated his appointment because of his solid science credentials , saying that after eight years of the Bush administration misusing science to serve its agenda , Collins ’ appointment , with his background as a geneticist in biomedical research , illustrates that Obama will honor his commitment to restoring scientific integrity to Washington .
8. Stem Sold
Less than four months after his appointment , Collins announced the approval of stem - cell line funding .
On December 2 , he said 13 new human embryonic stem - cell lines were approved for use in federally funded research .
President Obama issued the executive order approving the use of the lines in research .
President Bush had killed federal funding for such research , instead limiting research dollars to cell lines created before August 2001 .
Many conservative Christians oppose stem - cell research because they are harvested from embryos left over from fertility treatments .
Because the process destroys the embryo , they argue that it ’s akin to abortion .
In signing the executive order , Obama disagreed :
“ In recent years , when it comes to stem - cell research , rather than furthering discovery , our government has forced what I believe is a false choice between sound science and moral values , ” Obama said at the White House .
“ In this case , I believe the two are not inconsistent .
As a person of faith , I believe we are called to care for each other and work to ease human suffering .
I believe we have been given the capacity and will to pursue this research — and the humanity and conscience to do so responsibly . ”
9. God , Head
Early this year scientists determined which section of the brain is used for prayer and thoughts of God .
In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in February , cognitive neuroscientists at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke used functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI , to determine what happens to our brains when we think of God .
The scans showed that thoughts activated particular neural pathways , including those in the anterior prefrontal cortex .
This is the same portion of the brain that is used for empathy and understanding one ’s fellow human beings .
10 . Darwin Tours Egypt
In November , the British Council hosted the first Darwin conference in Egypt .
The event was more significant for where it was held ( in a conservative Muslim country where there is little teaching of evolutionary theory ) than for what was discussed : Darwin and his legacy .
Many of the 150 academics and college students who participated in the conference had little knowledge of evolutionary theory and thought incorrectly that Darwin put forth the idea that man came from monkeys , according to the New York Times .
( In fact , he said we share a common ancestor . )
According to the Times , “ the British Council framed the conference to seek middle ground , more than to promote confrontation .
While challenging a religious society to think seriously about evolution , it emphasized the possibility of reconciling a belief in divine creation with Darwin ’s theories of evolution and natural selection . ”

UPDATE
A leading Swiss politician who called for a ban on separate Jewish and Muslim cemeteries has back - tracked and apologized .
“ I am sorry .
I did n’t mean it like that , ” said Christophe Darbellay , leader of the country ’s Christian Democratic Party , according to the World Bulletin news site .
He said his declaration in a TV interview Tuesday night was “ about the principle that we all belong to the same Swiss society … but you ca n’t explain that in 15 seconds . ”

World Bulletin reports :
The Conference of European Rabbis criticised his comments on Thursday and said the Swiss minaret ban will fuel xenophobia and risks making Jews the next target of religious intolerance .
“ We do n’t have a situation of the extreme right in Europe attacking Jews because they are content to attack Muslims , ” Philip Carmel , the international relations director for the Conference of European Rabbis , told Reuters .
“ But the Swiss example is classic : it ’s not just Muslims who are going to be targeted by the extreme right . ”
ORIGINAL STORY FOLLOWS BELOW
Just a few days after Swiss voters approved of a ban on minarets in their country , the leader of a major Swiss political party is defending his call to ban separate Jewish and Muslim cemeteries .
According to Jewish news service JTA , Christophe Darbellay , head of the country ’s Christian Democratic Party , made the comment during a TV interview on Tuesday evening .
“ It does n’t bother me to be buried next to a person of another religion , ” Darbellay told the Swiss daily Le Matin on Thursday .
“ But I do n’t imagine that in this country , every religion or sect can have a separate cemetery in every town .
It would n’t be manageable to make these exceptions .
…
Principle requires that one does not distinguish on the basis of origin or religion . ”
JTA reports : “ Darbellay reportedly said that existing cemeteries would not be affected by a ban , but that there should be no separate cemeteries in the future . ”
The paper added that critics describe the Christian Democrat leader ’s move as an “ escalation ” of the political conflict between the Swiss and their Muslim minority .

On Sunday , by a vote of 58 percent to 42 percent , Swiss voters approved a ban on minarets — the towers that appear at the top of Muslim mosques — raising concerns in many corners of the world about religious oppression .
While it was n’t Darbellay ’s party that championed that move – the nationalist Swiss Peoples ’
Party had pushed for it — Darbellay has in the past argued in favor of a ban on Muslim burqas .
Of the country ’s Muslim minority , he said : “ The majority of them are integrated , but a minority refuses to respect our rules and dreams of Sharia law in place of our federal constitution , and that ’s unacceptable .
We are all equal under the same law . ”
Switzerland ’s minaret ban is reflective of growing fears about the “ Islamization ” of Europe , a hot political topic on the continent in recent years .
The move was condemned by the UN ’s human rights commissioner and even drew fire from Pope Benedict XVI .

Even the country ’s foreign minister warned that the minaret ban could pose a risk to Swiss security .
A few months ago the story about al - Qaida was how , under pressure in Afghanistan and Pakistan , it had largely been unravelled and its operational abilities degraded .
Now , after the attempted downing of a US jet bound for Detroit , the same sources – the US and UK intelligence agencies – say not only that al - Qaida is still a dangerous threat , but that it may have managed to export and reconstitute parts of its operations to Somalia and Yemen .
So what , precisely , should we believe ?
The reality is that there have always been Islamist groups in Africa who have described themselves as being al - Qaida .
While some have been more closely associated with the core of Osama bin Laden 's ideology and were involved in early al - Qaida spectaculars in Africa , others have used the name as a cover for criminality .
In the past two years , however , there have been a number of significant changes in Somalia and Yemen that have contributed to the emergence of a more widespread and cohesive jihadi ideology far more closely aligned to al- Qaida 's aims and agendas .
In large part – at least in Somalia – US intervention has been responsible for the radicalisation .
When the Islamic Courts Union emerged in Somalia in 2006 and brought a brief period of relative calm to the country it was America that encouraged its toppling .
The consequence was a splitting away of a hardline faction of the courts ' militia – known as the Shabaab – who the US defined as al - Qaida allies or proxies and have targeted , including with drones .
The emergence of the Shabaab , which controls large swaths of Somalia , has coincided – if the claims of the US intelligence agencies are to be believed – with events in the " Af - Pak " theatre .
Seasoned Arab al - Qaida fighters have been replaced by Central Asians and transferred to Yemen and Somalia under the guidance of its chief of external operations , Saleh al - Somali , who was killed in a drone attack in Waziristan this month .
What has also been well documented in the past few months has been the existence of an active recruitment system targeting young Somalis with US , European and Australian passports to train in camps that have sprung up in Somalia in particular .
Twenty , it is believed , travelled from Minneapolis alone .
Twenty more from Stockholm are also thought to have attended training camps , along with dozens of young British Somalis .
Last spring it emerged that some of the four Australian citizens arrested and charged with planning to attack an army barracks had trained in Somalia .
It is not only in Somalia that it is claimed al - Qaida is reconstituting itself .
In Yemen an insurgency in the remote Shabwa region backed by groups claiming loyalty to al - Qaida has provided a second regional centre .
It was there , four days ago , that an al - Qaida - supporting group said it had declared war on the US .
Large questions remain .
A number of those who have gone back to fight – or be recruited for training – appear to have died fighting , particularly in Somalia .
And while more than $ 1bn a year in remittances goes back to Somalia , suggesting that the Shabaab would not be short of money for operations , it is unclear how well al - Qaida operations in both Yemen and Somalia are organised .
Equally uncertain is the scope of their agenda : whether they are more focused for now on a local , rather than international , jihad .
One thing , however , is quite clear .
It is that the new al - Qaida has a very different face and a different base .
If the threat is as real as suggested by the attempted attack on Northwest Airlines , the West 's security services will be playing catch - up .
Angel Falls could henceforth be known as Kerepakupai - Meru Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called for the world 's highest waterfall , Angel Falls , to be given back its indigenous name .
The falls , which drop nearly 1 km ( 0.6 miles ) from a flat - topped mountain in the south of Venezuela , are currently named after a 1930s US aviator .
Jimmy Angel is believed to have been the first outsider to see them .
Mr Chavez said they should be called Kerepakupai - Meru , the name used by the indigenous Pemon people of the area .
Mr Chavez , who accuses the US of plotting against his country , said that thousands of indigenous people had seen the falls before Jimmy Angel " discovered " them .
Angel Falls at least partially inspired Paradise Falls , the fantasy Latin American waterfall in the recent Disney / Pixar animated film Up .
Third name Speaking on his weekly TV show , Mr Chavez asked Venezuelans how they could accept the idea that " the highest waterfall in the world was discovered by a man who came from the United States in a plane ? "
Jimmy Angel 's ashes were scattered over the waterfall " With all respect to that man who came , who saw it , we should change that name , right ? " he argued .
He initially said the name should be " Churun - Meru " but then corrected himself on air after receiving a note from his daughter Maria pointing out that the Pemon Indian name of the waterfall was Kerepakupai - Meru .
After several minutes practising the proper name , the president of the mainly Spanish - speaking country declared he had mastered it .
" That 's the name ... the name of the Indians , " he said .
The waterfall is among Venezuela 's most famous tourist destinations .
Jimmy Angel died at the age of 57 in a 1956 plane crash in Panama .
" One could say he was the first one to see it from a plane , " Mr Chavez said .
" But how many millions of indigenous eyes saw it , and prayed to it ?
No -one should refer to Angel Falls any more , " he added .

What greater joy can there be than to sink from the cruel world of stupidity and woe on to a snug , familiar pillow as the mopoke sings softly in the darkness outside ?
What more blessed state can there be than sweetly dwindling consciousness , where without trousers and upholding nothing , one surrenders to eternity for a while and is no longer a Jew , a Muslim , a Catholic , an Australian or whatever , but simply a weary soul ?
If we are to be touched by the healing miracle of oblivion , it is better that the mental and cultural contraptions of identity loosen and slip away during the descent .
You can't take it with you .
To descend into heaven for a while , we must free ourselves from our own grip , from our own group , from our obsession with our own story .
Not only do our bodies require rest but our innocent animal souls need respite from the trouble of human self and the burdensome riches of cultural inheritance . " . . .
And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept : Untroubling and untroubled where I lie . . . " – I Am by John Clare .
So off we float and down we go , leaving the world of bombardment behind : the media warnings of catastrophic fires , the didactic tales of ruined lives , ruined rivers , poisoned communities , broken economies , human depravity , injustice and misery , perpetual war and frenzied overpopulation — stories unleashed upon the common man in the name of care , responsibility and freedom of information : an ongoing tag - team lecture by expert public voices who , by virtue of media magnification , outnumber the obscure passive wretch 10,000 to one .
To make matters worse , the entertainments that may have previously helped to offset all this grim intensity in the public discourse , and consoled or enchanted , are increasingly irritating to the common man .
Freakish crudities , deceptions and aggressive hoaxes of unprecedented awfulness are launched against the hapless citizen each day as a new wave of pushy , fame - crazed narcissists posing as artists loot and scrape and scramble for content and attention .
In the face of this , it is understandable that the soul might sometimes want to scream or cry or fall asleep in its pitiful trench .
At least there 's independence in sleeping — and satisfaction in the knowledge that sleep is a self - made liberation that works at the end of the day .
In dreams may be some chance for truth and joy .
It might not halt the onslaught of dispiriting news , but it may help to water the garden of dignity and imagination .
But soon the sleepers must " come to " and get up — and pick up the contract and take up the rucksack of culture or religion and proceed into the world as if everything is normal .
They must reconstitute themselves over a cup of tea or coffee perhaps and remember what the world seems to be on about and recall what it is they must do .
It all comes back and soon the radio is reminding them that the world is in dire trouble and it's all a terrible mess .
And so the bombardment starts all over again : the traffic , the news , the conflict and the full catastrophe .
Across the planet one tribe is crushing another tribe .
The innocent dreamers are now back to the business of being Catholics or Jews or Tamils or Muslims or whatever ; dragging ancestry , customs and all the unique cultural gifts , blocks and blind spots that their histories have bequeathed to them .
As if being a plain human was n't difficult and wonderful enough , people have felt it necessary to construct and cling to glittering existential add - ons , to gorge their minds and to make themselves more secure and special .
In so doing , they have managed to turn the human world into a lurid , overwrought imbroglio and the natural world into a tragedy .
Perhaps a plain life without an overblown ancestral story and religious tradition is too meagre and raw for most ; perhaps too lonely and vulnerable , living from breath to breath with no sacred texts , rituals or costumes , no grand ethnic themes , no taboos or traditional enemies or heathen others and no group called " Us " to belong to or fight for in the war against " Them " .
None of that for the plain human . . . just a body and a soul surrounded by nature , humanity and a big , wide earth .
English author Lynne Truss tells a good story about Them and Us .
It concerns an Englishman who is shipwrecked and marooned on a remote island for 30 years .
Finally , he is discovered and , before sailing back to England , he invites his rescuer sea captain to view the three buildings he has constructed on the island .
First he proudly shows him the home he has built for himself and the captain is duly impressed .
He then leads his rescuer through the jungle and shows him another large building he has made .
" This is the club I belong to , " says the Englishman proudly .
The captain is astounded .
They tramp on through the undergrowth until they come to a clearing with another large building .
" And what 's this you 've built ? " inquires the captain in utter amazement .
The Englishman turns to him slowly and replies in a low and serious voice : " This is the club I do n't belong to . "
I have been publicly criticised in the most spiteful and petty way for having substantially lost contact with my family of origin , as if it were a sin , a shameful dysfunction or a disabling sadness .
An individual who out of necessity and for the sake of survival turns away from nationality , culture , religion , family or marriage is not easily understood or forgiven by the majority , who defend and cling to such things so vehemently .
Yet to turn away and leave is not as difficult or unnatural as it might seem .
Nor does it constitute a crippling loss or a breakdown or an illegitimacy .
Some people travel light .
My children have too many loose threads in their ancestry to care much about cultural inheritance — threads that tangle and fray all the way back to China , Scotland , Ireland , Finland , Poland , Holland , England , indigenous Australia , Germany and heaven only knows where else .
They have no logo , no shares in any great cultural franchise with stories of tragedy and triumph , and do n't have much in the way of extended family .
None of this to enshrine and uphold .
They are unadorned earthlings .
Human nature is their story .
The spirit of country runs out of the earth and the air and into their bodies like a mystery .
This is their inheritance .
It is no virtue , no deficiency and no advantage ; this is simply their lot .
I see them asleep at night , these beautiful earthlings ; their faces still so glowing and open and young .
There are many of them in this world and in this land .
When they awaken they will create their own way .
Heaven forbid that they should ever know the sleep of fear that the young Bill Harney knew , as the great cultures with their great pride , great ideas and great identities hurled their great madness down upon each other .
I think this video from Qom is the best one of all for the day :
Meanwhile , pro-government supporters held a rally of their own the day after , with lots of extra room on the street to stretch out and relax .
See more pictures from that rally here Let 's do a quick comparison , and remember that these photos have been approved and published by the government itself ; in other words , these are the most impressive images they have .
Here 's the image from their rally yesterday showing the largest number of people in one place :
Wow , look at all those people .
Lengthwise it's about thirty people side by side , and it stretches back a little ways too .
Now let 's compare that to the opposition gathering at the funeral the day before .
Edit : Balatarin right now has a post from a blog here in Persian on the same subject : the pro-Ahmadinejad newspaper Kayhan published an article on the " great surge " of people in Qom ( article screenshot here ) .
The " great surge " actually looked like this : whereas the funeral the day before looked like this :

Weaning humanity from its fossil fuel habit will take decades , and it will take decades more for global warming to stop .
But one simple measure could slow warming in some of Earth 's most sensitive regions , effective immediately — and it would cost just $ 15 billion .
That 's a rough price tag for providing clean stoves to the 500 million households that use open fires , fed by wood and animal dung and coal , to heat their homes and cook .
Those fires produce one - quarter of all so - called " black carbon , " a sooty pollutant that 's adding to the planetary heat burden .
" We know how to cook without smoke , " said Veerabhadran Ramanathan , a University of California , San Diego climatographer .
" A clean stove costs $ 30 .
Multiply that by 500 million households , and it's only $ 15 billion .
This is a solvable problem . "
After floating to the atmosphere , black carbon mixes with dust to form a solar heat - absorbing particulate layer .
Raindrops form around the particles , trapping even more heat .
Soot deposited by the rain heats up , too .
The climate dynamics of the black carbon process have been fully described only in the last decade , but scientists now say their short - term impact sometimes rivals that of carbon dioxide .
As much as one - half of the 3.4 degree Fahrenheit rise in Arctic temperatures since 1890 is attributed to black carbon .
By disrupting weather patterns , it may be responsible for weakening seasonal rains in South Asia and West Africa .
And black carbon is also a major reason why Himalayan glaciers , which provide water to hundreds of millions of people , are vanishing .
Unlike carbon dioxide , however , which can hang in the atmosphere for centuries , black carbon returns to Earth in less than a month .
And that makes it a ripe target for immediate action .
Though Ramanathan is quick to warn that eliminating black carbon is no substitute for controlling carbon dioxide emissions , which in coming centuries could have a far greater effect , he estimates that a 50 % reduction in black carbon could delay the onset of severe global warming by one to two decades .
In addition to being emitted by unclean stoves , black carbon also comes from coal - fired power plants , and burning diesel fuel and forests .
Halting deforestation and installing filters on power plants and cars will cost more than clean stoves , though the price would likely be small compared to the environmental , agricultural and health benefits .
In the meantime , clean stoves remain a very practical target .
Black carbon emissions are not being considered as part of whatever agreement comes from the ongoing United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen , but Ramanathan hopes that regional agreements will address the problem .
Many non-governmental organizations are already working to distribute clean stoves .
" We 're not talking about a trillion dollar problem .
We 're talking about a few billion dollars .
There 's no downside here , " said Ramanathan .

Mr Musharraf says he acted in the best interest of Pakistan Former president Pervez Musharraf says the US military aid given to Pakistan during his tenure was used to strengthen defences against India .
The money was used to arm the troops who moved with their equipment from the western border to the east based on the perceived threats , he said .
The US gave $ 10 bn dollars to Pakistan to fight the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
In 2007 , Pakistan rejected a report which said it had used $ 5bn on weapons systems designed to fight India .
Pakistan 's military had described the New York Times report as " nonsense " .
' Did right '
" Wherever there is a threat to Pakistan , we will use it [ equipment provided by the US ] there .
If the threat comes from al - Qaeda or Taliban , it will be used there .
If the threat comes from India , we will most surely use it there , " Mr Musharraf told Pakistan 's Express News television channel .
" There is nothing like this equipment has come from the US and must only be used against Taliban , or that equipment has come from China and must be used against this or that , " he added .
Mr Musharraf confirmed that the weapons were indeed used against India .
" We did right .
What we did , we did right .
We have to ensure Pakistan 's security .
From whichever side the threat comes , we will use the entire force there . "
Mr Musharraf said he did not care if this diversion of aid angered the US .
" Whoever wishes to be angry , let them be angry , why should we bother ?
We have to maintain our security , and the Americans should know , and the whole world should know that we wo n't compromise our security , and will use the equipment everywhere . "
Meanwhile , India said Mr Musharraf 's statement merely confirmed " what we have suspected over a long time and what we have suggested all along " .
" We do not feel that such assistance should be turned around and used against us , " news agency Reuters quoted India 's junior external affairs minister Shashi Tharoor as saying .
" We pose no threat to Pakistan and we find that this kind of diversion is neither in the interest of the sub continent nor of those who are giving this assistance . "
This is the first time Pakistan has admitted to diverting the US aid to strengthen its defences against India .
In the past , Pakistan 's army has dismissed claims that aid from the US had been misappropriated .

Insurance companies charge women 48 percent more than men for the same coverage on the individual market .
14.5 million American women purchased health insurance through the individual market .
These women pay up to 48 percent more in premiums than men , according to a recent study .
This discrepancy is due to an insurance industry practice known as “ gender rating , ” which permits insurance companies in most states to charge men and women different premiums for the same coverage .
Insurance companies in all but 12 states are completely free to continue this practice .
Many insurance companies do n’t provide maternity coverage , calling pregnancy a “ matter of choice ” and C- sections a “ pre-existing condition . ”
A 2008 study found that just 12 percent of individual market plans include comprehensive maternity coverage .
Defending the practice , one insurance official called pregnancy a “ matter of choice . ”
Many insurance companies consider C- sections a “ pre-existing condition , ” while a subsidiary of United Health , one of the biggest insurance companies in the nation , “ simply rejects ” women who have had C- sections .
Insurance companies are currently free to deny coverage to victims of domestic violence .
It is perfectly legal for insurance companies in eight states and the District of Columbia to deny coverage to victims of domestic violence — and insurance companies are happy to take advantage of this loophole .
Rationalizing this practice , one health care official infamously argued that covering a victim of domestic violence would be akin to covering “ a smoker who does n’t stop smoking . ”
[ USA Today , 6/2/94 ]
Ten Senate conservatives voted in 2006 to kill a proposal that would have ensured coverage to victims of domestic violence .
[ Sens . Alexander , Burr , Ensign , Enzi , Frist , Gregg , Hatch , Isakson , Roberts and Sessions ; CQ Committee Coverage , Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee Markup , 3/15/06 ]
President Obama and leaders in Congress have outlined specific reforms yhat would end these and other abusive insurance industry practices .
The reforms being advanced by the White House and Congress would :
Make “ gender rating ” illegal .
Prevent insurance companies from denying care on the basis of pre-existing conditions .
End “ rescission , ” or the insurance industry practice of canceling someone ’s coverage when they get sick .
Set limits on out - of - pocket expenses .
Provide competition and choice .

This post contains the first set of results from my SPARQL extension survey .
I ’ve completed an initial survey of a number of different SPARQL processors to itemise the extension functions that each of them have implemented .
This will be an ongoing activity as implementations evolve continually , but I thought it would be useful to summarise my findings so far .
If you want to look at the results for yourselves , then I ’ve created a publically accessible Google Spreadsheet that lists all of the results .
The first tab of the spreadsheet includes the list SPARQL endpoints / processors that I ’ve surveyed .
I completed the initial round of the survey a few weeks ago , so any updates since then wo n’t have been included .
List of Implementations
The full list of surveyed processors / endpoints consists of :
Allegrograph
ARQ
Corese
Geospatialweb project
Mulgara
OpenAnzo
Openlink Virtuoso
Sesame
TopBraid product suite
XMLArmyKnife.com
If I ’ve missed any other implementations that support extension functions then please let me know .
I ’m aware that other engines also support property functions , but I ’ve not included this type of extension in my first survey round .
I ’ll be exploring that area in the new year .
I want to thank the implementers of a number of these systems for providing me with additional information , feedback and support as I ’ve compiled the results .
If anything has been misrepresented or simply missed , then you have my apologies and I will endeavour to fix any reported problems ASAP .
The goal is to perform a fair , objective survey of the current situation : I ’m not pushing any agenda here , other than a desire for convergence and continual improvement .
Breakdown of Results
The currently implemented extension functions can be organised into the following categories :
String
Date / Time
Math / Logic
RDF / Graph Manipulation
Geospatial
Network
The first three categories , covering string , date , and mathematical manipulations have the largest number of functions .
This is as expected as these areas are the most useful for any programming or query language .
Given that extension functions are restricted to value testing in SPARQL 1.0 , then you would also assume that they would be most commonly used to provide additional flexibility when comparing strings , manipulating and comparing dates , and performing simple mathematical functions .
Very few implementations offer any functions in the remaining categories .
I had originally expected to find more functions in the Geospatial category but I think that the majority of exploration in that area has focused on using property functions instead .
I would expect to see the number of distinct functions in each area to grow with the delivery of SPARQL 1.1 , if it becomes possible to use them as part of a SELECT expression , e.g. to create new values / bindings , as well as just in FILTER tests .
Those implementations that already offer a wide range of additional functions , such as Virtuoso , already have additional SPARQL language extensions that allow functions to be used in this way .
Currently however the numbers are inflated due to repeated implementation of the same function in different engines .
For example ARQ , Virtuoso and Corese all have their own variant of a “ contains ” function .
Portability
This brings me to the topic of query portability .
A SPARQL query is portable if it can run unchanged on any SPARQL processor .
A query is not portable if it uses proprietary extensions that are not supported on other processors .
Implementers can increase portability by supporting each others extensions or by converging on a common set of functions .
As a standard develops , you ’d expect to see some replication of functions across engines before pressures from users , and a better understanding of the utility of various extensions , encourages convergence .
It ’s encouraging to see that some replication of functions is happening across SPARQL engines .
For example both Mulgara and TopQuadrant support a basic set of string functions that were originally provided by the ARQ engine .
These functions are part of the XPath Functions and Operators library which acts as a handy “ off - the - shelf ” set of function definitions for SPARQL implementors to converge around .
Mulgara also now supports a number of the EXSLT functions which can act as another reference point for useful function definitions .
Looking at the list of extensions , its easy to see that more convergence could take place as there are plenty of other extension functions that have been independently implemented .
Expanding the set of commonly used functions in SPARQL is currently a time - permitting feature for SPARQL 1.1 .
Replication of functions across implementations is partially hampered because of a couple of non-standard ways that extension functions have been implemented .
For example both Corese and Virtuoso implement their extension functions as language extensions , i.e. they do n’t quite conform to the SPARQL 1.0 recommendation .
Corese does n’t associate its functions with a URI , i.e. they are just functions that are exposed in the basic language .
The Virtuoso “ bif ” ( built - in ) functions are used with a prefix ( e.g. bif:contains ) but this prefix is not ( and cannot ) be associated with a URI .
In both cases this means that implementations cannot replicate the functions using existing extension points : they ’d have to be implemented with similar language extensions , or query rewriting .
Conclusions and Recommendations
I ’m encouraged to see the wide range of experimentation that has been taking place around SPARQL extensions as it illustrates that developers are exploring how to use the language in a variety of ways .
Extensions also indicate areas where the query language could be extended to encourage interoperability and address common issues faced by developers .
There are clearly a common set of functions around strings , dates and mathematical operators that ought to be available as a core part of the language .
If the SPARQL 1.1 specification does n’t end up defining this then I ’d like to encourage the implementer community to do further work to explore replicating useful extensions or converging on a common set outside of the Working Group .
To help this process along it would be useful for developers to provide more feedback on the functions they provide useful , and for some statistics to be gathered around which functions are being commonly used in practice .
Right now there are a common set of functions available from the ARQ engine that are implemented in at least two other SPARQL processors .
The same functions can be ported to other engines with a minimum of query rewriting , often with little more than changes to query prefixes .
My other recommendation at this stage is that implementers need to work harder on documenting the extensions they provide .
Some engines have pretty good documentation , but for others the documentation is either hard to find or clearly lagging behind the latest code base .
Publishing documentation about extensions , ideally with examples , really does help developers get started much quicker .
The cuts in greenhouse gas emissions being proposed at the Copenhagen climate conference , which opens today , are completely inadequate to stop dangerous climate change , one of Britain ’s leading climate scientists warns .
Current proposals , including recent ones from major emitting nations such as the US , China and India , are “ little more than token gestures ” , compared to what the science deems necessary to give even a 50 - 50 chance of staying below the danger threshold , says Professor Kevin Anderson , Director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester .
Writing in The Independent today , Professor Anderson cautions that with the commitments currently on the table in Copenhagen , global emissions of carbon dioxide will peak far too late for temperature rises to stay below two degrees Centigrade above the pre-industrial level , which is regarded as the limit that the earth and human society can safely stand .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Instead , they are likely to put the world on a disastrous trajectory for four degrees or even higher .
Nations must now make much more radical commitments , he says , even if it means sacrificing economic growth .
Professor Anderson is one of the world ’s leading experts on CO2 emissions rates , and his comments represent a sobering reality check about just how great is the task which the world now faces in bringing global warming under control .
The meeting in the Danish capital , which lasts for the next two weeks and will be attended in its final stages by most of the world ’s leaders including President Barack Obama and Gordon Brown , will attempt to construct a new climate treaty under which all countries will eventually cut back their CO2 .
In the run-up to the conference , most of the world ’s biggest carbon emitters , led by China and the USA , and including the European Union and Britain , have “ put numbers on the table ” indicating the reductions they are prepared to make , if negotiations are successful in the round .
The targets announced for the first time in the last fortnight by America , China and India , in particular , have been regarded as a considerable step forward .
But the sum of all the commitments is simply inadequate for the point where emissions peak as a whole and then start to decline to come early enough , Professor Anderson says .
The date of the emissions peak is increasingly seen as a vital point in checking the progress of the warming .
Last year , the Met Office ’s Hadley Centre for climate prediction and research said that if global emissions peaked in 2015 or 2016 and then declined annually at a rate of four per cent , there would be a 50 - 50 chance – but no more than that – of keeping the rise in temperatures to two degrees , the goal upon which much of the world ’s climate policy is premised .
For every ten years that the peak was delayed , the Hadley Centre said , the world would be committed to another 0.5 of a degree of warming .
Professor Anderson points out that there is a widespread assumption that an emissions peak might come relatively early , but asserts that the political and economic will to bring this about is actually absent .
He writes : “ For example , the [ Lord ] Stern and the [ UK ]
Committee on Climate Change reports are premised on global emissions reaching their highest levels by 2015 and 2016 respectively , before beginning a process of year - on - year reductions . ”
He goes on : “ However , amongst those working on climate change there is near universal acknowledgment that such early peaking years are politically unacceptable – yet the Stern and the CCC analyses remain pivotal in the formation of emission - reduction policy .
“ The statements by the US , China and India , allied with commitments from other nations , suggest peaking global emissions between 2020 and 2030 is about as hard as the economic and political orthodoxy is prepared to push in terms of emission reductions .
“ If peaking global emissions between 2020 and 2030 is left unquestioned , the cumulative quantity of greenhouse gases emitted will be sufficient to put temperatures on a 4 degrees C or higher trajectory . ”
In recent years , emissions have shot up in a way no - one expected even a decade ago , largely owing to the breakneck industrialisation of China , which doubled its CO2 output over the decade from 3bn to 6 bn tonnes , and in doing so overtook the US as the world ’s biggest polluter .
Currently global carbon emissions are rising by nearly three per cent annually , making a four per cent annual decline as tall order indeed , and one that the present Copenhagen commitments would not remotely be able to facilitate .
There has to be a move to a radical new level of emissions cuts , Professor Anderson says , if dangerous climate change is to be avoided .
He writes : “ If Copenhagen is to have any chance of kick - starting a global movement to stay below the 2 degrees C characterisation of dangerous climate change , it must inspire and instigate a rapid shift away from the current political and economic consensus . ”
The first challenge , he says , is to get political buy - in to what the science is saying in relation to , at least , a 50:50 chance of not exceeding 2 degrees C .
“ In brief , wealthy ( OECD ) nations need to peak emissions by around 2012 , achieve at least a 60 per cent reduction in emissions from energy by 2020 , and fully decarbonise their energy systems by 2030 at the latest .
“ Alongside this , the ‘ industrialising ’ nations ( non- OECD ) need to peak their collective emissions by around 2025 and fully decarbonise their energy systems by 2050 . ”
He notes : “ This scale of reductions is presently far removed from that which the negotiators in Copenhagen are intending to consider . ”
He concludes : “ The second challenge for Copenhagen , therefore , is to make a clear and explicit decision to do all that is necessary to put global emissions on a 2 degrees C pathway , even if this requires a temporary cessation in economic growth amongst the wealthy OECD nations . ”
* On the eve of the conference yesterday , the UN ’s top climate change official expressed confidence that the meeting would deliver a comprehensive , ambitious and effective international climate change deal .
“ Negotiators now have the clearest signal ever from world leaders to craft solid proposals to implement rapid action , ” said Yvo de Boer , Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) .
Mr de Boer said there was unprecedented political momentum to clinch an ambitious deal in Copenhagen : “ Never in 17 years of climate negotiations have so many different nations made so many firm pledges together .
“ So whilst there will be more steps on the road to a safe climate future , Copenhagen is already a turning point in the international response to climate change . ”
However , climate sceptics will be boosted by the fact that the controversy over the stolen emails from the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia , which has been seized on by the sceptic lobby seeking to undermine the scientific consensus , will receive an airing at the conference today .
Mr de Boer said that Dr Raj Pachauri , the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , IPCC , would refer to it in his speech during the opening ceremonies .
The UNFCCC secretariat revealed last night that 34,000 people had applied for accreditation to the meeting , taking place in a conference centre which only holds 15,000 .
The limit on accreditation of journalists has already been reached at 3,500 and further accreditation has been suspended , while environmental groups are being rationed as to the numbers of activists who are allowed on the site .

Most recently , a Mexican newspaper reported that metal heads and gangsters have warned Tijuana 's emo kids to stay away from the town 's fair next month .
But the so - called emos are organizing , too .
Last week , they demonstrated against the violence , pictured above , and Wednesday some met with police in Mexico City .
" They 're organizing to defend their right to be emo , " wrote Daniel Hernandez of LA Weekly on his personal blog , which has provided stellar coverage of the whole affair .
Music - based subcultures have permeated Mexico 's major cities for decades , fueled by constant migration from rural cities .
But only in the past year have emos begun to make their presence felt in the streets .
In response , many of the established so - called tribus urbanas like punks and metalheads are responding with violence .
The emo-punk battles are reminiscent of earlier subculture fights among various factions , like the Hell 's Angels fighting hippies at the Altamont Music Festival or the Mods taking on the Rockers .
But while videos of Mexican teenagers with pompadours advancing on equally baby - faced emo rockers seem like scenes from a south - of - the - border version of John Waters '
Crybaby , there are ugly undercurrents to the story .
First , by some accounts , the emo subculture is identified with homosexuality in Mexico .
As Mexico City youth worker Victor Mendoza told Time.com : " At the core of this is the homophobic issue .
The other arguments are just window dressing for that . "
Gustavo Arellano , the author of Ask a Mexican and an editor at OC Weekly , said that the sexual ambiguities cultivated by emo fashion helped set the group up for targeting by more macho groups .
" What do you do when you are confronted with a question mark about sexuality in Mexico ? "
Arellano said .
" You beat it up . "
Forum posts show similar sentiments .
One person wrote on a government youth - website forum , " detesto a los emosexuales , " which translates as " I hate emosexuals . "
Emosexual is an obvious play on homosexual , especially in Spanish , where the H is silent .
Many of the attacks have been planned , or at least fomented , on violently anti-emo websites like Movimiento Anti Emosexual , which features videos of physical violence sprinkled liberally with anti-gay sentiment .
Last.fm's Anti Emo Death Squad group has almost 4,000 members .
But Arellano said he thought the riots could have a positive impact here in the US .
" It 's a great clusterfuck for the American mind 's idea of Mexico , " Arellano said .
" This teaches the rest of the world that Mexico is not just a bunch of cactuses and sombreros . "

NEW DELHI : The plight of a 61 - year - old women , who suffered a brutal sexual assault 36 years ago and has been lying in a vegetative state in a Mumbai hospital ever since , has moved the Supreme Court into setting aside its pro-life stance and examining the woman ’s plea that her life be ended .
The woman , Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug , does not want to live any more .
Doctors have told her there is no chance of any improvement in her state .
So she , through her ‘ next friend ’ Pinki Virani , decided to move the SC with a plea to ‘‘ direct KEM Hospital not to force - feed her ’ ’ .
‘‘ Is this plea not akin to euthanasia ?’’ asked a Supreme Court bench comprising Chief Justice K G Balakrishnan and Justices A K Ganguly and B S Chauhan , when the matter came up for hearing .
To this , her counsel Shekhar Naphade countered : ‘‘ Is not keeping the woman in this persistent vegetative state by force - feeding violative of her right to live with dignity guaranteed by Article 21 ( right to life ) of the Constitution ? ’’
‘‘ She is beyond cure .
Let the court inquire about what medical science has in store for her .
It appears there has been utter indifference of medical world towards her .
The SC has to lay down some guideline in such cases , ’’ he added .
The pro-life apex court , which had negated pleas of termination of pregnancy of a mentally retarded girl resulting from a rape at a Nari Niketan in Chandigarh and a similar plea from a Mumbai couple for terminating a diseased fetus , asked Naphade :
‘‘ Do you mean right to life includes right to die ? ’’
Without taking the risk of hinging his arguments on that line , Naphade gave it a small tweak and said : ‘‘ She is going through a torture of a life .
Is this human rights ?
Should the medical authorities not be activated to do something ?
This is not a case to be left aside and forgotten .
The apex court must lay down some guidelines . ’’
Setting aside its previous position on the issue , the bench agreed to examine the merits of the petition and sought responses from the Union government , Maharashtra , Municipal Corporation of Brihan Mumbai , Commissioner of Mumbai Police and Dean of KEM Hospital .
This is how her next friend — a legal term used for a person speaking on behalf of someone who is incapacitated — describes Shanbaug : ‘‘ Her bones are brittle .
Her skin is like ‘ papier mache ’ stretched over a skeleton .
Her wrists are twisted inwards , her fingers are bent and fisted towards her palms , resulting in growing nails tearing into the flesh very often .
Her teeth are decayed and giving her pain .
Food is mashed and given to her in semi - solid form .
She is in a persistent vegetative state . ’’

COPENHAGEN --
The political script for a big climate - change conference in this Danish city has U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders flying in later this week to christen a new era of global environmental cooperation .
In reality , the summit is shaping up as a pivotal economic showdown between the U.S. and China .

Fabled Enemies by Jason Bermas is the latest film to question the events of September 11th 2001 .
Instead of the focus being on physical anomalies surrounding the attacks , it focuses on a vast intelligence network and how they were able to succeed almost 7 years ago .
It begins with footage from the morning itself reminding everyone that in the court of public opinion Osama Bin laden was convicted on day 1 , there were no other suspects .
We then delve into the fact that many of the alleged hijackers were trained at U.S. military facilities , and still others had ties to the FBI .
When others within the FBI tried to go after Bin Laden , and his financial supporters there investigations were impeded and shut down .
Able Danger the Black Ops program that identified the hijackers prior to 9/11 had also tried to move the information tot he FBI , but the FBI still was not interested for some reason .
Anthony Shaffer who headed up this team later met with Phillip Zelikow , the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission , to try and pass this information along after the fact .
It was then covered up , not included in the report , and Shaffer and his team were gagged and slandered .
The film then explores the mystery of those who were detained on the morning of September 11th .
Several vans were stopped that morning containg Israeli citizens , who either seemed to have prior knowledge of the attacks , or had explosives in their vehicle .
When investigators started looking into this network it was revealed they did indeed have a classified role in 9/11 , and that two companies within the United States may have been helping them gain their intel .
Ten Early New Testament Papyri December 20 , 2009
I did n’t know much about the earliest sources for the New Testament , and so I went to find out .
Here are a quick ten :
1. Rylands Library Papyrus I : P52 ( 117-138AD )
This is the earliest fragment from the New Testament .
It is named P52 , and dates back to 117 - 138 AD .
It contains parts of John 18:31 - 33 and John 18:37 - 38 on the back , which talk about Jesus trial .
2 . A few verses of Philemon : P87 ( 125 AD )
P87 is dated by at around 125AD .
It contains Philemon 13 - 15 ( of Paul saying that he is sending back the former slave Onesimus as a brother ) as well as the epilogue ( v24-25 ) .
3. Oxyrhynchus papyrus 2683 : P77 ( 150 AD )
This papyrus is named P77 and contains Matthew 23:30 - 39 .
4. Chester Beatty Papyrus I : P45 ( 150 AD )
This manuscript , known as P45 , contains sections of all four gospels and also Acts .
including Matthew 20 - 21 and 25 - 26 ; Mark 4 - 9 and 11 - 12 ; Luke 6 - 7 and 9 - 14 ; John 4 - 5 and 10 - 11 ; and Acts 4 - 17 .
You might be wondering why a papyrus is named ‘ Chester Beatty ’ .
Apparently these were purchased from a dealer in Egypt by Chester Beatty in the 1930’s .
There ’s three of these papyri : P45 , P46 ( below ) and P47 ( containing Revelations 9 - 17 ) .
5. Chester Beatty Papyrus II : P46 ( 150 AD )
This manuscript , P46 , contains most Paul ’s letters : the majority of Romans ; Hebrews ; 1 Corinthians , 2 Corinthians , Ephesians , Galatians , Philippians , Colossians ; and two chapters of 1 Thessalonians .
Although usually dated around 150 - 200 AD , it is written in a handwriting which has only ever been found in first century manuscripts , and so some people ( eg. Young Kyu Kim ) suggest it could be much earlier .
6 . The Magdalen papyrus : P4/P64/P67 ( 175 AD )
7. Bodmer Papyrus II : P66 ( 175 AD ) P66 contains a nearly complete gospel of John .
It is the oldest of the Bodmer papyri , a set of 22 papyri which were discovered in Egypt in 1952 .
Buying New Testament papyri seems a good way to become famous , because they are named after Martin Bodmer who originally purchased them .
8. Bodmer XIV and XV : P75 ( 200 AD )
This early third century manuscript contains almost all of Luke , and also of John .
You can find almost 100 images of it online .
9 . Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 2 : P1 ( 200 AD )
P1 , fittingly contains Matthew 1 .
This is one of many parchments which have been found in the rubbish dumps of Oxyrhychus , Egypt .
Their discovery began in 1898 , uncovering not only early Christian text , but all sorts of ancient literature .
Now there are over 50 New Testament manuscripts from this site .
10 . Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 4446 : P104 ( 125-150 AD )
And last but not least , P104 , was another Oxyrhynchus piece of rubbish , which is now one of the more valuable pieces of rubbish in the world , because contains part of Jesus parable in Matthew 21 .
These papyri apparently go together , and contain portions of Matthew and Luke .
Their name , ‘ Magdalen ’ is from an Oxford college that they originally lived , even though they were discovered in Luxor , Egypt .
Apparently P4 was found stuffed in the binding of a codex of Philo .

WALTON , N.Y .
AMONG the sleek new group of domestic distillers , Cheryl Lins is an original .
Wearing a baseball cap , flannel - lined jeans and wire spectacles , she flits from store to cocktail bar , towing her cardboard box of goods , selling to old customers and looking for new .
When making her sales pitch , she sometimes forgets to say that she ’s the one who distills it , designs the label , waxes the cork and brings the bottles to market .
And by the way : her varieties of absinthe are local .
Since 2007 , when the Treasury Department relaxed its position on the sale of absinthe , 13 American distilleries have begun producing the spirit legally , according to the Wormwood Society , a consumer education and advocacy group .
Ms. Lins , 56 , is the first in New York State , making two versions at Delaware Phoenix , her micro-distillery here .
( Another absinthe , distilled in Gardiner , N.Y. , and called Edward III , will go on sale next week . )
Customers like Astor Wines & Spirits and the bar Louis 649 seem to find her lack of self - promotion sometimes amusing and mostly refreshing .
Justin Chearno , manager of the wine store Uva in Williamsburg , Brooklyn , said : “ When she walked into the store , I saw she had that thing natural winemakers have  an authentic , obsessive thing .
When she said she was selling absinthe , not wine , I was , like , ‘ You ’re kidding ! ’
Then I tasted .
Her flavors and tastes were just as alive . ”

Five years ago , Ms. Lins was living in a yurt in New Mexico .
To escape the heat , she came to this small town in Delaware County , chosen for no apparent reason other than instinct .
A computer programmer and watercolorist , she tended the fish counter at the health food store in nearby Delhi .
Then one March morning in 2006 , The New Yorker arrived in the mail .
Inside was an article on absinthe .
In 1976 , at the age of 17 , Mr Ruiz , from Valencia , told family members that he was gay .
At the time homosexuality was still banned and when his parents confided in a Catholic monk , he denounced their son to the authorities .
Marwa - Prozess in Dresden : Ein Deutscher , der nie ankam
Der russische Spätaussiedler Alex W. war ein Verlierer , sein Opfer Marwa El Sherbini eine Gewinnerin .
Vor Gericht zeigt er keine Regung .
Eine Annäherung an eine unbegreifliche Tat .
Vier Polizisten schleifen den Angeklagten in den Gerichtssaal .
Er ist an Händen und Füßen gefesselt .
Die dunkelblaue Kapuze hat er weit ins Gesicht gezogen , darunter trägt er Sturmhaube und Sonnenbrille .
Die Beamten zwingen ihn auf seinen Stuhl .
Alex W. wehrt sich .
Er schlägt mit dem Kopf auf den Tisch , trampelt mit den Füßen .
Tiefe Laute stößt er dabei aus .
Drei Beamte halten ihn fest .
Seine Verteidiger reden auf ihn ein .
Es ist Dienstag .
Alex W. will nicht an seinem Prozess im Dresdener Landgericht teilnehmen .
Der 28 - jährige Spätaussiedler ist des Mordes , des versuchten Mordes und der Körperverletzung angeklagt .
Aus Hass auf Muslime soll er hier im Landgericht während einer Beleidigungsverhandlung gegen ihn die 31 - jährige Ägypterin Marwa El Sherbini und ihren Ehemann Elwy Okaz mit einem Messer attackiert haben , so steht es in der Anklageschrift .
Die Klinge war 18 Zentimeter lang .
" Wie ein Berserker " , " wie ein rasendes Tier " habe er auf die wehrlose Frau eingestochen , sagen traumatisierte Zeugen , die El Sherbinis Tod nicht verhindern konnten .
" Immer wieder , immer wieder , er hörte gar nicht auf . " 16 - mal innerhalb von wenigen Minuten .
Ein Stich ging frontal ins Herz , er allein wäre tödlich gewesen .
Auch als El Sherbini schon am Boden lag und W.s Pflichtverteidiger einen Tisch zwischen sie und den Angreifer rammte , stoppte W. nicht .
Er beugte sich über den Tisch und stach weiter zu .
Die Wucht war so groß , dass er ihr ein Schlüsselbein und zahlreiche Rippen zertrümmerte .
Dann ging er wieder auf den Ehemann los .
Von ihm ließ er erst ab , als ein Bundespolizist , der sich zufällig im Gebäude aufhielt , hineinstürzte und irrtümlich auf Okaz schoss .
El Sherbini starb noch am Tatort , ihr Mann überlebte schwer verletzt .
Ihr dreijähriger Sohn Mustafa sah alles mit an .
Als seine Mutter verblutete , saß er in dem Blut , das sie verlor .
Wehrt Alex W. sich nicht gegen seine Prozessbeteiligung , dann sitzt er da , hinter seiner Kapuze versteckt , den Kopf gebeugt , das Gesicht hinter den Händen verborgen .
Nicht einmal habe er zu der Bank der Nebenkläger geschaut , wo auch El Sherbinis Witwer Okaz sitzt , sagt dessen Anwalt Heiko Lesch .
Bis zum siebten Prozesstag sagt W. kein einziges
Wort , dann lässt er von seinem Verteidiger eine Erklärung verlesen , die wenig erklärt .
Er sagt einmal " ja " , einmal " korrekt " , als es gar nicht anders geht .
Alex W. trägt wenig dazu bei , die unbegreifliche
Tat zu erklären .
Wer sich ihr nähern will , muss Aussagen von Gutachtern , den Beteiligten im Beleidigungsprozess , von Freunden und Bekannten wie Puzzleteile zusammenfügen .
Die Zeugen beschreiben Alex W. als einen , der unbedingt Deutscher sein will , in der deutschen Gesellschaft aber nicht angekommen ist .
Der isoliert ist und arbeitslos .
Der eine Freundin sucht und keinen Kontakt zu Mädchen findet .
Der leicht aufbraust , stur , bockig und uneinsichtig ist .
Der Menschen nach Rassen ordnet , Muslimen das Lebensrecht in Deutschland abspricht und an der NPD Gefallen findet .
" Er hasste sich selbst " , sagt Sergej G. , sein einziger Freund .
" Und diesen Hass hat er wohl auf Muslime projiziert . "
Alex W. ist 1980 in der russischen Millionenstadt Perm am Ural geboren , nach der Schule hat er eine Ausbildung zum Stuckateur und Maler absolviert .
Seine Eltern - die Mutter Architektin , der Vater Computerfachmann - trennten sich .
Der Vater blieb in Perm , Alex W. zog mit Mutter und Schwester zunächst nach Kasachstan , 2003 kamen sie nach Dresden .
W. lebte im Übergangswohnheim , wo er " immer Probleme machte " , wie der Heimleiter sagt .
Nach einem
Jahr musste er raus .
W. absolvierte einen Integrationskurs , Anfang 2006 dann einen vom Arbeitsamt geförderten Lehrgang zum Lagerarbeiter .
Genutzt hat es nichts .
W. lebte von Hartz IV , ab und an verdiente er etwas dazu .
Der damalige Schulleiter sagt vor Gericht , W. habe sich in der Klasse isoliert und die Dozenten mit ständigen Nachfragen genervt .
Unbedingt wollte er perfektes Deutsch sprechen .
Schon hier im Lehrgang fällt W. durch rassistische Parolen auf .
Sprüche wie " Deutschland gehört den Deutschen " und " Ausländer haben hier nichts zu suchen " hätten mehrere Lehrkräfte gehört , sagt der Schulleiter .
Stets habe W. betont , dass er Deutscher sei .
" Mir kam es so vor , als wolle er seine Herkunft verleugnen . "
Deutschland , das sei für W. rundum positiv gewesen , " Einwände ließ er nicht zu " .
Kamen sie doch , reagierte er aggressiv .
Von der " reinen Leistung her " aber sei W. ein guter Schüler gewesen .
Während des Lehrgangs war es auch , dass W. beim Streit einen älteren Mitschüler mit einem Messer bedrohte .
Andere Spätaussiedler forderten ihn auf , das Messer wegzustecken , erinnert sich Ruslan Z. , einer von ihnen .
" Danach wollte keiner mehr etwas mit ihm zu tun haben . "
Seine rassistischen Ansichten habe er " fast im Plauderton " vorgetragen , sagt die Staatsanwältin aus dem Beleidigungsverfahren , und er habe diese " hemmungslos wiederholt " .
Äußerungen wie : " Seit dem 11 .
September haben solche Monster kein Recht , hier zu leben . "
Oder : " Die deutsche Rasse soll sich nicht mit anderen mischen . "
W.s Abneigung habe sich besonders gegen Muslime gerichtet , sagt Johann K. , ein Bekannter .
Die würden den Deutschen die Arbeitsplätze wegnehmen und russische Frauen ansprechen .
Wenn K. und seine Freunde Döner essen gingen , wartete W. vor der Tür. " Er war eigentlich ganz ruhig " , sagt der 21 - Jährige .
" Er hat nur gesagt , dass er Muslime hasst .
Wenn er eine Mehrschusswaffe hätte , würde er sie umbringen . "
Auch in einem Brief an das Amtsgericht hat W. ausführlich seine islamfeindlichen Einstellungen dargelegt .
Der Islam sei eine " gefährliche Religion " , schreibt W. , alle Muslime seien " Islamisten " .
Niemand könne von ihm erwarten , dass er " Feinde in der Nähe " dulde .
Das Kopftuch sei ein Zeichen " von totaler religiöser Unterwerfung vor dem Satangott " .
Ein solches Kopftuch trägt Marwa El Sherbini , als sie an einem Sommerabend im Jahr 2008 auf einem Spielplatz zum ersten Mal auf Alex W. trifft .
W. sitzt rauchend auf einer Schaukel , auf der zweiten neben ihm sitzt seine Nichte .
Auch W.s Mutter ist dabei .
El Sherbini bittet W. freundlich , die Schaukel für ihren
Sohn zu räumen .
W. wurde " sofort aggressiv " , sagen Zeugen vor Gericht .
Sie habe kein Recht , auf dem Spielplatz zu sein , blafft W. El Sherbini an , und auch nirgendwo sonst in Deutschland .
Er beschimpft sie als " Islamistin " und " Terroristin " .
Ihr Sohn , sagt W. , " wird uns alle in ein paar Jahren in die Luft sprengen " .
Beruhigen lässt er sich weder von seiner Mutter noch von anderen Eltern deutscher und russischer Herkunft , die sich einmischen .
Doch El Sherbini weicht nicht zurück .
Dies sei ein öffentlicher Spielplatz für alle Kinder , entgegnet sie in fließendem Deutsch .
Schließlich ruft ein Mann die Polizei , El Sherbini zeigt W. an .
Er wird zur einer Geldstrafe verurteilt und geht in Berufung .
Am 1 . Juli wird verhandelt .
Die Ägypterin spricht weit besser Deutsch als W. , das betonen mehrere Zeugen .
Marwa El Sherbini verkörpert vieles , was Alex W. nicht ist .
Sie ist eine kluge , gebildete , selbstbewusste Frau , die aus einer wohlhabenden Familie in Alexandria stammt .
Sie ist erfolgreiche Handballspielerin und studierte Pharmazeutin .
Gemeinsam mit ihrem Mann Elwy Okaz kam sie 2005 nach Dresden , Mustafa ist hier geboren .
Okaz promoviert am Max - Planck - Institut für molekulare Zellbiologie und Genetik .
Er ist auf dem Sprung in die wissenschaftliche Elite , sie erwartet ihr zweites Kind .
Marwa El Sherbini ist eine Gewinnerin , Alex W. ein Verlierer .
Hat er sich deshalb auf sie gestürzt ?
Vielleicht war sie auch einfach nur zur falschen Zeit am falschen Ort , wie es Oliver Wallasch nennt , der El Sherbinis Bruder als Nebenkläger vertritt .
In seiner Einlassung zum Ende der Beweisaufnahme will Alex W. ein anderes Bild vermitteln .
In der Erklärung , die sein Anwalt verliest , gesteht er die Tat , auch zu seiner " ausländerfeindlichen Gesinnung " bekennt er sich .
Sein Motiv aber sei Enttäuschung über die deutsche Justiz gepaart mit Angst vor einer Gefängnisstrafe .
Auch geplant haben will W. den Angriff nicht .
Das Messer trage er immer bei sich .
Nach seiner Festnahme habe er " bedauert , dass es geschehen sei , dass ich mein Leben versaut habe und nicht selbst bei der Aktion erschossen wurde " , lässt W. verlesen .
Den Namen Marwa El Sherbini erwähnt er nicht , auch ein Zeichen von Reue oder eine Entschuldigung an die Hinterbliebenen gibt es nicht .
Den psychiatrischen Sachverständigen Stephan Sutarski , der am Donnerstag sein Gutachten unter Ausschluss der Öffentlichkeit vorstellte , hat W. damit nicht beeindruckt .
Der Angeklagte sei voll schuldfähig , so Sutarskis Schlussfolgerung .
Auch eine Handlung im Affekt durch eine Bewusstseinsstörung schloss er aus .
Damit droht W. eine lebenslange Freiheitsstrafe .
Das Gericht will das Urteil am Mittwoch verkünden .
Am Donnerstag wird Alex W. 29 Jahre alt .
I honestly did n’t believe this when I saw it .
I thought it was a joke .
Or perhaps just one writer on a larger group blog .
But in fact , the blog , Little Green Footballs , is written by one guy , Charles Johnson .
And he has a history of writing a pretty seriously conservative blog , to put it lightly .
His post yesterday is spot on .
Now , I know , some of the naysayers are going to say “ do n’t believe it . ”
But I do believe it .
What he wrote is too spot on to be faked or insincere .
And as I ’ve written before , we have to foster attempts by sane Republicans to take back their party .
At some point in the future , voters will get fed up with Democrats and switch the White House and the Congress back to Republican rule .
We do n’t need Sarah Palin , Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck running the party when that day comes , or the country will be in serious trouble .
Yes , having the crazies in charge help us keep the GOP out of power .
But having the crazies in charge if and when the GOP comes back into power is far too dangerous a thing to wish on our enemies , and ourselves .
You can read his entire post here .
Keep in mind , the blog has n’t gone Democratic .
It ’s simply gone sane .

Without even looking at you , I 'm pretty sure you have a posture problem .
That 's because almost everyone I see has a posture problem .
After years of evaluating clients at my fitness center in Indianapolis , I 've learned to spot an anatomical abnormality from the way a guy walks through the mall , sits on a park bench , or stands at a bar .
The trouble is n't just that slumped shoulders make you resemble a Neanderthal .
Over time , your poor posture takes a tremendous toll on your spine , shoulders , hips , and knees .
In fact , it can cause a cascade of structural flaws that result in acute problems , such as joint pain throughout your body , reduced flexibility , and compromised muscles , all of which can limit your ability to burn fat and build strength .
But do n't worry — all these problems can be corrected .
Are you ready to straighten yourself out ?
Use this head - to - toe guide to make sure your posture is picture - perfect .
Analyze Your Alignment
Strip down to a pair of shorts and ask a friend to take two full - body photos , one from the front and one from the side .
Keep your muscles relaxed but stand as tall as you can , with your feet hip - width apart .
Now compare your photos with the illustrations below to diagnose your posture problems .
Then see the following repair plans .
Forward Head
Where pain strikes : Your neck
The problem : Stiff muscles in the back of your neck
Fix it : Stretch with head nods daily : Moving only your head , drop your chin down and in toward your neck while stretching the back of your neck .
Hold for a 5 count ; do this 10 times .
The problem : Weak front neck muscles
Fix it :
Do this neck " crunch " every day : Lying faceup on the floor , lift your head so it just clears the floor .
Raise your head , and hold for 5 seconds ; do 2 or 3 sets of 12 reps daily .
Elevated Shoulder
Where pain strikes : Neck and shoulders
The problem : Your trapezius ( the muscle that starts at the back of your neck and runs across your upper back ) is shortened .
Fix it : Perform an upper - trap stretch .
With your higher - side arm behind your back , tilt your head away from your elevated side until you feel the stretch in your upper trapezius .
Apply slight pressure with your free hand on your stretched muscle .
Hold for 30 seconds ; repeat 3 times .
The problem : A weak serratus anterior , the muscle just under your pecs running from your upper ribs to your shoulder blades
Fix it :
Try chair shrugs .
Sit upright in a chair with your hands next to your hips , palms down on the seat , and keep your arms straight .
Without moving your arms , push down on the chair until your hips lift off the seat and your torso rises .
Hold for 5 seconds .
That 's 1 rep ; do 2 or 3 sets of 12 reps daily .
Rounded Shoulders
Where pain strikes : Neck , shoulder , or back
The problem : Tight pectoral muscles
Fix it :
Try a simple doorway stretch :
Place your arm against a doorjamb in the high - five position ( that is , forming an L ) , your elbow bent 90 degrees .
Step through the doorway until you feel the stretch in your chest and the front of your shoulders .
Hold for 30 seconds .
That 's 1 set ; do a total of 4 daily .
The problem : Weakness in the middle and lower parts of your trapezius
Fix it :
Use the floor L raise : Lying facedown on the floor , place each arm at a 90 - degree angle in the high - five position .
Without changing your elbow angle , raise both arms by pulling your shoulders back and squeezing your shoulder blades together .
Hold for 5 seconds ; do 2 or 3 sets of 12 reps daily .
Hunched Back
Where pain strikes : Neck , shoulder , back
The problem : Poor upper - back mobility
Fix it :
Lie faceup on a foam roller placed about midback , perpendicular to your spine .
Place your hands behind your head and arch your upper back over the roller 5 times .
Adjust the roller and repeat for each segment of your upper back .
The problem : Weak muscles in your back
Fix it : Perform the prone cobra .
Lie facedown with your arms at your sides , palms down .
Lift your chest and hands slightly off the floor , and squeeze your shoulder blades together while keeping your chin down .
Hold for 5 seconds ; do 2 or 3 sets of 12 reps daily .
Anterior Pelvic Tilt
Where pain strikes : Lower back ( because of the more pronounced arch in your lumbar spine ) .
The tilt also shifts your posture so that your stomach pushes outward , even if you do n't have an ounce of belly fat .
The problem : Your hip flexors , which allow you to move your thighs up to your abdomen , are tight .
Fix it : Kneel on one knee and perform a front hip stretch .
Tighten your gluteal ( butt ) muscles on your kneeling side until you feel the front of your hip stretching comfortably .
Reach upward with the arm that 's on your kneeling side , and stretch in the opposite direction .
Hold this position for a count of 30 seconds , and repeat 3 times .
The problem : Weak glutes
Fix it :
The glute bridge is your solution .
Lie on your back with your knees bent about 90 degrees .
Squeeze your glutes together and push your hips upward until your body is straight from knees to shoulders .
Hold for 5 seconds ; complete 2 or 3 sets of 12 reps daily .
Pigeon Toes
Where pain strikes : Knee , hip , or lower back
The problem : Tightness in the outer portion of your thigh ( your tensor fasciae latae )
Fix it : Stand up , cross your affected leg behind the other , and lean away from the affected side until you feel your hip stretching comfortably .
Hold for 30 seconds .
Repeat 3 times .
The problem : Weak gluteus maximus and medius muscles
Fix it : Use an exercise called the side - lying clamshell .
Lie on one side with your knees bent 90 degrees and your heels together .
Keeping your hips still , raise your top knee upward , separating your knees like a clamshell .
Pause for 5 seconds ; lower your knee to the starting position .
Perform 2 or 3 sets of 12 reps daily .
Duck Feet
Where pain strikes :
Hip or lower back
The problem :
You lack flexibility in all the muscles in your hips .
Fix it : Drop to your hands and knees and place one foot behind the opposite knee .
Making sure you keep your spine naturally arched , shift your weight backward and allow your hips to bend until you feel the stretch .
Hold the stretch for 30 seconds , repeat 3 times , and then switch sides .
The problem : Weakness in your oblique muscles and hip flexors
Fix it : Try the Swiss - ball jackknife .
Assume the top of a pushup position but rest your feet on a Swiss ball .
Without rounding your lower back , tuck your knees under your torso by rolling the ball with your feet toward your body .
Roll the ball back to the starting position .
Do 2 or 3 sets of 12 reps daily .

After doing polyphasic sleep for about 5 - 1/ 2 months , I finally decided to switch back to monophasic .
I made the decision about 10 days ago and have already returned to Bearsville .
I went back to my previous pattern of being an early riser .
So now I sleep about 6.5 hours a night and wake up with an alarm at 5 am every morning .
Why the return to monophasic sleep ?
First off , this definitely was n’t a clear - cut decision either way .
I could just as easily have kept going .
As previously noted in my extensive log entries , there were many things I really liked about polyphasic sleep .
Obviously the extra waking time was great .
But there are some drawbacks to polyphasic sleep that ultimately led me to decide to discontinue this pattern .
The drawbacks should be easy to understand even if you do n’t try it personally , so I do n’t think any of these will surprise you .
First off , let me say that I did n’t decide to stop for health reasons .
To my recollection I did n’t get sick even once while sleeping polyphasically , not even a cold .
My energy and alertness were excellent once I made it through the adaptation period .
A lot of people asked me about weight training and exercise — I did n’t have any problems there either .
My recovery after workouts was just fine .
Perhaps the post - workout nap had a positive effect .
I also did n’t decide to stop because of the general weirdness of polyphasic sleep .
It took me many weeks to psychologically adapt to this pattern of sleeping , but I did eventually adapt .
It gave me a whole new perspective on the passage of time .
I saw time as passing continuously rather than being chunked into individual days .
That was such an interesting experience .
The # 1 reason I decided to call it quits is simply that the rest of the world is monophasic .
If most of the world was polyphasic , I probably would have stuck with it .
Obviously when you go polyphasic , you fall out of sync with the way other people live .
You ’re awake most of the night while everyone is asleep .
If you sleep like most people , then the hours you ’ll gain from polyphasic sleep will come in the middle of the night .
And as I gradually learned , nighttime hours are not the same as daytime hours when you live in a monophasic world .
At first I rather liked the novelty of this new way of living .
I enjoyed having all that alone time .
It was great for writing , since I ’d never be interrupted .
But after several months , it began to wear on me .
Although I gained those nighttime hours , I also lost about 90 minutes during the daytime because of my naps .
So that meant less time to interact with people while they were awake .
There were times when that was n’t such a desirable trade - off .
At first it was fun doing things at night .
Las Vegas is a decent place to be polyphasic .
I played poker late at night a few times , and that was fun for a while .
But even though this is a 24 - hour city , most businesses still close at night , and most of the available nighttime activities do n’t interest me .
My family and friends are all asleep at night , and I do n’t know anyone locally who ’s up all night and is n’t working .
And I already spend enough time on the Internet .
So ultimately I was left with many hours of alone time .
Working at night was OK , but I like bouncing ideas off my wife during the day , and that was n’t an option at night .
Also , if I worked at night , I did n’t want to work during the daytime too .
I tried that and quickly grew weary of 20 - hour workdays .
Working at night meant being out of sync with people who worked during the day , like missing business calls and such .
Also , I really enjoy working with sunlight coming in through my window as opposed to using artificial light .
Another challenge was that I had to take my naps fairly regularly , every 4 hours on average .
I could stretch the time between naps every once in a while , but if I did that I ’d have to make up for it later with more frequent naps .
Suppose I want to begin working on a project , but I have a nap coming up in an hour .
I did n’t want to start the project knowing that I could only work an hour before having to nap .
So I tried to shuffle my work around to coincide with my short waking cycles .
That became somewhat annoying because I used to enjoy working 5 - 6 hours without a break .
I did n’t like chopping all of my work into 3.5 - hour blocks , and I often found the naps were getting in the way of my flow state .
This was n’t a very resilient pattern because if something unexpected came up , it would throw off my schedule , and I ’d have to take naps while I was in the middle of a task like writing an article , which broke my train of thought .
Whenever I wanted to do anything socially , I had to bracket those outings with naps on both ends .
I got a bit tired of having to do this .
I could never just up and leave .
I always had to nap first unless I was only going to be out a short time .
Also , I ’d often be both hungry and sleepy when I returned unless I ate while I was out .
My outings often took the form : nap - outing - nap - eat .
I like being spontaneous at times , but you ca n’t be too spontaneous on polyphasic sleep without negative consequences .
That really cramped my style .
I also missed sleeping with my wife .
However , she really liked having the bed all to herself at night .
She said she never slept better .
She actually did n’t want me to go back to monophasic .
But what I really missed was having 90 minutes less with her while she was awake .
Our time together was often interrupted by my naps , especially the one at 9 pm .
For example , we could n’t start watching a movie together at 8 pm without it being interrupted by a nap intermission .
So really it was the combination of all these niggling factors that led me to decide to return to monophasic sleep .
There are some things I really loved about polyphasic sleep , and there are some things I found very annoying .
But now that I ’ve adapted back to monophasic , I have to say that it ’s still not clear who the winner is .
I ca n’t say that I ’ll never return to polyphasic sleep if my circumstances change .
But for right now , for the kind of lifestyle I want to have , monophasic sleep is just a little bit better .
So it ’s back to hibernation mode for me . 🙂
What was it like switching back to monophasic ?
I was n’t sure what to expect when I decided to switch back to monophasic .
It ended up taking me several days to re-adapt .
I started out by going to bed with my wife one night and trying to sleep until morning .
I only managed to sleep a few hours .
I kept waking up , but when I could n’t sleep I just quietly meditated instead .
It was a long , slow night .
The next day I tried to skip naps , but I was n’t very successful .
I still got sleepy at my usual nap times and took three naps .
The second night was slightly better — I was able to sleep longer , maybe 4 - 5 hours total .
Each day / night saw more adaptation , and over the next few days , I reduced my daytime naps from 3 to 2 to 1 .
Eventually I was able to go the whole day with no naps .
I ’m not quite 100 % re-adapted yet , since I still need a daytime nap sometimes , but it ’s close enough .
I may actually keep the early afternoon nap , since I still find it very refreshing .
I am sleeping a good 6.5 hours at night now , although I still wake up once in the middle of each night .
Last night was sort of funny because I actually fell asleep twice while my wife was talking to me .
🙂
I ’m sure some people would rather see me continue with polyphasic sleep — I was amazed at how popular it ’s become and how many people have wanted to try it .
Although I opted to blog about this experiment publicly , it was something I chose to do for personal reasons .
So try not to be upset that I wo n’t be continuing as your friendly neighborhood polyphasic guinea pig .
As I stated at the outset , my main reason for trying this was curiosity .
I wanted to know what it was like .
Now I do . 🙂
Hopefully I ’ve shared enough detail throughout this experiment that anyone else who wants to try it will find the archives very helpful .
Even so , this was an individual experiment , and as such its applicability to other people may be limited .
I ’m not particularly close to the average in many areas ( vegan , left - handed , colorblind , ENTJ , guy who thought Bush was an idiot before he was elected , etc ) .
Polyphasic sleep was one of the weirdest things I ’ve ever done but also one of the best growth experiences of my life .
I ’m really glad I did it .
I ’m sure there will be more wacky experiments yet to come … all in the name of personal growth .
It ’s going to be hard to find something as exciting as this though .
I ’m open to suggestions ( unless you happen to be pissed off that I ’m no longer polyphasic , in which case you should seek counseling or perhaps eat some carrots ) .
So would this be a good time to tell you that the whole polphasic sleep thing was just a big joke ?
April Fools and all that ?
Remember that if you ’re polyphasic , it ’s still the same “ day ” as April 1st , right ?
Do n’t worry — I would n’t do that to you .
While I do appreciate a good joke now and then , this is n’t a joke , although many people seemed to have a hard time believing it at first .
Edit 4/14/06 : For your convenience , here are links to all of my polyphasic sleep log entries in order ( each link will open in a new window ) .
This is a treasure trove of free information for anyone interested in learning about my trial of polyphasic sleep .
To my knowledge these are the most detailed polyphasic sleep logs you ’ll be able to find anywhere on the web .
Sleep well !
