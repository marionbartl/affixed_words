" I 've just been advised about this , the Foreign Minister and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are on top of this case , " he told reporters in Melbourne .
" They are providing every level of consular assistance to the family and the individual concerned . "
Mrs Smoel was arrested by undercover police 14 days ago after leaving the Aussie Bar in Phuket .
She says she is accused of taking a mat from the bar , putting it in her bag and leaving the premises .
Mrs Smoel was arrested by undercover police 14 days ago after leaving the Aussie Bar in Phuket .
She says she is accused of taking a mat from the bar , putting it in her bag and leaving the premises .
Her brother - in - law , Gary Smoel - also at this morning 's conference call - said the arrest centred on what he understood to be a " slops rag " - a towel on a bar to soak up spilt drinks .
Mrs Smoel said she was devastated to have missed her eldest daughter 's appendectomy , Mother 's Day and another daughter 's birthday .
She said she spent four nights in a four - metre square cell with three other inmates before she was released on bail .
Thai police had confiscated her passport and she is required to report to authorities every two weeks as a condition of bail .
She said it was expected to be 14 weeks before her case was heard in court .
" She has received legal advice that suggests that if she is found guilty of night - time theft in Thailand , she faces two to five years ' imprisonment , " lawyer Brendan Murphy said .
" Annice Smoel is an innocent woman .
She has not committed a crime , she did not place the bar mat in her bag , nor did she leave the premises of the bar with it in her bag .
" This is a dire situation and we are calling on the Federal Government to urgently intervene to ensure she can return home to her family .
Smoel told Radio 3AW that the consulate had provided her with a list of lawyers but had told her that the consulate could not interfere in legal proceedings .
" I explained to them that I am innocent but they said that the Thai Government has n't decided that yet .
Until I 've been to court I have n't been proven innocent , " Mrs Smoel said .
" I get very scared when I see police .
I 'm just trying to keep it together , so I can get home , " she said .
Mrs Smoel told Radio 3 AW this morning that she did n't do it .
She said a friend had confessed to police that she had done it and there was video evidence proving her innocence .
" There was video evidence in the bar .
I was nowhere near the handbag , " she said .
" One of the girls involved went down to the police station on Sunday morning and confessed to the crime and apologised and they [ Thai police ] told her to go away .
They did n't care .
" Apparently the police have 48 days to investigate the crime .
" It 's just a really slow and crazy system . "
In a statutory declaration to Victoria Police , Mrs Smoel 's friends said they had played a " silly joke " on Mrs Smoel that had backfired .
" We would like to apologise for any harm , inconvenience or any lack of respect on our behalf .
This was truly not our intention .
" We were all out drinking and became intoxicated .
We put the bar mat into Annice 's handbag and she was unaware that we were playing a joke on her . "
The women said the bar mat did not leave the premises and that they intended to return the bar mat to the table .
They said bar staff approached Mrs Smoel and asked her to open her bag .
When staff saw the bar mat , they called the police .
Aussie Bar owner Steve Wood said Mrs Smoel had " rubbed the wrong people the wrong way " .
He said patrons regularly tried to steal the bar 's beer mats , which were on sale for $ 60 , and were usually spoken to by staff .
But Mr Wood , who was not in the bar the night of the arrest , said police had this time caught Mrs Smoel 's friends in the act .
He told Radio 3AW , Mrs Smoel had fled when approached by police and was later spotted at a beach and walked to Patong police station where she abused the police chief .
Mrs Smoel said police had confiscated her bag and she was having difficulty communicating with police and lawyers .
She said she had spent two nights in a small cell .
" It 's everything you read about , it 's four metres by four metres , concrete slab , big bars , " she said .
" The toilet makes you feel sick just to look at , no toilet paper .
" They would bring food twice a day .
It was food from the street . "
Mrs Smoel , whose husband , Darren , has flown to Thailand to be with her , said she now just wanted to get home to her children .
" I'm OK , I 'm hanging in there , I do n't feel like I can really deal with what 's happened until I get home with my kids and I 'm just trying to hang in there and do it one day at a time and get home . "
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said consular officials from the Australian embassy in Bangkok were aware of the arrest .

Is Harvard Law professor Charlie Nesson crazy ?
As Nesson himself admits , " this does seem to be a question on many people 's minds . "
In our recent conversation with Nesson , the professor said he hopes to turn the Joel Tenenbaum P2P file - swapping case into a wide - ranging discussion on copyright .
But a set of newly published e-mails indicate that Nesson wants to go further than anyone — including the most prominent " free culture " academics — previously suspected .
Not content to argue that massive statutory damages are unconstitutional in such cases , Nesson plans to press an audacious claim : noncommercial P2P file - swapping is " fair use " and thus totally legal .
This week , Professor Nesson published to his blog a batch of private e-mail correspondence about his strategy in the case .
In the e-mails , he lays out his plan of attack .
" Fair use " is not so much " defined " in US copyright law as it " bounded " by a set of four questions that can be applied to any particular use of copyrighted material to see if the use is allowed without permission .
The questions ask whether the new use is " transformative , " whether it uses a part of the original work or the whole thing , what the effect of the use is on the future market for the original , and what sort of work the original piece was ( published or unpublished ?
factual biography or fictional novel ? ) .
Using the test , even noncommercial file - sharing would seem to fail , since it is is no way transformative , copies the entire song in question , and seems to have at least some negative effects on the market for that song .
But Professor Nesson believes that " fair use " as a concept goes beyond the Copyright Act .
" Fair use is recognized as a common law , perhaps a constitutional concept , not defined by but merely recognized and continued by the statute ( Sony , Harper ) ; that the statutory four factors are illustrative and not exhaustive ; that analysis must be case by case ; and the question is a jury issue . "
The strategy then is to seek a jury trial and convince the jurors that fair use goes far beyond the description in US law .
Assuming the jury buys this argument , Nesson can then tap into a basic sense of fairness to claim that a federal trial with the potential of $ 150,000 in damages per song is unfair in a broad sense , especially when Joel was ( allegedly ) a noncommercial P2P user back in 2003 , when rightsholders were still dragging their feet in " licensing commercial alternatives for kids to buy single songs in digital downloads . "
In the attempt to codify this notion of " fairness " into a principle , Nesson comes up with this : " Seems to me to be an understandable principle that it 's okay to consume and share nonrivalrous good which are available on the net for free . "
Experts puzzled
Unfortunately , no one else appears to be buying it , not even the people Nesson and his students hope to call as expert witnesses at trial .
Stanford professor Lawrence Lessig said that he was " surprised if the intent is to fight this case as if what joel did was not against the law .
of course it was against the law , and you do the law too much kindness by trying to pretend ( or stretch ) ' fair use ' excuses what he did .
It does n't . "
Wendy Seltzer , who heads up the Chilling Effects website and served as an EFF staff attorney , was " puzzled " by the fair use argument .
" I fear that we do damage to fair use by arguments that stretch it to include filesharing — weakening our claims to fair use even for un-permissioned transformations , " she wrote .
" I am much more comfortable disagreeing with the law than claiming at this point in time that it already excuses filesharing . "
Terry Fisher , who heads Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet & Society , pointed out that P2P filesharing would likely fail the four factors test .
" This is not to suggest , of course , that it 's sensible for the legal system to be set up in such a way as to enable and encourage the RIAA to go after people like Joel , " he added .
" I devoted much of a book to arguing that it ’s not — and I 'm happy to testify to that effect .
But the fair use doctrine does not , in my view , provide a plausible vehicle for reform . "
The discomfort with strategy extends even to Nesson 's own students , who are doing much of the research and writing .
Ray Bilderback , who is writing the " disclosures " about expert witness testimony , wrote that " all of this looks very bad from my perspective .
I think that introducing our experts at this late stage to the very novel argument that we intend to raise at trial — an argument which has no real basis in case law or moderate academic scholarship — is a blunder that could have very serious consequences .
At this point , I have no idea what our disclosures will look like .
And they have to be filed TOMORROW .
Bad , bad , bad .
We should have been working on this for weeks rather than days . "
Given the general craziness of the case already , one is tempted to say this is simply par for the course .
But posting internal strategy e-mails was n't enough for Nesson , who also uploaded a lengthy audio clip of his wife , Fern , " twittering into my life . "
Fern 's " twittering " takes the form of a ( half - joking ? ) diatribe against Bilderback ( " he annoys me so much , " " the guy is such a schmuck , " " he 's my enemy already , " ) and a rant against those who disagree with Nesson 's reading of the law ( " then they 're going to have to go back to the fucking cases and really consider it instead of spouting all this shit that they 're teaching their students " ) .
It 's all rather ... extraordinary , extraordinary enough that Nesson has now taken down the e-mails from others .
The Internet never forgets , however ; not that Nesson is any way bothered by posting such material .
Throughout this case , he has attempted a radical openness that has ( to date ) irritated the judge , music industry lawyers , and even those lawyers who support his position .
But for those who want to see what goes into a federal case and the strategy that a noted Harvard Law prof pursues as he preps for trial , Nesson may be the ideal litigator .
" Billion Dollar Charlie " certainly does n't hold back , even on potentially embarrassing material .
There is strong evidence for a link between genius and autism .
In the first of three articles about the brain this week , we ask how that link works , and whether “ neurotypicals ” can benefit from the knowledge
Ronald Grant Archive
THAT genius is unusual goes without saying .
But is it so unusual that it requires the brains of those that possess it to be unusual in others ways , too ?
A link between artistic genius on the one hand and schizophrenia and manic - depression on the other , is widely debated .
However another link , between savant syndrome and autism , is well established .
It is , for example , the subject of films such as “ Rain Man ” , illustrated above .
A study published this week by Patricia Howlin of King 's College , London , reinforces this point .
It suggests that as many as 30 % of autistic people have some sort of savant - like capability in areas such as calculation or music .
Moreover , it is widely acknowledged that some of the symptoms associated with autism , including poor communication skills and an obsession with detail , are also exhibited by many creative types , particularly in the fields of science , engineering , music , drawing and painting .
Indeed , there is now a cottage industry in re-interpreting the lives of geniuses in the context of suggestions that they might belong , or have belonged , on the “ autistic spectrum ” , as the range of syndromes that include autistic symptoms is now dubbed .
So what is the link ?
And can an understanding of it be used to release flashes of genius in those whose brains are , in the delightfully condescending term used by researchers in the area , “ neurotypical ” ?
Those were the questions addressed by papers ( one of them Dr Howlin's ) published this week in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society .
The society , Britain 's premier scientific club and the oldest scientific body in the world , produces such transactions from time to time , to allow investigators in particular fields to chew over the state of the art .
The latest edition is the outcome of a conference held jointly with the British Academy ( a similar , though younger , organisation for the humanities and social sciences ) last September .
A spectrum of belief
A standard diagnosis of autism requires three things to be present in an individual .
Two of these three , impairments in social interaction and in communication with other people , are the results of autists lacking empathy or , in technical jargon , a “ theory of mind ” .
In other words they cannot , as even fairly young neurotypicals can , put themselves in the position of another being and ask themselves what that other is thinking .
The third criterion , however , is that a person has what are known as restrictive and repetitive behaviours and interests , or RRBI , in the jargon .
Until recently , the feeling among many researchers was that the first two features were crucial to someone becoming a savant .
The idea was that mental resources which would have been used for interaction and communication could be redeployed to develop expertise in some arbitrary task .
Now , though , that consensus is shifting .
Several of the volume 's authors argue that it is the third feature , RRBI , that permits people to become savants .
Francesca Happé of King 's College , London , is one of them .
As she observes , obsessional interests and repetitive behaviours would allow someone to practice , albeit inadvertently , whichever skill they were obsessed by .
Malcolm Gladwell , in a book called “ Outliers ” which collated research done on outstanding people , suggested that anyone could become an expert in anything by practising for 10,000 hours .
It would not be hard for an autistic individual to clock up that level of practice for the sort of skills , such as mathematical puzzles , that many neurotypicals would rapidly give up on .
Many , but not all .
Dr Happé has drawn on a study of almost 13,000 individual twins to show that childhood talent in fields such as music and art is often associated with RRBIs , even in those who are not diagnosed as classically autistic .
She speculates that the abilities of savants in areas that neurotypicals tend to find pointless or boring may result from an ability to see differences where a neurotypical would see only similarities .
As she puts it , “ the child with autism who would happily spend hours spinning coins , or watching drops of water fall from his fingers , might be considered a connoisseur , seeing minute differences between events that others regard as pure repetition . ”
Simon Baron - Cohen , a doyen of the field who works at Cambridge University , draws similar conclusions .
He suggests the secret of becoming a savant is “ hyper- systematising and hyper- attention to detail ” .
But he adds sensory hypersensitivity to the list .
His team have shown one example of this using what is known as the Freiburg visual acuity and contrast test , which asks people to identify the gap in a letter “ c ” presented in four different orientations .
Those on the autistic spectrum do significantly better at this than do neurotypicals .
That might help explain Dr Happé 's observations about coins and raindrops .
Insight , too , is given by autists themselves .
Temple Grandin is a professor of animal science at Colorado State University .
She also writes about her experience of being autistic .
As she describes in the volume , one of the differences she perceives between her experience and that of most neurotypicals is that she thinks in images .
She says her mind is like an internet search engine that searches for photographs .
To form concepts , she sorts these pictures into categories .
She does not , however , claim that all autistic people think like this .
To the contrary , she describes two other sorts : pattern thinkers who excel at maths and music , and verbal specialists who are good at talking and writing , but lack visual skills .
The latter might not qualify as autistic under a traditional diagnosis , but slip into the broader autistic spectrum .
The question of how the autistic brain differs physically from that of neurotypicals was addressed by Manuel Casanova of the University of Louisville , in Kentucky .
Dr Casanova has spent many years dissecting both .
His conclusion is that the main difference is in the structure of the small columns of nerve cells that are packed together to form the cerebral cortex .
The cortical columns of those on the autistic spectrum are narrower than those of neurotypicals , and their cells are organised differently .
The upshot of these differences is that the columns in an autistic brain seem to be more connected than normal with their close neighbours , and less connected with their distant ones .
Though it is an interpretative stretch , that pattern of connection might reduce a person 's ability to generalise ( since disparate data are less easily integrated ) and increase his ability to concentrate ( by drawing together similar inputs ) .
Rain and sunshine
Given such anatomical differences , then , what hope is there for the neurotypical who would like to be a savant ?
Some , possibly .
There are examples of people suddenly developing extraordinary skills in painting and music in adult life as a result of brain damage caused by accidents or strokes .
That , perhaps , is too high a price to pay .
But Allan Snyder of the University of Sydney has been able to induce what looks like a temporary version of this phenomenon using magnetism .
Dr Snyder argues that savant skills are latent in everyone , but that access to them is inhibited in non-savants by other neurological processes .
He is able to remove this inhibition using a technique called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation .
Applying a magnetic field to part of the brain disrupts the electrical activity of the nerve cells for a few seconds .
Applying such a field repeatedly can have effects that last for an hour or so .
The technique has been approved for the treatment of depression , and is being tested against several other conditions , including Parkinson 's disease and migraines .
Dr Snyder , however , has found that stimulating an area called the left anterior temporal lobe improves people 's ability to draw things like animals and faces from memory .
It helps them , too , with other tasks savants do famously well — proofreading , for example , and estimating the number of objects in a large group , such as a pile of match sticks .
It also reduces “ false ” memories ( savants tend to remember things literally , rather than constructing a mnemonic narrative and remembering that ) .
There are , however , examples of people who seem very neurotypical indeed achieving savant - like skills through sheer diligence .
Probably the most famous is that of London taxi drivers , who must master the Knowledge — ie , the location of 25,000 streets , and the quickest ways between them — to qualify for a licence .
The expert here is Eleanor Maguire of University College , London , who famously showed a few years ago that the shape of the hippocampus , a part of the brain involved in long - term learning , changes in London cabbies .
Dr Maguire and her team have now turned their attention to how cabbies learn the Knowledge .
The prodigious geographical knowledge of the average cabbie is , indeed , savant - like .
But Dr Maguire recently found that it comes at a cost .
Cabbies , on average , are worse than random control subjects and — horror — also worse than bus drivers , at memory tests such as word - pairing .
Surprisingly , that is also true of their general spatial memory .
Nothing comes for nothing , it seems , and genius has its price .
Savant syndrome , then , is a case where the politically correct euphemism “ differently abled ” has real meaning .
The conclusion that should be drawn , perhaps , is not that neurotypicals should attempt to ape savants , but that savants — even those who are not geniuses — should be welcomed for what they are , and found a more honoured place in society .
No we are n’t talking pianos , but Grand Solar Minimums .
Today a new milestone was reached .
As you can see below , we ’ve been leading up to it for a few years .
( Update : based on comments , I ’ve updated the graph above to show the 2004 solar max by sliding the view window to the left a bit compared to the previous graph .
– Anthony )
A typical solar minimum lasts 485 days , based on an average of the last 10 solar minima .
As of today we are at 638 spotless days in the current minimum .
Also as of today , May 27th , 2009 , there were no sunspots on 120 of this year ’s ( 2009 ) 147 days to date ( 82 % ) .
Paul Stanko writes :
Our spotless day count just reached 638 .
What is so special about 638 ?
We just overtook the original solar cycle , # 1 , so now the only cycles above this are : cycles of the Maunder minimum , cycles 5 to 7 ( Dalton minimum ) , and cycles 10 + 12 to 15 ( unnamed minimum ) .
Since the last one is unnamed , I ’ve nicknamed it the “ Baby Grand Minimum ” , in much the same way that you can have a baby grand piano .
We would now seem to have reached the same stature for this minimum .
It will be interesting to see just how much longer deep minimum goes on .
Of course it depends on what data you look at .
Solar Influences Data Center and NOAA differ by a few days .
As WUWT readers may recall , last year in August , the SIDC reversed an initial count that would have led to the first spotless month since 1913 :
Sunspeck counts after all , debate rages … Sun DOES NOT have first spotless calendar month since June 1913
NOAA did not count the sunspot , so at the end of the month , one agency said “ spotless month ” and the other did not .
From Spaceweather.com in an April 1st 2009 article :
The mother of all spotless runs was of course the Maunder Minimum .
This was a period from October 15 , 1661 to August 2 , 1671 .
It totaled 3579 consecutive spotless days .
That puts our current run at 17.5 % of that of the Maunder Minimum .
By the standard of spotless days , the ongoing solar minimum is the deepest in a century : NASA report .
In 2008 , no sunspots were observed on 266 of the year ’s 366 days ( 73 % ) .
To find a year with more blank suns , you have to go all the way back to 1913 , which had 311 spotless days ( 85 % ) :
The lack of sunspots in 2008 , made it a century - level year in terms of solar quiet .
Remarkably , sunspot counts for 2009 have dropped even lower .
We do indeed live in interesting times .

YOKOSUKA , Japan , May 7 ( UPI ) --
Some 6,000 morning commuters were told to get off trains and walk along railway tracks near Tokyo Thursday after a train had brake trouble , the railway said .
The Yokosuka Line train , bound for Narashino , Chiba Prefecture , from Yokosuka , Kanagawa Prefecture , became stranded between stations when its brakes became stuck around 6:50 a.m. local time , the East Japan Railway Co. said .

An estimated 357,000 commuters on other trains were also inconvenienced when train services were temporarily suspended on the parallel Keihin - Tohoku Line , the railway commonly called JR East said .
Several Yokosuka
Line passengers were hospitalized after complaining of sickness from being stranded in trains for up to 2 1/2 hours , the Kyodo News service reported .
While the train with brake trouble eventually completed its run to Tokyo around 9:30 a.m. , two trailing trains that came to a halt between stations did not .
About 6,000 commuters on those trains were told they had to get off and walk along the tracks to the nearest station , the news agency said .
JR East is the largest passenger railway company in the world and one of the seven Japan Railways Group companies .

The ‘ silent majority ’ has to shut up .
No seriously , they do .
In order to be a silent majority they have to first – wait for it – be silent about something .
And the current group that claims this title while planning and touting a “ FNC Tax Day Tea Parties ” or Tax Day Tea Party , is far from quiet .
“ Silent Majority No More ” , reads the front page of the Tax Day Tea Party website .
Fox News hosts are attending the gatherings around the country .
Silent ?
Majority ?
First , they have to be gentle .
Stoic .
But mainly , hushed .
Then they have earned the right to call themselves the brilliant , Nixon coined ‘ silent majority ‘ .
He was referring to the people that were n’t protesting .
Hint , hint .
Yes , a perfect moniker for lovers of all things rhetorical .
The phrase implies that if you do n’t vocally disagree – you ’re by default onboard .
Genius .
So , Tax Day Tea Parties are planned for April 15 – tax day .
Thousands of protesters ( not all in the same place ) are going to protest .
Something .
Obama probably .
Government maybe ; with politicians that hate government .
Mostly Obama .
Their message is clear – they ’re sick of not being heard .
As one commenter put it on taxdayteaparty.com , “ HI - TEA parties across America - A great idea !
YES -
We can have a voice in the direction of our country . ”
Yes .
Say it .
And another , “ This administration has made the people that have been paying attention MAD AS HELL AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT .
STAND UP STAND UP STAND UP . ”
Yes , stand up .
You ’ve been pushed around by Obama for too long – nearly 80 whole days .
You poor long suffering muted people .
Wait , taxes ?
Are they angry about taxes ?
And there ’s a tea party ?
Like a revolt ?
Like the precursor to the Revolutionary War ?
The Boston Tea Party was standing up to tyranny after years of neglect .
Not standing up to being mad that your candidate did n’t win .
The tea was a symbol of the tone deafness and arrogance of King George .
Everyone knew Englishmen ( which the colonist were ) could never live without tea , so British Parliament imposed a huge tax on it .
So instead of Liptons being thrown into various bodies of water around this country – the symbolic equivalent would be cutting up your credit cards .
Credit card companies are taxing Americans with no representation – but they know that Americans can’t live without them .
So where ’s that mutiny ?
The Founding Fathers were n’t hotheads .
They did n’t just ‘ get mad ’ and usurp a king ’s authority .
They had real grievances , real ideals , real leaders and a really brutal , bloody struggle .
The Fox News Channel Tax Day Tea Parties wasting perfectly good tea to protest government spending is like Jeep Cherokee sponsoring a Trail of Tears 5 K .
Yeah .
Yeesh .
But they ’re mad !
And they ’re ‘ teabaggin‘ .
And the ‘ Mainstream Media ’ is just ignoring this super important story except for Fox News who ’s attached their name to the demonstration .
Yeah .
A mainstream media news channel part of a huge media conglomerate ( whose charm to its loyal followers is that it ’s ‘ alternative ’ ) is beating the drum for this protest .
Your grassroots movement can’t have corporate media sponsorship .
But heck , if you ’re an ear piercing minority calling yourself a ‘ silent majority ’ what ’s a little fact fudging between friends .
It ’s a little archaic throw back to the Bush Misnomers ( titles for things that do n’t match what they actually do ) – the Clean Sky Initiatives ( that aided in pollution ) – The Patriot Act ( that squashed The Constitution ) or my favorite The State of the Union Address ( the wedge for the divide was more like it ) .
Conservatives are either high - profile kvetchers or the silent majority .
Not both .
Republicans are either breaking filibuster records or the silent majority .
Not both .
You guys are heard .
Like Phil Donahue once said to Bill O’Reilly on his show , “ Loud does n’t mean right . ”
Actually , Phil , these days – it does .
I am a member of the actual current silent majority ( all the polls have Obama ’s job approval rating hovering over 60 percent , more than who voted for him ) .
I want the stimulus bill to stimulate the economy .
I want businesses and markets to be regulated just enough to ban legal pirates but not too much to make them dead in the water .
And I hope that it works .

Fans of TheCarConnection.com might remember our Weird , Wacky and Wild Street Names contest a few years back -- with winning street names like Psycho Path , Divorce Court and Farfrompoopen Road taking the day .
Here 's a set of roads famous for a very different reason .
They 're among the world 's most dangerous roads and intersections .
We 've scanned the Web for pics and clips of the worst roads and intersections around the globe , and found eight that stand tall above the rest .
Some are dangerous and proven so by statistics -- others are pretty obvious , as you 'll see here .
Check over with the Association for Safe Travel for more information , and see a chart of the world 's worst roads -- and drive safely wherever you may be , especially on these roads :
Bolivia 's Road of Death
Above is just one of the hairpin turns and thousand - foot drops on North Yungas Road in Bolivia , also known as the Road of Death .
Widely considered the most dangerous road in the world , the Yungas trail runs for 40 cliff - hanging miles from the Amazon jungle to the Andean highlands .
At places , it 's only 10 feet wide , and has no guard rails or any driver protection .
National Geographic 's excellent minifeature on the Yungas Road shows just how dangerous it can be :
Deosai National Park
Deosai National Park trail , Pakistan
Pakistan is home to another road that traverses unsafe territory -- down to this rickety bridge that challenges even the toughest drivers and vehicles .
It 's in Deosai National Park , or the " land of the giants , " at the top of one of the highest plateaus in the world .

A682 Lancashire
A682 , Great Britain
The A682 in Great Britain through Lancashire is a treacherous one -- and it's the major road through that region .
It 's racked up almost 100 deaths over a ten - year period , so many that the European Road Assessment Programme called it the worst road in Britain .
St. Petersburg , Russia
This video of a traffic light in St. Petersburg , Russia , has been circulating on Facebook and YouTube for a while .
And still , few other intersections can demonstrate so vividly how wide roads , poorly planned turns and traffic lights can conspire to kill :
Pembroke Pines , Fla .
Pembroke Pines , Florida
Back in 1999 , the insurers at State Farm studied U.S. roads to arrive at a list of the 10 worst intersections in America .
Topping that list ?
The intersection of Flamingo Road and Pines Boulevard in Pembroke Pines , Fla. , beating roads in Philly , Phoenix , Tulsa and suburban New Orleans .
We 're sure it 's been fixed since then ... right ?
U.S. 19
U.S. 19 , Florida
MSNBC says this may be the most dangerous road in the U.S.
A hundred pedestrians were killed crossing the road during one five - years stretch .
It 's infamous enough to have its own Flickr group .
In all , pedestrians and accidents on one part of the road in Pinellas and Pasco County tallied 262 deaths over five years .

Jesse Ventura has been going on TV a lot lately because he 's promoting his new book , but he 's been littering the airwaves with the carcasses of dead conservative talking points when it comes to the topic of torture and George Bush .
Elisabeth Hasslebeck had had the misfortune of trying to tackle Ventura earlier on The View , and had been exposed for the moron she is , especially on torture .
So Ventura was on " Hannity " last night and much the same kind of complete and utter smackdown proceeded .
Best of all , get this : Sean Hannity thinks America is better off after George Bush instead of before .
I 'm serious .
I 'll do a Conservative / Pelosi impression on him and say that he 's either a very sick man mentally a complete liar , a hairpiece hag or all three .
Hannity also did his teleprompter bit on Obama .
Here 's just a few of Hannity 's insane ramblings ( buckle up , it 's a rough ride ) .
Sean tried his best to get Jesse to bite on the " Bush inherited a rescession " bit -- which , um , did n't go very well ...
Ventura :
You 're telling me that the United States was better off after George Bush or before him ?
Hannity : After .
Ventura : Oh , my God .
How can you make that statement ?
Hannity : I just did .. and I 'll tell you why ...
Ventura :
It 's ridiculous ... This country was far better off ( No. ) before George Bush then it is after George Bush .
Hannity then read off his usual list of Islamofascist horrors confronting America and he asks Ventura what he would do .
Hannity : ... and we have radicals that think God is going to reward them with virgins in Heaven Jesse , how do we stop em ?
Tell me , what do you do ?
Ventura :
You pay attention to memos on August sixth that tell you exactly what Bin Laden is going to do .
Instead we hear Condoleezza Rice going , " I did n't know what they were going to do . "
And the memos says Bin Laden set to hijack planes and ram them into buildings and your buddy George Bush , he was on vacation in Crawford at the time .
Do you know he took over 900 days off for vacation ?
Hannity : The President 's never off .... Do you know that , Let me give you an example ...
Ventura :
This one was on his watch because the biggest attack happened on his watch .
Hannity went into the deficit and Ventura told him Bush left it :
Hannity : This is Obama 's deficit ...
Ventura : To fix George Bush 's mess .
To debate a bully you have to be a bully , unfortunately , and Ventura rolls over him like a rag doll .

NBC Universal and its networks have been criticized for the global warming alarmism it parades on a regular basis .
However , now the criticism is coming from its own affiliates .
Prior to its April 26 airing on MSNBC , shows on NBC had been promoting the first part of the climate special “ Future Earth ” – an MSNBC program that used computer animation to show the possibilities of a polar icecap melting .
That prompted Bill Steffen , a meteorologist for NBC ’s Grand Rapids , Mich .
affiliate , to call out MSNBC for that special .
Steffen challenged several premises of “ Future Earth : Journey to the End of the World , ” on his WoodTV.com blog .
Steffen debunked the entire series premise that is posted on the MSNBC Web site : “ Find out why Earth ’s climate machine — the North Pole — is melting alarmingly fast .
Learn about our planet ’s future , and how you can stop its decline . ”
“ First , the North Pole is not ‘ Earth ’s Climate Machine , ’ ” Steffen wrote .
“ There is far more heat and area in the Tropics than at the North Pole .
Second , YOU ca n’t stop its decline ( assuming it ’s declining ) !
Nature is big – you personally are insignificant compared to nature .
Do n’t you wish you had the power to control icecaps !
If you do n’t mind some profanity , check out George Carlin ’s take on ‘ Saving the Planet . ’
Third , MSNBC does not know ‘ our planet ’s future . ’ ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Steffen rebutted claims of the MSNBC special saying that ice in the Antarctic has actually been expanding and that polar ice melting alone would not cause sea level to rise as depicted in the “ Future Earth . ”
“ Keep in mind that if the Polar icecap ( without Greenland ) melted … it would hardly cause sea level to rise , because the icecap is currently displacing water in the Arctic Ocean , ” Steffen wrote .
Steffen also pointed out , as many others have , the financial stake NBC Universal ’s parent company General Electric ( NYSE : GE ) has invested in cap - and - trade becoming law .
“ One last point , MSNBC is owned by General Electric , ” Steffen wrote .
“ GE is already making money off the issue with their Carbon Credit Master Card ( link from ‘ Treehugger , ’ no less ) .
Here ’s CNN ’s story on the new credit card . ”
Steffen even showed how much GE has spent lobbying for environmental causes , originally reported by the Washington Examiner on March 3 .
“ Interesting note :
In the fourth quarter of 2008 as GE / NBC stock fell 30 percent , GE spent $ 4.26 million on lobbying — that ’s $ 46,304 each day , including weekends , Thanksgiving and Christmas , ” Steffen wrote .
“ In 2008 , the company spent a grand total of $ 18.66 million on lobbying .
Reviewing their lobbying filings , GE ’s specific lobbying issues included the ‘ Climate Stewardship Act , ’ ‘ Electric Utility Cap and Trade Act , ’ ‘ Global Warming Reduction Act , ’ ‘ Federal Government Greenhouse Gas Registry Act , ’ ‘ Low Carbon Economy Act , ’ and ‘ Lieberman - Warner Climate Security Act . ’
Do you think this ‘ big business ’ is just concerned about the environment ? ”

We can't allow the government to introduce legislation which allows the ID card database to be used for tax enforcement
Campaigners against ID cards have warned for years that the ID verification process will give the authorities power to monitor a person 's spending and draw conclusions about their tax declarations and real income .
These fears were dismissed by government supporters and journalists as hysterical but now they turn out to be rather well - founded .
Secondary legislation laid before parliament last week reveals that the taxman will have access to the log of a person 's major transactions , hotel bookings , airline tickets , holidays , car payment plans etc .
Naturally the subject of this inspection will have no idea that HM Revenue and Customs is examining their spending log or what deductions , false or otherwise , will be made .
As the Daily Mail pointed out this legislation was quietly introduced to parliament at the very moment that MPs ' fraudulent and tax - avoiding affairs were being revealed by the Daily Telegraph .
A piquant detail in the long story of how parliament has come to revile the ordinary member of the public .
It is absolutely essential for civil society and the conduct of our democracy – or what remains of it – that faceless bureaucrats are not given the power to look into individuals ' spending .
It is another line drawn in the sand that we allow the executive to cross at our peril .
I suggest that we should regard it as part of the battle to equalise the power of the government and the people .
But there are many who do not see the threat and indeed argue for even greater intrusion and data collection by the state .
David Goodhart , the editor of Prospect magazine , wrote recently : " If there is too much suspicion of the state and too many data protection rules the state cannot give us what we want .
It might be useful if we started to see out data as similar to tax , something we willingly surrender to the authorities in return for various benefits . "
In this newly announced piece of legislation , tax and data become intimately associated in a way that Goodhart no doubt applauds .
But it never seems to occur to critics that the state has no natural right to either tax or information .
Both are given up only with our consent , which depends on the demonstrable competence and propriety of the state , something that none of us could swear to today .
Goodhart's is the argument of tyrants and slaves , it urges us to trust the state regardless of the evidence of its fallibility .
Incidentally , it seems ironic that this statist line appears in a magazine part–owned by two wealthy financiers , one of whom , George Robinson is a hedge fund manager who made £ 18 m in 2004 on a turnover of £ 74 m , income that no doubt benefited from the favourable tax environment devised for hedge funds by Gordon Brown .
The supporters of state databases are going to have to campaign very hard over the coming months , not just about intrusion , but also data security .
It will be interesting to see how they propose to guarantee the safety of our data after the 11th day of revelations by the Daily Telegraph , which of course all come from a breach of an official database , just like the one that will monitor our spending .

Kapersky Labs recently took a new , out - of - the - box M&A Companion Touch netbook out for testing , only to find three pieces of factory installed malware .
Kaspersky discovered the malware when they installed their recently - released Security for Ultra Portables on the $ 499 netbook designed for the school market .
Roel Schouwenberg , a senior antivirus researcher at Kaspersky Labs , said the malware appears to have been installed by the factory , since the netbook was brand new and still in its original packaging .
After doing a little more digging , Schouwenberg was able to find multiple Windows system restore points indicating that the machine had been updated with new drivers or had software installed before leaving the factory .

Malware Included Rootkit , Password Stealer
The AutoRun worm , which spreads via infected USB flash drives , was among the three pieces of malware found on the netbook .
Apparently a USB stick that was used to install drivers onto the machine was responsible for the infection .
The infection on the netbook resulted in having a rootkit and password stealer on top of the AutoRun worm .
Factory direct computer malware infections are rare , but Schouwenberg recommended installing security software , updating it by downloading the latest definition file on another computer and transferring the update to the new system and running a full antivirus scan before connecting a new machine to the Internet .

INDULGING in a fatty meal after studying for an exam could boost your results .
A study in rats shows that eating a certain type of fat produces a hormone that helps the brain cement short - term memories into long - term ones .
Daniele Piomelli and colleagues at the University of California at Irvine trained rats to complete two tasks : avoid an area that gave them a shock , and find a platform in a pool of water .
Immediately after the training periods , they injected some of the rats with oleoylethanolamide ( OEA ) – a chemical produced in the small intestine of vertebrates which creates …
All sorts of startling conclusions are being drawn about the failure of California ’s ballot funding initiatives last week .
Newt Gingrich hailed it as another Boston Tea Party , and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman insisted that it condemns California , one of the world ’s largest economies , to banana republic status .
But if it was such a big deal , how come the voter turnout was so low ?
Maybe because the statewide ballot initiatives were a bit of a political practical joke played by a Republican governor and leading Democrats pretending to be dealing on a statewide basis with the consequences of a national economic crisis that can be solved only through massive federal intervention .
There is no way that the people of any state will vote to increase their taxes in the midst of a deep recession , and certainly not when the funding demands seem to have little to do with solving the problem at hand .
As a subheading in the ever - sober Economist magazine put it , “ Voters reject a ballot they could not comprehend . ”
I tried , and after reading the opposing argument in the literature supplied at my nearly empty polling station I voted for the ballot propositions that our governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , had requested .
I assumed that this would help our vastly underfunded inner-city schools .
Later , my son Chris , who teaches in one of those schools , told me that I might have been wrong and that the convoluted paragraphs of the all too typically obtuse California propositions could not improve matters much at all .
So , filled with doubt and guilt , I took solace in the fact that in terms of the money involved it was n’t that big a deal , and that surely the feds , to whom we Californians send more in revenue than any other state , would bail us out as they have the banks .
Heck , the entire projected California budget shortfall comes to only $ 21 billion , a tiny fraction of the banking bailout .
Yes , only — what is $ 21 billion in federal loan guarantees for California to skirt bankruptcy compared with the $ 45 billion given to Citigroup , along with $ 300 billion more in guarantees for that company ’s toxic paper ?
Or how about the $ 185 billion doled out to AIG ?
If Citigroup is too big to fail , is n’t the state of California ?
Does anyone seriously believe that the national economy can snap back to health if California is in the dump ?
The cause of California ’s , and almost every other state ’s , predicament is an economy ruined by deregulation policies that were secured by the lobbying efforts of Wall Street , led most prominently by Citigroup .
So , I expected a federal government that has spent trillions salvaging the banks that got us into this mess to find the relatively minor sums needed to bail out California and other states that have been the victims of Wall Street ’s dangerous games .
But I did n’t count on the tough - love steeliness of President Obama ’s senior adviser David Axelrod , who told Californians that “ there ’s a limit to what the government can do ” when it comes to bailing out our state ( as opposed to the banks ) .
Or of White House press secretary Robert Gibbs : “ Obviously , the state has to make some very tough fiscal decisions … [ given ] the budgetary constraints that they have . ”
Tough for whom ?
Not the politicians of either party .
The results of such decisions are tough for the poor of America , two - thirds of whom are kids , left to the tender mercy of the states , thanks to the sweeping “ welfare reform ” and other programs put into place by the Clinton White House in one of that Democratic administration ’s signature triangulation ploys .
The Los Angeles Times summarized the direction of those difficult choices in a story headlined “ Poor would be hard hit by proposed California budget cuts , ” which stated that Schwarzenegger “ is considering a plan to slash California ’s safety net for the poor by eliminating the state ’s main welfare program , health insurance for low - income families and cash grants to college students . ”
Bail out the banks , but not the 500,000 poor families with children served by the CalWorks program , which will be dismantled , or the 928,000 children covered by the Healthy Families program , slated for oblivion .
At a time when the feds are spending with such abandon in an effort to stimulate the economy , why is it tolerable to leave states in a position where they are forced to fire teachers ?
As the Los Angeles Times reported : “ Schwarzenegger has proposed slashing state spending on education by $ 3 billion to help close the budget gap , and the state would pay dearly for canceling classes , firing instructors , cutting class days and shortening the school year , experts said . ”
How can there be federal funds readily available for banker bonuses but not to keep teachers in the classroom with their students ?
It must have been the kids who caused the meltdown .
A few weeks ago my girlfriend and I went to a gay wedding – and I mean “ gay ” as in two guys getting married , not “ gay ” as in I was " my girlfriend forced me to go to some gay ass wedding last weekend instead of letting me watch the playoffs . "
We had no idea what to expect so we were both very pleasantly surprised – gay people throw kick ass weddings !
Now , just to set the tone here , the guys getting married are not your Abercrombie & Fitch kind of gay – they are lovingly referred to in the community as “ bears ” .
What is a “ bear ” you ask ?
Well , in order to be a “ bear ” you have to qualify in the three B’s : Big ( I ’d say at least an extra 40 lbs ) , Bald ( shaved or thinning or Friar Tuck did n’t really seem to matter ) , and Bearded ( goatee , full beard , Fu- Manchu as long as there were some whiskers ) .
And the majority of people in attendance at the wedding seemed to fit the bill ( I said hello to four different people that I thought I knew only to realize once they turned around it was n’t them – if not for the alcohol it would have been very awkward ) .
The wedding was also held in someone ’s backyard ( since the state of California in an act of utter stupidity decided that marriage has to be between a man and a woman – you know , ‘ cause we ’ve done such a good job with it ) with a pool and lots of sunshine .
Booze was served before , during and after the ceremony .
Chairs were set up in front of a lemon tree and when it was time for the wedding to begin my girlfriend turned and asked which side we should sit on – trying to sound suave I said “ The Grooms ” .
To which my girlfriend scowled and said “ Duh , which groom , douche bag ? ” I had n’t considered that , so after five more minutes of discussion we decided to sit on the side with less direct sunlight ( that also happened to be closer to the bar ) .
The ceremony was surprisingly fast and even more surprisingly sweet .
Several people spoke and the Groom and Groom wrote their own vows that were witty , funny , and very heartfelt .
I was struck by the utter appreciation the two had for each other and how glad they were to be getting married – which I do n’t often feel at regular “ breeder ” weddings – usually all I feel at those is bored to tears and how much the day is really all about the bride and the groom just better not fuck things up .
Then the chairs were cleared away and the reception started .
This was my favorite part of the whole day .
I mentioned earlier that “ bears ” are big guys , right ?
They had the reception catered by …wait for it …
Pie 'n fucking Burger !
My head nearly exploded .
No surf n’ turf here people .
No dried out chicken Kiev with room temperature cream of chicken soup ladled over it .
Oh - no , were talking fresh , hot , juicy cheese burgers with grilled onions and all the French fries you could eat .
I consumed three helpings then it was time for pie , bitches .
Apple , pecan chocolate , some kind of crème , and a host of others I barely remember because my brain stopped functioning after the second piece of apple .
It was hands down one of the best weddings I have ever been to – until the clothes came off and the pool turned into a big , bald , bearded gay grotto .
Not that I have anything against it , I just know it ’s not safe to swim right after eating .
Republicans were out this weekend in force , holding town - hall meetings designed to " reconnect " with constituents -- and demonstrating in the process that they remain as clueless as ever .
As it happens , there was also an interesting Rasmussen poll showing that those constituents basically despise them :
Just 21 % of GOP voters believe Republicans in Congress have done a good job representing their own party ’s values , according to a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey .
Sixty - nine percent ( 69 % ) say congressional Republicans have lost touch with GOP voters throughout the nation .
These findings are virtually unchanged from a survey just after Election Day .
Among all voters , 73 % say Republicans in Congress have lost touch with the GOP base .
Seventy - two percent ( 72 % ) of Republicans say it is more important for the GOP to stand for what it believes in than for the party to work with President Obama .
Twenty - two percent ( 22 % ) want their party to work with the President more .
In other words , the Republican base , by a large margin , is unhappy with their party 's political leadership for not being right - wing enough .
And that happens to comport with what their real leadership , aka the Right - Wing Punditocracy , has been saying .
Unfortunately for Republicans , the electorate at large has a distinctly different outlook .
They strongly want Republicans to cooperate with President Obama , and strongly believe they are not making a good - faith effort to do so , either .
Republicans want to fight , but this not a fight Republicans are winning :
A new CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll shows that the president has a 63 percent favorability rating .
But 31 percent of Americans approve of how congressional Republicans have conducted themselves , a dropoff of 13 percentage points from February when the same question was asked .
Here 's the standard GOP analysis of the problem :
Shortly after the November elections , Republicans en masse began to acknowledge that the party had lost its way on the issue of fiscal discipline during the Bush administration .
Their vote against the stimulus bill was the first real test for Republicans to exercise their frustration with what they describe as excessive federal spending .
And they 're shaping a message around this theme .
" We are united , " said Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas , chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee .
" The debt of this country is a national crisis and a national security issue . "
The problem with this is that Republicans seem to believe that it was simply George W. Bush 's profligate ways with the budget that caused the economic disaster we currently are confronting .
And that 's part of the picture , to be sure .
But only a small part .
The cold reality is that , as we explained after the election , the economic turmoil was created by a broad swath of Bush policies that , in every respect , were clear products of conservative fiscal and governmental philosophy :
The swirling global economic crisis produced by Republican rule is only the most prominent debacle produced by eight years of conservative philosophy being put into action .
Conservatives never met a deregulation scheme they did n't like -- and it was that very mania for breaking down well - established institutional barriers , particularly in the financial sector , that led to the housing bubble and the collapse on Wall Street .
Certainly , Democrats played along , often eagerly -- but they were being conservative when they did .
No doubt the solutions to the economic crisis will entail re-regulating the financial sector and imposing strict government oversight .
And when they do , no doubt conservatives will accuse Democrats of indulging " socialism " .
But it is to laugh : the right has earned all the credibility of Joe the Plumber on such matters .
Especially when you consider all the other fruits of conservative governance : Foreign - policy debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A government that invades nations under false pretenses .
A nation less secure and at greater risk of terrorist attacks than ever .
A sinking economy .
An expanding gap between rich and poor .
Utter inaction on global warming .
$ 5 - a - gallon gasoline .
An unresolved immigration problem .
An incapacity to deal with natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina .
A debacle in public - school education testing and funding .
Declining food and consumer - product safety standards .
A government that spies on its own citizens .
A government that tortures prisoners held in their detention facilities .
These messes were n't the result of George W. Bush being too liberal and straying too far from the movement 's party line .
To the contrary -- they 're the direct result of him toeing that line to the millimeter .
They are all the direct product of the conservative philosophy of governance .
So it 's not surprising that the public now believes more in liberal solutions than conservative ones :
The survey found the public holds greater confidence in Democrats than in Republicans in handling most of the issues that are involved in Obama 's legislative agenda .
Democrats were favored by a margin of 61 percent to 29 percent on education ; 59 percent to 30 percent on health care and 59 percent to 31 percent on energy .
Congress is expected to consider major legislation later this year in all three areas .
Democats were also viewed with more confidence in handling taxes , long a Republican strong suit .
The only issue among nine in the survey where the two parties were rated as even was in the war on terror .
Conservatives had their shot and blew it -- and it goes well beyond George W. Bush 's budget failures .
“ With all Obama wants to do and all he ’s got going , it ’s going to take more than four years , ” said Larry Gibbons , 58 , a retired restaurant manager and a Republican in Phoenix who voted for Mr. Obama ’s opponent , John McCain .
Speaking in a follow - up interview to the poll , he said , “ Obama is attacking everything at once and I do approve of that . ”
Throughout Mr. Obama ’s candidacy and his young presidency , race has been a subtle thread woven through his message of change .
Yet the president shies away from talking about it .
In response to a question at his last news conference , Mr. Obama conceded that his election had created ‘’ justifiable pride on the part of the country , ” then quickly shifted gears , adding , “ That lasted about a day . ”
But Americans do feel differently about race and race relations with Mr. Obama in the White House , according to poll respondents who spoke in follow - up interviews .
Some , like Jacqueline Luster , 60 , a retired bank employee in Macedonia , Ohio , say that the times are changing , and that Mr. Obama seems to be speeding that change .
“ With him as president , people seem to be working together toward the same goals , and that has helped race relations , ” said Ms. Luster , who is black and a Democrat .
“ Before there was more of a separation , blacks working for black goals and whites for white goals .
Obama has helped change the perception of blacks in a positive way , but it ’s also the times . ”
Another Democrat , Lisa Fleming , 49 , who is white , said that even in the small Illinois town , Potomac , where she lived , she noticed “ people of different races being kinder to each other ” since Mr. Obama ’s election .
In Kansas City , a white Republican homemaker , Mary Robertson , 78 , said Mr. Obama ’s ‘’openness and acceptance have helped others be more open and accepting . ”
The nationwide telephone survey was conducted Wednesday through Sunday with 973 adults .
For purposes of analysis , blacks were oversampled in this poll , for a total of 212 , and then weighted back to their proper proportion in the poll , based on the census .
The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all people , and plus or minus seven points for blacks .
Cue the Fox News hate machine for President Barack Obama bowing .
I can see it now :
How dare he supplicate in his own office !
Apparently a White House staffer ’s son wanted to see if Obama ’s haircut felt like his own , so the President bent over so the boy could pat his head .

( or Always a Release Candidate , Never a Release )
In How to Ruin Your Ability to Release Software I described the release process a colleague 's workplace uses .
That discussion started with a complaint about a subject near and dear to my heart : release candidate cycles .
The Semantic Dance
A release candidate is a build of the software that everyone hopes has no bugs users will care about .
In truth , everyone knows it has bugs , and so it 's actually a release made to prove that you intend to release software sometime , and if no one reports any bugs in it , you can tell them it's their fault that , when you finally get around to releasing software , the really - released - this - time - no - foolin ' has bugs , even if you knew about them before you released the release candidate .
My colleague 's project has one very simple metric for when they can produce a release candidate : the project has no bugs labeled " unhandled " in the bug tracking system .
In other words , the difference between a build of the software suitable for end users is whether someone has changed the label of every new bug in the bug tracking system .
( While you can use the number of bugs as an indicator of some information about the quality of the software and the rate of change in the number of bugs as a derivative of the quality of the software , keeping in mind popularity and availability , I 'm not sure the text of particular UI widgets in the bug tracking system even has the whiff of a usuable metric .
Talk about data - driven programming ! )
Of course , that does n't work , and ( if anyone actually tries the release candidate -- they 're universally buggy , so why would you ? ) people report bugs , and all the project wanted to do was finally release a new version of the software , and so it 's time to stop doing everything else and fix all of the bugs without making any other changes to the system .
If you 're very unlucky , or if your project manager is actively hostile or did n't understand the sentence in Dr. Royce 's paper which says " This does not work " , this is the first time a separate QA group has seen the software .
Preventing Change at All Costs
The goal of a release candidate is to be completely boring .
Nothing should happen .
Users and testers should discover no bugs .
Nothing should go wrong .
If anything , you should lose weight , look ten years younger , and drive a nicer car .
The point of having release candidates at all is so that the final , eventual , we - really - did - it release will be that boring .
Rumor has it that China will hand - deliver a lovely fruit basket to the Dalai Lama if this ever happens .
Projects with release candidates often create a branch in their source code repositories to represent a stable point for development .
For " stable " read " nothing can ever change , unless it 's to fix a bug , and then it 's only the most minor change possible . "
In other words , stability ( does the software build , does it meet customer needs , does it work ? ) is less a goal for day - to - day development than it is for the once - in - a - blue - moon crunch time when someone realizes that software that you never release to customers is worthless .
The reason for creating a stability branch is so that developers can continue to develop software without worrying about those pesky concerns ... yet .
There 's always time later to fix things .
You can see this attitude in bug triaging and bug fixing .
" This bug is n't very important .
We can downgrade its severity .
This bug is too hard to fix the right way .
Let 's just hack around it . "
Of course , developers have to wait to hear back from QA -- and in organizations with a strong barrier between dedicated QA and developers , you wo n't see developers looking for their own bugs .
Developers will go off and build the next big wad of code to cram into a pending release right before the next release candidate branch branches .
Imagine the tangle of merging from branch to branch .
Imagine the work involved in unraveling minimally intrusive hacks and fixing bugs the right way .
Imagine the arguments from a developer who wants to run off and write new code and hates to hear that code he wrote six to eighteen months ago could never have worked , and a QA person who knows that he 'll lose this argument and get chewed out for the shoddy quality of the release .
At just the time when a project 's quality needs to increase , the management structure of the project acts to depress its quality by hiding bugs , splitting development efforts , and actively preventing feedback on efficacy and suitability .
My favorite bad example comes from Perl 5 , where all development takes place on a branch called bleadperl .
Another branch represents code which will become Perl 5.10.1 , and likewise Perl 5.8.10 or Perl 5.6.3 or whatever ( Perl 5.8.10 is unlikely , but this development antipattern held for the 5.8.x series ) .
The person in charge of releasing a new stable version of Perl spends a day or so every week merging changes from bleadperl to maintperl .
A significant percentage of the work invested in a new stable release of Perl is manually merging patches already committed between branches .
If this person falls behind or goes on vacation , the differences between bleadperl and maintperl increase , and the time to produce a new stable version of Perl increases .
( Now imagine if all development took place on branches and only merged to trunk when they were stable ; suddenly there 's an extra day a week available for Perl 5 development . )
Backwards Day
If you 'd never seen software development before , you might think that the normal rules of life do not apply here .
Unfortunately , they do -- it 's the results of this software process that go wrong .
If you do n't know if your software works , why are you releasing it ?
If you 're not sure if your software meets customer needs , why are you releasing it ?
If your developers can't keep the software stable , why should you believe that they 'll stabilize it later ?
If you play games in your bug tracker , why should anyone trust it ?
If you can only guess if a release is worth using , why would anyone use it ?
Why are so few people asking these questions about their projects ?

That was the case in last night ’s game 5 battle between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Calgary Flames .
After blocking a shot , Matt Walker went to the bench in pain .
He takes his glove off and looks down to see his finger bent in ways it should n’t be .
TSN gets a good replay of the incident , but the best part of all is the reaction of the two ladies behind the glass when they see Walker ’s finger .
You think chicks really dig scars ?
Best part of it all .
He came back and finished the game .
That was the kind of effort the Blackhawks needed and got , taking the crucial game 5 by a score of 5 - 1 .
They now head back to Calgary for game six hoping to avoid a return trip home for a game seven .
Heres the clip of the finger and the reaction .

Ah , computer keyboards .
Once expensive , heavy , and loud contraptions , they ’ve slowly turned into cheap commodity items .
A basic Logitech keyboard will set you back less than $ 10 nowadays , and you might never give it much thought .
As for users with more ample budgets , they ’ll usually splurge on devices with rows of media keys , split “ ergonomic ” layouts , built - in LCD displays , or wireless laptop - style designs .
For a small number of enthusiasts and veteran typists , however , the perfect keyboard is n’t the cheapest or flashiest you can pick up at Best Buy .
Those people believe keyboard designs peaked some time in the 1980s , when IBM started offering the 1391401 — or Model M— with its computers .
“ Everything that ’s come out since then is garbage , ” they might tell you while adjusting their glasses and brushing crumbs from their beards .
And if you ’ve tried a Model M , you might just nod your head in agreement .
What does this have to do with Metadot ’s Das Keyboard Professional ?
Simply put , the Das Keyboard and Model M share a similar design philosophy : emphasizing tactile and auditory feedback over other attributes .
They both produce loud , mechanical clicks after each key press , and they both have bare layouts with no media keys or other frills .
There ’s one big difference , though .
While eBay brims with vintage Model M keyboards priced as low as $ 30 , the Das Keyboard carries a $ 129 price tag .
Is it really worth that much , and can it compare with IBM ’s cult keyboard ?
Buckling springs
What makes the Model M “ click ” is the so - called buckling - spring design .
An actual metal spring lies waiting under each key .
When depressed , that spring buckles and activates the key switch , which in turn produces the trademark clicking sound — so you really feel and hear the successful key press .
Or , in the words of U.S. patent 4118611 , “ The sudden snap action provides a tactile feedback to a human operator due to the sudden decrease in force as will be described more specifically later , and also produces an audible feedback since the sudden pivoting of the rocker member 4 produces a clicking noise . ”
The Das Keyboard feels similar , although it uses a different mechanical switch design engineered by Cherry .
There ’s still a metallic ( stainless steel ) spring inside each key , and keys still click , but the Cherry key switch has a shorter travel time and requires slightly less pressure .
According to the diagrams I collected below , the Das Keyboard ’s keys should depress when subject to around 56 g of force after 1.2 mm of travel , while the Model M will need approximately 70 g and a 2.3 mm displacement .
If you ever used one of the old Apple Extended II keyboards in the 1990s , the Das Keyboard may feel familiar — both units have similar enclosed key switches .
By contrast , most consumer keyboards out there are based on the dome - switch design , where a rubber membrane with “ bubbles ” replicates the feel of springs .
If you ’re in front of a regular desktop keyboard right now , go ahead : pop out one of the keys and look under it .
You ’ll probably see a grimy rubber dome staring up at you .
That dome does n’t cost much to manufacture , and it generates very little noise when it collapses , but it also has a gummy feel that produces far less tactile feedback .
So , because dome - switch keyboards do n’t let you hear or feel exactly how much force you need to depress a key , you might find yourself pushing too hard or too softly .
That can mean either more fatigue or more typos .
Some users try to alleviate those shortcomings with split ergonomic keyboards , which place your hands in a more natural position , but those do n’t really solve the feedback problem — although they can feel comfy enough to type on .
I do n’t have any statistics handy , but I can throw some anecdotal evidence at you .
( Take that however you please . )
I ’ve been typing 2,000 words a day five days a week for around three years on a 1989 Model M , and my fingers , hands , or wrists never get tired .
When I was using a Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro and typing less each day , I suffered from finger pain and annoying wrist tingling on a regular basis .
I actually type faster on the Model M , as well , even though my touch - typing technique has n’t changed .
I therefore believe the spring - based mechanical design provides a more comfortable typing experience , although I can’t deny the shortcomings .
Shoving springs inside each key increases cost and weight , and it makes the keyboard loud .
You probably wo n’t care if you ’re a recluse rattling away in your basement , but other people probably will care if you try that around them .
Then again , folks got by just fine in the typewriter days — it may just be a matter of habit .
Before we move on , I should mention one last upside for the mechanical switch camp : longevity .
I was n’t kidding when I said my Model M is almost 20 years old now .
Despite its age , it still works perfectly .
Keys never stick , get gummed up , or fail to register , even if I sometimes have to oil up the space bar mechanism to prevent it from squeaking .
I challenge you to find a dome - switch keyboard that continues to feel great after two decades ( or even one ) .
That ’s an especially important consideration for the Das Keyboard , since it ’s so much more expensive than regular wired keyboards .
Taking a closer look at the animal
Now that the boring part is out of the way , let ’s have a look at the Das Keyboard Professional .
The first two keyboards to bear the Das Keyboard name catered to an exclusive niche , since they had completely blank key caps .
That made them inaccessible to all but experienced touch - typists .
By contrast , the third - gen Das Keyboard is available both with and without marked key caps .
Metadot dubs the blank version Das Keyboard Ultimate , but we ’re looking at the version with marked key caps today — the Das Keyboard Professional .
Without the blank keys gimmick going for it , this keyboard really needs to stand out because of its tactile comfort alone .
That ’s apparently what Metadot had in mind , because the Das Keyboard Professional really does n’t have many frills .
You get 104 normally placed keys ( including Windows keys ) , three LEDs , a dual - port USB 2.0 hub , and that ’s pretty much it .
Much of the company ’s attention seems to have gone into the details , like the glossy finish , stylish lock indicators , 6.6 - foot USB cable , support for up to 12 simultaneous key presses , lack of “ F - lock ” nonsense , and of course , the clicky key switches .
Incidentally , prying off key caps need n’t involve a screwdriver or very much brute force .
The caps simply slide off the little cross - shaped key switch nubs , although they stay securely in place unless you actively try to tamper with them .
I ca n’t say I approve of the glossiness , since this device is after all designed to come in contact with human hands on an day - to - day basis .
Even Metadot apparently expects the keyboard to collect smudges quickly , because it throws a little wiping cloth in the box .
Nevertheless , the Das Keyboard looks good .
That ’s a welcome change from the Model M and its more recent copycats , which are about as retro as New Coke and Rick Astley music videos .
Unless you ’re still using a CRT monitor and an old - fashioned ball mouse , the Das Keyboard should look more at home on your desk than other clicky offerings .
The Das Keyboard is a good deal lighter and more compact than the Model M , as well .
( Metadot quotes a weight of 2.6 lbs , while the Model M weighs more than double that according to my bathroom scale . )
Those are nice pluses for folks with small desks and LAN party addicts .
On the flip side , you ca n’t use the flat area at the top to store pens and other knick - knacks , and the Das Keyboard probably does n’t make a good weapon .
Keep that in mind next time you get into a fight over code formatting rules or Joss Whedon shows .
Typing on a $ 130 keyboard
So , what does typing on the Das Keyboard Professional actually feel like ?
I compared it to Apple ’s Extended Keyboard II earlier in this review , and that ’s not entirely inaccurate : both units have flatter keys than the Model M , and they both have less travel time and softer springs .
That means you do n’t have to push as hard , which ( in theory ) should minimize fatigue .
Surprisingly , however , I found the Das Keyboard a little cramped .
That ’s not because it ’s any smaller than the Model M .
On the contrary , the home row is actually slightly wider overall .
However , Metadot opted for slightly narrower key caps with larger gaps between them .
This difference amounts to something like half a millimeter per key , but it still caused me to make more typos at first .
( Though perhaps the Das Keyboard ’s shorter overall height also played a part in that . )
Take that impression with a grain of salt : I ’ve been using a Model M on my desktop for about six years , so I ’m a bit like a grouchy old man asked to part with his favorite chair .
Softer feel or not , the Das Keyboard Professional ’s keys are very clicky .
The clicks have a somewhat higher pitch and a less plasticky sound than those on the Model M , so they actually sound a little more like an old typewriter .
If you ’re hoping paying $ 130 will get you the same feel as the Model M without the deafening noise , prepare to be disappointed .
For the reasons I explained eariler , however , auditory feedback is a good thing for typists .
I expect some may want to actually see and hear the device in action , so I ’ve filmed myself typing away on both the Das Keyboard and the Model M. Enjoy :
While we ’re on the topic of noise , I noticed a strange issue with my review unit : the keys hum .
You ca n’t hear it in the video , but hitting a key or slapping the underside of the keyboard produces a resonating musical sound not unlike a faint A3 note .
After further tinkering , I think the noise comes from the springs inside each key .
While you may not hear anything if you ’re listening to music or wearing headphones , it ’s definitely unsettling .
I was even more unsettled when I plugged my Model M back in , because as it turns out , it also produces a sort of ringing sound — just on a higher pitch .
I must ’ve gotten used to it over the years , because I think it ’s fainter and easier to tune out , a bit like a subdued wind chime .
All things considered , though , I think the Das Keyboard Professional feels just great to type on .
It does n’t really replicate the touch and feel of the Model M , but after about a day of use , I ’d be tempted to say it ’s actually a little more comfortable .
Keys require little pressure to hit , and at certain moments , I feel like my fingers are simply gliding over the keyboard instead of painstakingly pressing down on each key .
Coupled with the clickiness , that makes for some very satisfying typing .
Some readers may wonder why I ’m comparing the Das Keyboard to the Model M and not a more recent dome - switch keyboard .
That ’s essentially because the two designs are like apples and oranges : clicky keyboards are in a league of their own in terms of tactile feel , and you ca n’t really replicate that without mechanical key switches .
The Das Keyboard and Model M both feel crisp , responsive , accurate , and satisfying to use , whereas every dome switch keyboard I ’ve typed on has felt mushy and spongy .
If you ’ve tried both keyboard types and prefer the dome - switch variety , then the Das Keyboard is n’t for you .
Simple as that .
The earthquake that hit central Italy in the middle of last night , reducing some towns to rubble and killing at least 90 people , was foretold by an Italian seismologist -- but his warnings were ignored , according to news reports .
However , many researchers say that the seismologist 's predictions were based on inadequate evidence , and say the Italian government was right not to publicize his predictions , as they would only have spread panic .
The region felt its first tremors in mid-January .
Scientists say that tremors do not necessarily indicate that a larger quake is on the way , but seismologist Giampaolo Giuliani grew increasingly concerned .
He published his warnings , which received some attention ; according to Italian newspapers , vans with loudspeakers drove around the town of L'Aquila one month ago telling locals to evacuate their houses .
Then
Giuliani , who based his forecast on concentrations of radon gas around seismically active areas , was reported to police for " spreading alarm " and was forced to remove his findings from the Internet .
" Now there are people who have to apologize to me and who will have what has happened on their conscience " [ Reuters ]
, he told an Italian newspaper .
Giuliani measured radon gas emitted by the smaller tremors , and initially predicted that a large quake would strike on March 29 .
When
it did n't , Guido Bertolaso , head of Italy 's Civil Protection Agency , last week officially denounced Giuliani in court for " false alarm . "
" These imbeciles enjoy spreading false news , " Bertalaso was quoted as saying .
" Everyone knows that you can't predict earthquakes " [ Time ] .
Although at first glance last night 's 6.3 magnitude quake seems to have validated Giuliani 's predictions , other researchers argue that Giuliani 's accuracy was a matter of chance .
Italy 's National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology said in a statement that " at the current state of knowledge " it was not possible to forecast the location , timing and force of an earthquake [ BBC News ] .
While some seismologists working around California 's San Andreas Fault announced last year that subtle shifts in subterranean rocks may presage an earthquake by a few hours , that research is still at an early stage .
Ross Stein of the U.S. Geological Survey notes that there was a flurry of interest in using radon gas measurements to predict earthquakes in the 1980s and early 1990s , but says most researchers gave up on the idea over a decade ago .
Stein explains
that one problem is that radon is a gas that is measured at the surface , which is a long way from where whatever it is that happens to trigger an earthquake , 10 miles below the earth ’s surface , is taking place .
He added that since radon gas is so easy to measure , “ it can launch an armchair industry ” of earthquake forecasters [ The New York Times blog ] .

Shouting " Death to America " and " Death to the Government " , thousands of Afghan villagers hurled stones at police yesterday as they vented their fury at American air strikes that local officials claim killed 147 civilians .
The riot started when people from three villages struck by US bombers in the early hours of Tuesday , brought 15 newly - discovered bodies in a truck to the house of the provincial governor .
As the crowd pressed forward in Farah , police opened fire , wounding four protesters .
Traders in the rest of Farah city , the capital of the province of the same name where the bombing took place , closed their shops , vowing they would not reopen them until there is an investigation .
A local official Abdul Basir Khan said yesterday that he had collected the names of 147 people who had died , making it the worst such incident since the US intervened in Afghanistan started in 2001 .
A phone call from the governor of Farah province , Rohul Amin , in which he said that 130 people had died , was played over the loudspeaker in the Afghan parliament in Kabul , sparking demands for more control over US operations .

The protest in Farah City is the latest sign of a strong Afghan reaction against US air attacks in which explosions inflict massive damage on mud-brick houses that provide little protection against bomb blasts .
A claim by American officials , which was repeated by the US Defence Secretary Robert Gates yesterday in Kabul , that the Taliban might have killed people with grenades because they did not pay an opium tax is not supported by any eyewitnesses and is disproved by pictures of deep bomb craters , one of which is filled with water .
Mr Gates expressed regret for the incident but did not go so far as to accept blame .
The US admits that it did conduct an air strike at the time and place , but it is becoming clear , going by the account of survivors , that the air raid was not a brief attack by several aircraft acting on mistaken intelligence , but a sustained bombardment in which three villages were pounded to pieces .
Farouq Faizy , an Afghan radio reporter who was one of the first to reach the district of Bala Baluk , says villagers told him that bombs suddenly , " began to fall at 8 pm on Monday and went on until 10 pm though some believe there were still bombs falling later " .
A prolonged bombing attack would explain why there are so many dead , but only 14 wounded received at Farah City hospital .
The attack was on three villages – Gerani , Gangabad and Koujaha – just off the main road .
It is a poppy growing area of poor farmers and there were several fields of poppies near the villages .
The Taliban are traditionally strong here and the police and soldiers waiting around the villages were said by eyewitnesses to be frightened .
This would explain why Afghan army commanders might have been eager to call for US airstrikes , though they would have needed the agreement of American special operations officers .
Provincial officials , including the governor Rohul Amin , say that in the lead - up to the bombing there was heavy fighting between hundreds of Taliban and the Afghan Army and police .
Going by Mr Faizy 's account there had been , " a fight some seven or eight kilometres from the three villages in which two Afghan Army and a US Humvee were destroyed .
A third Afghan Army vehicle was captured . "
Three police were killed and four wounded , as was one American and one Afghan army soldier .
This was hardly a major military engagement , but the pro-government forces seem to have got the worst of it and their burned out vehicles still stand in the road .
The loss of life in Afghanistan from air strikes is often worse than in Iraq where houses are more modern and usually have basements .
In the villages in Farah , people were living in compounds with mud brick walls which crumbled easily .
Pictures of the aftermath of the attack show people standing beside the remains of a relative which often only looks like a muddy pile of torn meat .
One elderly white bearded man , said by neighbours to have lost 30 members of his family , squats despairingly beside a body that has been torn into shreds .
Among the few wounded to stay alive is a child with a badly burned face .
One reason why US bombing inflicts such heavy civilian casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq is that both are very poor countries in which houses are very crowded .
When the US used air strikes and heavy artillery with little restraint in the siege of Fallujah in 2004 it caused serious loss of life .
Wedding parties in both countries have often been mistaken for " terrorist " gatherings and bombed .
In Afghanistan opinion polls show that support for the Taliban and for armed attacks on foreign forces rises sharply after events like the bombing in Farah .
President Hamid Karzai frequently criticises the US military for wantonly inflicting civilian casualties , attacks which his opponents say is an opportunistic effort to burnish his nationalist credentials .
The Taliban increasingly use tactics developed by insurgents in Iraq , notably suicide bombing on a mass scale and IEDs , or mines in the road detonated by a control wires or electronically .
In Helmand province yesterday a suicide bomber killed 12 civilians in an attack on a foreign military convoy near the bazaar of the town of Gereshk .
No foreign troops were killed by the explosion , though two were wounded .
Can the United States put pressure on Israel ? :
A user ’s guide
Presidents Bill Clinton , George W. Bush , and now Barack Obama have all publicly stated that the United States seeks a “ two - state ” solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
In other words , the United States supports the creation of a viable Palestinian state in virtually all of the West Bank and Gaza .
The new Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu opposes this goal , and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has already said that he does not think Israel is bound by its recent commitments on this issue .
To advance its own interests , therefore , the United States will have to pursue a more even - handed policy than it has in the past , and put strong pressure on both sides to come to an agreement .
Instead of the current “ special relationship ” — where the U.S. gives Israel generous and nearly - unconditional support — the United States and Israel would have a more normal relationship , akin to U.S. relations with other democracies ( where public criticism and overt pressure sometimes occurs ) .
While still committed to Israel ’s security , the United States would use the leverage at its disposal to make a two - state solution a reality .
This idea appears to be gaining ground .
Several weeks ago , a bipartisan panel of distinguished foreign policy experts headed by Henry Siegman and Brent Scowcroft issued a thoughtful report calling for the Obama administration to “ engage in prompt , sustained , and determined efforts to resolve the Arab - Israeli conflict . ”
Success , they noted , “ will require a careful blend of persuasion , inducement , reward , and pressure … ” Last week , the Economist called for the United States to reduce its aid to Israel if the Netanyahu government continues to reject a two - state solution .
The Boston Globe offered a similar view earlier this week , advising Obama to tell Netanyahu “ to take the steps necessary for peace or risk compromising Israel ’s special relationship with America . ”
A few days ago , Ha’aretz reported that the Obama Administration was preparing Congressional leaders for a possible confrontation with the Netanyahu government .
These developments got me thinking : what might a more even - handed posture look like in practice ?
We already know what it means for the United States to put pressure on the Palestinians , because Washington has done that repeatedly — and sometimes effectively — over the past several decades .
During the 1970s , for example , the United States supported King Hussein ’s violent crackdown on the PLO cadres who were threatening his rule in Jordan .
During the 1980s , the United States refused to recognize the PLO until it accepted Israel ’s right to exist .
After the outbreak of the Second Intifada , the Bush administration refused to deal with Yasser Arafat and pushed hard for his replacement .
After Arafat ’s death , we insisted on democratic elections for a new Palestinian assembly and then rejected the results when Hamas won .
The United States has also gone after charitable organizations with ties to Hamas and backed Israel ’s recent campaign in Gaza .
In short , the United States has rarely hesitated to use its leverage to try to shape Palestinian behavior , even if some of these efforts — such as the inept attempt to foment a Fatah coup against Hamas in 2007 — have backfired .
But what about pressure on Israel ?
The United States has only rarely put ( mild ) pressure on Israel in recent decades ( and never for very long ) , even when the Israeli government was engaged in actions ( such as building settlements ) that the U.S. government opposed .
The question is : if the Netanyahu / Lieberman government remains intransigent , what should Obama do ?
Are there usable sources of leverage that the United States could employ to nudge Israel away from the vision of “ Greater Israel ” and towards a genuine two - state solution ?
Here are a few ideas .
1 . Cut the aid package ?
If you add it all up , Israel gets over $ 3 billion in U.S. economic and military aid each year , which works out to about $ 500 per Israeli citizen .
There ’s a lot of potential leverage here , but it ’s probably not the best stick to use , at least not at first .
Trying to trim or cut the aid package will trigger an open and undoubtedly ugly confrontation in Congress ( where the influence of AIPAC and other hard - line groups in the Israel lobby is greatest ) .
So that ’s not where I ’d start .
Instead , I ’d consider a few other options , such as :
2. Change the Rhetoric .
The Obama administration could begin by using different language to describe certain Israeli policies .
While reaffirming America ’s commitment to Israel ’s existence as a Jewish - majority state , it could stop referring to settlement construction as “ unhelpful , ” a word that makes U.S. diplomats sound timid and mealy - mouthed .
Instead , we could start describing the settlements as “ illegal ” or as “ violations of international law . ”
The UN Charter forbids acquisition of territory by force and the Fourth Geneva Convention bars states from transfering their populations ( even if voluntarily ) to areas under belligerent occupation .
This is why earlier U.S. administrations described the settlements as illegal , and why the rest of the world has long regarded them in the same way .
U.S. officials could even describe Israel ’s occupation as “ contrary to democracy , ” “ unwise , ” “ cruel , ” or “ unjust . ”
Altering the rhetoric would send a clear signal to the Israeli government and its citizens that their government ’s opposition to a two - state solution was jeopardizing the special relationship .
3. Support a U.N. Resolution Condemning the Occupation .
Since 1972 , the United States has vetoed forty - three U.N. Security Council resolutions that were critical of Israel ( a number greater than the sum of all vetoes cast by the other permanent members ) .
If the Obama administration wanted to send a clear signal that it was unhappy with Israel ’s actions , it could sponsor a resolution condemning the occupation and calling for a two - state solution .
Taking an active role in drafting such a measure would also ensure that it said exactly what we wanted , and avoided criticisms that we did n’t want included .
4. Downgrade existing arrangements for “ strategic cooperation . ”
There are now a number of institutionalized arrangements for security cooperation between the Pentagon and the Israel Defense Forces and between U.S. and Israeli intelligence .
The Obama administration could postpone or suspend some of these meetings , or start sending lower - grade representatives to them .
There is in fact a precedent for this step : after negotiating the original agreements for a “ strategic partnership , ” the Reagan administration suspended them following Israel ’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982 .
Today , such a step would surely get the attention of Israel ’s security establishment .
5. Reduce U.S. purchases of Israeli military equipment .
In addition to providing Israel with military assistance ( some of which is then used to purchase U.S. arms ) , the Pentagon also buys millions of dollars of weaponry and other services from Israel ’s own defense industry .
Obama could instruct Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to slow or decrease these purchases , which would send an unmistakable signal that it was no longer “ business - as - usual . ”
Given the battering Israel ’s economy has taken in the current global recession , this step would get noticed too .
6 . Get tough with private organizations that support settlement activity .
As David Ignatius recently noted in the Washington Post , many private donations to charitable organizations operating in Israel are tax - deductible in the United States , including private donations that support settlement activity .
This makes no sense : it means the American taxpayer is indirectly subsidizing activities that are contrary to stated U.S. policy and that actually threaten Israel ’s long - term future .
Just as the United States has gone after charitable contributions flowing to terrorist organizations , the U.S. Treasury could crack down on charitable organizations ( including those of some prominent Christian Zionists ) that are supporting these illegal activities .
7 . Place more limits on U.S. loan guarantees .
The United States has provided billions of dollars of loan guarantees to Israel on several occasions , which enabled Israel to borrow money from commercial banks at lower interest rates .
Back in 1992 , the first Bush administration held up nearly $ 10 billion in guarantees until Israel agreed to halt settlement construction and attend the Madrid peace conference , and the dispute helped undermine the hard - line Likud government of Yitzhak Shamir and bring Yitzhak Rabin to power , which in turn made the historic Oslo Agreement possible .
8. Encourage other U.S. allies to use their influence too .
In the past , the United States has often pressed other states to upgrade their own ties with Israel .
If pressure is needed , however , the United States could try a different tack .
For example , we could quietly encourage the EU not to upgrade its relations with Israel until it had agreed to end the occupation .
I do n’t think Obama needs to employ all of these steps –and certainly not all at once — but the United States clearly has plenty of options if pressure turns out to be necessary .
And most of these measures could be implemented by the Executive Branch alone , thereby outflanking die - hard defenders of the special relationship in Congress .
Indeed , even hinting that it was thinking about some of these measures would probably get Netanyahu to start reconsidering his position .
Most importantly , Obama and his aides will need to reach out to Israel ’s supporters in the United States , and make it clear to them that pressing Israel to end the occupation is essential for Israel ’s long - term survival .
He will have to work with the more far - sighted elements in the pro-Israel community — including groups like J Street , the Israel Policy Forum , Brit Tzedek v’Shalom , and others — and make it perfectly clear that his administration is not selling Israel down the river .
And yes , we are also going to have to keep pressing Hamas to moderate its positions and push the Palestinian authority to create more effective governing institutions .
The key point to grasp is that using U.S. leverage on both sides–and not just one –is not an “ anti- Israel ” policy , if that is what it will take to make the two - state solution a reality .
It is in fact the best thing we could do for ourselves and for Israel itself .
In effect , the United States would be giving Israel a choice : it can end its self - defeating occupation of Palestinian lands , actively work for a two - state solution , and thereby remain a cherished American ally .
Or it can continue to expand the occupation and face a progressive loss of American support as well as the costly and corrupting burden of ruling millions of Palestinians by force .
Indeed , that is why many — though of course not all –Israelis would probably welcome a more active and evenhanded U.S. role .
It was former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert who said “ if the two - state solution collapses , Israel will face a South - Africa style struggle for political rights . ”
And once that happens , he warned , “ the state of Israel is finished . ”
The editor of Ha’aretz , David Landau , conveyed much the same sentiment last September when he told former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the United States should “ rape ” Israel in order to force a solution .
Landau ’s phrase was shocking and offensive , but it underscored the sense of urgency felt within some segments of the Israeli body politic .
Indeed , I suspect it would not take much U.S. pressure to produce the necessary shift in Israel ’s attitudes .
As the recent bipartisan statement notes , “ most Israelis understand and appreciate that , at the end of the day , what really matters most for Israel ’s security is a relationship of trust , confidence , and friendship with the U.S. ”
If the United States believes that a two - state solution is the best option , then it will have to convey that this “ trust , confidence , and friendship ” can be retained if Israel changes course , but can not be taken for granted .
In Haskell , every type has at least one value – ⊥ .
The empty type is not actually empty – it has ⊥ in it , sum types contain the sum of the two types plus one extra element – ⊥ , etc .
But we do n’t always need to do this .
The ⊥ value of a type has one important feature , it ’s the least defined value in the type .
So let ’s investigate the four primitive types :
Empty – as this type has no values , there ’s obviously no least defined one , so we definitely need to add an extra value .
( ) – this type has only one value , so that value clearly is the least defined .
Thus ( ⊥ :: ( ) ) can be defined safely to be ( ) .
Sum types – any value we chose in ( A + B ) must carry a tag to determine which of type A or B it ’s in , and so cannot be the least defined value – if we chose a value in A , it carries enough information to say it ’s not in B , and vice - versa .
Thus for sum types , we must add an extra ⊥ .
Product types – assuming that we have bottom values in types A and B , we can define ⊥ for ( A × B ) as being ( ⊥ :: A , ⊥ :: B ) .
One can clearly make at least two choices here , either the choice Haskell makes – add bottom values everywhere , or add bottom values only where they are needed .
One could argue convincingly that what Haskell does is very consistent and predictable , but interestingly , the other choice has some nice results .
The functor laws demand that fmap id x = x .
A special case of this is that fmap id ⊥ = ⊥ .
Lets look at this for pairs – that means that fmap id undefined = undefined , but this is n’t as lazy as we could be – we ’d like to be able to return a tuple straight away , without looking at any of the tuple we ’re given .
If however we chose to only add a bottom value to a type when needed , then bottom for tuples really is ( ⊥ , ⊥ ) , and we ’re able to define fmap for tuples as fmap f x = ( fst x , f $ snd x ) and not break the Functor laws .
Any more comments about this are appreciated .
What other consequences does this decision have ?
To my knowledge , no one has proposed waterboarding the US Federal Reserve .
But the hostile reaction of much of the country 's political leadership to suggestions that the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) audit the Federal Reserve Board might lead people to think that waterboarding was being called for .
The basic story is straightforward .
The US Congress has lent more than $ 700bn , via the Treasury , to bankers at below market interest rates through the troubled assets relief programme , or Tarp .
This was to keep the banks from going belly up .
At the same time , the Fed has lent more than $ 2 trillion to banks and non-financial institutions to maintain liquidity in the financial system .
The congressional oversight panel , led by Elizabeth Warren , has frequently complained that the Treasury has not always been altogether forthcoming in providing information about its lending practices under the Tarp .
However , there is at least a public paper trail .
We can find out how much money each bank received and under what terms .
By contrast , there is no public paper trail for the Fed 's loans , even though it has more than three times as much money outstanding as does the Treasury through the Tarp .
The Fed has only provided aggregate information on the amount of loans in each of its various lending programs , and general information on the terms of the loans and the types of collateral received .
However , it is not possible to find out in detail how much money Goldman Sachs borrowed , for example , at what interest rate , and which assets it posted as collateral .
The Fed has explicitly refused to make information about specific borrowers public .
In fact , the inspector general who has the responsibility for overseeing the Fed told congress that she does not have this information .
Apparently the Fed does n't even trust its inspector general with information on its lending practices .
It is difficult to understand the rationale for this secrecy .
There may be times where it is necessary for America 's central bank to lend money to a bank without immediately making the information public in order to avoid a panic .
However , it is difficult to understand why this information cannot be made available weeks or even months later .
After all , this money does not belong to the Fed – it belongs to us .
The proposal for a GAO audit of the Fed is a first step towards reasserting democratic control over this institution .
In many respects , the Fed has more direct control over the direction of the economy than the president or congress , yet it carries through its actions largely outside of the public 's view .
Furthermore , it is structured so that the banks have a hugely disproportionate influence over the Fed 's actions .
The Fed 's 12 district bank presidents are appointed through a process dominated by the banks within each district .
These 12 presidents sit on the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , the Fed 's key decision - making body on monetary policy , far outnumbering the seven governors who are appointed through the democratic process .
( Only five of the 12 bank presidents are voting members of the FOMC .
The president of the New York Fed is always a voting member .
The other 4 voting positions rotate among the other 11 districts . )
In a democracy , it is difficult to justify a situation in which the most important economic policy making body is , by design , more answerable to the banking industry than democratically elected officials .
The Federal Reserve Transparency
Act is a step toward making the Fed accountable .
It would simply require that the Government Accountability Office audit the Fed 's books and report to Congress on the bailout and other issues .
While more than 130 Republican members of the House of Representatives have signed on as co-sponsors of the bill , just over 30 Democratic members are co-sponsors .
No one in the Democratic leadership has signed onto the bill .
It is difficult to reconcile the Democrats ' position with President Obama 's often - repeated commitment to transparency .
The resistance to transparency at the Fed will only encourage the public to believe that there actually is something to hide .
The Fed bears primary responsibility for the economic collapse .
Alan Greenspan failed to take any steps to rein in the housing bubble and arguably even promoted it .
It was inevitable that the collapse of an $ 8tn bubble would lead to a serious downturn of the sort that we are now seeing .
This incredible failure of the Fed should raise fundamental questions about its structure .
Certainly it would be a positive step if the Fed were more answerable to democratically - elected officials and less accountable to Wall Street bankers .
A GAO audit would be a big step in the right direction .
Writers of the Bible
( Image )
In this article , biblical scholar Michael Coogan describes the Bible as an anthology of texts composed over centuries by different sets of authors .
Mainstream Jewish and Christian organizations , including seminaries and rabbinical schools , generally embrace such scholarship — seeing the voice of God in a text compiled by human hands .
In the following interview , Michael Coogan , Professor of Religious Studies at Stonehill College and Director of Publications for the Harvard Semitic Museum , offers insights into how scholars today understand how the first five books of the Bible were written .
An anthology of sacred texts
Q : Most people may see the Bible as a single text , but is it ?
Michael Coogan :
One way of thinking about the Bible is that it 's like an anthology of literature made over the course of many centuries by different people .
Think of an analogy : The Norton Anthology of English Literature , which covers over a thousand years , from Beowulf into the 20th century .
The Bible covers a similar span .
The earliest texts in the Bible likely date to before 1000 B.C. , and the latest texts go at least to the 2nd century B.C. , and for Christians , into the 2nd century A.D.
So it is an anthology of the literature of ancient Israel and early Judaism , and for Christians , of earliest Christianity , as well .
Like any anthology , it 's selective .
There were many other texts that the ancient Israelites and early Christians produced that we no longer have .
We have reference in the Book of Numbers , for instance , to the Book of the Wars of Yahweh .
Yahweh was the name of the God of Israel .
And it must have been a wonderful book , but all we have is a kind of learned footnote .
Q : If it 's an anthology , what ties the Bible together ?
Coogan :
More than anything else , the Bible is an account of the actions of God in the world from creation , and especially his dealings with humans , and especially with a certain subset of humans , the ancient Israelites .
So it 's really the story of God acting in history .
Q : Do you think it has a central theme ?
Coogan :
That 's a difficult question to answer .
I think the central message is that there is a God who is deeply and passionately involved in human history , from the scope of empires to the details of an individual 's life .
Within that larger framework , one of the major themes of the Bible is that of covenant .
In Christian tradition , the two parts of the Bible are the Old and New Testaments , and " testament " is just an archaic word for covenant .
Q : Was the Israelites ' idea of a having a covenant with God unusual ?
Coogan :
Well , the word " covenant " in Hebrew , berit , really means contract .
It 's used in the Bible to describe all sorts of secular agreements .
It 's used for treaties between one king and another .
It 's used for marriage .
It 's used in debt slavery , in which someone would pay off a debt by agreeing to work for someone .
Contracts like that are known throughout the ancient world .
The biblical writers used this legal metaphor to describe the relationship between God and Israel , and God and various individuals within the ancient Israelite community .
And that seems unique .
No other ancient people used that metaphor to describe their relationship with their god or gods .
The Five Books of Moses
Q : The first five books of the Bible , which Jews know as the Torah , are also called The Five Books of Moses .
Where did the idea that Moses wrote these books come from ?
Coogan :
In the Hebrew Bible , Moses is the single most important human character , and more space is devoted to the account of Moses ' life and speeches by Moses than to anyone else in the Bible .
Moses is also considered closer to God than anyone else in the Bible .
And certainly by the 5th century B.C. , the idea developed that Moses had written down words that God himself had spoken on Mt. Sinai .
Eventually — and this did n't happen until several centuries later — it came to be understood that Moses wrote all of the first five books of the Bible .
Q : What were some clues that led biblical scholars to question this belief ?
Coogan :
The view that Moses had personally written down the first five books of the Bible was virtually unchallenged until the 17th century .
There were a few questions raised before that .
For example , the very end of the last book of the Torah , the Book of Deuteronomy , describes the death and burial of Moses .
So some rabbis said Moses could n't have written those words himself because he was dead — perhaps Joshua , his divinely designated successor , wrote those words .
But other rabbis said , no , Moses was a prophet , and God revealed to him exactly what would happen at the end of his life .
" Underlying the Bible are several different ancient documents or sources , which biblical writers and editors combined at various stages into the Torah . "
It was n't until the 17th century , with the rise of critical thinking in many disciplines — in science , in philosophy , and others — that people began to look at the Bible not just as a sacred text but as they would look at any other book .
And they began to notice in the pages of the first five books of the Bible a lot of issues that did n't seem consistent with the idea that Moses was their author .
For example , Moses never speaks in the first person ;
Moses does n't say , " I went up on Mt. Sinai . "
There are also a lot of repetitions — the same stories told from different perspectives .
And there are also many , many inconsistencies ; as the same stories are retold , many of the details change .
So scholars began to think not just that Moses was not the author , but that ordinary men and women ( mostly men ) had written these pages .
Q : What are some obvious inconsistencies , for instance in the Noah story ?
Coogan :
In the story of the flood , in Genesis chapters 6 to 9 , there seem to be two accounts that have been combined , and they have a number of inconsistencies .
For example , how many of each species of animals is Noah supposed to bring into the ark ?
One text says two , a pair of every kind of animal .
Another text says seven pairs of the clean animals and only two of the unclean animals .
[ For more analysis of the flood story , see Who Wrote the Flood Story ?. ]
Q : Why would the biblical writers compiling the various accounts include such clear discrepancies ?
Coogan : Even before the Bible became the Bible , even before these texts became official canonical scriptures , there was an idea of preserving ancient traditions .
Preserving ancient traditions was more important than a kind of superficial consistency of plot or detail .
The Documentary Hypothesis
Q : What is the Documentary Hypothesis ?
Coogan : The Documentary Hypothesis is a theory to explain the many repetitions , inconsistencies , and anachronisms in the first five books of the Bible .
In its classic form , it says that underlying the Bible are several different ancient documents or sources , which biblical writers and editors combined at various stages into the Torah as we have it today .
Q : What 's the earliest source ?
Coogan :
The earliest of these sources is the one known as J , which many scholars initially dated to the 10th century B.C. , the time of David and Solomon , or perhaps a bit later , to the 9th century , after the split of the United Kingdom into the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south .
Some scholars today , however , question that dating , placing J as late as the 4th century B.C .
Q : How did it get the name " J " ?
Coogan :
The J source gets its name because it uses the divine name " Yahweh . "
In the stories about Abraham , for instance , God is called Yahweh .
The German word for Yahweh is spelled with a J instead of a Y .
And the German scholars who initially worked on the Documentary Hypothesis called the source " J . "
Q : People reading the Bible today in English do n't come across the name Yahweh .
Why is that ?
Tell us more about the name .
Coogan :
It 's a very mysterious name .
In Jewish tradition it came to be considered so sacred that it was never to be pronounced .
When you ran across this name in the Bible , written with its four consonants , which in English would be YHWH , you never read what that name was , you read some other word , usually a word that means " Lord . "
The Hebrew word is Adonai .
This pious substitution became standard in Jewish tradition and also in Christian tradition .
Almost all translations of the Bible say " The Lord . "
It 's also a mysterious name because we do n't know exactly what it means .
It seems to have been the personal name of the god of Israel .
His title , in a sense , was God , and his name was these four letters , which we think were probably pronounced something like Yahweh .
Q : How does the Bible , in the sections that are attributed to this oldest source , J , depict Yahweh when he first appears ?
Coogan :
The earliest poems we have in the Bible depict the God of Israel , Yahweh , as a god who comes from the south , surrounded by an entourage of heavenly warriors who fight with him .
He appears on mountains with all the accoutrements of a storm — the mountains quake , and the Earth shakes , and the clouds drop down water .
He is , in effect , a storm god , like many other storm gods of the ancient Mediterranean world .
J uses some of this language , and also , J describes Yahweh as a god personally involved with humans , like deities in myths of other cultures .
The E and D sources
Q : So the J source used the name Yahweh , but other sources used a different name for God .
Tell us about the so - called E source .
Coogan :
In Genesis , in many passages , God is called not Yahweh but Elohim .
And some of these passages were identified in the Documentary Hypothesis as coming from a source called E , for Elohim .
The E source is very difficult to characterize .
The J source has a fairly coherent narrative , but the E source is extremely fragmentary .
Some scholars even wonder if there is an E source .
In the classic understanding , the E source seems to have a northern origin , because the stories in the book of Genesis are frequently set in the northern part of Israel , in what became the northern Kingdom of Israel .
" In the Book of Deuteronomy there seems to be a new understanding of God 's relationship with Israel and Israel 's relationship with its God . "
Q : Does E depict God differently than J does ?
Coogan : Yes .
In the J source , God appears directly to people .
For example , he speaks directly to Abraham — he even comes to visit him and has dinner with him in his tent .
In the E source , however , God is more remote .
God does n't appear in person to human beings , but God appears to them in dreams or sends messengers , later to be called angels , or sends prophets , but does n't deal with human beings directly .
Q : What 's the next source , according to the chronology of the Documentary Hypothesis ?
Coogan :
The third source is called D , and it takes its name from the Book of Deuteronomy .
It is found almost exclusively in the Book of Deuteronomy .
Deuteronomy has a very distinctive style , which is very different from that found in the earlier books of the Torah .
It also has important themes that , although found earlier in the Torah , are given special emphasis in Deuteronomy , especially the insistence on the exclusive worship of the God of Israel .
Q : Is it known when this source was written ?
Coogan :
Many scholars think that it was written in the late 8th century B.C.
It was subsequently used by King Josiah , in the late 7th century B.C. , in support of his effort to unify the kingdom and to enforce religious observance .
Q : What does the Bible itself — the later books of the Bible — tell us about Josiah and his link to Deuteronomy ?
Coogan :
We are told in the Book of Kings that King Josiah learned that a scroll had been discovered in the temple archives .
The scroll was brought to him and read out loud before him .
And the narrative goes on to say that , as the scroll was being read , Josiah began to weep , because he realized that it was a sacred text containing divine commands that the people had been breaking .
After he heard the scroll read , King Josiah ordered a sweeping religious reform throughout his kingdom .
And the details of that reform , as described in the Book of Kings , correspond in many details to the divine requirements in the Book of Deuteronomy .
Q : What were some of the requirements ?
Coogan : Josiah required , for example , that all of the shrines to other gods and goddesses throughout the land be destroyed .
He also forbade the worship of Yahweh , the God of Israel , at any place other than Jerusalem .
The Book of Deuteronomy says , " You shall worship the Lord , your God , only at one place , at the place he will choose . "
Scholars have wondered about Josiah 's motivation .
Was it simply his piety ?
Or was there a political motivation as well ?
By requiring that all Israelites worship Yahweh only in Jerusalem , Josiah brought under his direct control the enormous religious establishment of ancient Israel , which up until that time had been scattered in various centers of worship throughout the land .
Q : How does Deuteronomy describe Israel 's relationship with God ?
Coogan :
In the Book of Deuteronomy there seems to be a new understanding of God 's relationship with Israel and Israel 's relationship with its God .
One of the terms that Deuteronomy uses repeatedly is the term " love . "
" You should love the Lord , your God , because he has loved you .
He has loved you more than any other nation . "
So the divine love for Israel requires a corresponding loyalty to God , an exclusive loyalty to God .
And Deuteronomy , more than any other part of the Bible , is insistent that only the God of Israel is to be worshipped .
The final synthesis
Q : What events led to the last major phase of the writing of the Torah ?
Coogan :
In the 6th century B.C. the Babylonians invaded the Kingdom of Judah twice .
In the second invasion , which began in 587 B.C. and ended in 586 B.C. , they destroyed the city of Jerusalem .
It was the end of a way of life .
It was the end of control of the Promised Land by the descendants of Abraham for many , many centuries .
It was the end of the dynasty founded by David .
The Temple , which was supposed to be the only place where Yahweh was worshipped , was destroyed , and a significant part of the population was taken to exile in Babylon .
It was a crisis of enormous proportion .
The great Israeli biblical scholar Yehezkel Kaufmann said it is a watershed , it is when ancient Israel ends and Judaism begins .
Amongst the exiles from Jerusalem to Babylon were priests from the temple .
And they seem to have brought with them their sacred documents , their sacred traditions .
According to the Documentary Hypothesis , they consolidated these traditions — they edited them , and they constructed what became the first version of the Torah .
" The priests collected the ancient traditions and shaped them into the Torah . "
Q : These last writers , the priestly writers , are known as P , right ?
Coogan : Yes .
So it was P who took all these earlier traditions — the J source , the E source , the D source , and other sources as well — and combined them into what we know as the Torah , the first five books of the Bible .
The P source , in fact , frames the Torah with its own material :
The first chapter of the first book of the Bible , Genesis , is from the P source , and most of the last chapter of the last book of the Torah , the Book of Deuteronomy , is also from the P source .
Q : After the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple , the Israelites retained their faith .
That seems remarkable .
Coogan : Yes .
In the ancient world , if your country was destroyed by another country , it meant their gods were more powerful than yours .
And the natural thing to do was to worship the more powerful god .
But the survivors of the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. did not give up the worship of Yahweh .
They continued to worship Yahweh and struggled to understand how this could have happened .
One explanation was that they were being punished deservedly for their failure to live up to the covenant obligations .
Probably one of the reasons why the priests collected the ancient traditions and shaped them into the Torah was so that these covenant obligations would not be forgotten again .
Q : So they kept the faith that , as long as they were loyal to God , God would protect them and return them one day to the Promised Land .
Coogan : Yes .
One of the pervasive themes in the Torah is the theme of exile and return .
Over and over again , individuals and groups leave their land only to return .
Abraham goes down to Egypt and comes out of Egypt .
Jacob goes to a foreign land and returns .
The Israelites go to Egypt and get out .
And for the exiles in Babylon in the 6th century B.C. , that theme must have resonated very powerfully .
God , who had acted on their behalf in the past , will presumably do so again .
To assure that divine protection , the priestly writers stress aspects of religious observance that were not tied down to the land of Israel itself , that were not attached to any particular institution such as the temple , that did not require a monarchy — all of those had ceased to exist .
So the P tradition emphasizes observances such as the Sabbath observance , such as dietary observance , such as circumcision .
You do n't need to be in the land of Israel to keep the Sabbath .
You do n't need a temple or a king or a priesthood to observe the dietary laws .
Any Jew anywhere in the world can do that .
So the priestly tradition , writing for these exiles , was teaching them how to be faithful to the covenant .

A Boston Lisp Meeting will take place on Tuesday , May 26th 2009 at 1800 at MIT 34-401B , where Norman Ramsey will speak about Using Higher - Order Functions and Continuation - Passing Style to Make Dataflow Optimization Simple .
Additionally , we are still accepting proposals for up to two volunteers to each give of a 5 - minute Lightning Talk ( followed by 2 - minute Q&A ) .
Also , there will be a buffet offered by ITA Software .
Registration is not necessary but appreciated .
See details below .

Norman Ramsey will talk about Using Higher - Order Functions and Continuation - Passing Style to Make Dataflow Optimization Simple .
Norman Ramsey 's research spans theory ( a foundational model for probabilistic programming languages ) and practice ( methods for making code generators reusable ) .
While he has contributed to a variety of topics in programming languages and software engineering , his primary interests lie in functional programming and programming - language infrastructure .
His introduction to functional programming came on a Symbolics Lisp machine , but shortly afterward he was seduced by the beauty of algebraic data types and pattern matching .
These days his favorite programmable programming systems are Haskell ( look ! it has Prolog in the type checker and will generate your code for you ! ) and Lua ( the best of scripting , metaobjects , and C rolled up into a tiny package ) .
He is currently Associate Professor of computer science at Tufts University , a job which he enjoys tremendously except that it does not leave him time for enough programming .
His website is at http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/
* *
Having observed the success of the formula at ILC '2009 , we have instituted Lightning Talks at the Boston Lisp Meeting .
At every meeting , before the main talk , there are two slots for strictly timed 5 - minute talks followed by 2 - minute for questions and answers .
The slots for next meeting are still open .
Step up and come talk about your pet project !

Everyone at the quiet Korean religious retreat knew John Chong as the intensely private handyman and welder who worked virtually nonstop and seemed cordial , if at times distant .
They did n’t know the other John Chong , the one who authorities say loaded his .32 - caliber revolver Tuesday night , left his home and began a rampage that shattered the life of this quiet Catholic community near Temecula and set off reverberations throughout the Korean community in this country and abroad .
According to Riverside County sheriff ’s deputies , sometime after 7 p.m. Tuesday , Chong , 69 , walked 300 yards from his small house to a tidy bungalow belonging to Chuneui and Jong Pil Yun , both 58 .
Once there he shot Chuneui in the head , killing her instantly .
His next bullet hit Jong Pil in the chest , leaving him gravely wounded .
A pool of blood remained in the house Wednesday .
Orange slices and a bowl of rice sat on the counter , uneaten .

Chong then walked to the white and yellow cottage owned by Joseph and Juliana Kim with plans to shoot them as well , authorities said .
But the Kims fought back ferociously with fists , furniture and weights .
The battle started on the porch and carried on into the living room .
The front door of the cottage was ripped from its hinges .
On Wednesday , bloodstains could be seen on the porch , the rug and the tablecloth .
Pieces of furniture were flipped over .
Pennies and quarters were flung about the room .
“ From all accounts it was hand - to - hand fighting , ” said sheriff ’s Sgt. Michael Lujan .
“ The suspect had significant blunt - force trauma to the face and remains unconscious . ”
A neighbor , Paula Schultze , heard the shots and commotion .

“ Joseph ’s wife ran to my trailer saying ‘ Help me !
Help me !’ ” she said , standing just a few yards from the Kims ’ home .
“ She had the gun and I took it and put it in the bushes .
Joseph looked beat up . ”
Schultze found a bloody green dumbbell she said the couple used to pummel Chong .
“ It was really horrible , I told them to keep John breathing until the ambulance got here , ” she said .
“ At this point I did n’t know who shot who . ”
Authorities said two shots were fired during the brawl and the Kims suffered facial injuries from which they are expected to recover .
Jong Pil
Yun is also expected to survive his gunshot wounds , Lujan said .

Investigators have not established a motive for the shooting .
Those who knew Chong said he was a skilled maintenance man who built brick walls , dug holes and welded .
“ I spoke with him yesterday , ” said Chuck Owens , 69 , who lives just above the camp .
“ He ’s a very good man and a hard worker .
I think he had personality conflicts with the victims .
He was unhappy because he felt no one was chipping in and pulling their weight .
I think every person has his breaking point .
I cried when I heard it was him . ”
The Kkottongnae Retreat Camp is run by the Congregation of the Sisters of Jesus .
Kkottongnae , which means “ flower village ” in Korean , is a Christian social service organization founded in Korea that works with orphans and the homeless .
Between 50 and 100 people live at the site near Temecula , officials said .
The organization has other retreats in Lynwood , New Jersey and Georgia .
Sister Thaddeus
Suh , community supervisor for the Sisters of Jesus , said the camp would be closed for the next month until they “ come to terms with Tuesday ’s events . ”

Bishop Gerald Barnes of the Diocese of San Bernardino said , “ In these troubling times when we are seeing so many acts of senseless violence , we must hold God ’s peace and grace in our hearts and ask for His strength to bear these tragedies . ”
The shootings hit the Korean community hard .
In the town of Eumseong - gun in South Korea ’s Chungbuk province , Kkottongnae retreat officials were baffled by the violence .
“ We are unable to contact the retreat in the United States right now because the area is restricted , ” said Mateo Park , a public relations representative .

On Wednesday , Korean families , nuns and priests came to the crime scene seeking information about the victims .
“ The people here take in the homeless .
In Korea , they will pick them up off the streets and give them their dignity , ” said Young Balser , who came to offer help translating for the nuns who live at the retreat .
“ They sacrifice their lives for these people . ”
The nuns were eventually taken to a nearby Catholic Church .
Victor Nam , 59 , came from Diamond Bar to see if he could get to the Yun home .
He said the couple came to the U.S. in 1987 and were his best friends .

“ They are very nice people , very good people and are very faithful and devoted to God , ” he said .
“ This whole thing is really shaking up the Korean community . ”
According to Nam , the Yuns moved from Torrance to the retreat five years ago .
Jong Pil , who also goes by his baptized name Benedicto , often served as a translator for the Koreans who could n’t speak English .
His wife , said one resident , served as the retreat ’s cook .
She went by the first name Scholastica .
They have an adult daughter , friends said .
Joseph Kim is a retired airline pilot , according to those who know him .
Pictures of him inside airplanes hang in his living room .
His age is unknown .
The retreat lies at the end of a winding road nestled in emerald green hills studded with crosses and statues of Mary and Jesus .
The complex is composed of bungalows , row houses and dormitory rooms with names like Love , Hope , Joy and Peace .

After investigators left Wednesday , it seemed largely abandoned except for a handful of residents and visitors .
“ Our priest told us to come and check out what happened , ” said Jacob Choe , 56 , a friend of the Yuns from Torrance .
“ It ’s unbelievable . ”
Choe was standing outside the couple ’s home .
Its sliding glass door was ajar and blood stained the floor .
Colorful flowers sat in dozens of pots on the doorstep .
“ They are such a wonderful couple , ” Choe said .
“ I am just so shocked and so sad . ”

Obama Meets Privately With the Dead

The surviving ( and formerly feuding ) members of the Grateful Dead had a secret impromptu meeting Monday evening with the man they credit with reuniting them : President Obama .
The president welcomed all the members of The Dead , who are performing tonight at the Verizon Center in Washington , to the Oval Office just before dinner last night .
They did n't talk music as much as they did history - history about the Oval Office , and the president 's desk .
Apparently the band was quite taken with how tidy the president keeps his desk .
And how down - to - earth he seemed , according a source who was there .
" The president was so gracious .
Really , really nice and so welcoming .
It hit you : you 're in the Oval Office , but it was so normal , " the source told us .
The entourage included the four surviving members of the Grateful Dead - Bob Weir , Phil Lesh , Mickey Hart , Bill Kreutzmann - plus keyboardist Jeff Chimenti ( from Weir 's Ratdog ) and Warren Haynes , who is joining the Dead on their 2009 spring tour as lead vocalist and guitarist .
Some of them had their wives in tow .
As if chatting with the president in the Oval Office were n't cool enough , something remarkable happened on their way out .
Just outside the Oval Office , Phil and his wife , Jill Lesh , spotted a vase full of Scarlet Begonias sitting on a table .
For the uninitiated , " Scarlet Begonias " is one of the late Grateful Dead band leader Jerry Garcia 's most famous songs .
( Check out a youthful looking Jerry Garcia singing " Scarlet Begonias " in this 1977 video , and be sure you have a tissue . )
After admiring the Scarlet Begonias , the band went next door to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to meet with the most prominent Deadheads in the Obama White House : senior advisors David Axelrod and Pete Rouse , and deputy chief of staff Jim Messina .
All three are planning to go to tonight 's one and only Dead show in Washington , we 're told .
After leaving the White House , the members of the Dead - none of whom , surprisingly , wore tie - dyed t- shirts to the Oval Office - walked over to their favorite Washington restaurant , the Old Ebbitt Grill , for dinner .
Given that the Dead sparked the " Deadheads for Obama " movement when they reunited during the 2008 presidential campaign to play a fundraiser for Obama , we expect to see plenty of happy Deadheads at the show .
We 'll give you a full update , so check back .
Lawrence H. Summers plays down his stint in the hedge fund business as a mere part - time job  but the financial and intellectual rewards that he gained there would make even most full - time workers envious .
Mr. Summers , the former Treasury secretary and Harvard president who is now the chief economic adviser to President Obama , earned nearly $ 5.2 million in just the last of his two years at one of the world ’s largest funds , according to financial records released Friday by the White House .
Impressive as that might sound , it is all the more considering that Mr. Summers worked there just one day a week .
Much is known about Mr. Summers ’s days in Washington and Cambridge , but little attention has been paid to his two years in New York , from late 2006 to late 2008 , advising an elite corps of math wizards and scientists devising investment strategies for D. E. Shaw & Company .
Nerve cells play a key role in itching Scientists have shown scratching helps relieve an itch as it blocks activity in some spinal cord nerve cells that transmit the sensation to the brain .
However , the effect only seems to occur during itchiness itself - scratching at other times makes no difference .
While it is widely - known scratching relieves an itch , the physiological mechanisms for how this works are little understood .
The University of Minnesota study appears in Nature Neuroscience .
We all know that scratching helps alleviate itch , but this elegant study helps to show how this mechanism works
Professor Patrick Haggard
University College London Previous research has suggested that a specific part of the spinal cord - the spinothalamic tract - plays a key role .
Nerve cells in this area have been shown to be more active when itchy substances are applied to the skin .
Blocks activity
The latest work , in primates , found that scratching the skin blocks activity of nerve cells in the spinothalamic tract during itchiness - preventing the spinal cord from transmitting signals from the scratched area of skin to the brain .
ITCHING
There are many causes of itch , including more than 50 diseases including shingles , Aids , gallbladder problems and Hodgkin's Disease
The itch produced by many diseases can greatly affect quality of life and can not be treated currently For many types of itch , it is not clear that itch serves any clear purpose Researcher Dr Glenn Giesler hopes the work could lead to ways to relieve chronic itch effectively for the first time .
However , he said more information was still needed about the chemistry underpinning the effect .
Professor Gil Yosipovitch , an expert on itching from Wake Forest University in North Carolina , said the finding was " potentially significant " .
He said : " Although there is a long way to go , methods that can induce a pleasurable scratch sensation without damaging the skin , via mechanical stimuli or drugs that can inhibit these neurons , could be developed to treat chronic itch . "
However , Professor Yosipovitch stressed that scratching and itching were complex phenomena involving factors such as emotions as well as physiology .
" The main open question is what happens in patients who suffer from chronic itch where scratching may actually aggravate itch perception . "
Professor Patrick Haggard , of University College London , said : " We all know that scratching helps alleviate itch , but this elegant study helps to show how this mechanism works .
" It 's an interesting illustration of a very general principle of the brain controlling its own inputs , in this case by making movements that triggers an interaction between scratchy touch and itch . "
Dr Paul Bays , based at UCL's Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience , agreed that the study provided an important part of a physiological explanation for how the sensation of itch is reduced .
" However , it is still unclear why scratching should have this effect , or why it is only effective for itches and not for painful sensations - which are transmitted to the brain through the same pathway . "

7 . Find a clever , workable domain name

Few web phenomenon come close to the sight of seeing an inspired post you write near the top of a Google search — but it's on someone else 's site , plagiarized completely .
Keep track of who 's stealing from you with a search at Copyscape , or subscribe to an RSS feed of your site 's leechers at CopyGator .
Edit your blog 's own RSS feeds to include link - backs that boost your own Google ranking and show the reading world exactly who wrote what when lazy spam - bloggers re-publish your feeds .
And , when all else fails , take a multi-step formal and legal approach to getting the copycat stuff knocked down .
It is n't fun writing to domain hosts , advertisers , or site admins with your copyright gripes , but it 's reassuring when your work is reclaimed as your own .
Thanks and credit to Digital Inspiration for the last two links .
4 . Pay nothing for hosting with free apps

Back when " You Tube " was just a funny way of describing your television , anyone who wanted a web site pretty much had to pay for the domain name and the remote storage space to host it .
Not so in these modern times , when any number of services are begging to give you the free space and tools you need to put yourself , or your project , on the web .
As we 've pointed out , the best of those free apps — like Google Apps , Tumblr , the no-fee hosts like Freewebs and Google Page Creator — can help even the most novice ( yet cheap ) would - be site owner up and running with a decent web presence .
Heck , in some cases , they would n't even pay for a domain name .

Why I Did n’t Buy A Mac
When I decided to purchase a new PC for the Hand Luggage Only project , I had a pretty open mind about what I might get , but I must admit there was one decision already made : I definitely was n’t going to buy a Mac .
I was whining on Twitter recently about yet another annoying Windows bug when my brother challenged me : “ I still wonder why you put up with it .
Vista , I mean . ”
My brother is an Apple convert of a few years standing , so there ’s an implied challenge in here : why have n’t you got yourself a Mac yet ?
There are some pragmatic considerations involved ( a conservative 90 % of the Australian PC market uses Windows , so running a Mac immediately puts you in a minority , which is n’t great when you write about tech for a living ) .
But the answer to that question mostly comes down to a perennial Lifehacker obsession : productivity .
I might be inclined to whinge about how Windows works , but I do understand how it works pretty well .
At the very broadest level , if I decided to switch to Mac , I ’d be spending a lot of time learning where different features and tweaks were hidden .
That certainly would n’t have made sense while I was planning to be on the road non -stop for a month ( my temper is short enough as it is ) , and I ’m not convinced it would make sense even if I had more time to devote to it .
The Mac is also a very mouse - centric environment , and my work style is designed around using a mouse as little as possible .
Yes , I know there are keyboard shortcuts on offer if you choose to dig them up , but the entire platform is still fundamentally based on the notion that drag and drop is a useful way to get things done .
That ’s not a vision of the world I share at all — pretty much the only time I use drag and drop is to file messages in Outlook , and even that I tend to leave and do in batches .
( The same issue is one of the reasons I think iTunes bites . )
I ’m also a great believer in working with applications maximised , and that ’s pretty much impossible on the Mac because of its “ size the windows to the content ” philosophy .
I realise lots of people like this approach , but for me it just means a screen full of distractions .
A more specific objection to the Mac is that I would n’t be able to run Outlook .
( Before you say it — no , I ’m not prepared to use Parallels or Boot Camp to get that done .
For day - to - day work , I want to be running just one OS , thank you . )
I ’ve written before about how Outlook is an essential element of my day - to - day work , and I ’ve yet to see evidence that the various Mac alternatives would meet my needs as well in a single product .
And finally there ’s the simple matter of size .
Even assuming I could get over all those other objections , there ’s no Mac notebook on the market that remotely comes close to the power / size / price combination offered by my Portégé R600 .
The Air is probably a tad thinner , but it has fewer USB ports and the screen is too big .
So what it really boils down to is a bunch of reasons not to shift versus a lot of enthusiastic claims that “ everything just works ” .
I have a reputation amongst friends and colleagues for being able to find the flaws in pretty much any tech ( translation : everything I use tends to crash pretty quickly ) , and I doubt the Mac would be any different .
So it ’s really not a difficult decision .
My initial experience with Windows 7 suggests that it may have eliminated some of Vista ’s more intractable annoyances .
However , even if it turns that Windows 7 also can’t remember folder settings and often treats Wi - Fi as a joke for its own personal amusement , I do n’t see myself embracing the book of Jobs any time soon .
Throughout May 2009 , Lifehacker Australia editor Angus Kidman will be travelling throughout Australia with just one carry - on bag for the Hand Luggage Only project .
WASHINGTON , April 22 ( UPI ) -- Rep. Elijah Cummings , D - Md. , has called for an inquiry into insurance claims made by federally contracted U.S. civilians working in war zones .
Reacting to media reports concerning the difficulties returning civilian contracts have when filing claims , Cummings , a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform requested an investigation in a letter to committee Chairman Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday .

The newspaper and the non-profit journalism group ProPublica had reported that American International Group Inc. , which handles nearly 90 percent of all compensation cases for U.S. workers in foreign war zones , routinely challenged insurance claims made by returning civilians .
The Labor Department said 44 percent of all serious claims and about 60 percent of claims for mental health services were denied to returning contractors .
Casualties among civilian workers in Iraq total more than 1,400 civilian dead and 31,000 injured , the newspaper said .
Civilian workers " should able to return to their families without having to wage another battle here at home to receive the healthcare they are more than entitled to receive , " Cummings said in his request for an official inquiry .
In a statement , AIG said the " vast majority " of claims were processed without dispute , the Times said .
Over the span of 11 years , the Sun ’s activity waxes and wanes as magnetic field lines that are wound and tangled inside the Sun periodically break through to the surface .
These breakthroughs produce a pair of sunspots of opposite magnetic polarity , one positive and the other negative , that travel together across the face of the Sun .
The heightened magnetic activity associated with sunspots can lead to solar flares , coronal mass ejections , and other far - reaching electromagnetic phenomena that endanger astronauts and damage or disrupt satellites .
This series of images from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) spacecraft shows ultraviolet light ( left ) and sunspots ( right ) each spring from 1999 through 2010 .
Sunspots darken the visible surface of the Sun , while observations of ultraviolet light reveal how the magnetic activity that produced the sunspots excited the overlying solar atmosphere , producing intensely bright areas .
As Solar Cycle 23 reached its peak between 2000 - 2002 , numerous sunspots speckled both hemispheres , and then their numbers dramatically dropped off as the cycle went toward its minimum .
If you map the location of the spots on the Sun ’s surface over the course of a solar cycle , the pattern they make is shaped like a butterfly .
The reason for the butterfly pattern is that the first sunspots of each new solar cycle occur mostly at the Sun ’s mid-latitudes , but as the solar cycle progresses , the area of maximum sunspot production shifts toward the ( solar ) equator .
Solar Cycle 24 began in early 2008 , but there was minimal activity through early 2009 .
The image from April 29 , 2009 , does show a pair of small sunspots ( far right , most visible in large image ) , but the location of the spots near the equator means that they belong to solar cycle 23 .
The sunspots visible in the images from May 2 , 2010 , however , are from the new cycle .
The most recent forecast from the Space Weather Prediction Center is that solar cycle 24 will be of below - average intensity , and that it will peak in May 2013 .
The small changes in solar irradiance that occur during the solar cycle exert a small influence on Earth ’s climate , with periods of intense magnetic activity ( the solar maximum ) producing slightly higher temperatures , and solar minimum periods such as that seen in 2008 and early 2009 likely to have the opposite effect .
Wireshark makes it possible to watch an unencrypted Internet chat session while it is taking place , or in the case of Mr. Walton ’s research in India , to watch as Internet attackers copied files from the Dalai Lama ’s network .
In almost every case , when the Ghostnet system administrators took over a remote computer they would install a clandestine Chinese - designed software program called GhOst RAT  for Remote Administration Terminal .
GhOst RAT permits the control of a distant computer via the Internet , to the extent of being able to turn on audio and video recording features and capture the resulting files .
The operators of the system  whoever they were  in addition to stealing digital files and e-mail messages , could transform office PCs into remote listening posts .
The spying was of immediate concern to the Tibetans , because the documents that were being stolen were related to negotiating positions the Dalai Lama ’s political representatives were planning to take in negotiations the group was engaged in .
After returning to Canada , Mr. Walton shared his captured data with Mr. Villeneuve and the two used a second tool to analyze the information .
They uploaded the data into a visualization program that had been provided to the group by Palantir Technologies , a software company that has developed a program that allows investigators to “ fuse ” large data sets to look for correlations and connections that may otherwise go unnoticed .
The company was founded several years ago by a group of technologists who had pioneered fraud detection techniques at Paypal , the Silicon Valley online payment company .
Palantir has developed a pattern recognition tool that is used both by intelligence agencies and financial services companies , and the Citizen Lab researchers have modified it by adding capabilities that are specific to Internet data .
Mr. Villeneuve was using this software to view these data files in a basement at the University of Toronto when he noticed a seemingly innocuous but puzzling string of 22 characters reappearing in different files .
On a hunch , he entered the string into Google ’s search engine and was instantly directed to similar files stored on a vast computerized surveillance system located on Hainan Island off the coast of China .
The Tibetan files were being copied to these computers .
But the researchers were not able to determine with certainty who controlled the system .
The system could have been created by so - called patriotic hackers , independent computer activists in China whose actions are closely aligned with , but independent from , the Chinese government .
Or it could have been created and run by Internet spies in a third country .
So , if we 're to believe the ZuneHD specs that " trickled into " the inbox of Windows Mobile Power User then this is what 's coming from Microsoft :
multi - touch capacitive OLED screen in a 16:9 aspect ratio
3D Xbox game support ( whatever that is )
playback of " HD media " available from Zune Marketplace
TV - out from what looks like a mini-HDMI port on the left - side
HD Radio
choice of 16GB or 32 GB of storage ( not a lot for HD content )
wireless sync
multi - touch " browser " of the Internet - type , presumably ( so why nothing shown on the main menu in the image above ? )
launches this Fall , " around September " in the US , Canada , UK , France and possibly other European countries .
likely to be a " showcase " for Windows Mobile 7 when released ( Huh ? WinM o7 wo n't be out until 2010 .
Perhaps they mean early WinMo7 betas expected in November ? )
While the rumored specs are impressive they are n't completely unprecedented .
Already , we 've seen Samsung 's massive OmniaHD sporting an HDMI jack and biggie 3.7 - inch capacitive AMOLED display stretched into a 16:9 aspect ratio .
Thing is , the OmniaHD 's display has a less than HD 360 x 640 pixel resolution -- HD in this case means 720 p video capture and HD video out .
Definitely have n't seen hand - held sized ( less than 4 - inches ) capacitive OLEDs sporting a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels yet .

There is a reason Megan Fox is dressed this way , but really ... do you care ?
MUSIC NEWS - Reports from the UK's BBC are that RADIOHEAD have gone back into the studio to start work on their follow - up to 2007's smash , IN RAINBOWS .
Bassist Colin Greenwood said to the BBC that the band 's already begun work on their eighth studio album .
He said : " We just went in last week .
It was really good .
It was really noisy and chaotic and really fun .
" We 're at the stage where we 've got the big Lego box out and we 've tipped it out on the floor and we 're looking at all the bits and thinking , what next ? "
They 've again tapped producer Nigel Godrich ( Beck , Pavement ) to help out , but Greenwood explained that the band had no plans yet on the new album 's release : " We 've got lots of ideas but we do n't decide what we 're going to do until we 've finished the thing .
It 's all up in the air , but it was up in the air last time . "
Greenwood also said that it was too early to say whether any new material would make it onto their setlists for their upcoming UK festival gigs at Reading and Leeds this August .
Previously , Radiohead has tested out new material before an audience before its official release , so we can only hope !

The average age of foster parents has risen since 2000
Two thirds of people who foster children are near retirement age , which could leave Wales short of carers in the near future , a charity has warned .
Fostering Network has found 68 % of current carers are in their 50s , 60s or 70s , and could retire from fostering in the next decade .
They say the average age of carers is rising , and have expressed concern over the lack of younger foster families .
The assembly government said it was committed to supporting foster carers .
The report , The Age of Foster Care , found only 8 % of foster carers are in their 30s and the average age of a carer has risen from 46 to 53 for women since 2000 and from 47 to 54 for men .
The charity says there is already a shortage of 700 foster families in Wales , and believe the age of current families make it more likely this figure will rise in the near future .
It wants fostering services to audit their current fostering workforce to assess the potential impact of forthcoming retirements and review recruitment procedures to ensure they appealed to younger people .
It is vital measures are put in place now to ensure that there is not an even more severe shortage of foster carers in 10 to 15 years time
Frieda Lewis
Last month , the charity claimed half of the councils in Wales did not pay their recommended minimum rate to foster carers , leaving them financially badly off .
It called on the Welsh Assembly Government to introduce regulations requiring all fostering services to provide adequate , statutory payment levels .
Frieda Lewis , director of Fostering Network Wales , said : " It 's extremely worrying that such a very high proportion of the foster care workforce is potentially so close to retiring .
" For the sake of the thousands of children who need the support and care of a foster family each year , it 's crucial more people come forward .
" In order to avert the impending crisis , it 's important that we attract people of all ages .
" Older people can bring experience and skills from previous jobs , but it 's essential we also appeal to the untapped pool of those in their 20s , 30s and 40s , who are particularly well placed to offer long - term care to younger children .
" This report also shows that it is vital measures are put in place now by national and local governments to ensure that there is not an even more severe shortage of foster carers in 10 to 15 years time . "
Mags Amos , 30 , who has been fostering with her husband Simon , 35 , for the last year through Cardiff - based Pathway Care , said they were able to relate better to the children they cared for because the age difference was less .
" We have a three year old daughter and there are not many years between some the children we 've been fostering and her , which helps , " she said .
" From the beginning we have found fostering to be very satisfying .
" It sometimes can be difficult and challenging but you have to be calm and patient with them .
Trust and confidence builds up . "
Gail Duffy , 43 , who has been fostering for 11 years , said the benefits for her and her husband had been " incredible " .
" Watching them developing , their achievements along the way , watching them leave school with all their GCSEs when in years previously people had told them they were not capable of , has meant a lot to us , " said Ms Duffy , who has had around 20 children placed with her since 1998 .
A spokesperson for the assembly government said : " We have commissioned researchers to look at a methodology to develop a national fees and support framework to provide a structured approach to support carers and reward them for the care they provide .
" The research will inform the policy development and consultation on the Strategy for Vulnerable Children due later this summer which will consult on a range of measures to support family friends and other foster carers . "

Niklas Kronwall Lays Devastating Hit on Martin Havlat In Game 3
Total Pro Sports –
Last night ’s game three overtime victory for the Chicago Blackhawks not only provided a thrilling finish .
It also produced what many will be calling “ the hit of the year ” .
At least those who thought it was a legal one will likely be doing so .
With just under 7 minutes left in the first period , and the Blackhawks up 2 - 0 , a slap pass from the point by Brad Stuart went wide and was sent around the boards in the Chicago zone .
Martin Havlat picked it up just inside his own blue line .
When he turned up ice , he was greeted with the shoulder of a charging Niklas Kronwall .
Chicago ’s leading scorer in both the regular season and playoffs hit the ice hard and was out .
A scrum ensued around him as his teammates went after Kronwall in his defense .
As the rough stuff continued , the refs looked to break up the fights while protecting Havlat from players ’ skates as he lay motionless on the ice .
Trainers then came out and a very wobbly Havlat was taken off the ice after several minutes .
He did not return .
Kronwall was assessed a 5 minute major and a game misconduct for interference .
The call was a questionable one .
Neither ref’s arm went up when the hit was made ( as footage in the replay shows ) .
Not even several seconds after it had occurred .
Rules do allow linesmen to make calls for 5 minute majors .
That may have been the case here .
Even then , the call can still be viewed as questionable .
The puck was in Havlat ’s skates , and the hit was not from behind .
There was also no elbow , and Kronwall did not jump prior to making contact .
Some can argue that when taking into consideration how hard the hit looked and the damage it inflicted to Havlat , it is tough for the ref not to call something .
However , the 5 minute major call remains questionable .
Do legal hits become illegal when they injure someone ?
How hard are you allowed to hit someone ?
Detroit would end up killing off the major , but an early third period goal for the Blackhawks would put them up 3 - 0 .
All of a sudden some may have been wondering if the Pavel Datsyuk injury is that much of a factor .
The Wings answered that with three goals in the final 5:42 of the second to even the score at 3 - 3 .
With little offensive production in the third from both teams , overtime would be required for the second consecutive game .
Chicago was determined to avoid a similar fate as they received in game 2 , and just 1:52 in they succeeded after Patrick Sharp snapped home a rebound into an empty net .
With the win , the Blackhawks can once again see the light .
It is unsure if either team will have to play without their leading scorer as the status of Havlat and Datsyuk remain up in the air .
Chicago will have to be ready for either situation if they hope to make that light a little brighter Sunday afternoon at the United Center .

This Minotaur rocket launch from Wallops Island in December 2006 was photographed by Geoff Chester in Alexandria , Virginia .
UPDATE May 9 , 12:30 p.m. ET : The May 5 launch was scrubbed .
A May 8 attempt was also scrubbed .
The next attempt is tentatively slated for May 19 .
The article below remains as originally written , and further updates will be available from NASA here .
Should a rocket blast off on schedule early Tuesday evening from NASA 's Wallops Island Flight Facility in Virginia , a potentially spectacular sight might be visible across a wide swath of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard , weather permitting .
It would be only the third attempt at launching an orbital rocket from this coastal Virginia range – located just south of Assateague Island – in the last 13 and a half years .
The first time NASA attempted an orbital launch from Wallops , in October 1995 , the liftoff of a 50 - foot - tall Conestoga rocket ignited normally , but the vehicle exploded over the Atlantic just 46 - seconds later .
A problem with the rocket 's guidance system was blamed .
Then in December 2006 , a 69 - foot - long , 5 - foot wide , 35 - ton , four - stage Minotaur I rocket successfully launched the TacSat - 2 satellite , carrying a semisecret payload from the Pentagon 's Missile Defense Agency .
Now another Minotaur I rocket awaits liftoff from the Wallops Flight Facility Tuesday , May 5 , no earlier than 8 p.m. EDT .
A home video of a Minotaur launch out West in 2005 , shot by Doc Searls with his son , shows they can be spectacular crowd - pleasers .
While many Westerners are fairly familiar with such sightings , they are all but unknown in the East and so may end up surprising millions of people should the Minotaur I lift off on schedule .
The chief goal of this flight is to place the 880 - pound TacSat - 3 satellite with its trio of payloads that will offer real - time imagery ( within 10 - minutes of collection ) , sea - based information transmitted from ocean buoys and plug - and - play avionics to assist warfighters in keeping one step ahead of their adversaries .
In addition , three " cubesats " will be launched as secondary payloads on the TacSat - 3 mission .
A launch window from May 5 to 9 , from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. EDT each day , has been established to take into account bad weather or equipment glitches ( see " Final Points " below ) .
A launch after 8:00 p.m. EDT would occur just after sunset along the entire Atlantic Coastline .
What to expect
Over the years , similar rocket firings have routinely taken place from California 's Vandenberg Air Force Base .
Rocket launches that have occurred around the time of sunrise or sunset have left long , glowing contrails in their wake that have been seen for a few hundred miles across the Desert Southwest ; often becoming contorted by high level winds into strange and exotic patterns and sometimes , prismatic colors .
Based on a very similar launch from Wallops Island in December 2006 and similar dusk and dawn launches from Vandenberg as a guide , I 've determined that it should be possible that Tuesday 's post - sunset launch may be visible as far north as southern Maine ; as far south as northeastern Florida and as far west as eastern Kentucky .
The rocket will be launched on a southeast trajectory .
Approximately six minutes after launch it will be passing north of Bermuda .
Three minutes later it will reach orbital altitude over the middle of the North Atlantic .
Observers who are situated within about 800 statute miles of the Wallops Island Flight Facility appear to have a reasonable chance of catching a view of the Minotaur I contrail within the first few minutes after launch .
The key to making a sighting is to have a clear , unobstructed view of the horizon in the direction of Wallops Island .
For example , a viewer in Raleigh , North Carolina should look toward the northeast ; in Boston , Massachusetts look southwest ; in Wheeling , West Virginia it will be due east .
Areas farther to the northeast ( toward southern New England ) have an advantage since skies will be darker – sunset will come somewhat earlier than it will along the Mid-Atlantic Coast .
At Wallops , it 's at 7:57 p.m. , but from Boston it 's at 7:49 p.m .
Farther to the west , across the Ohio Valley the Sun will still be above the horizon so the launch may only be barely visible , if at all against the blue daytime sky .
But should the launch be delayed by just 30 - minutes , sunset will arrive , sufficiently darkening local skies .
Final points
The Minotaur I is a launch vehicle sometimes called " half man and half beast " because it combines features of the Minuteman missiles and Pegasus rockets .
It also merges space technologies designed for both military and commercial ventures .
Another factor in this launch is the upcoming May 11 launch of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at Cape Canaveral , Florida .
According to Wallops Public Affairs officer Keith Koehler , the Wallops tracking systems are needed to support a shuttle Launch .
" We have to stand down because of the Space Shuttle launch .
We have assets that support the launch .
Then I believe there is another launch at the Cape that will be using assets that we use . "
Wallops is NASA 's cynosure for tracking orbital payloads and receiving meteorological information relating to North America .
And although it has never been used for this purpose , Wallops can also boast that its 8,750 - foot runway , usually reserved for winged - aircraft safety tests , is an approved shuttle emergency - landing site .
The latest launch updates are available from NASA here .

From June 1st , customers of Vodafone , the world 's second largest wireless carrier , will be able to text and call from over 35 countries at no extra charge .
Attention American carriers :
Be more like this .

The service , called " Passport " , will be available as a three - month summer trial for UK subscribers , and can be activated for free .
Customers will be able to travel to just about any country that Vodafone operates in and tap into the minute and text allocations from their regular plan , or in the case of pay - as - you - go customers , call and text at their usual domestic rate .
Data roaming still applies , but come July it 'll be capped at about $ 1.40 per megabyte as per new EU regulations .
As someone who 's stuck in concurrent T - Mobile contracts in two separate countries , I take this news kind of personally .
Steep roaming charges make some sense when you 're jumping between carriers , but they 're stupidly frustrating when you 're paying way more for services from a different arm of the same company .

This obviously does n't mean much for Americans ( although Voda does own a 45 % stake in Verizon ) , but it does represent a precedent we should all push for .
Aside from steep taxes ( as in the UK ) , it 's mainly plain old price gouging — of carriers by other carriers , or of customers by their carriers — that keeps prices so high .

Welcome to my new photo blog .
It 's the place where I 'll be exploring photojournalism and pictures that make the news , highlighting interesting work by photographers on the web and most importantly , the place where you can share your views on the subject as well as your pictures .
You might have noticed that in the past few weeks , we have launched new - look picture galleries across the site .
Here 's one on the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico City by freelance photographer Trevor Snapp ; another drawn from the wires on the first day of the Indian elections and finally one by our readers on the theme of closing .
The new format makes more of the powerful images we use from our staff , freelancers and agency sources .
Though the BBC runs the largest newsgathering operation in the world , our picture gathering is for obvious reasons based on the moving image .
So like the majority of the world 's press , we subscribe to a number of news agencies who provide us with the latest still pictures from the big events of the day .
Many of the photographers who work for wire agencies - such as the Associated Press , Getty Images and , in the UK , the Press Association - are among the best in the world , and we use their pictures to illustrate , contextualise and at times add what Harold Evans , author of Pictures on a Page , describes as " depth of meaning " .
That is the way a picture can add information to a story : something that can't be captured by the written word , it can also encompass an emotional angle .
There will of course be lots more on how we use pictures in future posts , the mechanism of photojournalism , ethics and much more , but for now I just wanted to say hello .
Whether you are a professional photographer , amateur or student , please do let us have your thoughts on our new - look galleries and anything you 'd like me to address .
This blog post about Idris led me to Edwin C. Brady 's 2005 PhD thesis , Practical Implementation of a Dependently Typed Functional Programming Language .
This thesis considers the practical implementation of a dependently typed programming language , using the Epigram notation defined by McBride and McKinna .
Epigram is a high level notation for dependently typed functional programming elaborating to a core type theory based on Luo's UTT , using Dybjer 's inductive families and elimination rules to implement pattern matching .
This gives us a rich framework for reasoning about programs .
However , a naive implementation introduces several run-time overheads since the type system blurs the distinction between types and values ; these overheads include the duplication of values , and the storage of redundant information and explicit proofs .
A practical implementation of any programming language should be as efficient as possible ; in this thesis we see how the apparent efficiency problems of dependently typed programming can be overcome and that in many cases the richer type information allows us to apply optimisations which are not directly available in traditional languages .
I introduce three storage optimisations on inductive families ; forcing , detagging and collapsing .
I further introduce a compilation scheme from the core type theory to G - machine code , including a pattern matching compiler for elimination rules and a compilation scheme for efficient runtime implementation of Peano 's natural numbers .
We also see some low level optimisations for removal of identity functions , unused arguments and impossible case branches .
As a result , we see that a dependent type theory is an effective base on which to build a feasible programming language .

The hunt for the Higgs boson , a theoretical particle thought to convey mass on some elementary particles , is a one horse race right now .
Since the temporary closure of the Large Hadron Collider at Cern near Geneva last year , the only people with a chance of finding the elusive particle work on the Tevatron at Fermilab near Chicago .
I 've written about the brilliant Colliding Particles project here before .
It is run by a group of physicists who are involved in the Higgs hunt .
They make videos to explain not just their particular area of physics , but the broader role and importance of studying nature at its most fundamental level .
The videos are beautiful and inspiring .
And that can't be easy when you 're dealing with particle physics .
I 've posted the latest video installment from the team above and once again it gives a wonderful insight into the way physicists work .
The most fun part though has to be the discussion about the most acceptable phrase to explain what brought Cern 's machine down shortly after it was powered up .
An electrical failure ?
A minor technical malfunction ?
A giant subterranean deathbang ?
While I 'm here , if you missed the Daily Show 's unforgettable visit to Cern , you can see it here .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- I first met Abu Wissam at the foot of his son's shallow grave .
Never will he be able to erase the last image he has of his son's body .
Business school student Raed Wissam was lured to his death aged 25 .
" He was cut to pieces , " he said .
" His hands and feet were chopped off .
And he was decapitated . "
For a long time , Iraqis would say that it was " outsiders " that were carrying out such atrocities .
The truth that is so hard to accept for many is that that often was not the case .
Iraqis turned on each other , neighbors slaughtered neighbors , friends betrayed one another .
It was the sheer degradation of society on a shocking and utterly petrifying scale .
Abu Wissam 's son Raed was a 25 - year - old business school student .
His fiancee says that one day he got a phone call from a college friend asking to meet him .
Little did she know that it was a plot to lure him out of the house and that it would be their last goodbye .
They were childhood sweethearts .
She says they knew that they would get married from the time they were six .
" All I do now is cry , " she sobs .
Raed 's mother can barely form a coherent sentence .
Her voice shakes with every word , uncontrollable tears pour down her face .
Her hands tremble holding Raed 's worn - out photograph .
From time to time she caresses the image , the face that she will never touch again .
" I do n't sleep . "
She stutters .
" I take pills ... I live on pills . "
" Nights are n't nights anymore , days are n't days .
They cut his hands off , they cut his head off . "
Watch World 's Untold Stories - Inside Iraq : Living with the Enemy »
As the last words leave her mouth she can no longer speak , only cry .
The militia behind the kidnapping was the self proclaimed Mehdi Army , a Shia militia loyal to radical cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
And the militiamen were once friends and neighbors .
For years my colleagues and I have reported on the atrocities committed by Shia militias , Sunni insurgents , and al Qaeda gunmen .
We recited the daily tally of unidentified , mutilated bodies found in the streets of Baghdad .
We spoke of beheadings , kidnappings and torture .
But little did we really know about any of it .
Now that there is a semblance of so - called stability , we can start to put a face and name to the victims and begin to try and understand and impart the horrors of what millions of Iraqis lived through and tens of thousands died from .
It is only now that we can begin to comprehend the magnitude of what Iraqis went through .
Raed 's body was found in the courtyard of a mosque not far from his home .
Abu Wissam says that the militia accused Raed of being a spy for the Americans .
They demanded $ 10,000 for Raed 's corpse .
Abu Wissam paid .
The killers did not hand it over .

Nearly a year later , once the militia was forced underground by the " Sons of Iraq " -- a rival U.S. backed militia -- he found Raed 's body .
Twenty - seven other bodies were also dug up , including that of a teenage girl .
We 're told that the militiamen shaved her head before they slaughtered her .
Her family is too petrified to speak to us .
Others clamor around our camera crew .
Clutching photographs of their loved ones still missing .
Desperate to grasp on to any thread that might lead them to those who vanished .
They tell us about how they used to hear the victims ' screams , how that sound still haunts them .
They tell us the killers are still out there .
The pain is palpable .
So much sorrow and anguish , choking emotions , sheer helplessness , in just one location , one mosque in Baghdad with dried blood still streaking the walls .
How does a society just rip apart like that ?
How do families that have grown up together for generations suddenly turn on one another ?
There are plenty of experts and analysts offering their opinions .
As for Abu Wissam , he does n't know why the people he cheerily said good morning to for decades all of a sudden slaughtered his boy .
" They were our neighbors , they lived in the homes around us , " Abu Wissam says .
He tells us how on hot summer days when ice was in short supply and power cuts were rampant , he would take a cold pitcher of water over to their house .
He tells us these were the people who sold vegetables at the market .
Now murderers .
Can a father ever forgive his son's killers ?
Stop seeking justice ?
The families of the victims often gather at Abu Wissam 's house .
They do n't talk of reconciliation or forgiveness .
They talk of wanting justice -- and that means the killers ' detention and execution .
" The government has done nothing for us , " one of the mothers gathered there says , her voice filled with anger and frustration .
" We will take our own revenge .
I say that as a woman , I do n't have a man who can stand up for me , I will take revenge with my own hands .
I will booby - trap myself and head towards them , towards their families . "
" I could hurt their families .
But I am not like them , I am not like the Mehdi militia , " Abu Wissam says .
" They killed my son .
I am looking for rule of law . "
He has worked with the Iraqi security forces identifying the members of the militia , operating with them on raids .
And he has come face to face with some of his son's killers .
And he asked them why .
" They said , ' We had orders to kill .
For each person we killed they gave us $ 10,000 , ' " Abu Wissam says .
" Their families are still defending them , saying our sons did n't do anything . "
The killers are now cab drivers , college students , entrepreneurs .
They 've melted back into society .
How can they live with themselves and the cold - blooded reality of what they have done ?
How can a society that has been so violently ripped apart come back together ?
The political and military leadership speak in positive overtones .
We 're watching U.S. troops fulfill a timeline to " end the war , " so desperate is America for some sort of ending .
But it is not over .
For Iraqis it 's far from over .
In many ways it is just beginning .
Oppose LTTE campaign of threats and violence against SEP supporters in Europe !
9 March 2009
The Socialist Equality Party ( SEP ) , the Sri Lankan section of the International Committee of the Fourth International ( ICFI ) , urges all those who uphold democratic rights , including Tamils and Tamil organisations , to demand that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) instruct its European agents to cease their threats and violent attacks against our members and supporters in Europe .
At demonstrations in Berlin , London , and Paris on February 4 , and at a protest meeting in Stuttgart on February 7 , SEP supporters were told to stop distributing leaflets and to leave , and were jostled , threatened with violence , and subjected to anti-Sinhala racist abuse by stewards from various pro-LTTE organisations , including the Comité de coordination tamoul en France ( CCT ) and the British Tamils Forum .
Similarly , SEP supporters campaigning February 6 in Paris 's La Chapelle neighbourhood for a public meeting March 15 , which will advance a socialist solution to end the 25 - year civil war and the oppression of the Tamils of Sri Lanka , had their leaflets seized and destroyed by CCT supporters .
The CCT operatives warned that only those who have its permission will be allowed to speak about politics with Tamils living in La Chapelle .
The perpetrators of these coordinated attacks were acting on the instructions of the LTTE .
The LTTE has a notorious , decades - long history of employing murderous violence against its Tamil political opponents .
Its anti-democratic methods , which have included assassinations , have been in flagrant disregard of the democratic aspirations of the Tamil masses , and have strengthened the reactionary Sri Lankan state in its war against the Tamil people .
In Europe , the LTTE 's violence is escalating .
Last Saturday , a group of 75 or more LTTE supporters — brandishing portraits of German Chancellor Angela Merkel , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , and US President Barack Obama — attempted to break up a demonstration by Tamil and left French groups protesting against the Sri Lankan state 's oppression of the Tamils .
" Apart from us , you are not allowed to organise demonstrations or meetings , " an LTTE thug told the protesters .
The intimidation campaign mounted by the LTTE 's European agents is a flagrant attack on democratic rights and must be vigorously opposed .
The LTTE 's targeting of the SEP is especially outrageous given the SEP's well - known and unbroken record of championing the democratic rights of the Tamil people .
In the face of state attacks and Sinhalese chauvinist violence , the SEP has unceasingly demanded the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Sri Lankan troops from the north and east as a crucial first step in uniting the working class and peasantry , Sinhala , Tamil and Muslim , to overthrow the reactionary Sinhala elite - dominated capitalist state and establish a United Socialist States of Sri Lanka and Eelam that will ensure the democratic rights and basic social needs of all .
The LTTE resorts to violence because it is unable to answer political criticism , and fears mounting opposition to its right - wing policies and resentment of its anti-democratic methods among émigré Tamil workers and youth .
The politics and modus operandi of the LTTE , it should be added , are very much bound up with the commercial interests of its local agents within the Tamil business community .
The LTTE 's arrogant assertion of its dominance over the Tamils stands in grotesque contrast with its pathetic and fawning appeals to the governments of the US , Britain , the other Western powers , and India to " save " the Tamil people .
The LTTE lashes out against its socialist opponents , while urging Tamils to place their hopes in the imperialist states that have aided and abetted the Sinhala bourgeoisie in its racist war against the Tamil people .
The nationalist politics and anti-democratic tactics of the LTTE are of one piece .
Its ambition to carve out a capitalist state in the north - east and its strategy of seeking the patronage of one or more great powers underlies the LTTE 's hostility to the democratic rights of Tamils whether in the diaspora or living under the repressive regime it long maintained in the Wanni .
The bankruptcy of the LTTE 's perspective and its incompatibility with the genuine democratic and egalitarian aspirations of the Tamil people have been conclusively proven .
The LTTE is desperately seeking to maintain its authority through intimidation and violence .
Such methods must be opposed and condemned .
All those who defend democratic rights should demand that the LTTE immediately cease its attempts to suppress political debate within the Tamil community and end all threats and harassment of SEP members and supporters .

10 great tools for any UNIX system

This content is part of the series : Speaking UNIX
Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
Much like a vernacular , the universe of UNIX tools changes almost perpetually .
New tools crop up frequently , while others are eternally modernized and adapted to suit emerging best practices .
Certain tools are used commonly ; others are used more infrequently .
Some tools are perennial ; occasionally , some are obsoleted outright .
To speak UNIX fluently , you have to keep up with the " lingo . "
Table 1 lists 11 of the significant packages previously discussed in the Speaking UNIX series .
Table 1 . Prominent UNIX tools
Name Purpose Cygwin A UNIX - like shell and build environment for the Windows ® operating system .
fish A highly interactive shell with automatic expansion and colored syntax for command names , options , and file names .
locate Build and search a database of all files rename Rename large collections of files en masse rsync Efficiently synchronize files and directories , locally and remotely Screen Create and manage virtual , persistent consoles Squirrel A cross - platform scripting shell tac Print input in reverse order , last line first ( tac is the reverse of cat ) type Reveal whether a command is an alias , an executable , a shell built in , or a script wget Download files using the command line zsh An advanced shell featuring automatic completion , advanced redirection operands , and advanced substitutions
This month , let 's look at 10 more utilities and applications that expand or improve on an existing or better - known UNIX package .
The list runs a wide gamut , from a universal archive translator to a high - speed Web server .
In some cases , depending on your flavor of UNIX , you will have to install a new software package .
You can build from source as instructed , or you can save time and effort if your package - management software provides an equivalent binary bundle .
For example , if you use a Debian flavor of Linux® , many of the utilities mentioned this month can be installed directly using apt - get .
Find a command with apropos
UNIX has so many commands , it is easy to forget the name of a utility — especially if you do not use the tool frequently .
If you find yourself scratching your head trying to recall a name , run apropos ( or the equivalent man - k ) .
For example , if you 're hunting for a calculator , simply type apropos calculator :
$ apropos calculator bc ( 1 ) - An arbitrary precision calculator language dc ( 1 ) - An arbitrary precision calculator
Both bc and dc are command - line calculators .
Each UNIX manual page has a short description , and apropos searches the corpus of descriptions for instances of the specified keyword .
The keyword can be a literal , such as calculator , or a regular expression , such as calc* .
If you use the latter form , be sure to wrap the expression in quotation marks ( " " ) to prevent the shell from interpreting special characters :
$ apropos " calcu * " allcm ( 1 ) - force the most important Computer - Modern - fonts to be calculated allec ( 1 ) - force the most important Computer - Modern - fonts to be calculated allneeded ( 1 ) - force the calculation of all fonts now needed bc ( 1 ) - An arbitrary precision calculator language dc ( 1 ) - An arbitrary precision calculator
Run a calculation on the command line
As shown above , dc is a capable calculator found on every UNIX system .
If you run dc without arguments , you enter Interactive mode , where you can write and evaluate Reverse Polish Notation ( RPN ) expressions :
$ dc5 6 * 10 / p 3
However , you can do all that work right on the command line .
Specify the -e option and provide an expression to evaluate .
Again , wrap the expression in quotation marks to prevent interpolation by the shell :
$ dc -e " 5 6 * 10 / " 3
Find processes with pgrep
How many times have you hunted for a process with ps aux | grep ... .
Countless times , probably .
Sure , it works , but there is a much more effective way to search for processes .
Try pgrep .
As an example , this command finds all instantiations of strike 's login shell , ( where strike is the name of a user ) :
$ pgrep -l -u strike zsh 10331 zsh 10966 zsh
The pgrep command provides options to filter processes by user name ( the -u shown ) , process group , group , and more .
A companion utility , pkill , takes all the options of pgrep and accepts a signal to send to all processes that match the given criteria .
For instance , the command pkill - 9 -u strike zsh is the equivalent of pgrep -u strike zsh | xargs kill - 9 .
Generate secure passwords with pwgen
Virtually every important subsystem in UNIX requires its own password .
To wit , e-mail , remote login , and superuser privileges all require a password — preferably disparate and each difficult to guess or derive using an automated attack .
Moreover , if you want to develop scripts to generate accounts , you want a reliable source of random , secure passwords .
The pwgen utility is a small utility to generate gobs of passwords .
You can tailor the passwords to be memorable or secure , and you can specify whether to include numbers , symbols , vowels , and capital letters .
Many UNIX systems have pwgen .
If not , it is simple to build :
$ # As of March 2009 , the latest version is 2.06 $ wget http://voxel.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/\
pwgen/pwgen-2.06.tar.gz $ tar xzf pwgen-2.06.tar.gz $ cd pwgen -2.06 $ ./ configure && make && sudo make install
Here are some sample uses :
Print a collection of easy - to - recall passwords : $ pwgen - C ue2 Ahnga Soom0Lu0 Hie8aiph gei9mooD eiXeex7N Wid4Ueng taShee3v Ja3shii8 i Ng0viSh iegh5 ouF ... zoo8 Ahzu Iefev0ch MoVu4 Pae goh1Ak6 m EiJup5ei
Generate a single , secure password : $ pwgen -s - 1 oYvy9WWa
Generate a single , secure password with no ambiguous , or easily confused , characters and at least one non-alphanumeric character : $ ./ pwgen -s - B - 1 -y 7gEqT_V [
To see all the available options , type pwgen -- help .
Watch many files with multitail
Whether you 're a developer debugging new code or a systems administrator monitoring a system , you often have to keep an eye on many things at once .
If you 're a developer , you might watch a debug log and stdout to track down a bug ; if you 're an administrator , you might want to police activity to intercede as necessary .
Usually , both tasks require oodles of windows tiled on screen to keep a watchful eye — perhaps tail in one window , less in another window , and a command prompt in yet another .
If you have to monitor several files at once , consider multitail .
As its name implies , this utility divides a console window into multiple sections , one section per log file .
Even better , multitail can colorize well - known formats ( and you can define custom color schemes , too ) and can merge multiple files into a single stream .
To build multitail , download the source , unpack it , and run make .
( The options in the distribution 's generic makefile should suffice for most UNIX systems .
If the make fails , look in the topmost directory for a makefile specific to your system . )
# As this article was written , the latest version of multitail was 5.2.2 $ wget http://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/multitail-5.2.2.tgz
$ tar xzf multitail - 5.2.2.tgz $ cd multitail - 5.2.2 $ make $ sudo make install
Here are some uses of multitail to consider :
To watch a list of log files in the same window , launch the utility with a list of file names , as in multitail / var/ log / apache2/{access,error}.log .
.
To watch a pair of files in the same window and buffer everything that 's read , use the - I option to merge the named file into another , as in multitail -M 0 /var/log/ apache/access.log - I /var/log/apache/error.log .
Here , the Apache error log and access log are interlineated .
-M 0 records all incoming data ; you can see the buffer at any time by pressing the B key .
option to merge the named file into another , as in .
Here , the Apache error log and access log are interlineated .
records all incoming data ; you can see the buffer at any time by pressing the B key .
You can also mix and match commands and files .
To watch a log file and monitor the output of ping , try multitail logfile -l " ping 192.168.1.3 " .
This creates two views in the same console :
One view shows the contents of logfile , while the other shows the ongoing output of ping 192.168.1.3 .
In addition to command - line options , multitail provides a collection of interactive commands to affect the current state of the display .
For instance , press the A key in the display to add a new log file .
The B key displays the save buffer .
The Q key quits multitail .
See the man page for multitail for the complete list of commands .
Compress and extract almost anything with 7zip
Between Windows and UNIX alone , there are dozens of popular archive formats .
Windows has long had .zip and .cab , for instance , while UNIX has had .tar , .cpio , and .gzip .
UNIX and its variants also employ .rpm , .deb , and .dmg .
All these formats are commonly found online , making for something of a Babel of bits .
To save or extract data in any particular format , you could install a bevy of specialized utilities , or you can install 7zip , a kind of universal translator that can compress and extract virtually any archive .
Further , 7zip also proffers its own format , featuring a higher compression ratio than any other scheme , gigantic capacity reaching into terabytes , and strong data encryption .
To build 7zip , download the source for p7zip , a port of 7zip to UNIX , from its project page on SourceForge ( see Related topics ) .
Unpack the tarball , change to the source directory , and run make .
( Like multitail , the generic makefile should suffice ; if not , choose from one of the specialized makefiles provided . )
$ wget http://voxel.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/p7zip/\ p7zip_4.65_src_all.tar.bz2 $ tar xjf p7zip_4.65_src_all.tar.bz2 $ cd p7zip_4.65 $ make $ sudo make install
The build produces and installs the utility 7za .
Type 7za with no arguments to see a list of available commands and options .
Each command is a letter — akin to tar — such as a to add a file to the archive and x to extract .
To try the utility , create an archive of the p7zip source itself in a variety of formats , and extract each archive with 7za :
$ zip -r p7.zip p7zip_4.65 $ 7za - ozip x p7.zip $ tar cvf p7.tar p7zip_4.65 $ 7za - otar x p7.tar $ bzip2 p7.tar $ 7za - so x p7.tar. bz2 | tar tf -
In order from top to bottom , 7za extracted a .zip , .tar , and .bz2 archive .
In the last command , 7za extracted the .bz2 archive and wrote the output to stdout , where tar decompressed and cataloged the files .
Like tar , 7za can be the source or destination of a pipe ( | ) , making it easy to combine with other utilities .
View compressed files with zcat
Per -disk capacity now exceeds a terabyte , but a disk can nonetheless fill up quickly with large data files , lengthy log files , images , and media files such as movies .
To conserve space , many files can be compressed to a fraction of their original size .
For example , an Apache log file , which is simply text , can shrink to one - tenth of its original size .
Although compression saves disk space , it can add effort .
If you need to analyze a compressed Apache log file , for instance , you must decompress it , process the data , then re-compress it .
If you have a great number of log files , which is typical if you keep records to establish trends , the overhead can become excessive .
Luckily , the gzip suite includes a number of utilities to process compressed files in situ .
The utilities zcat , zgrep , zless , and zdiff , among others , serve the same purpose as cat , grep , less , and diff , respectively , but operate on compressed files .
Here , two source files are compressed with gzip and compared with zdiff :
$ cat old This is Monday .
$ cat new This is Tuesday .
$ gzip old new $ zdiff - c old.gz new.gz *** - 2009-03-30 22:26:34.518217647 +0000 --- /tmp/new.10874
2009-03-30 22:26:34.000000000 +0000 *************** *** 1,3 ****
This is !
Monday .

Surf the Web , conquer the Internet , make world peace with cURL
A prior Speaking UNIX column recommended wget to download files directly from the command - line .
Ideal for shell scripts , wget is great for those times where you do not have ready access to a Web browser .
For example , if you are trying to install new software on a remote server , wget can be a real life - saver .
If you like wget , then you 'll love cURL .
Like wget , cURL can download files , but it can also post data to a Web page form , upload a file via the File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) , act as a proxy , set Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) headers , and a whole lot more .
In many ways , cURL is a command - line surrogate for the browser and other clients .
Thus , it has many potential applications .
The cURL utility is readily built using the tried - and - true ./ configure && make && sudo make install process .
Download , extract , and proceed :
$ wget http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.19.4.tar.gz
$ tar xzf curl - 7.19.4.tar.gz $ cd curl - 7.19.4 $ ./ configure && make && sudo make install
The cURL utility has so many options , it 's best to read over its lengthy man page .
Here are some common cURL uses :
To download a file — say , the cURL tarball itself — use : $ curl -o curl.
tgz http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.19.4.tar.gz
Unlike wget , cURL emits what it downloads to stdout .
Use the -o option to save the download to a named file .
To download a number of files , you can provide a sequence , a set , or both .
A sequence is a range of numbers in brackets ( [ ] ) ; a set is a comma-delimited list in braces ( {} ) .
For example , the following command would download all files named parta.html , partb.html , and partc.html from the directories named archive1996 / vol1 through archive1999 / vol4 , inclusive , for a total of 48 files .
$ curl http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html \ -o " archive # 1_vol #2_part#3.html "
When a sequence or set is specified , you can provide the -o option with a template , where # 1 is replaced with the current value of the first sequence or set , # 2 is a placeholder for the second , and so on .
As an alternative you can also provide - O to keep each file name intact .
) ; a set is a comma-delimited list in braces ( ) .
For example , the following command would download all files named parta.html , partb.html , and partc.html from the directories named archive1996 / vol1 through archive1999 / vol4 , inclusive , for a total of 48 files .
To upload a suite of images to a server , use the - T option : $ curl -T " img[1-1000 ] .png " ftp://ftp.example.com/upload/
Here , the glob img [ 1 - 1000 ] .png is captured in quotation marks to prevent the shell from interpreting the pattern .
This command uploads img1.png through img1000.png to the named server and path .
option :
You can even use cURL to look up words in the dictionary : $ curl dict://dict.org/d:stalwart 220 miranda.org dictd 1.9.15 / rf on Linux 2.6.26-bpo.1-686 < auth.mime > < 400549.18119.1238445667@miranda.org > 250 ok 150 1 definitions retrieved 151 " Stalwart " gcide " The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48 " Stalwart \ Stal " wart\ ( st [ o^ ] l " w [ ~e ] rt or st[add ]l " - ; 277 ) , Stalworth \ Stal " worth \ ( - w [ ~e ] rth ) , a . [ OE . stalworth , AS. staelwyr[ eth ] serviceable , probably originally , good at stealing , or worth stealing or taking , and afterwards extended to other causes of estimation .
See { Steal} , v. t. , { Worth} , a . ]
Brave ; bold ; strong ; redoubted ; daring ; vehement ; violent .
" A stalwart tiller of the soil . " -- Prof. Wilson . [ 1913 Webster ]
Fair man he was and wise , stalworth and bold .
-- R. of Brunne . [ 1913 Webster ]
Note : Stalworth is now disused , or but little used , stalwart having taken its place .
[ 1913 Webster ] . 250 ok [ d /m/c = 1/0/20 ; 0.000r 0.000u 0.000s ] 221 bye [ d /m/c =
0/0/0 ; 0.000r 0.000u 0.000s ]
Replace the word stalwart with the word you 'd like to define .
In addition to its command - line personality , all of cURL 's capabilities are available from a library aptly named libcurl .
Many programming languages include interfaces to libcurl to automate tasks such as transmitting a file via FTP .
For example , this PHP snippet uses libcurl to deposit a file uploaded via a form to an FTP server :
<?php ... $ ch = curl_init ( ) ; $ localfile = $ _FILES [ ' upload ' ] [ ' tmp_name ' ] ; $ fp = fopen ( $ localfile , 'r ' ) ; curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT_URL , ' ftp://ftp_login:password@ftp.domain.com /'.$_FILES['upload' ] [ ' name ' ] ) ; curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT_UPLOAD , 1 ) ; curl_setopt ( $ch , CURLOPT_INFILE , $ fp ) ; curl_setopt ( $ch , CURLOPT_INFILESIZE , filesize ( $ localfile ) ) ; curl_exec ( $ ch ) ; $ error_no = curl_errno ( $ch ) ; curl_close ( $ ch ) ; ... ?>
If you have to automate any sort of Web access , consider cURL .
SQLite : A database for most occasions
UNIX offers a slew of databases — many of them open source , some for general application , and some highly specialized .
Most databases , though , tend to be large , independent applications — MySQL , for example , requires a separate installation , some configuration , and its own daemon — and may be overkill for a large class of software .
Consider an address book accessory for the desktop :
Is it appropriate to deploy MySQL to persist names and phone numbers ?
Probably not .
And what if the application is intended to run on a very small device or on a modest computer ?
Such hardware may not be suited to multiprocessing , a large memory footprint , or significant demands on physical storage .
Certainly , an embedded database is an alternative .
Typically , an embedded database is packaged as a library and is linked directly to application code .
Such a solution makes the application independent of an external service , albeit at a cost : Queries are n't typically expressed in Structured Query Language ( SQL ) .
SQLite combines the best of all worlds :
The software is tiny , you can embed it in virtually any application , and you can query your data with vanilla SQL .
PHP and Ruby on Rails use SQLite as the default storage engine , as does the Apple iPhone .
To build SQLite , download the source amalgamation ( a single file combining all the source ) from the SQLite download page , extract it , and run ./ configure && make && sudo make install .
$ # As of March 2009 , the latest version was 3.6.11 .
$ wget http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-amalgamation-3.6.11.tar.gz $ tar xzf sqlite - amalgamation - 3.6.11.tar.gz $ cd sqlite - 3.6.11 $ ./ configure && make $ sudo make install
The build produces a library and associated application programming interface ( API ) header files as well as a stand - alone command - line utility named sqlite3 that 's useful for exploring features .
To create a database , launch sqlite3 with the name of the database .
You can even place SQL right on the command line , which is great for scripting :
$ sqlite3 comics.db " CREATE TABLE issues \ ( issue INT PRIMARY KEY , \ title TEXT NOT_NULL ) " $ sqlite3 comics.db " INSERT INTO issues ( issue , title ) \ VALUES ( ' 1 ' , ' Amazing Adventures ' ) " $ sqlite3 comics.db " SELECT * FROM issues " 1 | Amazing Adventures
The first command creates the database ( if it does not exist already ) as well as a table with two columns , an issue number , and a title .
The middle command inserts a row , and the final command shows the contents of the table .
SQLite offers triggers , logging , and sequences .
SQLite is also typeless , unless you specify a type .
For example , the issues table declared works fine without types :
$ sqlite3 comics.db " create table issues ( issue primary key , title ) " $ sqlite3 comics.db " INSERT INTO issues ( issue , title ) \ VALUES ( 1 , ' Amazing Adventures ' ) " $ sqlite3 comics.db " SELECT * FROM issues " 1 | Amazing Adventures
Lack of type is considered a feature , not a bug , and has many applications .
Grab XAMPP , an off - the - shelf Web stack
If you want to use your UNIX machine as a Web server , you have oodles of choices to compose a Web stack .
Of course , there 's the Apache HTTP Server , MySQL , Perl , PHP , Python , and Ruby on Rails , and this article recommends some components you may not have heard of previously , including SQLite and lighttpd .
But building a stack from scratch is n't everyone 's cup of tea .
Configuring Apache and other software packages to interoperate can be maddening at times , and you may not want the onus of maintaining the source yourself , recompiling each time a new patch is issued .
For those good reasons , you might opt for an off - the - shelf stack .
Just install and go !
XAMPP is one of many pre-packaged Web stacks you can find online .
It includes Apache and compatible builds of MySQL , PHP , and Perl .
A version of XAMPP is available for Linux , Sun Solaris , Windows , and Mac OS X .
You download XAMPP , extract it , and start :
# The latest version for Linux was 1.7 $ wget http://www.apachefriends.org/download.php?xampp-linux-1.7.tar.gz
$ sudo tar xzf xampp - linux - 1.7.tar.gz - C /opt $ sudo / opt / lampp / lampp start Starting XAMPP 1.7 ...
LAMPP : Starting Apache ...
LAMPP : Starting MySQL ... LAMPP started .
The second command extracts the XAMPP distribution and places it directly in / opt ( thus the need to preface the command with sudo .
If you want to locate XAMPP elsewhere , change the argument to - C .
The last command launches Apache and MySQL , the two daemons required to serve a Web site .
To test the installation , simply point your browser to http://localhost .
You should see something like Figure 1 .
Figure 1 .
The XAMPP stack start page
Click Status to see how things are operating .
XAMPP provides phpMyAdmin and webalizer to create and manage MySQL databases on the server and measure Web traffic , respectively .
By the way , XAMPP also provides the entire source code to the stack , so you can apply customizations or add to the stack if you need to .
If nothing else , the XAMPP source code reveals how to build a stack , if you want to eventually tackle or customize the process yourself .
Go small with the lighttpd server
XAMPP and many bundles like it package the Apache HTTP Server .
Apache is certainly capable — by most measures , it still powers the majority of sites worldwide — and an enormous number of extensions is available to add wholesale subsystems and integrate tightly with programming languages .
But Apache is n't the only Web server available , and in some cases , it is n't preferable .
A complex Apache instance can require an immense memory footprint , which limits throughput .
Further , even a small Apache instance may be excessive compared to the return .
" Security , speed , compliance , and flexibility " describe lighttpd ( pronounced " lighty " ) , a small and very efficient alternative to Apache .
Better yet , the lighttpd configuration file is n't the morass that Apache 's is .
Building lighttpd from scratch is a little more involved , because it depends on other libraries .
At a minimum , you need the development version ( the version that includes the header files ) of the Perl Compatible Regular Expression ( PCRE ) library and the Zlib compression library .
After you 've installed those libraries ( or built the libraries from scratch ) , compiling lighttpd is straightforward :
$ # Lighttpd requires libpcre3 - dev and zlib1g - dev $ wget http://www.lighttpd.net/download/lighttpd-1.4.22.tar.gz $ tar xzf lighttpd - 1.4.22.tar.gz $ cd lighttpd - 1.4.22 $ ./ configure && make && sudo make install
Next , you must create a configuration .
The most minimal configuration possible sets the document root , server port , a few Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension ( MIME ) types , and the default user and group for the daemon :
server.document-root = " /var/www/lighttpd/host1 " server.groupname = " www " server.port = 3000 server.username = " www " mimetype.assign = ( " .html " => " text / html " , " .txt " => " text / plain " , " .jpg " => " image / jpeg " , " .png " => " image / png " ) static- file.exclude-extensions = ( " .fcgi " , " .php " , " .rb " , " ~ " , " .inc " ) index- file.names = ( " index.html " )
Assuming that you saved the text to a file named / opt/etc/ lighttpd.conf , you start lighttpd with lighttpd - D -f / opt/etc/lighttpd.conf .
Like Apache , lighttpd can serve virtual hosts .
All it takes is three lines , using a conditional :
$ HTTP [ " host " ] == " www2.example.org " { server.document-root = " /var/www/lighttpd/host2 }
Here , if the host is named www2.example.org , an alternate document root is used .
Lighttpd is especially adept at managing large numbers of parallel requests .
You can readily mix lighttpd with Rails , PHP , and more .
Better , smarter , faster

Ötzi the iceman
Ötzi is a mummified human discovered in 1991 in the Schnalstal glacier in the Alps , on the border between Austria and Italy .
He died around 3300 BC .
The mummy offers a wealth of information about the humans living in Europe at the time .
Ötzi was named after the Ötztal region where he was found .
The new Iceman photoscan website now gives all web users access to images of the body gathered by researchers .
The site has a dynamic online - map - style interface to let people zoom into photographs that capture Ötzi from all angles and show details as small as 1 millimetre .
( Image : © South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology / Eurac / Marco Samadelli / Gregor Staschitz )
Who was he ?
Ötzi was male , around 45 years old and around 1.6 metres ( 5 ' 3 " ) tall - about average for a Neolithic human .
He was slim and probably weighed about 50 kilograms .
His hair was dark and wavy , and at least shoulder length .
His eyeballs , though dessicated remained in the sockets , allowing scientists to determine that his eyes were blue .
He had a gap between his two incisor teeth , known as a diastema .
He also had no wisdom teeth .
( Image : © South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology / Eurac / Marco Samadelli / Gregor Staschitz )
How did he die ?
One of the hardest questions to answer about Ötzi is how he died .
Early theories were that he had died from exposure , or was killed as part of a ritual sacrifice .
There is good evidence that he was close to home , and the fact he was was unprepared for mountain trekking suggests that he was fleeing .
However , forensic examination of his body suggested a careful burial .
In 2001 an arrowhead found in Ötzi 's shoulder provided another possible cause of death .
The wound is visible at the very bottom of this picture , just left of the middle .
Another theory uses cuts on his right hand and wrist to argue he had been in a knife fight .
However , this conclusion is strongly disputed by other experts .
The current consensus is that he died of a blow to the head .
( Image : © South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology / Eurac / Marco Samadelli / Gregor Staschitz )
Tattoos
Ötzi had several tattoos like these , resembling barcodes .
The ones shown are on his lower back .
Unlike modern tattoos , they were made by first cutting lightly into his skin , and then rubbing charcoal into the incisions .
The tattoos may have been an early form of acupuncture , used to treat the iceman 's arthritis .

It must be quite hard generating good green PR for the power company E.ON , which is trying to get permission to build Britain 's first coal - fired power station in more than 20 years .
So well done the press office last week for its offering that " the future 's bright at E.ON 's Ratcliffe - on - Soar power station " .
The station has become " a little greener " by putting 68 solar panels on the roof " to help heat and light the admin block " .
Its team leader on the environment , Christine Smith , says : " It 's a great way to show how new , renewable technology can be integrated with the more traditional way of generating electricity . "
" Integrated " is not quite the world I would choose .
The company boasts that it will save an estimated 6.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year .
Green Party candidate and author of the Carbon Commentary blog Chris Goodall emailed me to point out that that is about one millionth of the emissions from the power plant itself .
So , taking account of the saving , the plant 's net emissions are now 99.9999 % of what they used to be .
Actually , Chris , I think you were too generous .
According to Carma ( Carbon Monitoring for Action ) , which keeps tabs on major CO2 emitters round the world , the 40 - year - old plant emits 12.8 million tonnes of CO2 a year .
It is Britain 's third largest source of CO2 into the air .
So make that about half of one millionth .
Eon is the company that wants to build a new coal - fired power station at Kingsnorth in Kent .
To be fair , the company recognises that a few solar panels on the roof may not be enough to secure government permission .
Especially now the energy and climate change secretary , Ed Miliband , has promised a thorough look at the environmental implications of its plans .
Eon 's trump card has been to promise that Kingsnorth will be " carbon - capture ready " .
That is , it will be designed so it is able to bolt on equipment to capture CO2 from the stack emissions and send them off for burial under the sea , or wherever , just as soon as the technology is ready for commercial application .
As we have reported here before that day is about $ 20 billion and probably a couple of decades away .
By then , of course Kingsnorth may have emitted , by my estimate , some 120 million tonnes of CO2 .
But at least Kingsnorth will be ready .
Except that we are only now learning the extent to which the coal industry is unprepared to pay the billions to get carbon capture to the state when it can be used in anger against climate change .
Last month we learned that the " clean coal " guys are playing dirty .
Paul Golby , chief executive of E.ON UK talked at length about the investment needed to make it happen , before dumping the whole deal into the government 's lap .
" If they fund it , we will fit it , " he said .
Excuse me , Mr Golby .
You ask the government to break all its promises about a clean energy future in order to allow you to build a coal power station , because you have this great new technology just round the corner that will make it miraculously green after all .
Then you add innocently that , of course , the government will have to pay to develop that technology .
To add to the insult , the " pay up or else " threat was made at the London - based Adam Smith Institute , which describes itself as Europe 's top " free market think tank " .
Call me naive , but I thought free marketers paid their own bills rather than relying on government largesse .
I guess we should be pleased that Golby has laid it on the line about who they expect to foot the bills .
It 's us .
Meanwhile , I hope the sun shines on their solar panels .

How to Make a Jedi Robe
Last Halloween we made 4 Jedi robes to go with some Star Wars masks we bought .
These are the instructions to make the robes .
We wanted to make the robes with as few pieces of fabric and as little sewing as possible .
I had never made anything resembling clothing before so patterns from the store were out of the question ( too complicated ) .
When you make your robe , think of it as a Mexican poncho that goes over your head , rests on your shoulders and happens to be sewn up the sides to make sleeves .
The Jedi Robe
Buy some extra wide brown polyester fabric .
72 " wide ( or however wide your arms are stretched out ) .
You will need a lot .
Buy a whole bolt of it .
Go to Wal - Mart .
I got my fabric there from a bargain bin for $ 2 / yard .
If you can't find fabric wide enough , you will have to add extensions to the sleeves .
Figure out how tall you are at the shoulder .
Double that number and cut that much fabric off of the bolt .
If you are 5 feet tall ( 60 " ) at the shoulder , cut 10 feet ( 120 " ) off of the bolt .
Spread the fabric out on the floor folding it over on itself width - wise .
Lay down on the fabric with your arms stretched out and your shoulders at the fold in the fabric .
Have someone trace around you .
Do n't trace too close to the body or else the robe will not flow right .
Pin the two layers of fabric together along the trace line .
Cut the traced shape out of the fabric about an inch outside of the trace line .
Sew along the trace lines .
Turn the robe inside out .
Make the front opening of the robe by cutting a line straight up the middle of the front of the robe to the shoulder fold .
Make sure you only cut up the front of the robe .
Try the robe on to make sure the measurements are OK .
Hem the edges along the bottom of the robe , the ends of the sleeves , and the edges of the front opening .
If you do n't hem these edges , your robe will look really cheap and you will end up with a lot of little threads all over the house .
The Jedi Robe Hood
This part was a little tricky to figure out .
It took a few paper mock - ups to figure out how to make a hood shape .
In the end , it was simple : one rectangular piece of fabric , folded in half , with one side stitched up .
Cut a 1 foot by 2 foot rectangle of fabric .
( Some readers have mentioned that this size hood seems too small .
For a larger hood use a 16 " by 32 " or larger piece of fabric . )
Fold it in half to make a 1 foot square piece of fabric .
( 16 " square if you used a bigger piece of fabric . )
Sew one edge from the fold to the end .
Turn the hood inside out .
Attach the Hood to the Robe
Prepare the robe by cutting a 6 inch circular neck hole out of the robe centered around the top of the front slit .
Discard the circular piece of fabric .
The hood will be sewn to the circular hole you just cut .
Align the seam you stitched up the back of the hood to the center of the back on the neck hole .
Sew the two ends of the hood rectangle to the left and right sides of the neck hole .
Depending on how big you made the neck hole , the edge of the hood may be too big for the neck hole .
If this happens , just put a couple of pleats in when you attach the hood .
Hem the front edge of the hood .
The hood will look WAY too big , but that is how the Jedi robe hoods are .
The Inner Tunic
One thing that is characteristic of the Jedi wardrobe is the presence of a v-neck .
This tunic will provide the appearance of a Jedi v-neck .
Start off with 3 pieces of tan fabric from a 60 " bolt .
They will make up the right and left side of the Jedi tunic and a belt to hold the tunic to your body .
You will have two pieces that go over each shoulder and cross at the waist in the front and the back .
Iron a small fold near the inner edge of each piece to give the appearance of multiple layers .
I sewed my fold in place to make sure it stayed .
Put the two pieces of the tunic on and have someone position and pin them together when you get the desired " V " shape .
Repeat for the back .
Sew the two pieces together at the waist so they do n't come apart when you are wearing the tunic .
Put on the belt and place it over the stitch you made to hold the two pieces of the tunic together .
Tie it in the back so you have sort of a cummerbund in the front .
Notes
We found that the bottom of the robe was too long at the sides ( because shoulders slope down from the neck ) .
Before we hemmed the bottom , we trimmed it making it curve up at the sides so the body of the robe was more bell shaped .

If you are making more than one robe , use the first robe as a pattern and just trace it on the fabric for the second , third , fourth ... robes .
Unless you are entering a fashion show , do n't worry about the robe being perfect .
We were going to a big outdoor Halloween festival at night so we just wanted the suggestion of a Jedi robe .
We had normal clothes on underneath .
Use a safety pin under your chin to fasten the robe shut .
( If you did n't hem the edges , the safety pin will unravel the robe . )
Make sure you have a light saber to go with your robe .
Otherwise you will look like a monk .
Some fans have said that they found this page after searching for Luke Skywalker , Jedi , Star Wars Costume , Jedi Costume Pattern and even an R2D2 costume for a toddler .
A fan wrote in to say that he used a heavy , flat bedsheet ( king size ) instead of extra wide fabric .
Great idea !

Wyndclyffe
RHINEBECK , NEW YORK
January 12 , 1999
In 1994 , I was introduced to the book Hudson River Villas .
This book is a record of the many fine mansions that were built along the banks of the Hudson River .
Some of these buildings are still standing , some have been redesigned or restored , but a great many have been left to ruin or demolished .
American culture constantly builds great things , only to tear them down , or let them fall apart .
The great mansions of the Hudson River Valley are remnants from the time of the great merchants and bankers of the 19th century .
The advent of the railroad in 1849 made it possible for people to travel to New York City to work in the morning , and escape to the countryside in the evening .
Many people simply owned mansions as summer houses , or used them for parties in the fall .
Then , as now , social status was important , and having a larger , more grand residence than your neighbors was important .
January 2000
It is out of this estate - building that the phrase " keeping up with the Joneses " supposedly originated from .
On the eastern shore of the Hudson , near Rhinebeck , is the ruined shell of a mansion known as Wyndclyffe , which is featured in Hudson River Villas .
It was built in 1853 for Elizabeth Schermerhorn Jones , a relative by marriage to the wealthy Astor Family , and it is rumored she is the source of the old adage .
A later owner was Andrew Finck , New York City beer baron and a cooper by trade , and associate of brewer Jacob Rupert , of nearby Linwood .
Wyndclyffe , then known as Linden Hall or Finck Castle , supposedly had an underground tap line from the mansion to the tennis courts .
January 2000
The house was a private residence until 1936 , and was finally abandoned for good sometime after 1950 .
Wyndclyffe remained remarkable intact through the 1980s , but decay worsened as abandonment neared the end of a half - century .
The eastern turet collapsed in 1998 , and other sections have fallen since .
Yet Wyndclyffe is still an imposing sight .
It is amazing that such a fascinating building had been left to ruin .
Maybe it is true , that America is all about " keeping up with the Joneses . "
This house , that for so long was held in esteem , no longer mattered .
At some point , it was deemed not necessary to pay for the maintenance of the mansion , grounds and outbuildings .
Wyndclyffe was no longer a status symbol .
People would rather have built new houses somewhere else than buy this awesome structure .

From the river , it appears ominous , and yet it ’s not readily apparent it ’s a ruin .
The western side of the house is remarkably well kept for 50 years of exposure to the elements .
The east side of the house has completely fallen in , only the exterior walls still stand , allowing a glimpse of the interior .
Several interior support columns stand amidst the debris .
Fine wood panels still line the walls , and great sliding doors open to what was once the library .
Stairways end in midair and continue somewhere else .
There was an opening in the staircase above the first floor , which once allowed light in from a skylight , its sideboards hang suspended in the air today .
The skylight is still in place , but its windows have long been destroyed by vandals , or time .
July 1999
Persons past and present have owned Wyndclyffe with an interest in preserving it .
But such intentions never led to any degree of fruition .
As the house decayed , the surrounding property has shrunk , so that just 2 or 3 tangled overgrown acres remain , home to foxes and turkeys .
The carriage house has been restored , and a Mediterranean style mansion nearby , said to have been built for a member of the Finck family around 1906 , was recently restored after years of its own neglect .
Multiple Exposure
There are many similar tales of mansions being left to ruin in the Hudson Valley .
For now , Wyndclyffe is one of the lucky ones .
Many mansions and buildings were demolished outright before even falling into ruin .
But Wyndclyffe continues to fall apart .
Entering this ruins is not advised .
During 2001 , a good chunk of the northwest corner of the first floor of the mansion collapsed into the basement .
Neighbors have called the police when observing cars entering the property , and I do n't blame them .
In 2003 , a new owner appeared on the scene with the intention of restoring the mansion .
Windows were boarded up and a fence was installed surrounding the house .
February 2007 .
Numerous trees surrounding the house have been cut down .
The ground behind the house has been dug up with large earth - moving equipment .
I can only speculate at the purpose of such work .
It appears that nothing has been to to the house itself since it was boarded up and fenced off in late 2003 .

A large hole now appears on the north wall .
August 2010 UPDATE OCTOBER 1 , 2016
Wndclyffe was recently sold .
Its new owner and future plans have not been announced .
Prior to the sale of the house I took another set of photographs , which can be viewed at this link .

The Israel lobby and Republican neocons have scored their first triumph of the Obama administration by derailing the appointment of Chas Freeman as director of the National Intelligence Council .
Freeman was a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia and known as an outspoken critic of the Israeli occupation .
Director of national intelligence Dennis Blair , an old friend , appointed Freeman to head the agency that produces intelligence estimates for nations that pose a danger of terrorism to US interests .
During the Bush administration these estimates were quite controversial , and the report for Iran judged that the regime had suspended its nuclear programme , running counter to the claims of Dick Cheney and other Iran hawks .
Because of his strong , critical views on Israel 's policy toward the Palestinians , knocking out Freeman was one of the lobby 's top priorities .
To his credit , the feisty Freeman went down swinging .
He landed heavy blows on his detractors :
The libels on me and their easily traceable email trails show conclusively that there is a powerful lobby determined to prevent any view other than its own from being aired , still less to factor in American understanding of trends and events in the Middle East .
The tactics of the Israel Lobby plumb the depths of dishonour and indecency and include character assassination , selective misquotation , the wilful distortion of the record , the fabrication of falsehoods , and an utter disregard for the truth .
The next time anyone qvells about how moderate a Republican Olympia Snowe is , just remember that she signed a highly partisan letter attacking Freeman that every Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee also signed .
Given her status as a swing vote and party moderate , her participation may have sealed his fate .
She caved to rightist pressure at the drop of a hat .
But Democrats like Charles Schumer also led the charge against Freeman .
" Charles Freeman was the wrong guy for this position .
His statements against Israel were way over the top and went beyond anything I have seen from any administration official , " Schumer said in a statement .
" I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him , and I am glad they did the right thing . "
This raises another important and obvious point : Democrats are not automatically friends of Israeli - Palestinian peace .
" Liberal " and " conservative " in their normal domestic context have little or no meaning as far as the conflict .
There are liberal bloggers like Markos Moulitsas who have n't learned that lesson yet and may never because peace is a secondary issue ( if it 's an issue at all ) to the primary goal of attaining and preserving Democratic political power .
But I also believe that progressive Democrats , bloggers , Middle East analysts and the Obama administration itself also share some blame for Freeman 's withdrawal .
They did n't mobilise in time to wage a counter - attack against the smears .
The New York Times , for example , did n't weigh in with a news story or editorial at all .
It confirmed Freeman 's " funeral " with a story the day he withdrew .
While it 's true that journalists like Matt Ygleisias , James Fallows , MJ Rosenberg , Spencer Ackerman , Greg Sargent spoke out in favour of Freeman , along with and fellow CIA / intelligence officers , most did so late in the game after the lobby had drawn first blood .
By then the damage had been done .
I hope they wo n't be caught as flat - footed next time .
This was a Lexington and Concord for the Israel lobby , the first skirmish in what they know will be a long war against any constructive Obama impulse to address the real issues in the conflict and resolve them .
It is the lobby saying : Take what we tell you very , very seriously or you will know our wrath .
Aipac 's Josh Block somewhat disingenuously told the New York Times that his organisation had " taken no position " on the Freeman appointment .
Spencer Ackerman writes that Aipac 's campaign against the former ambassador was one of the Beltway 's worst kept secrets and that the group had been " shopping around oppo research " on him for some time .
I am sorry that Obama and Dennis Blair withdrew from the field with hardly a fight .
It does n't augur well for the trench warfare that will be necessary in the future if there is ever to be a US role in midwiving peace in the Middle East .
In this one , Obama faced the lobby eyeball to eyeball and flinched .
You certainly can try to argue that this appointment was not the type that warranted a major expenditure of political capital .
Freeman is a bridge toward the goal but not the goal itself .
There will be significant battles , and the administration needs to save its powder for those .
But what is lacking in this analysis is the symbolic importance of the Freeman appointment and its savaging .
Politics , like football , is a game of inches .
It is a game of momentum .
The lobby has tripped up Obama 's momentum and grabbed the agenda , at least momentarily .
And both Blair and Obama have lost the benefit of an honest broker , who would not be afraid to tell them when they were wearing no clothes .
Seems to me we 've just completed eight years of an administration that ran from the truth tellers as fast as their feet would carry them .
Similarly , the lobby wants no truth tellers when it comes to devising US policy toward Israel .
It wants sycophants , yes - men , pols who know how to line up in a straight line .
We can see how well this policy worked for George Bush .
And it wo n't work for an administration that wants to act as a more honest broker , rather than a cheerleader or enabler of one side 's bad habits .
This is a very sad day for anyone who really wishes for Israeli - Palestinian peace and a vigorous American role in achieving it .
Many of us familiarize with the Gundam , Japanese robotics anime .
The Gundam official company in Japan has announced that 18 - meter - tall ( 59 - foot - tall ) , “ life - size ” statue of the title robot will be built at Tokyo ’s artificial Odaiba island this July 2009 , the biggest ever .
The project is as part of the “ Mobile Suit Gundam 30th Anniversary Project , ” “ Gundam will rise from the ground . ”
Japan as usual is always do things beyond our imagination .
Bouncing Red Ball has more to say :
The statue will be free for viewing , but it will only stay up for two months .
It will be built with fiberglass - reinforced plastic over a steel frame so it can be disassembled later .
The head unit will move and the body will have 50 points that will emit light .
Mist can shoot forth from 14 locations on the body .
The park is just four trains stops from Tokyo Big Sight , the home of the Comic Market dōjinshi convention and the Gundam Big Expo convention that will be held from August 21 to August 23 .
Bandai Namco
Group is still determining what to do with the statue after its allotted two months in the park are over .
Will this Gundam statue will protect Tokyo from outside attack ?
We will see about it .
The Gundam itself is probably actually just a “ mask ” of Japan government to hide their new millitary weapon .
Who knows right ?
It ’s possible 😀

Jones also charged that , contrary to beliefs that the agency has a political agenda , " In reality the CIA is loyal only to itself .
As long as Mrs. Pelosi supported its bureaucratic lifestyle , it supported her , but when she attacked it , it fought back .
The CIA may not be able to conduct efficient intelligence operations , but it knows how to survive . "
Reports that CIA managers were outraged or demoralized by the water - boarding controversy are wrong , Jones also maintained .
To the contrary , he said , they felt that revelations of their interrogators roughing up , or even torturing , detainees made them look tough .
" The interrogations controversy has served the CIA bureaucracy , " Jones asserted .
" A top goal of bureaucracy is to look busy , and whether one agrees with the interrogation methods or not , the impression given is that the CIA is both busy and aggressive . "
Jones added : " It relishes this ' cowboy ' image , and its greatest fear is that the taxpayer might figure out how little it actually is doing .
" Bans or restrictions on interrogations , " he added , " would have the constructive effect of removing this smokescreen , this distraction , and redirecting focus to what exactly the CIA is doing to provide the foreign intelligence the president needs . "
From polling data I 've seen , those of us who are certain that the CIA assassinated JFK are almost as small a minority as those who identify themselves as members of the Republican Party -- 25 % and 21 % respectively .
But even if you do n't want to believe they 'd actually kill an American president , you'd be foolish to believe that they 're not an organization built on deceit and misdirection .
According to Russ Baker 's latest book , Family of Secrets it 's likely that the Watergate scandal was a CIA plot to removed Nixon !
Take it for what it 's worth -- judge for yourself -- but you may have noticed that in recent weeks they 've tried to engineer a coup against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Or maybe they were just firing a very loud warning shot over the bow of any Democrats who want to get too feisty that there will be no investigations or hearings that lead to any CIA personnel going to prison regardless of what crimes were committed .
I 'd say the message was received .is about as vanilla and inoffensive a news source as you 're going to find Inside - the - Beltway .
Yesterday evening they featured a piece by Jeff Stein confirming -- from inside the secretive agency -- that the CIA lies to and misleads members of Congress as a matter of course .
A 25 year veteran former deep - cover spy , who uses the name Ishmael Jones , and wrote the book The Human Factor : Inside the CIA 's Dysfunctional Intelligence Culture , claims the CIA 's congressional briefers " routinely " lie to members of Congress .
He 's no Pelosi fan and from reading his stuff I have to believe he 's an extreme rightist .
But , he does admit that its more likely than not that they lied to her .
According to a review of " Jones ' " book at ForeWord Magazine , the agent was n't thrown out of the CIA " but was a highly regarded agent who resigned to write this book because he could no longer serve in this organization that had lost its sense of purpose and the capability to protect the United States from terrorist attacks . "
He sees the CIA as " a bloated , unresponsive bureaucracy that exists to serve itself and cannot fulfill its important intelligence - gathering role , which was the reason for its creation by President Harry Truman .

“ Mother , what ’s wrong ?
You ’ve got to share this with me , ” Carol says .
Maude ’s response is typical , with barbs aimed both inward and outward , delivered by Ms. Arthur with a flash of simultaneous anger , despair and humor : “ Honey , I ’d give anything to share it with you . ”

The two - part episode was broadcast in November 1972 , two months before Roe v. Wade , the Supreme Court case that made abortion legal nationwide , was decided .
By the episode ’s conclusion , Maude , who lived in Westchester County in New York , where abortion was already permitted , had chosen to end the pregnancy .
Two CBS affiliates refused to broadcast the program , and Ms. Arthur received a shower of angry mail .
“ The reaction really knocked me for a loop , ” she recalled in a 1978 interview in The New York Times .
“ I really had n’t thought about the abortion issue one way or the other .
The only thing we concerned ourselves with was :
Was the show good ?
We thought we did it brilliantly ; we were so very proud of not copping out with it . ”
“ The Golden Girls , ” an immensely popular show that was broadcast on NBC from 1985 - 92 and can still be seen daily in reruns , broke ground in another way .
Created by Susan Harris ( who wrote the “ Maude ” abortion episode ) , it focused on four previously married women sharing a house in Miami , and with its emphasis on decidedly older characters , it ran counter to the conventional wisdom that youthful sex appeal was the key to ratings success .
Which is not to say “ The Golden Girls ” was n’t sexy .
Like “ Maude , ” it was a comedy that dealt with serious issues , especially those involved with aging , but also matters like gun control , gay rights and domestic violence .
And like “ Maude , ” it could be bawdy .
The women were all active daters and , to different degrees , openly randy .
As Dorothy , Ms. Arthur was coiffed and clothed in a softer , more emphatically feminine manner than she had been in “ Maude , ” but she was no less sharp - tongued , and she and the show ’s other stars  Rue McClanahan , Betty White and Estelle Getty ( who , though younger than Ms. Arthur , played Dorothy ’s mother )  were frequently praised for portraying the lives of older women as lively , uncertain , dramatic and passion - filled as those of college sorority sisters .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week , while those filing continuing claims hit an all - time high for the 10th straight week , according to a government report released Thursday .
In the week ended March 28 , a total of 669,000 people filed initial jobless claims , up 12,000 from the previous week 's upwardly revised figure of 657,000 , the Labor Department reported .
It was the largest weekly increase since October 1982 , and it surprised economists surveyed by Briefing.com , who had forecast initial claims to decline to 650,000 .
The number of people continuing to file for jobless benefits rose 161,000 to 5.7 million in the week ended March 21 , the latest week for which data was available .
It was the highest number since the government began keeping records in 1967 , and the 10th consecutive week that continuing claims rose to a record high .
The increasing number of people continuing to file for unemployment benefits suggests that Americans are struggling to re-enter the workforce .
The 4 - week moving average for weekly filings , which smoothes out volatile peaks and troughs , was 656,750 , up 6,500 from the previous week 's revised average .
Earlier this month , initial claims and the 4 - week moving average had declined slightly , raising some hopes that the labor market was stabilizing .
Given last week 's increase , however , that seems improbable , according to Andrew Gledhill , an economists at Moody 's Economy.com .
" This increase is definitely bad news , " Gledhill said .
" This is the worst labor market downturn at least since the 1980s , and I do n't expect it to subside soon , " he said .
The report comes one day before the government 's closely watched monthly jobs report .
The Labor Department is expected to report Friday that the economy shed 658,000 jobs in March , more than the 651,000 reported for February , according to a consensus estimate of economists complied by Briefing.com .
The unemployment rate is forecasted to rise to 8.5 % from 8.1 % .

Eat fat to lose fat
Fat is it friend or foe ?
Well if you ask most , including health care professionals , they ’ll say foe .
It ’s time for people to wake up !
The current ways of eating are n’t working .
Just a few years ago , for the first time in history the top six books on the New York Times Best Seller list , were about the same subject : diets low in carbs , moderate to high protein , high in fibrous carbs ( vegetable ) , and moderate fat .
Why is this topic so popular ?
They work !
One of the biggest reasons protein diets work is the consumption of fat .
That is , fat minus the abundance of carbs .
Fat has many functions outside of being used as an energy source , and certain fatty acids are essential .
Without eating them you ’d literally get sick and die .
But how does fat help our diet ?
Well , fat satiates the appetite , and helps to stop the cravings for sugar .
And probably most importantly , fat when combined with a low sugar intake actually aids in burning fat as fuel .
That ’s right , fat helps burn fat .
When fat is restricted , our bodies have a defense mechanism built in through evolution for survival .
Our bodies will actually stop using fat as fuel in an effort to preserve our stores for future use .
Bodybuilders have known this for years through trial and error , while dieting for shows , they would reach a certain body fat percentage and suddenly plateau for no apparent reason .
We found that by adding fat to the diet like olive oil , or coconut oil , would jump - start the body to burn body fat .
It ’s not the amount of food you consume that is the problem .
It ’s the types of food you ’re consuming .
Sounds bizarre does n’t it .
An Australian zoo was evacuated after an " ingenious " orang - utan escaped from her enclosure by short - circuiting an electric fence today .
Staff at Adelaide zoo said 137lb ( 62kg ) Karta used a stick to short - circuit the electric wires around her enclosure before piling up some more sticks to climb out .
But the 27 - year - old ape only ventured as far as a surrounding fence , still metres from members of the public , during her 30 minutes of freedom .
The zoo's curator , Peter Whitehead , said she seemed to realise she was somewhere she was not supposed to be and returned to her enclosure .
" You 're talking about an animal that 's highly intelligent , " he said .
" We 've had issues with her before in normal day - to - day operations where she tries to outsmart the keepers .
She 's an ingenious animal . "
Karta was spotted by a member of the public and , although she returned to her enclosure , the zoo was evacuated as a safety precaution .
Whitehead said the orang - utan was not aggressive and had not been close to members of the public .
However , vets stood by with tranquiliser guns in case of trouble .
Zoo officials will conduct a thorough review of Karta 's escape attempt .
Liverpool 4 – 4 Arsenal : Arshavin 35 , Torres 48 , Benayoun 55 , Arshavin 66 , Arshavin 69 , Torres 71 , Arshavin 89 , Benayoun 92 .
Highlights thanks to the Arsenalist .
A scorcher of a game at Anfield produced eight goals , and four came from none other than Andrey Arshavin .
The game was nearly ours when Arshavin scored his 4th in the 89th minute .
Anfield must have been thinking it was 1989 all over again , but Benayoun grabbed a point for Liverpool in injury time .
Arsenal defended abysmally , and because of that we conceded easily – the left side got mauled – Liverpool were pounding away at us and we found it hard to pass the ball .
Gibbs and Silvestre looked weak at times and that is to be expected , and Sagna was at fault for Liverpool ’s first equaliser .
On the other hand we were clinical in attack – 4 shots on target and 4 goals .
Arshavin took his first goal , slotting in a Fabregas cross in the first half , after Nasri played him through .
Benayoun then equalised early in the second half after Sagna cleared the ball across his own penalty area to Kuyt .
Torres made it 2 – 1 and it seemed that the game was lost !
However , Arshavin then capitalised on slack Liverpool defending to make it 2 - 2 , and then made it 3 -2 !
Torres made it three all after fooling Silvestre to gain more space .
But in the 89th minute Walcott countered from a corner as Liverpool committed men forward .
He took the ball forward and played Arshavin through on goal and he coolly took his 4th , making it 4 - 3 .
When Arshavin made it 4 - 3 on the 89th minute I thought the game was ours , 1989 style .
Up for Grabs now moment , Kenny Dalglish vacant stare moment .
It was n’t to be .
I do n’t know how the 4th assistant found 5 minutes added time , but it was inevitable the way Liverpool were pressing our shaky defence that they would get another goal .
Benayoun headed home after shambolic clearing from Arsenal allowed Liverpool to get a cross in injury time .
In any case it was a great game , highly entertaining , although I was disappointed that we never really got going .
Arshavin more than made up for it with his performance – he really is a very , very special player .
This keeps the unbeaten run going .
Wenger said that 3 points would have been better than one but in all fairness we were very lucky to come away with a point .
It was the induvidual brilliance of Arshavin that got us the point .
The first time that 4 goals have been scored at Anfield in the league since the 1940s and who else could do it ?
What a rollercoaster of a game !
How I ’m wishing that Arshavin could play in the Champions League .

狙っているのは、強力な論理的推論・探索機能があり、関数プログラミング機能を持つオブジェクト群が、人間に近い構文のI/Fによって動く知的なシステムです。
厳密ではないのですが、簡単に言うとデカルト言語のアイデアは、述語論理+関数+拡張バッカス記法+オブジェクト指向です。
● 例1：デカルト言語の基本的な機能のプログラム例
まずは、prologのように、バックトラック機構を持った述語論理言語がベースになっています。例えば、prologのリスト処理プログラムは、構文を書き直すだけでそのまま動きます。
● 例2：デカルト言語のプログラム：リストの操作
しかし、prologとは異なり、引数の中にさらに述語を書くことができる関数述語機能を持ちます。これは、述語の中の引数に述語を記述するとその第一引数を返り値と見做して実現しています。
また、拡張バッカスナウア記法のオア | , 省略可[ ] , 繰り返し{}のような制御構造を拡張しています。そのため、文脈自由文法の生成規則をデカルト言語で記述すると、それが構文解析のパーサになります。
● 例3 ：Tiny Rubyコンパイラの作成 , 続 Tiny Rubyコンパイラの 作 成( 2 )
さらに、オブジェクト指向プログラミングの機能を持ち、継承やポリモフィズムおよびカプセル化の機能をサポートします。
● 例4：デカルト言語による論理的なA.I : 自然言語による論理 , デカルト言語のプログラム：サルとバナナ
使い方のマニュアルは以下にあります。

デカルト言語は、誰でも簡単に使える言語は目指していません。この言語の利用者が深く理解し習熟し工夫を重ねることにより、素晴らしい結果が得られるような言語にしたいと考えています。
だから、ちょと分かり難いし、ちょっと書き難いかもしれませんが（笑）
今までのコンピュータサイエンスは、20世紀末に叫ばれたソフト開発者の不足に対応するために、開発言語や開発手法など、おまりに簡単で大勢に使えることばかりに注力してきたように思えます。しかし、現状を見ればわかるとおり、すでにコンピュータはコモディティな存在となり、そのような目的はもう達成されてしまったように感じます。人を集めてちょっと教育して大量投入すればなんとかなる仕事は現状でもう十分です。
今後のコンピュータサイエンスは、多少扱いが難しくても、より高度でより困難な問題が解決できるような方向に前進すべきではないでしょうか。
ちょっと変な喩えなのですが、大勢を載せた快適な大型旅客船ばかりではなく、キーンと甲高いジェット音を鳴り響かせ、操縦には高度なテクニックが必要ではありますが、高速で高機動な超音速戦闘機が必要なのではないかと考えています。のんびりとした船旅をしている間に、何者にも邪魔されずに地球の反対側まで超音速で到達できるのです。(デカルト言語では、まだその域には達していませんが。)
プロジェクトを始めた動機は？ また、どうやって始めましたか？
最近のコンピュータの飛躍的な性能向上と容量拡大により、実現可能な状態になったと感じたからです。
デカルト言語は、とても重い言語になると予想できました。まさにHeavyweight Languageです。前からいろいろとアイデアは持っていたのですが、最近の高性能大容量PCで、ようやく多少の富豪プログラムでも平気で動く環境が整いました。これなら、いけると思ったのです。
影響を受けたプログラミング言語はありますか？
昔の第五世代コンピュータ計画で開発されたGHC（Guarded Horn ClausesでHaskellではない）言語の本を見つけて読んで衝撃を受けました。
デカルト言語とはずいぶん異なるのですが、30年も前の容量も少なく性能も低いコンピュータで目指す目標が壮大なのです。今からもう一度、第五世代コンピュータプロジェクトをやり直したら、今度は結果が異なるのではないでしょうか。
GHCと似た系統のガード節やユニフィケーション機能を持つ、HaskellやErlangが最近脚光を浴び始めているのも、やっと時代が追いついてきたということではないでしょうか。
このソフトウェアのターゲット・ユーザーは？
いろいろな人に使ってもらいたいです。
awk代わりに、入力ファイルを読み込んで、結果を出力するようなスクリプト言語を使いたいユーザー
業務用のエンタープライズ処理を行いたいユーザー
オレオレ・プログラム言語のインタプリタやコンパイラを作りたいユーザー

プロジェクトがうまく行っていると感じるのはどんなときですか？
デカルト言語のアイデアがいろいろと次々と思い浮かぶときです。そんなときには、ごりごり書いたプログラムがコンパイルエラー無しで一発でコンパイルできます。
このプロジェクトをやっていて最も驚いた出来事は？
あまり驚くようなことは無かったように思えます。
毎日淡々と機能拡張していくことが楽しみです。
このプロジェクトで最も苦労している点は？
やはり、ドキュメント整備です。
私の頭の中にしかない仕様や機能をドキュメントにしなければならないので、誰かに頼むわけにもいきませんし。
できる範囲で順にドキュメントを書いてきました。
今後のプロジェクトの方向性は？
デカルト言語本体も拡張していくのですが、今後はドキュメントとアプリを増やしていきたいと考えています。
ソースコードは、割りとどんどんと書けるのですが、マニュアルや関連ドキュメントがなかなか整備しきれません。
また、アプリケーションを書いていきたいですね。言語を創っただけではあまりにも意味がないので、デカルト言語で動くアプリケーションを増やしていきたいと考えています。
それと、本体の拡張としては、コンパイラを作り性能を改善したいですね。また、加えてWWWアプリのサーバーサイドやクライアントサイドとしても使えるようにしたいとまだ漠然としてはいますが考えています。
また、マルチコアにも対応しないといけないですね。
このソフトウェアあるいはプロジェクトについて誇れるところは？
他のプログラミング言語とは異なる毛色になっているじゃないかと思えるところでしょうか。
このプロジェクトでどこかやり直せるとしたら、どこを変更したいですか？
デカルト言語という名前が英字で は" descartes " と、長くて打ちにくくて覚えにくいので後悔することがあります。
しかし、デカルトには、心身２言論や普遍言語および機械論的世界観など、デカルト言語と無関係とは思えないような思想や哲学があるので、おそらく名前を変えたりすることは将来もないでしょう。

SAN JOSE , Calif . --
The Anaheim Ducks collectively kept their celebrations to a murmur , refusing to show any postgame excitement Sunday night except for the first career playoff goals by three of their youngest forwards .
It was a showcase of the level , veteran cool you 'd expect from a team two years removed from a Stanley Cup -- even after that club just tore through the NHL 's toughest road arena and took two games from the league 's best regular - season team .
Andrew Ebbett broke a tie with a goal from an awkward angle with 10:16 left , and the Ducks stunned the San Jose Sharks with another defensive gem in a 3 - 2 victory in Game 2 , jumping to a 2 - 0 lead in the first - round playoff series .
Jonas Hiller made 42 saves in his second outstanding effort , while Bobby Ryan and Drew Miller also scored their first playoff goals .
Just as their 2 - 0 Game 1 victory , the eighth - seeded Ducks were defensively tough and offensively fortunate against San Jose , which lost just five home games in regulation during the entire regular season .
" We knew we could play well , " Hiller said .
" But to come into the rink of the best team in the league and win the first two games , we do n't expect that , although we have to think it 's possible .
...
I 'm sure this is not what people expected from us .
We have the two wins , but the Sharks are still the best team this year . "
Ryane Clowe 's goal early in the second period ended more than 174 minutes of scoreless playoff hockey for the Sharks dating to last season , but San Jose could n't rally despite another monstrous edge in shots .
An eighth seed has beaten a top seed seven times in the NHL playoffs since 1994 , and playoff - tested Anaheim is ripe to add its name to the list .
San Jose must win four of the next five games , including two in Anaheim , to avoid what would be a disastrous end to a 117 - point season capped by the franchise 's first Presidents '
Trophy .
" I 'm not too sure that the guys in there , after the two games , I think if you went through and asked each of the guys , they'd think they 're the better team , " said Todd McLellan , the Sharks ' rookie coach .
" They 're not getting the puck luck , and you have to give Anaheim credit .
They found a way to win . "
Game 3 is Tuesday night in Anaheim .
Jonathan Cheechoo also scored , and Evgeni Nabokov made 23 saves for the Sharks , who outshot Anaheim 44 - 26 after a 35 - 17 edge in the Ducks ' 2 - 0 Game 1 victory -- but San Jose dropped to 0 - for - 12 on the power play in the series after going scoreless in six chances in Game 2 .
Although an NHL playoff neophyte , Hiller again showed off the resilience he learned as a star in the top Swiss league and the world championships .
Yet the rest of the Ducks know about playoff toughness from experiences the Sharks just can't duplicate in the regular season .
" I do n't think that we recognize the pressure , as much as you guys seem to want to put that exclamation mark on it , " Ducks coach Randy Carlyle said .
" [ Hiller ] played in some real intense games for us down the stretch .
He 's a veteran guy from the Swiss league and world championships .
He knows what pressure is about .
What he 's got to do is just do his job .
He does n't have to win the hockey game for us .
He 's just got to give us a chance . "
The Sharks ' frustration only was heightened in the third period when the Ducks scored on Ebbett 's fortunate deflection and Miller 's rebound shot through traffic in a 3 1/2 - minute span , while San Jose managed only Cheechoo 's goal with 6:06 left .
McLellan broke up his top - line pairing of Joe Thornton and captain Patrick Marleau for Game 2 , moving around his top two scorers but rarely icing them together .
It did n't generate much new offense , but Clowe came through after a turnover by Ebbett , slipping the puck past three defenders to snap the Sharks ' playoff scoreless streak at 174 minutes , 2 seconds , dating to their four - overtime elimination loss to Dallas last spring .
" I do n't feel a lot of panic around here , that 's for sure , " Clowe said .
" We 're going to go on the road , and maybe we 'll be a little more relaxed .
We 'll probably get some of those bounces .
That 's the way it goes sometimes in a long series .
I thought we worked hard enough to get some bounces , but obviously we were hitting posts like there 's no tomorrow .
That 's the playoffs . "
In the third period , Ebbett deflected the puck off the back of Nabokov 's pad from near the goal line on a play set up by the speed of Teemu Selanne , who slipped behind the San Jose defense and fired the puck on net to set the sequence in motion .
Miller then put the Ducks up 3 - 1 on a rebound goal with 6:43 to play , but Cheechoo reduced the deficit 37 seconds later by barging past two defenders for a score .
The Sharks kept pushing , and Christian Ehrhoff hit the post with 2:10 to play -- but Anaheim controlled the puck for much of the final minute , preventing the Sharks from threatening .
" It 's not like we 've been spanked and we 've got our tail between our legs , " McLellan said .
" We play the same way , do the same things , create the same number of chances , eventually it 'll go in for us , and we 'll continue on . "
Then , owing to the great demand of many branch meditation centers of the Mahasi Satipatthana Vipassana , as well as of the public , this discourse was published in book form in 1954 .
The book has now run into its sixth edition .
As there is also a keen interest and eager demand among many devotees of other nationalities who are unacquainted with Burmese , the discourse is now translated into English .
From the first day of the opening of the Centre a discourse on the exposition of Satipatthana Vipassana , its purpose , the method of practice , the benefits derived therefrom , etc. , has been given daily to each batch of devotees arriving at the Centre almost everyday to undertake the intensive course of training .
The discourse lasts usually for one hour and thirty minutes , and the task of talking almost daily in this manner inevitably caused a strain .
Fortunately , the Buddha Sasananuggaha Association came forward to relieve the situation with an offer of the donation of a tape - recorder , and the discourse given on 27th July 1951 to a group of fifteen devotees undertaking the training was taped .
Thereafter this taped discourse has been in constant daily use preceded by a few preliminary remarks spoken by the Mahasi Sayadaw .
On the personal request of the Honorable U Nu , Prime Minister , and Thado Thiri Thudhamma Sir U Thwin , President of the Buddha Sasananuggaha Association , the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw , Bhadanta Sobhana Mahathera , came down from Shwebo to Rangoon on 10th November 1949 .
The Meditation Centre at the Thathana Yeiktha , Hermitage Road , Rangoon , was formally opened on 4th December 1949 , when the Mahasi Sayadaw began to give to fifteen devotees a methodical training in the right system of Satipatthana Vipassana .
Satipatthana Vipassana
Namo Buddhassa
Honor to the Fully Enlightened One
On coming across the Teaching of the Buddha , it is most important for everyone to cultivate the virtues of moral conduct ( sila ) , concentration ( samadhi ) , and wisdom ( pañña ) .
One should undoubtedly possess these three virtues .
For laypeople the minimal measure of moral conduct is the observance of the Five Precepts .
For bhikkhus it is the observance of the Patimokkha , the code of monastic discipline .
Anyone who is well - disciplined in moral conduct will be reborn in a happy realm of existence as a human being or a deva ( god ) .
However , this ordinary form of mundane morality ( lokiya - sila ) will not be a safeguard against relapse into the lower states of miserable existence , such as hell , the animal realm , or the realm of petas ( ghosts ) .
It is therefore desirable to cultivate the higher form of supramundane morality ( lokuttara - sila ) .
When one has fully acquired the virtue of this morality , one will be secure from relapse into the lower states and will always lead a happy life by being reborn as a human being or a deva .
Everyone should therefore make it his duty to work for supramundane morality .
There is every hope of success for anyone who strives sincerely and in real earnestness .
It would indeed be a pity if anyone were to fail to take advantage of this fine opportunity of being endowed with higher qualities , for such a person will undoubtedly be a victim sooner or later of his own bad karma , which will pull him down to the lower states of miserable existence in hell , the animal realm , or the sphere of petas , where the span of life lasts for many hundreds , thousands or millions of years .
It is therefore emphasized here that coming across the Teaching of the Buddha is the unique opportunity to work for path morality ( magga - sila ) and fruition morality ( phala - sila ) .
It is not , however , advisable to work for moral conduct alone .
It is also necessary to practice samadhi or concentration .
Samadhi is the fixed or tranquil state of mind .
The ordinary or undisciplined mind is in the habit of wandering to other places .
It can not be kept under control , but follows any idea , thought or imagination , etc .
In order to prevent this wandering , the mind should be made to attend repeatedly to a selected object of concentration .
On gaining practice , the mind gradually abandons its distractions and remains fixed on the object to which it is directed .
This is samadhi .
There are two kinds of concentration : mundane concentration ( lokiya - samadhi ) and supramundane concentration ( lokuttara - samadhi ) .
Of these two , the former consists in the mundane absorptions , such as the four rupa- jhanas — the absorptions pertaining to the world of form — and the four arupa - jhanas — the absorptions pertaining to the formless world .
These can be attained by the practice of tranquillity meditation ( samatha - bhavana ) with such methods as mindfulness of breathing , loving - kindness ( metta ) , kasina meditation , etc .
By virtue of these attainments one will be reborn in the plane of the brahmas .
The life - span of a brahma is very long and lasts for one world cycle , two , four , or eight world cycles , up to a limit of 84,000 world cycles , as the case may be .
But at the end of his lifespan , a brahma will die and be reborn as a human being or a deva .
If one leads a virtuous life all the time , one may lead a happy life in a higher existence , but as one is not free from the defilements of attachment , aversion and delusion , one may commit demeritorious deeds on many occasions .
One will then be a victim of his bad karma and be reborn in hell or in other lower states of miserable existence .
Thus mundane concentration also is not a definite security .
It is desirable to work for supramundane concentration , the concentration of the path ( magga ) and the fruit ( phala ) .
To acquire this concentration it is essential to cultivate wisdom ( pañña ) .
There are two forms of wisdom : mundane and supramundane .
Nowadays , knowledge of literature , art , science , or other worldly affairs is usually regarded as a kind of wisdom , but this form of wisdom has nothing to do with any kind of mental development ( bhavana ) .
Nor can it be regarded as of real merit , because many weapons of destruction are invented through these kinds of knowledge , which are always under the influence of attachment , aversion , and other evil motives .
The real spirit of mundane wisdom , on the other hand , has only merits and no demerits of any kind .
True mundane wisdom includes the knowledge used in welfare and relief work , which causes no harm ; learning to acquire the knowledge of the true meaning or sense of the scriptures ; and the three classes of knowledge of development for insight ( vipassana - bhavana ) , such as knowledge born of learning ( sutamaya - pañña ) , knowledge born of reflection ( cintamaya - pañña ) , and wisdom born of meditative development ( bhavanamaya - pañña ) .
The virtue of possessing mundane wisdom will lead to a happy life in higher states of existence , but it still cannot prevent the risk of being reborn in hell or in other states of miserable existence .
Only the development of supramundane wisdom ( lokuttara - pañña ) can decidedly remove this risk .
Supramundane wisdom is the wisdom of the path and fruit .
To develop this wisdom it is necessary to carry on the practice of insight meditation ( vipassana - bhavana ) out of the three disciplines of morality , concentration , and wisdom .
When the virtue of wisdom is duly developed , the necessary qualities of morality and concentration will also be acquired .
The Development of Wisdom
The method of developing this wisdom is to observe materiality ( rupa ) and mentality ( nama ) — the two sole elements existing in a living being — with a view to knowing them in their true nature .
At present , experiments in the analytical observation of materiality are usually carried out in laboratories with the aid of various kinds of instruments , yet these methods cannot deal with the mind .
The method of the Buddha does not require any kind of instruments or outside aid .
It can successfully deal with both materiality and mentality .
It makes use of one 's own mind for analytical purposes by fixing bare attention on the activities of materiality and mentality as they occur within oneself .
By continually repeating this form of exercise , the necessary concentration can be gained , and when concentration is keen enough , the ceaseless course of arising and passing away of materiality and mentality will be vividly perceptible .
The living being consists solely of the two distinct groups of materiality and mentality .
The solid substance of body as it is now found belongs to the group of materiality .
According to the usual enumeration of material phenomena , there are altogether twenty - eight kinds in this group , but in short it may be noted that body is a mass of materiality .
For example , it is the same as a doll made of clay or wheat , which is nothing but a collection of particles of clay or flour .
Materiality changes its form ( ruppati ) under physical conditions of heat , cold , etc. , and because of this changeableness under contrary physical conditions , it is called rupa in Pali .
It does not possess any faculty of knowing an object .
In the Abhidhamma , the elements of mentality and materiality are classified as " states with object " ( sarammana - dhamma ) and " states without object " ( anarammana - dhamma ) , respectively .
The element of mentality has an object , holds an object , knows an object , while that of materiality does not have an object , does not hold an object , and does not know an object .
It will thus be seen that the Abhidhamma has directly stated that materiality has no faculty of knowing an object .
A yogi also perceives in like manner that " materiality has no faculty of knowing . "
Logs and pillars , bricks and stones and lumps of earth are a mass of materiality .
They do not possess any faculty of knowing .
It is the same with the materiality which makes up a living body — it has no faculty of knowing .
The materiality in a dead body is the same as that of a living body — it does not possess any faculty of knowing .
People , however , have a common idea that the materiality of a living body possesses the faculty of knowing an object and that it loses this faculty only at death .
This is not really so .
In actual fact , materiality does not possess the faculty of knowing an object in either a dead or a living body .
What is it then that knows objects now ?
It is mentality , which comes into being depending on materiality .
It is called nama in Pali because it inclines ( namati ) towards an object .
Mentality is also spoken of as thought or consciousness .
Mentality arises depending on materiality : depending on the eye , eye - consciousness ( seeing ) arises ; depending on the ear , ear - consciousness ( hearing ) arises ; depending on the nose , nose - consciousness ( smelling ) arises ; depending on the tongue , tongue - consciousness ( tasting ) arises ; depending on the body , body - consciousness ( sense of touch ) arises .
There are many kinds of sense of touch , either good or bad .
While touch has a wide field of action in running throughout the whole length of the body , inside and outside , the sense of seeing , hearing , smelling and tasting come into being in their own particular spheres — the eye , ear , nose and tongue — each of which occupies a very small and limited area of the body .
These senses of touch , sight , etc. , are nothing but the elements of mind .
There also comes into being mind - consciousness — thoughts , ideas , imaginings , etc. — depending on the mind - base .
All of these are elements of mind .
Mind knows an object , while materiality does not know an object .
Seeing
People generally believe that in the case of seeing , it is the eye which actually sees .
They think that seeing and the eye are one and the same thing .
They also think : " Seeing is I , " " I see things , " " The eye , seeing , and I are one and the same person . "
In reality this is not so .
The eye is one thing and seeing is another , and there is no separate entity such as " I " or " ego . "
There is only the reality of seeing coming into being depending on the eye .
To give an example , it is like the case of a person who sits in a house .
The house and the person are two separate things : the house is not the person , nor is the person the house .
Similarly , it is so at the time of seeing .
The eye and seeing are two separate things : the eye is not seeing , nor is seeing the eye .
To give another example , it is just like the case of a person in a room who sees many things when he opens the window and looks through it .
If it is asked , " Who is it that sees ?
Is it the window or the person that actually sees ? " the answer is , " The window does not possess the ability to see ; it is only the person who sees . "
If it is again asked , " Will the person be able to see things on the outside without the window ? " the answer will be , " It is not possible to see things through the wall without the window .
One can only see through the window . "
Similarly , in the case of seeing , there are two separate realities of the eye and seeing .
The eye is not seeing , nor is seeing the eye , yet there can not be an act of seeing without the eye .
In reality , seeing comes into being depending on the eye .
It is now evident that in the body there are only two distinct elements of materiality ( eye ) and mentality ( seeing ) at every moment of seeing .
In addition , there is also a third element of materiality — the visual object .
At times the visual object is noticeable in the body and at times it is noticeable outside the body .
With the addition of the visual object there will then be three elements , two of which ( the eye and the visual object ) are materiality and the third of which ( seeing ) is mentality .
The eye and the visual object , being materiality , do not possess the ability to know an object , while seeing , being mentality , can know the visual object and what it looks like .
Now it is clear that there exist only the two separate elements of materiality and mentality at the moment of seeing , and the arising of this pair of separate elements is known as seeing .
People who are without the training in and knowledge of insight meditation hold the view that seeing belongs to or is " self , " " ego , " " living entity , " or " person . "
They believe that " seeing is I , " or " I am seeing , " or " I am knowing . "
This kind of view or belief is called sakkaya - ditthi in Pali .
Sakkaya means the group of materiality ( rupa ) and mentality ( nama ) as they exist distinctively .
Ditthi means a wrong view or belief .
The compound word sakkaya - ditthi means a wrong view or belief in self with regard to nama and rupa , which exist in reality .
For greater clarity , we will explain further the manner of holding the wrong view or belief .
At the moment of seeing , the things which actually exist are the eye , the visual object ( both materiality ) , and seeing ( mentality ) .
Nama and rupa are reality , yet people hold the view that this group of elements is self , or ego , or a living entity .
They consider that " seeing is I , " or " that which is seen is I , " or " I see my own body . "
Thus this mistaken view is taking the simple act of seeing to be self , which is sakkaya - ditthi , the wrong view of self .
As long as one is not free from the wrong view of self , one cannot expect to escape from the risk of falling into the miserable realms of the hells , the animals or the petas .
Though one may be leading a happy life in the human or deva world by virtue of one 's merits , yet one is liable to fall back into the miserable states of existence at any time , when one 's demerits operate .
For this reason , the Buddha pointed out that it is essential to work for the total removal of the wrong view of self :
" Let a monk go forth mindfully to abandon view of self "
( sakkaya - ditthippahañaya sato bhikkhu paribbaje ) .
To explain : though it is the wish of everyone to avoid old age , disease and death , no one can prevent their inevitable arrival .
After death , rebirth follows .
Rebirth in any state of existence does not depend on one 's own wish .
It is not possible to avoid rebirth in the hell realm , the animal realm or the realm of the petas by merely wishing for an escape .
Rebirth takes place in any state of existence as the consequence of one 's own deeds : there is no choice at all .
For these reasons , the round of birth and death , samsara , is very dreadful .
Every effort should therefore be made to acquaint oneself with the miserable conditions of samsara , and then to work for an escape from samsara , for the attainment of Nibbana .
If an escape from samsara as a whole is not possible for the present , an attempt should be made for an escape at least from the round of rebirth in the hell realms , the animal realm and the peta realm .
In this case it is necessary to work for the total removal within oneself of sakkaya - ditthi , which is the root cause of rebirth in the miserable states of existence .
Sakkaya - ditthi can only be destroyed completely by the noble path and fruit : the three supramundane virtues of morality , concentration and wisdom .
It is therefore imperative to work for the development of these virtues .
How should one do the work ?
By means of noting or observing one must go out from the jurisdiction of defilements ( kilesa ) .
One should practice by constantly noting or observing every act of seeing , hearing , etc. , which are the constituent physical and mental processes , till one is freed from sakkaya - ditthi , the wrong view of self .
For these reasons advice is always given here to take up the practice of vipassana meditation .
Now yogis have come here for the purpose of practicing vipassana meditation who may be able to complete the course of training and attain the noble path in no long time .
The view of self will then be totally removed and security will be finally gained against the danger of rebirth in the realms of the hells , animals and petas .
In this respect , the exercise is simply to note or observe the existing elements in every act of seeing .
It should be noted as " seeing , seeing " on every occasion of seeing .
By the terms " note " or " observe " or " contemplate " is meant the act of keeping the mind fixedly on the object with a view to knowing it clearly .
When this is done , and the act of seeing is noted as " seeing , seeing , " at times the visual object is noticed , at times consciousness of seeing is noticed , at times the eye - base , the place from which one sees , is noticed .
It will serve the purpose if one can notice distinctly any one of the three .
If not , based on this act of seeing there will arise sakkaya - ditthi , which will view it in the form of a person or as belonging to a person , and as being permanent , pleasurable , and self .
This will arouse the defilements of craving and attachment , which will in turn prompt deeds , and the deeds will bring forth rebirth in a new existence .
Thus the process of dependent origination operates and the vicious circle of samsara revolves incessantly .
In order to prevent the revolving of samsara from this source of seeing , it is necessary to note " seeing , seeing " on every occasion of seeing .
Hearing , Etc .
Similarly , in the case of hearing , there are only two distinct elements , materiality and mentality .
The sense of hearing arises depending on the ear .
While the ear and sound are two elements of materiality , the sense of hearing is the element of mentality .
In order to know clearly any one of these two kinds of materiality and mentality , every occasion of hearing should be noted as " hearing , hearing . "
So also , " smelling , smelling " should be noted on every occasion of smelling , and " tasting , tasting " on every occasion of tasting .
The sensation of touch in the body should be noted in the very same way .
There is a kind of material element known as bodily sensitivity throughout the body , which receives every impression of touch .
Every kind of touch , either agreeable or disagreeable , usually comes in contact with bodily sensitivity , and from this there arises body - consciousness , which feels or knows the touch on each occasion .
It will now be seen that at every moment of touching there are two elements of materiality — the bodily sensitivity and the tangible object — and one element of mentality — knowing of touch .
In order to know these things distinctly at every moment of touching , the practice of noting as " touching , touching " has to be carried out .
This merely refers to the common form of sensation of touch .
There are special forms which accompany painful or disagreeable sensations , such as feeling stiffness or tiredness in the body or limbs , feeling hot , pain , numb , aches , etc .
Because feeling ( vedana ) predominates in these cases , it should be noted as " feeling hot , " " feeling tired , " " feeling painful , " etc. , as the case may be .
It may also be mentioned that there occur many sensations of touch in the hands , the legs , and so on , on each occasion of bending , stretching , or moving .
Because of mentality wanting to move , stretch or bend , the material activities of moving , stretching or bending , etc. , occur in series .
( It may not be possible to notice these incidents at the outset .
They can only be noticed after some time , on gaining experience by practice .
It is mentioned here for the sake of general information . )
All activities in movements and in changing , etc. , are done by mentality .
When mentality wills to bend , there arises a series of inward movements of hand or the leg .
When mentality wills to stretch or move , there arises a series of outward movements or movements to and fro .
They fall away soon after they occur and at the very point of occurrence , as one will notice later .
In every case of bending , stretching , or other activities , there arises first a series of intentions , moments of mentality , inducing or causing in the hands and legs a series of material activities , such as stiffening , bending , stretching , or moving to and fro .
These activities come up against other material elements , the bodily sensitivity , and on every occasion of contact between material activities and sensitive qualities , there arises body - consciousness , which feels or knows the sensation of touch .
It is therefore clear that material activities are predominating factors in these cases .
It is necessary to notice the predominating factors .
If not , there will surely arise the wrong view which regards these activities as the doings of an " I " — " I am bending , " " I am stretching , " " my hands , " or " my legs . "
This practice of noting as " bending , " " stretching , " " moving , " is carried out for the purpose of removing such wrong views .
Mind
Depending on the mind - base there arises a series of mental activities , such as thinking , imagining , etc. , or generally speaking , a series of mental activities arises depending on the body .
In reality , each case is a composition of mentality and materiality , mind - base being materiality , and thinking , imagining , and so forth being mentality .
In order to be able to notice materiality and mentality clearly , " thinking , " " imagining , " and so forth should be noted in each case .
After having carried out the practice in the manner indicated above for some time , there may be an improvement in concentration .
One will notice that the mind no longer wanders about but remains fixed on the object to which it is directed .
At the same time , the power of noticing has considerably developed .
On every occasion of noting , one notices only two processes of materiality and mentality : a dual set of object ( materiality ) and mental state ( mentality ) , which makes note of the object , arising together .
Again , on proceeding further with the practice of contemplation , after some time one notices that nothing remains permanent , but that everything is in a state of flux .
New things arise each time .
Each of them is noted as it arises .
Whatever arises then passes away immediately and immediately another arises , which is again noted and which then passes away .
Thus the process of arising and passing away goes on , which clearly shows that nothing is permanent .
One therefore realizes that " things are not permanent " because one sees that they arise and pass away immediately .
This is insight into impermanence ( aniccanupassana - ñana ) .
Then one also realizes that " arising and passing are not desirable . "
This is insight into suffering ( dukkhanupassana - ñana ) .
Besides , one usually experiences many painful sensations in the body , such as tiredness , heat , aching , and at the time of noting these sensations , one generally feels that this body is a collection of sufferings .
This is also insight into suffering .
Then at every time of noting it is found that elements of materiality and mentality occur according to their respective nature and conditioning , and not according to one 's wishes .
One therefore realizes that " they are elements ; they are not governable ; they are not a person or living entity . "
This is insight into non-self ( anattanupassana - ñana ) .
On having fully acquired these insights into impermanence , suffering , and non-self , the maturity of knowledge of the path ( magga - ñana ) and knowledge of fruition ( phala - ñana ) takes place and realization of Nibbana is won .
By winning the realization of Nibbana in the first stage , one is freed from the round of rebirth in the realms of miserable existence .
Everyone should therefore endeavor to reach the first stage , the path and fruit of stream - entry , as a minimum measure of protection against an unfortunate rebirth .
The Beginner 's Exercise
It has already been explained that the actual method of practice in vipassana meditation is to note , or to observe , or to contemplate , the successive occurrences of seeing , hearing , and so on , at the six sense doors .
However , it will not be possible for a beginner to follow these on all successive incidents as they occur because his mindfulness ( sati ) , concentration ( samadhi ) , and knowledge ( ñana ) are still very weak .
The moments of seeing , hearing , smelling , tasting , touching , and thinking occur very swiftly .
It seems that seeing occurs at the same time as hearing , that hearing occurs at the same time as seeing , that seeing and hearing occur simultaneously , that seeing , hearing , thinking and imagining always occur simultaneously .
Because they occur so swiftly , it is not possible to distinguish which occurs first and which second .
In reality , seeing does not occur at the same time as hearing , nor does hearing occur at the same time as seeing .
Such incidents can occur only one at a time .
A yogi who has just begun the practice and who has not sufficiently developed his mindfulness , concentration and knowledge will not , however , be in a position to observe all these moments singly as they occur in serial order .
A beginner need not , therefore , follow up on many things .
He needs to begin with only a few things .
Seeing or hearing occurs only when due attention is given to their objects .
If one does not pay heed to any sight or sound , one may pass the time without any moments of seeing or hearing taking place .
Smelling rarely occurs .
The experience of tasting can only occur while one is eating .
In the case of seeing , hearing , smelling and tasting , the yogi can note them when they occur .
Body impressions , however , are ever present .
They usually exist distinctly all the time .
During the time that one is sitting , the body impression of stiffness or the sensation of hardness in this position is distinctly felt .
Attention should therefore be fixed on the sitting posture and a note made as " sitting , sitting , sitting . "
Sitting
Sitting is an erect posture of the body consisting of a series of physical activities , induced by consciousness consisting of a series of mental activities .
It is just like the case of an inflated rubber ball which maintains its round shape through the resistance of the air inside it .
The posture of sitting is similar in that the body is kept in an erect posture through the continuous process of physical activities .
A good deal of energy is required to pull up and keep in an erect position such a heavy load as this body .
People generally assume that the body is lifted and kept in an upright position by means of sinews .
This assumption is correct in a sense because sinews , blood , flesh and bones are nothing but materiality .
The element of stiffening which keeps the body in an erect posture belongs to the group of materiality and arises in the sinews , flesh , blood , etc. , throughout the body , like the air in a rubber ball .
The element of stiffening is the air element , known as vayo - dhatu .
The body is kept in an erect position by the air element in the form of stiffening , which is continually coming into existence .
At the time of sleepiness or drowsiness , one may drop flat because the supply of new materials in the form of stiffening is cut off .
The state of mind in heavy drowsiness or sleep is bhavanga , the " life - continuum " or passive subconscious flow .
During the course of bhavanga , mental activities are absent , and for this reason , the body lies flat during sleep or heavy drowsiness .
During waking hours , strong and alert mental activities are continually arising , and because of these the air element arises serially in the form of stiffening .
In order to know these facts , it is essential to note the bodily posture attentively as " sitting , sitting , sitting . "
This does not necessarily mean that the body impression of stiffening should particularly be searched for and noted .
Attention need only be fixed on the whole form of the sitting posture , that is , the lower portion of the body in a bent circular form and the upper portion held erect .
It may be found that the exercise of observing the mere sitting posture is too easy and does not require much effort .
In these circumstances , energy ( viriya ) is less and concentration ( samadhi ) is in excess .
One will generally feel lazy and will not want to carry on the noting as " sitting , sitting , sitting " repeatedly for a considerable length of time .
Laziness generally occurs when there is an excess of concentration and not enough energy .
It is nothing but a state of sloth and torpor ( thina - middha ) .
More energy should be developed , and for this purpose , the number of objects for noting should be increased .
After noting as " sitting , " the attention should be directed to a spot in the body where the sense of touch is felt and a note made as " touching . "
Any spot in the leg or hand or hip where a sense of touch is distinctly felt will serve the purpose .
For example , after noting the sitting posture of the body as " sitting , " the spot where the sense of touch is felt should be noted as " touching . "
The noting should thus be repeated using these two objects of the sitting posture and the place of touching alternately , as " sitting , touching , sitting , touching , sitting , touching . "
The terms " noting , " " observing " and " contemplating " are used here to indicate the fixing of attention on an object .
The exercise is simply to note or observe or contemplate as " sitting , touching . "
Those who already have experience in the practice of meditation may find this exercise easy to begin with , but those without any previous experience may at first find it rather difficult .
Rising - Falling
A simpler and easier form of the exercise for a beginner is this :
With every breath there occurs in the abdomen a rising - falling movement .
A beginner should start with the exercise of noting this movement .
This rising - falling movement is easy to observe because it is coarse and therefore more suitable for the beginner .
As in schools where simple lessons are easy to learn , so also is the practice of vipassana meditation .
A beginner will find it easier to develop concentration and knowledge with a simple and easy exercise .
Again , the purport of vipassana meditation is to begin the exercise by contemplating prominent factors in the body .
Of the two factors of mentality and materiality , the former is subtle and less prominent , while the latter is coarse and more prominent .
At the outset , therefore , the usual procedure for an insight meditator is to begin the exercise by contemplating the material elements .
With regard to materiality , it may be mentioned here that derived materiality ( upada - rupa ) is subtle and less prominent , while the four primary physical elements ( maha - bhuta - rupa ) — earth , water , fire and air — are coarse and more prominent .
The latter should therefore have priority in the order of objects for contemplation .
In the case of rising - falling , the outstanding factor is the air element , or vayo - dhatu .
The process of stiffening and the movements of the abdomen noticed during the contemplation are nothing but the functions of the air element .
Thus it will be seen that the air element is perceptible at the beginning .
According to the instructions of the Satipatthana Sutta , one should be mindful of the activities of walking while walking , of those of standing , sitting and lying down while standing , sitting and lying down , respectively .
One should also be mindful of other bodily activities as each of them occurs .
In this connection , it is stated in the commentaries that one should be mindful primarily of the air element , in preference to the other three elements .
As a matter of fact , all four primary elements are dominant in every action of the body , and it is essential to perceive any one of them .
At the time of sitting , either of the two movements of rising and falling occurs conspicuously with every breath , and a beginning should be made by noting these movements .
Some fundamental features in the system of vipassana meditation have been explained for general information .
The general outline of basic exercises will now be dealt with .
Outline of Basic Exercises
When contemplating rising and falling , the disciple should keep his mind on the abdomen .
He will then come to know the upward movement or expansion of the abdomen on breathing in , and the downward movement or contraction on breathing out .
A mental note should be made as " rising " for the upward movement and " falling " for the downward movement .
If these movements are not clearly noticed by simply fixing the mind on them , one or both hands should be placed on the abdomen .
The disciple should not try to change the manner of his natural breathing .
He should neither attempt slow breathing by the retention of his breath , nor quick breathing or deep breathing .
If he does change the natural flow of his breathing , he will soon tire himself .
He must therefore keep to the natural rate of his breathing and proceed with the contemplation of rising and falling .
On the occurrence of the upward movement of the abdomen , the mental note of " rising " should be made , and on the downward movement of the abdomen , the mental note of " falling " should be made .
The mental notation of these terms should not be vocalized .
In vipassana meditation , it is more important to know the object than to know it by a term or name .
It is therefore necessary for the disciple to make every effort to be mindful of the movement of rising from its beginning to its end and that of falling from its beginning to its end , as if these movements are actually seen with the eyes .
As soon as rising occurs , there should be the knowing mind close to the movement , as in the case of a stone hitting a wall .
The movement of rising as it occurs and the mind knowing it must come together on every occasion .
Similarly , the movement of falling as it occurs and the mind knowing it must come together on every occasion .
When there is no other conspicuous object , the disciple should carry on the exercise of noting these two movements as " rising , falling , rising , falling , rising , falling . "
While thus being occupied with this exercise , there may be occasions when the mind wanders about .
When concentration is weak , it is very difficult to control the mind .
Though it is directed to the movements of rising and falling , the mind will not stay with them but will wander to other places .
This wandering mind should not be let alone .
It should be noted as " wandering , wandering , wandering " as soon as it is noticed that it is wandering .
On noting once or twice the mind usually stops wandering , then the exercise of noting " rising , falling " should be continued .
When it is again found that the mind has reached a place , it should be noted as " reaching , reaching , reaching . "
Then the exercise of noting " rising , falling " should be reverted to as soon as these movements are clear .
On meeting with a person in the imagination , it should be noted as " meeting , meeting , " after which the usual exercise should be reverted to .
Sometimes the fact that it is mere imagination is discovered when one speaks with that imaginary person , and it should then be noted as " speaking , speaking . "
The real purport is to note every mental activity as it occurs .
For instance , it should be noted as " thinking " at the moment of thinking , and as " reflecting , " " planning , " " knowing , " " attending , " rejoicing , " " feeling lazy , " " feeling happy , " " disgusted , " etc. , as the case may be , on the occurrence of each activity .
The contemplation of mental activities and noticing them is called cittanupassana , contemplation of mind .
Because people have no practical knowledge in vipassana meditation , they are generally not in a position to know the real state of the mind .
This naturally leads them to the wrong view of holding mind to be " person , " " self , " " living entity . "
They usually believe that " imagination is I , " " I am thinking , " " I am planning , " " I am knowing , " and so forth .
They hold that there exists a living entity or self which grows up from childhood to adulthood .
In reality , such a living entity does not exist , but there does exist a continuous process of elements of mind which occur singly , one at a time , in succession .
The practice of contemplation is therefore being carried out with the aim of discovering the true nature of this mind - body complex .
As regards the mind and the manner of its arising , the Buddha stated in the Dhammapada ( v.37 ) :
Durangamam ekacaram
asariram guhasayam
ye cittam saññamessanti
mokkhanti marabandhana .
Faring far , wandering alone ,
Formless and lying in a cave .
Those who do restrain the mind
Are sure released from Mara 's bonds .
Faring far .
Mind usually wanders far and wide .
While the yogi is trying to carry on with the practice of contemplation in his meditation room , he often finds that his mind has wandered to many far - off places , towns , etc .
He also finds that his mind can wander to any of the far - off places which he has previously known at the very moment of thinking or imagining .
This fact is discovered with the help of contemplation .
Alone .
Mind occurs singly , moment to moment in succession .
Those who do not perceive the reality of this believe that one mind exists in the course of life or existence .
They do not know that new minds are always arising at every moment .
They think that the seeing , hearing , smelling , tasting , touching and thinking of the past and of the present belong to one and the same mind , and that three or four acts of seeing , hearing , touching , knowing usually occur simultaneously .
These are wrong views .
In reality , single moments of mind arise and pass away continuously , one after another .
This can be perceived on gaining considerable practice .
The cases of imagination and planning are clearly perceptible .
Imagination passes away as soon as it is noted as " imagining , imagining , " and planning also passes away as soon as it is noted as " planning , planning . "
These instances of arising , noting and passing away appear like a string of beads .
The preceding mind is not the following mind .
Each is separate .
These characteristics of reality are personally perceptible , and for this purpose one must proceed with the practice of contemplation .
Formless .
Mind has no substance , no form .
It is not easy to distinguish as is the case with materiality .
In the case of materiality , the body , head , hands and legs are very prominent and are easily noticed .
If it is asked what matter is , matter can be handled and shown .
Mind , however , is not easy to describe because it has no substance or form .
For this reason , it is not possible to carry out analytical laboratory experiments on the mind .
One can , however , fully understand the mind if it is explained as that which knows an object .
To understand the mind , it is necessary to contemplate the mind at every moment of its occurrence .
When contemplation is fairly advanced , the mind 's approach to its object is clearly comprehended .
It appears as if each moment of mind is making a direct leap towards it object .
In order to know the true nature of the mind , contemplation is thus prescribed .
Lying in a cave .
Because the mind comes into being depending on the mind - base and the other sense doors situated in the body , it is said that it rests in a cave .
Those who do restrain the mind are sure released from Mara 's bonds .
It is said that the mind should be contemplated at each moment of its occurrence .
The mind can thus be controlled by means of contemplation .
On his successful controlling of the mind , the yogi will win freedom from the bondage of Mara , the King of Death .
It will now be seen that it is important to note the mind at every moment of its occurrence .
As soon as it is noted , the mind passes away .
For instance , by noting once or twice as " intending , intending , " it is found that intention passes away at once .
Then the usual exercise of noting as " rising , falling , rising , falling " should be reverted to .
While one is proceeding with the usual exercise , one may feel that one wants to swallow saliva .
It should be noted as " wanting , " and on gathering saliva as " gathering , " and on swallowing as " swallowing , " in the serial order of occurrence .
The reason for contemplation in this case is because there may be a persisting personal view as " wanting to swallow is I , " " swallowing is also I . "
In reality , " wanting to swallow " is mentality and not " I , " and " swallowing " is materiality and not " I . "
There exist only mentality and materiality at that moment .
By means of contemplating in this manner , one will understand clearly the process of reality .
So too , in the case of spitting , it should be noted as " wanting " when one wants to spit , as " bending " on bending the neck ( which should be done slowly ) , as " looking , seeing " on looking and as " spitting " on spitting .
Afterwards , the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling " should be continued .
Because of sitting for a long time , there will arise in the body unpleasant feeling of being stiff , being hot and so forth .
These sensations should be noted as they occur .
The mind should be fixed on that spot and a note made as " stiff , stiff " on feeling stiff , as " hot , hot " on feeling hot , as " painful , painful " on feeling painful , as " prickly , prickly " on feeling prickly sensations , and as " tired , tired " on feeling tired .
These unpleasant feelings are dukkha-vedana and the contemplation of these feeling is vedananupassana , contemplation of feeling .
Owing to the absence of knowledge in respect of these feelings , there persists the wrong view of holding them as one 's own personality or self , that is to say , " I am feeling stiff , " " I am feeling painful , " " I was feeling well formerly but I now feel uncomfortable , " in the manner of a single self .
In reality , unpleasant feelings arise owing to disagreeable impressions in the body .
Like the light of an electric bulb which can continue to burn on a continuous supply of energy , so it is in the case of feelings , which arise anew on every occasion of coming in contact with disagreeable impressions .
It is essential to understand these feelings clearly .
At the beginning of noting as " stiff , stiff , " " hot , hot , " " painful , painful , " one may feel that such disagreeable feelings grow stronger , and then one will notice that a mind wanting to change the posture arises .
This mind should be noted as " wanting , wanting . "
Then a return should be made to the feeling and it should be noted as " stiff , stiff " or " hot , hot , " and so forth .
If one proceeds in this manner of contemplation with great patience , unpleasant feelings will pass away .
There is a saying that patience leads to Nibbana .
Evidently this saying is more applicable in the case of contemplation than in any other .
Plenty of patience is needed in contemplation .
If a yogi cannot bear unpleasant feelings with patience , but frequently changes his posture during contemplation , he cannot expect to gain concentration .
Without concentration there is no chance of acquiring insight knowledge ( vipassana - ñana ) and without insight knowledge the attainment of the path , fruition and Nibbana can not be won .
Patience is of great importance in contemplation .
Patience is needed mostly to bear unpleasant bodily feelings .
There is hardly any case of outside disturbances where it is necessary to exercise patience .
This means the observance of khantisamvara , restraint by patience .
The posture should not be immediately changed when unpleasant sensations arise , but contemplation should be continued by noting them as " stiff , stiff , " " hot , hot , " and so on .
Such painful sensations are normal and will pass away .
In the case of strong concentration , it will be found that great pains will pass away when they are noted with patience .
On the fading away of suffering or pain , the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling " should be continued .
On the other hand , it may be found that pains or unpleasant feelings do not immediately pass away even when one notes them with great patience .
In such a case , one has no alternative but to change posture .
One must , of course , submit to superior forces .
When concentration is not strong enough , strong pains will not pass away quickly .
In these circumstances there will often arise a mind wanting to change posture , and this mind should be noted as " wanting , wanting . "
After this , one should note " lifting , lifting " on moving it forward .
These bodily actions should be carried out slowly , and these slow movements should be followed up and noted as " lifting , lifting , " " moving , moving , " " touching , touching , " in the successive order of the process .
Again , on moving one should note " moving , moving , " and on putting down , note " putting , putting . "
If , when this process of changing posture has been completed , there is nothing more to be noted , the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling " should be continued .
There should be no stop or break in between .
The preceding act of noting and the one which follows should be contiguous .
Similarly , the preceding concentration and the one which follows should be contiguous , and the preceding act of knowing and the one which follows should be contiguous .
In this way , the gradual development by stages of mindfulness , concentration and knowledge takes place , and depending on their full development , the final stage of path - knowledge is attained .
In the practice of vipassana meditation , it is important to follow the example of a person who tries to make fire .
To make a fire in the days before matches , a person had to constantly rub two sticks together without the slightest break in motion .
As the sticks became hotter and hotter , more effort was needed , and the rubbing had to be carried out incessantly .
Only when the fire had been produced was the person at liberty to take a rest .
Similarly , a yogi should work hard so that there is no break between the preceding noting and the one which follows , and the preceding concentration and the one which follows .
He should revert to his usual exercise of noting " rising , falling " after he has noted painful sensations .
While being thus occupied with his usual exercise , he may again feel itching sensations somewhere in the body .
He should then fix his mind on the spot and make a note as " itching , itching . "
Itching is an unpleasant sensation .
As soon as it is felt , there arises a mind which wants to rub or scratch .
This mind should be noted as " wanting , wanting , " after which no rubbing or scratching must be done as yet , but a return should be made to the itching and a note made as " itching , itching . "
While one is occupied with contemplation in this manner , itching in most cases passes away and the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling " should then be reverted to .
If , on the other hand , it is found that itching does not pass away , but that it is necessary to rub or scratch , the contemplation of the successive stages should be carried out by noting the mind as " wanting , wanting . "
It should then be continued by noting " raising , raising " on raising the hand , " touching , touching " when the hand touches the spot , " rubbing , rubbing " or " scratching , scratching " when the hand rubs or scratches , " withdrawing , withdrawing " on withdrawing the hand , " touching , touching " when the hand touches the body , and then the usual contemplation of " rising , falling " should be continued .
In every case of changing postures , contemplation of the successive stages should be carried out similarly and carefully .
While thus carefully proceeding with the contemplation , one may find that painful feelings or unpleasant sensations arise in the body of their own accord .
Ordinarily , people change their posture as soon as they feel even the slightest unpleasant sensation of tiredness or heat without taking heed of these incidents .
The change of posture is carried out quite heedlessly just while the seed of pain is beginning to grow .
Thus painful feelings fail to take place in a distinctive manner .
For this reason it is said that , as a rule , the postures hide painful feelings from view .
People generally think that they are feeling well for days and nights on end .
They think that painful feelings occur only at the time of an attack of a dangerous disease .
Reality is just the opposite of what people think .
Let anyone try to see how long he can keep himself in a sitting posture without moving or changing it .
One will find it uncomfortable after a short while , say five or ten minutes , and then one will begin to find it unbearable after fifteen or twenty minutes .
One will then be compelled to move or change one 's posture by either raising or lowering the head , moving the hands or legs , or by swaying the body either forward or backward .
Many movements usually take place during a short time , and the number would be very large if they were to be counted for the length of just one day .
However , no one appears to be aware of this fact because no one takes any heed .
Such is the order in every case , while in the case of a yogi who is always mindful of his actions and who is proceeding with contemplation , body impressions in their own respective nature are therefore distinctly noticed .
They cannot help but reveal themselves fully in their own nature because he is watching until they come to full view .
Though a painful sensation arises , he keeps on noting it .
He does not ordinarily attempt to change his posture or move .
Then on the arising of mind wanting to change , he at once makes a note of it as " wanting , wanting , " and afterwards he returns again to the painful sensation and continues his noting of it .
He changes his posture or moves only when he finds the painful feeling unbearable .
In this case he also begins by noting the wanting mind and proceeds with noting carefully each stage in the process of moving .
This is why the postures can no longer hide painful sensations .
Often a yogi finds painful sensations creeping from here and there or he may feel hot sensations , aching sensations , itching , or the whole body as a mass of painful sensations .
That is how painful sensations are found to be predominant because the postures cannot cover them .
If he intends to change his posture from sitting to standing , he should first make a note of the intending mind as " intending , intending , " and proceed with the arranging of the hands and legs in the successive stages by noting as " raising , " " moving , " " stretching , " " touching , " " pressing , " and so forth .
When the body sways forward , it should be noted as " swaying , swaying . "
While in the course of standing up , there occurs in the body a feeling of lightness as well as the act of rising .
Attention should be fixed on these factors and a note made as " rising , rising . "
The act of rising should be carried out slowly .
During the course of practice it is most appropriate if a yogi acts feebly and slowly in all activities just like a weak , sick person .
Perhaps the case of a person suffering from lumbago would be a more fitting example here .
The patient must always be cautious and move slowly just to avoid pains .
In the same manner a yogi should always try to keep to slow movements in all actions .
Slow motion is necessary to enable mindfulness , concentration and knowledge to catch up .
One has lived all the time in a careless manner and one just begins seriously to train oneself in keeping the mind within the body .
It is only the beginning , and one 's mindfulness , concentration and knowledge have not yet been properly geared up while the physical and mental processes are moving at top speed .
It is thus imperative to bring the top - level speed of these processes to the lowest gear so as to make it possible for mindfulness and knowledge to keep pace with them .
It is therefore desirable that slow motion exercises be carried out at all times .
Further , it is advisable for a yogi to behave like a blind person throughout the course of training .
A person without any restraint will not look dignified because he usually looks at things and persons wantonly .
He also cannot obtain a steady and calm state of mind .
The blind person , on the other hand , behaves in a composed manner by sitting sedately with downcast eyes .
He never turns in any direction to look at things or persons because he is blind and cannot see them .
Even if a person comes near him and speaks to him , he never turns around and looks at that person .
This composed manner is worthy of imitation .
A yogi should act in the same manner while carrying out the practice of contemplation .
He should not look anywhere .
His mind should be solely intent on the object of contemplation .
While in the sitting posture he must be intently noting " rising , falling . "
Even if strange things occur nearby , he should not look at them .
He must simply make a note as " seeing , seeing " and then continue with the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling . "
A yogi should have a high regard for this exercise and carry it out with due respect , so much so as to be mistaken for a blind person .
In this respect certain girl - yogis were found to be in perfect form .
They carefully carried out the exercise with all due respect in accordance with the instructions .
Their manner was very composed and they were always intent on their objects of contemplation .
They never looked round .
When they walked , they were always intent on the steps .
Their steps were light , smooth and slow .
Every yogi should follow their example .
It is necessary for a yogi to behave like a deaf person also .
Ordinarily , as soon as a person hears a sound , he turns around and looks in the direction from which the sound came , or he turns towards the person who spoke to him and makes a reply .
He does not behave in a sedate manner .
A deaf person , on the other hand , behaves in a composed manner .
He does not take heed of any sound or talk because he never hears them .
Similarly , a yogi should conduct himself in like manner without taking heed of any unimportant talk , nor should he deliberately listen to any talk or speech .
If he happens to hear any sound or speech , he should at once make a note as " hearing , hearing , " and then return to the usual practice of noting " rising , falling . "
He should proceed with his contemplation intently , so much so as to be mistaken for a deaf person .
It should be remembered that the only concern of a yogi is the carrying out intently of contemplation .
Other things seen or heard are not his concern .
Even though they may appear to be strange or interesting , he should not take heed of them .
When he sees any sights , he must ignore them as if he does not see .
So too , he must ignore voices or sounds as if he does not hear .
In the case of bodily actions , he must act slowly and feebly as if he were sick and very weak .
Other Exercises
Walking
It is therefore to be emphasized that the act of pulling up the body to the standing posture should be carried out slowly .
On coming to an erect position , a note should be made as " standing , standing . "
If one happens to look around , a note should be made as " looking , seeing , " and on walking each step should be noted as " right step , left step " or " walking , walking . "
At each step , attention should be fixed on the sole of the foot as it moves from the point of lifting the leg to the point of placing it down .
While walking in quick steps or taking a long walk , a note on one section of each step as " right step , left step " or " walking , walking " will do .
In the case of walking slowly , each step may be divided into three sections — lifting , moving forward and placing down .
In the beginning of the exercise , a note should be made of the two parts of each step : as " lifting " by fixing the attention on the upward movement of the foot from the beginning to the end , and as " placing " by fixing on the downward movement from the beginning to the end .
Thus the exercise which starts with the first step by noting as " lifting , placing " now ends .
Normally , when the foot is put down and is being noted as " placing , " the other leg begins lifting to begin the next step .
This should not be allowed to happen .
The next step should begin only after the first step has been completed , such as " lifting , placing " for the first step and " lifting , placing " for the second step .
After two or three days this exercise will be easy , and then the yogi should carry out the exercise of noting each step in three sections as " lifting , moving , placing . "
For the present a yogi should start the exercise by noting as " right step , left step , " or " walking , walking " while walking quickly , and by noting as " lifting , placing " while walking slowly .
Sitting
While one is walking , one may feel the desire to sit down .
One should then make a note as " wanting . "
If one then happens to look up , note it as " looking , seeing , looking , seeing " ; on going to the seat as " lifting , placing " ; on stopping as " stopping , stopping " ; on turning as " turning , turning . "
When one feels a desire to sit , note it as " wanting , wanting . "
In the act of sitting there occur in the body heaviness and also a downward pull .
Attention should be fixed on these factors and a note made as " sitting , sitting , sitting . "
After having sat down there will be movements of bringing the hands and legs into position .
They should be noted as " moving , " " bending , " " stretching , " and so forth .
If there is nothing to do and if one is sitting quietly , one should then revert to the usual exercise of noting as " rising , falling . "
Lying Down
If in the course of contemplation one feels painful or tired or hot , one should make a note of these and then revert to the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling . "
If one feels sleepy , one should make a note of it as " sleepy , sleepy " and proceed with the noting of all acts in preparation to lie down : note the bringing into position of the hands and legs as " raising , " " pressing , " " moving , " " supporting " ; when the body sways as " swaying , swaying " ; when the legs stretch as " stretching , stretching " ; and when the body drops and lies flat as " lying , lying , lying . "
These trifling acts in lying down are also important and they should not be neglected .
There is every possibility of attaining enlightenment during this short time .
On the full development of concentration and knowledge , enlightenment is attainable during the present moment of bending or stretching .
In this way the Venerable Ananda attained Arahatship at the very moment of lying down .
About the beginning of the fourth month after the Buddha 's complete passing away , arrangements were made to hold the first council of bhikkhus to collectively classify , examine , confirm and recite all the teachings of the Buddha .
At that time five hundred bhikkhus were chosen for this work .
Of these bhikkhus , four hundred and ninety - nine were Arahats , while the Venerable Ananda was a sotapanna , a stream - enterer .
In order to attend the council as an Arahant on the same level with the others , he made his utmost effort to carry on with his meditation on the day prior to the opening of the council .
That was on the fourth of the waning moon of the month of Savana ( August ) .
He proceeded with mindfulness of the body and continued his walking meditation throughout the night .
It might have been in the same manner as noting " right step , left step " or " walking , walking . "
He was thus occupied with intense contemplation of the processes of mentality and materiality in each step until dawn of the following day , but he still had not yet attained to Arahatship .
Then the Venerable Ananda thought : " I have done my utmost .
Lord Buddha has said : ' Ananda , you possess full perfections ( paramis ) .
Do proceed with the practice of meditation .
You will surely attain Arahatship one day . '
I have tried my best , so much so that I can be counted as one of those who have done their best in meditation .
What maybe the reason for my failure ? "
Then he remembered : " Ah !
I have been overzealous in keeping solely to the practice of walking throughout the night .
There is an excess of energy and not enough concentration , which indeed is responsible for this state of restlessness .
It is now necessary to stop walking practice so as to bring energy in balance with concentration and to proceed with the contemplation in a lying position . "
The Venerable Ananda then entered his room , sat down on his bed , and began to lie down .
It is said that he attained Arahatship at the very moment of lying down , or rather at the moment of contemplating as " lying , lying . "
This manner of attaining Arahatship has been recorded as a strange event in the Commentaries , because it is outside the four regular postures of standing , sitting , lying and walking .
At the moment of his enlightenment , the Venerable Ananda could not be regarded as strictly in a standing posture because his feet were off the floor , nor could he be regarded as sitting because his body was already at an angle , being quite close to the pillow , nor could he be regarded as lying down since his head had not yet touched the pillow and his body was not yet flat .
The Venerable Ananda was a stream - enterer and he thus had to develop the three other higher stages — the path and fruit of once - returning , the path and fruit of non-returning , and the path and fruit of Arahatship in his final attainment .
This took only a moment .
Extreme care is therefore needed to carry on the practice of contemplation without relaxation or omission .
In the act of lying down , contemplation should therefore be carried out with due care .
When a yogi feels sleepy and wants to lie down , a note should be made as " sleepy , sleepy , " " wanting , wanting " ; on raising the hand as " raising , raising " ; on stretching as " stretching , stretching " ; on touching as " touching , touching " ; on pressing as " pressing , pressing " ; after swaying the body and dropping it down as " lying , lying . "
The act of lying down itself should be carried out very slowly .
On touching the pillow it should be noted as " touching , touching . "
There are many places of touch all over the body but each spot need be noted only one at a time .
In the lying posture there are also many movements of the body in bringing one 's arms and legs into position .
These actions should be noted carefully as " raising , " " stretching , " " bending , " " moving , " and so forth .
On turning the body a note should be made as " turning , turning , " and when there is nothing in particular to be noted , the yogi should proceed with the usual practice of noting " rising , falling . "
While one is lying on one 's back or side , there is usually nothing in particular to be noted and the usual exercise of " rising , falling " should be carried out .
There may be many times when the mind wanders while one is in the lying posture .
This wandering mind should be noted as " going , going " when it goes out , as " arriving , arriving " when it reaches a place , as " planning , " " reflecting , " and so forth for each state in the same manner as in the contemplation while in the sitting posture .
Mental states pass away on being noted once or twice .
The usual exercise of noting " rising , falling " should be continued .
There may also be instances of swallowing or spitting saliva , painful sensations , hot sensations , itching sensations , etc. , or of bodily actions in changing positions or in moving the limbs .
They should be contemplated as each occurs .
( When sufficient strength in concentration is gained , it will be possible to carry on with the contemplation of each act of opening and closing the eyelids and blinking . )
Afterwards , one should then return to the usual exercise when there is nothing else to be noted .
Sleep
Though it is late at night and time for sleep , it is not advisable to give up the contemplation and go to sleep .
Anyone who has a keen interest in contemplation must be prepared to face the risk of spending many nights without sleep .
The scriptures are emphatic on the necessity of developing the qualities of four - factored energy ( caturanga - viriya ) in the practice of meditation : " In the hard struggle , one may be reduced to a mere skeleton of skin , bones and sinews when one 's flesh and blood wither and dry up , but one should not give up one 's efforts so long as one has not attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance , energy and endeavor . "
These instructions should be followed with a strong determination .
It may be possible to keep awake if there is strong enough concentration to beat off sleep , but one will fall asleep if sleep gets the upper hand .
When one feels sleepy , one should make a note of it as " sleepy , sleepy " ; when the eyelids are heavy as " heavy , heavy " ; when the eyes are felt to be dazzled as " dazzled , dazzled . "
After contemplating in the manner indicated , one may be able to shake off sleepiness and feel fresh again .
This feeling should be noted as " feeling fresh , feeling fresh , " after which the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling " should be continued .
However , in spite of this determination , one may feel unable to keep awake if one is very sleepy .
In a lying posture , it is easier to fall asleep .
A beginner should therefore try to keep mostly to the postures of sitting and walking .
When the night is advanced , however , a yogi may be compelled to lie down and proceed with the contemplation of rising and falling .
In this position he may perhaps fall asleep .
While one is asleep , it is not possible to carry on with the work of contemplation .
It is an interval for a yogi to relax .
An hour 's sleep will give him an hour 's relaxation , and if he continues to sleep for two , three or four hours , he will be relaxed for that much longer , but it is not advisable for a yogi to sleep for more than four hours , which is ample enough for a normal sleep .
Waking
A yogi should begin his contemplation from the moment of awakening .
To be fully occupied with intense contemplation throughout his waking hours is the routine of a yogi who works hard with true aspiration for the attainment of the path and fruit .
If it is not possible to catch the moment of awakening , he should begin with the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling . "
If he first becomes aware of the fact of reflecting , he should begin his contemplation by noting " reflecting , reflecting " and then revert to the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling . "
If he first becomes aware of hearing a voice or some other sound , he should begin by noting " hearing , hearing " and then revert to the usual exercise .
On awakening there may be bodily movement in turning to this side or that , moving the hands or legs and so forth .
These actions should be contemplated in successive order .
If he first becomes aware of the mental states leading to the various actions of body , he should begin his contemplation by noting the mind .
If he first becomes aware of painful sensations , he should begin with the noting of these painful sensations and then proceed with the noting of bodily actions .
If he remains quiet without moving , the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling " should be continued .
If he intends to get up , he should note this as " intending , intending " and then proceed with the noting of all actions in serial order in bringing the hands and legs into position .
One should note " raising , raising " on raising the body , " sitting , sitting " when the body is erect and in a sitting posture , and one should also note any other actions of bringing the legs and hands into position .
If there is then nothing in particular to be noted , the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling " should be reverted to .
Thus far we have mentioned things relating to the objects of contemplation in connection with the four postures and changing from one posture to another .
This is merely a description of the general outline of major objects of contemplation to be carried out in the course of practice .
Yet in the beginning of the practice , it is difficult to follow up on all of them in the course of contemplation .
Many things will be omitted , but on gaining sufficient strength in concentration , it is easy to follow up in the course of contemplation not only those objects already enumerated , but may many more .
With the gradual development of mindfulness and concentration , the pace of knowledge quickens , and thus many more objects can be perceived .
It is necessary to work up to this high level .
Washing and Eating
Contemplation should be carried out in washing the face in the morning or when taking a bath .
As it is necessary to act quickly in such instances due to the nature of the action itself , contemplation should be carried out as far as these circumstances will allow .
On stretching the hand to catch hold of the dipper , it should be noted as " stretching , stretching " ; on catching hold of the dipper as " holding , holding " ; on immersing the dipper as " dipping , dipping " ; on bringing the dipper towards the body as " bringing , bringing " ; on pouring the water over the body or on the face as " pouring , pouring " ; on feeling cold as " cold , cold " ; on rubbing as " rubbing , rubbing , " and so forth .
There are also many different bodily actions in changing or arranging one 's clothing , in arranging the bed or bed - sheets , in opening the door , and so on .
These actions should be contemplated in detail serially as much as possible .
At the time of taking a meal , contemplation should begin from the moment of looking at the table and noted as " looking , seeing , looking , seeing " ; when stretching the hand to the plate as " stretching , stretching " ; when the hand touches the food as " touching , hot , hot " ; when gathering the food as " gathering , gathering " ; when catching hold of the food as " catching , catching " ; after lifting when the hand is being brought up as " bringing , bringing " ; when the neck is being bent down as " bending , bending " ; when the food is being placed in the mouth as " placing , placing " ; when withdrawing the hand as " withdrawing , withdrawing " ; when the hand touches the plate as " touching , touching " ; when the neck is being straightened as " straightening , straightening " ; when chewing the food as " chewing , chewing " ; while tasting the food as " tasting , tasting , " when one likes the taste as " liking , liking " ; when one finds it pleasant as " pleasant , pleasant " ; when swallowing as " swallowing , swallowing . "
This is an illustration of the routine of contemplation on partaking of each morsel of food till the meal is finished .
In this case too it is difficult to follow up on all actions at the beginning of the practice .
There will be many omissions .
Yogis should not hesitate , however , but must try to follow up as much as they can .
With the gradual advancement of the practice , it will be easier to note many more objects than are mentioned here .
The instructions for the practical exercise of contemplation are now almost complete .
As they have been explained in detail and at some length , it will not be easy to remember all of them .
For the sake of easy remembrance , a short summary of the important and essential points will be given .
Summary of Essential Points
In walking , a yogi should contemplate the movements of each step .
While one is walking briskly , each step should be noted as " right step , left step " respectively .
The mind should be fixed intently on the sole of the foot in the movements of each step .
While one is in the course of walking slowly , each step should be noted in two parts as " lifting , placing . "
While one is in a sitting posture , the usual exercise of contemplation should be carried out by noting the movements of the abdomen as " rising , falling , rising , falling . "
The same manner of contemplation by noting the movements as " rising , falling , rising , falling " should be carried out while one is also in the lying posture .
If it is found that the mind wanders during the course of noting " rising , falling , " it should not be allowed to continue to wander but should be noted immediately .
On imagining , it should be noted as " imagining , imagining " ; on thinking as " thinking , thinking " ; on the mind going out as " going , going " ; on the mind arriving at a place as " arriving , arriving , " and so forth at every occurrence , and then the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling " should be continued .
When there occur feelings of tiredness in the hands , legs or other limbs , or hot , prickly , aching or itching sensations , they should be immediately followed up and noted as " tired , " " hot , " " prickly , " " aching , " " itching , " and so on as the case may be .
A return should then be made to the usual exercise of noting " rising , falling . "
When there are acts of bending or stretching the hands or legs , or moving the neck or limbs or swaying the body to and fro , they should be followed up and noted in serial order as they occur .
The usual exercise of noting as " rising , falling " should then be reverted to .
This is only a summary .
Any other objects to be contemplated in the course of training will be mentioned by the meditation teachers when giving instructions during the daily interview with the disciples .
If one proceeds with the practice in the manner indicated , the number of objects will gradually increase in the course of time .
At first there will be many omissions because the mind is used to wandering without any restraint whatsoever .
However , a yogi should not lose heart on this account .
This difficulty is usually encountered in the beginning of practice .
After some time , the mind can no longer play truant because it is always found out every time it wanders .
It therefore remains fixed on the object to which it is directed .
As rising occurs the mind makes a note of it , and thus the object and the mind coincide .
As falling occurs the mind makes a note of it , and thus the object and the mind coincide .
There is always a pair , the object and the mind which knows the object , at each time of noting .
These two elements of the material object and the knowing mind always arise in pairs , and apart from these two there does not exist any other thing in the form of a person or self .
This reality will be personally realized in due course .
The fact that materiality and mentality are two distinct , separate things will be clearly perceived during the time of noting " rising , falling . "
The two elements of materiality and mentality are linked up in pairs and their arising coincides , that is , the process of materiality in rising arises with the process of mentality which knows it .
The process of materiality in falling falls away together with the process of mentality which knows it .
It is the same for lifting , moving and placing : these are processes of materiality arising and falling away together with the processes of mentality which know them .
This knowledge in respect of matter and mind rising separately is known as nama - rupa - pariccheda - ñana , the discriminating knowledge of mentality - materiality .
It is the preliminary stage in the whole course of insight knowledge .
It is important to have this preliminary stage developed in a proper manner .
On continuing the practice of contemplation for some time , there will be considerable progress in mindfulness and concentration .
At this high level it will be perceptible that on every occasion of noting , each process arises and passes away at that very moment .
But , on the other hand , uninstructed people generally consider that the body and mind remain in a permanent state throughout life , that the same body of childhood has grown up into adulthood , that the same young mind has grown up into maturity , and that both body and mind are one and the same person .
In reality , this is not so .
Nothing is permanent .
Everything comes into existence for a moment and then passes away .
Nothing can remain even for the blink of an eye .
Changes are taking place very swiftly and they will be perceived in due course .
While carrying on the contemplation by noting " rising , falling " and so forth , one will perceive that these processes arise and pass away one after another in quick succession .
On perceiving that everything passes away at the very point of noting , a yogi knows that nothing is permanent .
This knowledge regarding the impermanent nature of things is aniccanupassana - ñana , the contemplative knowledge of impermanence .
A yogi then knows that this ever - changing state of things is distressing and is not to be desired .
This is dukkhanupassana - ñana , the contemplative knowledge of suffering .
On suffering many painful feelings , this body and mind complex is regarded as a mere heap of suffering .
This is also contemplative knowledge of suffering .
It is then perceived that the elements of materiality and mentality never follow one 's wish , but arise according to their own nature and conditioning .
While being engaged in the act of noting these processes , a yogi understands that these processes are not controllable and that they are neither a person nor a living entity nor self .
This is anattanupassana - ñana , the contemplative knowledge of non-self .
When a yogi has fully developed the knowledge of impermanence , suffering and non-self , he will realize Nibbana .
From time immemorial , Buddhas , Arahats and Ariyas ( noble ones ) have realized Nibbana by this method of vipassana .
It is the highway leading to Nibbana .
Vipassana consists of the four satipatthana , applications of mindfulness , and it is satipatthana which is really the highway to Nibbana .
Yogis who take up this course of training should bear in mind that they are on the highway which has been taken by Buddhas , Arahats and Ariyas .
This opportunity is afforded them apparently because of their parami , that is , their previous endeavors in seeking and wishing for it , and also because of their present mature conditions .
They should rejoice at heart for having this opportunity .
They should also feel assured that by walking on this highway without wavering they will gain personal experience of highly developed concentration and wisdom , as has already been known by Buddhas , Arahats and Ariyas .
They will develop such a pure state of concentration as has never been known before in the course of their lives and thus enjoy many innocent pleasures as a result of advanced concentration .
Impermanence , suffering and non-self will be realized through direct personal experience , and with the full development of these knowledges , Nibbana will be realized .
It will not take long to achieve the objective , possibly one month , or twenty days , or fifteen days , or , on rare occasions , even in seven days for those select few with extraordinary parami .
Yogis should therefore proceed with the practice of contemplation in great earnestness and with full confidence , trusting that it will surely lead to the development of the noble path and fruit and to the realization of Nibbana .
They will then be free from the wrong view of self and from spiritual doubt , and they will no longer be subject to the round of rebirth in the miserable realms of the hells , the animal world , and the sphere of petas .
May yogis meet with every success in their noble endeavor .
Ever play Gasing ?
Do n’t know what it is ?
Gasing is actually a very popular , traditional game in Malaysia but is known in many other places in the world as top - spinning .
The game was often played in the past by residents in the rural villages such as Kelantan and Melaka .
It was not just considerate a child ’s game as it is in other regions of the world , but it is believed that it would bring good luck and abundant harvest to the winners .
The game was mainly played right before the rice harvest season by both adults and children alike .
The objective of the game was simple , whoever keep the top spinning the longest would win .
The tradition of “ Gasing ” is becoming revitalized by the Malaysian government who are now organizing top - spinning competitions around the nation in various category ranging from primary school to the profesional clubs .
The competitions are usually being held at large shopping malls and popular open areas to attract tourists .
Traditional Gasing ( tops ) can be found in a variety of shapes and sizes .
There can be made of hard fruits or wood and can weigh anywhere from 100g ( 0.22 lb . ) and up to 5kg ( 11lb . ) .
Gasing comes with a string , which is tightly wound around a nail which is located at the base of the Gasing .
Some of the most popular shapes of Gasings , include plate - shaped , heart - shaped , flat - top , egg - shaped and berembang ( which is the shape of a popular fruit from a local , seaside tree ) .
The rules of the game are simple .
There are no fixed number of players and it may be played by either teams or by individuals .
The “ fighting ground ” is drawn onto a smooth surface in the shape of a circle .
The players then will hold the top in his hand and with the other , pull the string backward which will send the Gasing ( top ) into a spinning action .
The Gasing that spins the longest and stays within the specified circle will be the winner .
If a Gasing goes outside the circle bounds , the player loses the game .
Another version of the game , is sometimes called a “ striking match ” or “ Gasing Pangkah ” in Malay .
In this variation of the game the player who is able to knock their opponents Gasing ( top ) out of the circle first , will win the match .

WordPress is often thought of as little more than a blogging platform .
But it ’s capable of so much more .
Through a little customization and the use of plugins , WordPress can easily be transformed into a full - featured content management system .
Here are more than 25 sites who have done just that ( and done it well ) .
This is the second article in the three - part series , “ The Comprehensive Guide for a Powerful CMS using WordPress ” .

UGSMAG is a Canadian hip hop magazine .
The home page is laid out in a grid , with featured articles along the left two columns and news on the right .
The color scheme and design choices reflect the young , independent audience they attract .
The lack of a category list ( other than the top nav , which simply lists “ News , ” “ Features , ” and “ Interviews ” ) and archives lend the page to looking more like a traditional news or magazine website than a blog .
Subtle changes to individual article pages , such as removing the category labels , the use of a drop cap initial character , and moving the date from it ’s usual blog - centric location under the title to the upper - right hand corner of the page all also contribute to the site looking more like a magazine and less like your standard blog .
The Weather Pops are a group of weather - related characters available for licensing .
The site is simple and straightforward , and an excellent example of how WordPress can be used to build a simple yet powerful website .
The pages included on the site offer great examples of how you can incorporate a gallery , contact form , and standard pages into a WP site .
The integration of plugins , such as the NextGEN Gallery plugin used on the gallery page , further improves the functionality of the site .
Unless you looked at the code of the site , it ’s unlikely anyone would have any idea this site was built using WP .
The Temple Bar TradFest is an Irish music and culture festival held each year .
The home page of this site bears absolutely no resemblance to a blog .
The same can be said for internal pages , too .
Individual pages within the site have no date or timestamp , no category or other tags , and otherwise look nothing like a traditional blog post .
Good use of plugins for the gallery and other pages further improves the functionality of this WP installation .
This is another site where your average visitor would have no clue it was built on WP unless they checked the source code .
Table
Talk is an online store selling dining furniture , tableware , and similar products .
The home page features a product gallery with rotating images and the product pages show products laid out in a grid format .
The site was built using the WP e-Commerce plugin for the online store functionality .
E- commerce plugins greatly increase WP ’s ability to be used as a CMS for virtually any kind of site .
Pages within the Table Talk site are set up without comments , date and time stamps , and categories .
Categories are used for products , instead .
TPs is a teepee rental company serving Sussex and South East England .
This site is actually a great example of using WordPress as a CMS .
In addition to the standard pages found on most business sites ( news , information , about us , etc. ) , there ’s also a really great gallery page that uses the Lightbox formatting for viewing larger images and the option to view images in a slideshow .
The layout of the events page is also an excellent example of how pages can be thoroughly customized within WP to suit the needs of the individual site .
The Art of Catalin Bridinel is your basic portfolio site .
This site is a bit more blog - ish than most of the others here , but still offers up a good example of how to use WordPress for something other than your traditional blog .
Paintings are listed in blog posts , with a large image appearing immediately under the title and a brief description under that .
Comments are enabled here , unlike on many other CMS sites .
The overall design , lack of sidebars , and other stylistic elements make this look more like a traditional portfolio site than a blog .
Search Inside Video is a service that provides searchable transcripts for online video content .
Their site is one of the more innovative uses of WordPress as a CMS that I ’ve seen .
The overall site design is very simple , basically consisting of one long page with anchor tags for different content .
Not exactly a revolutionary idea .
But the implementation of it is very slick .
It ’s a great example of thinking outside the box in using WP as a CMS .
P2P Rescue is a non-profit organization working to help Sri Lanka and other Southeast Asian countries .
The home page offers up basic information and articles about the organization and their cause .
The overall site architecture is very simple , but again , bears little resemblance to a regular WP blog .
Use of plugins for allowing donations to be made through PayPal further increases WP ’s base functionality .
The site also includes an online store powered by WP e-Commerce .
Other pages include basic information about the organization and a blog ( under the “ Voices ” section ) .
Myshli is the portfolio of Danil Kryvoruchko .
The home page of the site offers a gallery of designs , including a JavaScript slideshow of selected works .
Individual pages on the site include galleries for each different type of work they do ( web , print , etc. ) along with an about page .
Pages for individual projects show a variety of screenshots and images .
The site also includes a blog with a different theme from the rest of the site ( the main site has a black background whereas the blog has a white background ) .
Little
White lies is a website that revolves around movies .
The home page is not unlike many other news and magazine websites , offering up links to current content , including interviews and reviews of upcoming and recently released films .
Category pages ( such as for interviews or reviews ) use a different layout than the home page , though it does make them feel a bit more blog - like .
The article pages have stripped out the majority of blog - centric features , but have left in the comments section ( many newspapers and magazines have added comment functionality to their articles both in and outside of blogs ) .
The shop section on the blog appears to be the only section not powered by WordPress .
Why this is is unclear , as there are some great plugins for e-commerce on WP .
KMX Karts are manufacturers of recumbent trikes .
The home page bears no resemblance to a blog , with the exception of the presence of a somewhat blog - like footer .
The site includes a number of different kinds of page templates .
There are pages for the different Kart models , pages for accessories , and pages for general company information .
Each type of page , because they have their own unique functions , is slightly different from the other pages .
The theme , though , is consistent throughout the site .
The e-commerce aspects of the site are powered by the Shopp plugin .
IconDock sells stock icons to designers .
This is one of the prettiest sites I ’ve seen using WP as a CMS .
The home page is simple while still offering up plenty of content and some icons for sale right on the home page .
Navigation is easy , with top nav and links placed within the content ( such as the “ Browse Icon Library ” in the main image on the home page ) .
The e-commerce portion of the site is powered by the WP e-Commerce plugin .
The product pages offer up plenty of information about individual icon sets as well as different pricing options .
One of the coolest features on this site , though , is the drag - and - drop shopping cart ( just drag an icon or set to the box on the left - hand side of the screen to add it to your cart ) .
The box on the side shows your cart ’s contents and removing an item is as simple as clicking the “ x ” in the corner .
It ’s definitely one of the slicker shopping cart UIs I ’ve seen .
Ginger is a restaurant in South Africa .
The overall site design and architecture are very simple while also being very attractive .
The home page offers up basic information , including their hours and phone number .
Other pages include more information about the restaurant , an online menu , and a gallery of the restaurant and their food .
The gallery uses the JavaScript Thickbox functionality for displaying photos .
There ’s also a slideshow in the header of their offerings .
A couple of features that really set this site apart from similar sites , though , are their addition of links to their Facebook page and a page that lets you tell friends about Ginger .
This kind of functionality is rarely seen on local business sites but should be utilized more often .
Fraai Magazine is a free online magazine offering up creative inspiration .
The site uses a the FLV Embed plugin to embed the Flash magazine into the site .

Pragmatic arguments have often been employed in support of theistic belief .
Theistic pragmatic arguments are not arguments for the proposition that God exists ; they are arguments that believing that God exists is rational .
The most famous theistic pragmatic argument is Pascal ’s Wager .
Though we touch on this argument briefly below , this entry focuses primarily on the theistic pragmatic arguments found in William James , J.S. Mill , and James Beattie .
It also explores the logic of pragmatic arguments in general , and the pragmatic use of moral arguments in particular .
Finally , this entry looks at an important objection to the employment of pragmatic arguments in belief formation — the objection that evidence alone should regulate belief .
As with so much in philosophy , the first recorded employment of a pragmatic argument is found in Plato .
At Meno 86b-c , Socrates tells
Meno that believing in the value of inquiry is justified because of the positive impact upon one ’s character :
Meno : Somehow or other I believe you are right .
Socrates : I think I am .
I should n’t like to take my oath on the whole story , but one thing I am ready to fight for as long as I can , in word and act — that is , that we shall be better , braver , and more active men if we believe it right to look for what we do n’t know than if we believe there is no point in looking because what we do n’t know we can never discover .
Meno :
There too I am sure you are . [ 1 ]
Paraphrased , Socrates ’ point is if being better , braver , and more active are among our desires , and if believing that inquiry is permissible facilitates our becoming better , braver , and more active , then we have reason , pragmatic reason , to believe that inquiry is permissible .
Socrates ’ argument is an argument for the permissibility of a certain belief , based on the benefits of believing that certain belief .
Pragmatic arguments are practical in orientation , justifying actions that are thought to facilitate the achievement of our goals , or the satisfaction of our desires .
If among your goals is A , and if doing such and such results in your achieving A , then , all else being equal , you have reason to do such and such :
Doing α brings about , or contributes in bringing about , β , and It is in your interest that β obtain .
So , you have reason to do α .
As presented this is a particular kind of pragmatic argument , a prudential argument .
Prudential pragmatic arguments are predicated upon one ’s preferences or goals or self - interest .
As we will see , there are pragmatic arguments that are not narrowly prudential but are moral in nature .
Pragmatic arguments are relevant to belief - formation , since inculcating a belief is an action .
There are , broadly speaking , two kinds of pragmatic arguments that have to do with belief - formation .
The first is an argument that recommends taking steps to believe a proposition because , if it should turn out to be true , the benefits gained from believing that proposition will be impressive .
This first kind of pragmatic argument we can call a “ truth - dependent ” pragmatic argument , or more conveniently a “ dependent - argument , ” since the benefits are obtained only if the relevant state of affairs occurs .
The prime example of a dependent - argument is a pragmatic argument that uses a calculation of expected utility and employs the Expectation Rule to recommend belief :
whenever both probability and utility values are known , one should choose to do an act which has the greatest expected utility .
Among the various versions of his wager argument , Pascal employs this Rule in a version which states that no matter how small the probability that God exists , as long as it is a positive , non-zero probability , the expected utility of theistic belief will dominate the expected utility of disbelief .
Given the distinction between ( A ) having reason to think a certain proposition is true , and ( B ) having reason to induce belief in that proposition , taking steps to generate belief in a certain proposition may be the rational thing to do , even if that proposition lacks sufficient evidential support .
The benefits of believing a proposition can rationally take precedence over the evidential strength enjoyed by a contrary proposition ; and so , given an infinite expected utility , Pascal ’s Wager contends that forming the belief that God exists is the rational thing to do , no matter how small the likelihood that God exists .
The second kind of pragmatic argument , which can be called a “ truth - independent ” pragmatic argument , or more conveniently , an “ independent - argument , ” is one which recommends taking steps to believe a certain proposition simply because of the benefits gained by believing it , whether or not the believed proposition is true .
This is an argument that recommends belief cultivation because of the psychological , or moral , or religious , or social , or even the prudential benefits gained by virtue of believing it .
In David Hume ’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion , for example , Cleanthes employs an independent argument , “ religion , however corrupted , is still better than no religion at all .
The doctrine of a future state is so strong and necessary a security to morals that we never ought to abandon or neglect it ” ( Hume 1776 , 87 ) .
Perhaps the best - known example of an independent - argument is found in William James ’s celebrated “ Will to Believe ” essay in which he argues that , in certain circumstances , it is rationally and morally permissible to believe a proposition because of the benefits thereby generated .
[ 2 ]
Unlike independent pragmatic arguments , dependent ones are , in an important sense , truth - sensitive .
Of course , being pragmatic arguments , dependent - arguments are not truth - sensitive in an evidential sense ; nevertheless they are dependent on truth since the benefits are had only if the recommended belief is true .
In contrast , independent pragmatic arguments , yielding benefits whether or not the recommended beliefs are true , are insensitive to truth .
Independent - arguments , we might say , are belief - dependent and not truth - dependent .
Pragmatic arguments in support of theistic belief can either be predicated on prudence or on morality .
By pragmatic arguments predicated on morality I mean arguments that contend that morality , or some proper part of morality , presupposes , or is facilitated by theistic belief .
And if morality , or the proper part of morality , is rational , then so too is theistic belief .
Put generally : [ 3 ]
Doing α helps to bring about β , and It is morally desirable that β.
So ,
It is prima facie morally desirable to do α .
Since ( 4 ) specifies actions , we should understand accepting theistic propositions as actions , even if believing is not an action ( for more on the distinction between acceptance and belief , see the section , “ Pragmatic Arguments and Belief , ” below ) .
It is important to recognize the distinction between theoretical moral arguments for theism ( arguments intended to show that God exists ) , and pragmatic moral arguments for the rationality of theistic belief .
George Mavrodes , for instance , constructs a theoretical moral argument by contending that it would be extremely odd that we would have moral obligations the fulfillment of which results in a net loss to the agent .
Such a world seems absurd ( Mavrodes , 1986 ) .
His argument is built upon the idea of a Russellian world , a universe in which mental events are products of non-mental events , and in which there ’s no human post - mortem survival , and extinction is the final end of every biological species .
A Russellian world implies atheism .
Summarized , Mavrodes ’ argument is that there are real moral obligations in the actual world .
But , real moral obligations would be absurd in a Russellian world , since fulfilling moral obligations often cause a net loss to the moral agent and there is no deep explanation of real moral obligation in a Russellian world ( the deep features of a Russellian world would be things like forces and atoms and chance ) .
But , fulfilling moral obligation is not absurd .
So , in this respect , there is reason to think that the actual world is not a Russellian world .
Two examples of pragmatic moral arguments are Adams ( 1979 ) and Zagzebski ( 1987 ) .
Adams builds his argument on the concept of demoralization — weakening of moral motivation — and the concept of a moral order — roughly , the idea that to achieve a balance of good over evil in the universe requires something more than human effort , yet human effort can add or detract from the total value of the universe .
While we cannot do it all on our own , the idea is , we can make a significant difference for better or worse .
In short , Adam ’s argument is that it is demoralizing not to believe that there is a moral order in the universe , and demoralization is morally undesirable .
So , there is moral advantage in accepting that there is a moral order , and theism provides the best account of why that is .
Hence , there ’s moral advantage in accepting theism .
Zagzebski builds her argument upon the ideas of moral skepticism and moral efficacy , and , though she does not employ the term , moral order .
Morality is efficacious if we can make significant contributions to the production of good in the universe and to the elimination of evil .
Moral skepticism is a doubting of our ability to acquire moral knowledge , and a doubting of moral efficacy .
Zagzebski argues that it is rational to try to be moral only if it is rational to believe that the probability that the attempt will succeed and will produce a great good is not outweighed by the probability that one will have to sacrifice goods in the course of the attempt .
But given what we know of human abilities and history , it is not rational to believe that the attempt to be moral is likely to succeed if there is no moral order .
Since it is rational to try to be moral , it is rational to believe that there is moral order in the universe , and Christian doctrine is , in part , an account of there being a moral order in the universe .
So , accepting Christian theism is more rational than accepting that there ’s no moral order in the universe .
Theistic moral pragmatic arguments may face an objection similar to the many - gods objection to Pascal ’s wager .
The many - gods objection contends that the betting options of the wager are not limited to Christianity and atheism alone , since one could formulate a Pascalian Wager for Islam , certain sects of Buddhism , or for any of the competing sects found within Christianity itself . [ 4 ]
A similar problem arises for theistic moral pragmatic arguments , at least insofar as those arguments are intended to provide strong support for theistic belief .
Let ’s say that a pragmatic argument provides strong support for theism just in case it provides reason for thinking that theism alone provides the benefit ; and let ’s say that a pragmatic argument provides weak support for theism just in case it provides reason for thinking that theism is just one of several alternatives in providing the benefit .
Pascal ’s Wager , for instance , is intended to provide strong support for theism ; while James ’s Will to Believe argument is intended to provide weak support .
Pragmatic moral arguments , if they are to provide strong support for theism , must provide reason to think that theistic belief alone is necessary for morality , or that theistic belief best facilitates moral practice .
But it ’s far from clear that theistic belief exceeds its competitors in facilitating moral practice .
Until reason for thinking that is forthcoming , it would be premature to hold that theistic moral pragmatic arguments provide strong support .
The argument presented by William James ( 1842–1910 ) in his 1896 essay , “ The Will to Believe ” , extends far beyond the issue of the rationality of theistic belief to include various philosophical issues ( for instance , whether to embrace determinism or indeterminism ) , and even matters of practical life .
James ’s argument , in its attack on the agnostic imperative ( withhold belief whenever the evidence is insufficient ) , makes the general epistemological point that :
a rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent me from acknowledging certain kinds of truth if those kinds of truth were really there , would be an irrational rule .
( James 1896 , 28 )
We might understand the agnostic imperative more fully as follows :
for all persons S and propositions p , if S believes that p is just as likely as not -p , then it is impermissible for S to believe either p or not -p .
If James is correct , then the agnostic imperative is false .
The foil of James ’s essay was W.K. Clifford ( 1845–79 ) .
Clifford argued that :
… if I let myself believe anything on insufficient evidence , there may be no great harm done by the mere belief ; it may be true after all , or I may never have occasion to exhibit it in outward acts .
But I cannot help doing this great wrong towards Man , that I make myself credulous .
The danger to society is not merely that it should believe wrong things , though that is great enough ; but that it should become credulous , and lose the habit of testing things and inquiring into them ; for then it must sink back into savagery .
( Clifford 1879 , 185–6 )
Clifford presented evidentialism as a rule of morality : “ it is wrong always , everywhere , and for any one , to believe anything upon insufficient evidence ” ( Clifford 1879 , 186 ) .
If Clifford ’s Rule of morality is correct , then any one who believes a proposition that she does not take to be more likely than not , is , thereby , immoral .
It may be worthwhile to note that Clifford ’s argument here is itself a moral pragmatic argument .
James has two main concerns in the “ Will To Believe ” essay .
The first is to argue that Clifford ’s Rule is irrational ( James 1896 : 28 ) .
The second is that a theistic commitment is permissible .
James contends that Clifford ’s Rule is but one intellectual strategy open to us .
A proponent of Clifford ’s Rule advises , in effect , that one should avoid error at all costs , and thereby risk the loss of certain truths .
But another strategy is to seek truth by any means available , even at the risk of error .
James champions the latter via the main argument of the “ Will to Believe ” essay .
To facilitate matters eight definitions employed by James are paraphrased :
Hypothesis : something that may be believed .
Option : a decision between two hypotheses .
Living option : a decision between two live hypotheses .
Live hypothesis : something that is a real candidate for belief .
A hypothesis is live , we might say , for a person just in case that person lacks compelling evidence disconfirming that hypothesis , and the hypothesis has an intuitive appeal for that person .
Momentous option : the option may never again present itself , or the decision cannot be easily reversed , or something of importance hangs on the choice .
It is not a trivial matter .
Forced option : the decision cannot be avoided .
Genuine option : one that ’s living , momentous , and forced .
Intellectually open : neither the evidence nor arguments conclusively decide the issue .
The first main argument might be sketched as follows :
Two alternative intellectual strategies are available : Strategy A : Risk a loss of truth and a loss of a vital good for the certainty of avoiding error .
Strategy B : Risk error for a chance at truth and a vital good .
Clifford ’s Rule embodies Strategy A. But , Strategy B is preferable to Strategy A because Strategy A would deny us access to certain possible kinds of truth .
And ,
Any intellectual strategy that denies access to possible truths is an inadequate strategy .
Therefore , Clifford ’s Rule is unacceptable .
James asserts that “ there are …cases where a fact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming ” ( James 1896 , 25 ) .
Among other examples James provides of this particular kind of truth is that of social cooperation :
a social organism of any sort whatever , large or small , is what it is because each member proceeds to his own duty with a trust that the other members will simultaneously do theirs .
Wherever a desired result is achieved by the co-operation of many independent persons , its existence as a fact is a pure consequence of the precursive faith in one another of those immediately concerned .
( James 1896 , 24 )
And if James is right that there is a kind of proposition that has as a truth - maker its being believed , what we might call “ dependent truths , ” then proposition ( 9 ) looks well supported .
Of course , accepting proposition ( 11 ) , and advancing an alternative strategy of seeking truth by any available means , even at the risk of error , does not entail that anything goes .
And an important part of James ’s essay restricts what legitimately might be believed in the absence of adequate evidence .
Among the requirements suggested by James the most important is :
Only genuine options that are intellectually open are decidable on passional grounds .
James is not arguing against conforming one ’s belief to the evidence , whenever there ’s a preponderance of evidence .
Nor is he arguing against the importance of evidence .
His is an argument contra the prohibition of believing whenever the evidence is silent , a prohibition implied by Clifford ’s Rule .
The requirement that an option is intellectually open may be redundant .
If the evidence were compelling , or even strongly supportive of , say , hypothesis a , and you recognized this , it may be that you would find only a alive .
Since you ’re aware that the evidence strongly supports it , you would not find not - a living .
In other words , to say that an option is living may imply that it is intellectually open .
Nonetheless , let ’s proceed as if aliveness and openness are logically distinct notions .
Additionally , we might ask whether the property of intellectual openness is to be understood as the evidence is lacking , or as the evidence is in principle lacking .
That is , is an option intellectually open when the evidence is indeterminate , or when it is essentially indeterminate ?
James ’s argument requires only the former .
The lack of adequate evidence is sufficient to render an option intellectually open .
If more evidence appears so that one hypothesis is supported by a preponderance of the evidence , then a commitment to abide by the evidence is triggered .
The relevance of all of this to theistic belief , according to James , is that :
Religion says essentially two things .
… the best things are the more eternal things , the overlapping things , the things in the universe that throw the last stone , so to speak , and say the final word … .
The second affirmation of religion is that we are better off even now if we believe [ religion ’s ] first affirmation to be true …
The more perfect and more eternal aspect of the universe is represented in our religions as having personal form .
The universe is no longer a mere
It to us , but a Thou… .
We feel , too , as if the appeal of religion to us were made to our own active good - will , as if evidence might be forever withheld from us unless we met the hypothesis half - way .
( James 1896 , 25 –7 )
James asserts that there are two affirmations of religion .
By affirmation James means something like an abstract claim , devoid of much doctrinal content , and found in the major religions .
The first affirmation is that the best things are the more eternal things , while the second is that we are better off even now if we believe the first affirmation .
The first affirmation is particularly puzzling , since James does not assert that the best things are the eternal things ; he says that the best things are the more eternal things .
He explicates this affirmation with three metaphors and a slogan : “ the overlapping things , the things in the universe that throw the last stone , so to speak , and say the final word .
‘ Perfection is eternal , ’— this phrase of Charles Secrétan seems a good way of putting this first affirmation of religion ” ( James 1896 , 25 ) .
Two ideas are suggested by James ’s explication : sovereignty and perfection .
If we understand “ more eternal ” as a kind of necessity , or non-contingency , then perhaps the first affirmation may be understood as asserting that the best things are those things that cannot fail to be sovereign and perfect .
This interpretation resolves much of the first affirmation ’s puzzle .
The plurality though is still puzzling .
We can resolve this puzzle by recognizing that , although he does not explicitly call it a third affirmation , James asserts that “ the more perfect and more eternal aspect of the universe is represented in our religions as having personal form .
The universe is no longer a mere
It to us , but a Thou ” ( James 1896 , 26 ) .
If we take this as a third affirmation of religion ( perhaps at the risk a charge of theistic parochialism ) , the possibility that the more eternal things are plural is foreclosed .
Monotheism , in other words , and not polytheism is established by the third affirmation .
Taken together , then , the first and the third affirmations of religion suggest that the supreme good in the universe is the existence of a personal being that is essentially perfect and sovereign .
The second affirmation is that we are better off now by believing in the existence of this perfect being .
At least in part , we would be better off now by believing the first affirmation because by doing so the possibility of a relationship with this being is established .
According to James , just as one is not likely to make friends if one is aloof , likewise one is not likely to become acquainted with the perfect being , if there is such , if one seeks that acquaintance only after sufficient evidence has been gathered .
There are possible truths , James claims , belief of which is a necessary condition of obtaining evidence for them .
Let ’s call the class of propositions whose evidence is restricted to those who first believe “ restricted propositions . ”
Dependent propositions and restricted propositions are James ’s counterexamples to Clifford ’s Rule .
They are two examples of the kinds of truths that Clifford ’s Rule would keep one from acknowledging .
That is , Clifford ’s Rule is problematic because following it would preclude access to restricted propositions and dependent propositions .
The Cliffordian may be forever cut off from certain kinds of truth .
One might object that James has at best shown that theistic belief is momentous only if God exists .
If God does not exist , and , as a consequence , the vital good of eternal life does not obtain , then no vital good is at stake .
To answer this objection a Jamesian might focus on what James calls the second affirmation of religion — we are better off even now if we believe — and take that affirmation to include benefits that are available , via pro-belief , even if God does not exist .
In The Varieties of Religious Experience James suggests that religious belief produces certain psychological benefits :
A new zest which adds itself like a gift to life , and takes the form either of lyrical enchantment or of appeal to earnestness and heroism … .
An assurance of safety and a temper of peace , and , in relation to others , a preponderance of loving affections .
( James 1902 , 475 )
In any case , given that theism is intellectually open and that it ’s part of a genuine option , and given that there are vital goods attached to theistic belief , James says , the hope that it is true is a sufficient reason to believe .
In addition this objection is easily evaded if we revise the notion of a genuine option by removing the requirement that an option is genuine only if momentous , although James himself may have been loath to drop that requirement .
James ’s second main argument proceeds :
the decision whether to accept theism is a genuine option .
And , theism is intellectually open .
And , there are vital goods at stake in accepting theism .
And , no one is irrational or immoral in risking error for a chance at truth and a vital good .
So , one may accept theism .
With this argument , James seeks to support the second of his two primary concerns of his essay , that a religious commitment is permissible .
An objection commonly leveled against James ’s argument is that “ it constitutes an unrestricted license for wishful thinking … if our aim is to believe what is true , and not necessarily what we like , James ’s universal permissiveness will not help us ” ( Hick 1990 , 60 ) .
That is , hoping that a proposition is true is no reason to think that it is .
A Jamesian might contend that this objection is unfair .
As we have noted , James does not hold that the falsity of Clifford ’s Rule implies that anything goes .
Restricting the relevant permissibility class to propositions that are intellectually open and part of a genuine option provides ample protection against wishful thinking .
A more significant objection contends that James ’s argument fails “ to show that one can have a sufficient moral reason for self - inducing an epistemically unsupported belief ” ( Gale 1990 , 283 ) .
This objection contends that there is a weighty moral duty to proportion one ’s beliefs to the evidence , and that this duty flows from moral personhood — to be a morally responsible person requires that one have good reasons for each of one ’s beliefs .
But to believe an epistemically unsupported proposition is to violate this duty and is thus , in effect , a denial of one ’s own personhood .
[ 5 ]
Or think of it another way , as intellectual beings , we have the dual goal of maximizing our stock of ( significant ) true beliefs and minimizing our stock of false ones .
Clifford ’s
Rule derives its moral validity , one might contend , from that intellectual goal .
And from Clifford ’s Rule flows our duty to believe only those propositions that enjoy adequate evidential support .
James ’s argument would , if operative , thwart our intellectual goal by permitting us to violate Clifford ’s Rule .
Can a morally and intellectually responsible person ever have a moral duty to believe a proposition that lacks adequate evidence , a duty that outweighs the alleged Cliffordian duty of believing only those propositions that enjoy adequate support ?
To answer this , let ’s employ what we might call the “ ET ” thought experiment .
Suppose Clifford is abducted by very powerful and very smart extraterrestrials , which offer him a single chance of salvation for humankind — that he acquire and maintain belief in a proposition that lacks adequate evidential support , otherwise the destruction of humankind will result .
Clifford adroitly points out that no one can just will belief .
The ETs , devilish in their anticipation as well as their technology , provide Clifford with a supply of doxastic - producing pills , which when ingested produce the requisite belief for 24 hours .
It ’s obvious that Clifford would do no wrong by swallowing the pills and bringing about a belief lacking adequate evidential support . [ 6 ]
Moreover , since one is never irrational in doing one ’s moral duty , not only would Clifford not be immoral , he would not even be irrational in bringing about and maintaining belief in a proposition lacking adequate evidential support .
As we mentioned earlier , given the distinction between ( A ) having reason to think a certain proposition is true , and ( B ) having reason to induce a belief in that proposition , it may be that a particular proposition lacks sufficient evidential support , but that forming a belief in that proposition is the rational action to perform .
A very interesting objection to James ’s argument is that it falls prey to the very principle it invokes against Clifford :
James writes : “ A rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent me from acknowledging certain kinds of truth if those kinds of truth were really there would be an irrational rule ” .
This may sound like sweet reason itself , but a moment ’s reflection should convince us that it is nothing of the kind .
Any rule whatever that restricts belief in any way might conceivably shut us off from some truths .
( Wood 2002 , 24 )
According to James , Clifford ’s Rule is problematic because , if followed , it would preclude access to restricted propositions and dependent propositions .
According to this objection , this alleged flaw of Clifford ’s Rule is true of any epistemic principle .
Every epistemic principle that divides beliefs into those that are permissible and those that are not runs the risk of shutting off access to certain possible kinds of truth .
James ’s restriction of the permissible use of the passional nature only to when one faces a genuine option that ’s intellectually open is just as guilty of the alleged flaw as is Clifford ’s Rule .
But an alleged flaw found in every possibility is no flaw .
Hence , James ’s objection to Clifford fails .
This objection is interesting since it is in one sense true .
It ’s obvious that any rule that restricts belief in any way might shut us off from certain truths .
Still , while interesting , this objection is irrelevant .
James ’s argument is not predicated on the abstract proposition that “ any rule whatever that restricts belief in any way might conceivably shut us off from some truths . ”
It is predicated on the principle that there are dependent propositions , and there are restricted propositions .
His examples of social trust , and acquiring friends , and of social cooperation are intended to make that clear .
If theism were true , then it is very likely that there would be dependent propositions and restricted propositions in that realm as well .
Clifford ’s Rule would preclude access to any restricted or dependent proposition , whether religious or not .
James is not arguing against conforming one ’s belief to the evidence , whenever there ’s a preponderance of evidence .
He is arguing against the prohibition of believing whenever the evidence is silent .
Since James ’s argument specifies the irrationality of Clifford ’s Rule ’s exclusion of dependent and restricted propositions , and not just the abstract possibility of some kind of true belief or other being excluded , it escapes this objection .
William Wainwright has argued that James ’s argument properly fits within an old Christian tradition , which asserts that :
Mature religious belief can , and perhaps should , be based on evidence but … the evidence can be accurately assessed only by men and women who possess the proper moral and spiritual qualifications .
This view was once a Christian commonplace ; reason is capable of knowing God on the basis of evidence — but only when one ’s cognitive faculties are rightly disposed .
( Wainwright 1995 , 3 ) .
If Wainwright is correct , then James ’s argument is not just a pragmatic argument , but also an epistemic argument , since he is arguing that one of the pragmatic benefits is a more reliable access to reality ( see also the explication of James ’ argument via contemporary epistemic utility theory in Pettigrew 2016 ) .
So , the chasm between the epistemic and the pragmatic is not unbridgeable , since James ’s Will to Believe argument spans the gulf between the pragmatic and the epistemic .
Importantly , we should keep in mind that whatever else it is , James ’s argument is , at least in part , a pragmatic argument , and , moreover , James probably saw his argument as having a similar status as Pascal ’s Wager , since he offers a positive evaluation of the Wager , very often overlooked by commentators , “ Pascal ’s argument , instead of being powerless , then seems a regular clincher , and is the last stroke needed to make our faith … complete ” ( James 1896 , 11 ) .
The posthumous publication of Mill ’s Three Essays on Religion ( 1874 ) drew criticism from the faithful , but it also drew a surprising disappointment from those who expected the “ saint of rationalism ” to argue for agnosticism .
The cause of this consternation is found in the third of the three essays , “ Theism , ” a short work begun in 1868 and unfinished when Mill died in 1870 .
The faithful found “ Theism ” objectionable because of Mill ’s criticism of several of the standard arguments of natural theology .
The disappointment of the other side flowed from Mill ’s endorsement of a position that can be summed up by the principle that where probabilities fail , hope can properly flourish .
As Mill expressed this principle when discussing immortality , “ … to any one who feels it conducive either to his satisfaction or to his usefulness to hope for a future state as a possibility , there is no hindrance to his indulging that hope ” ( Mill 1874 , 210 ) .
Mill thought that belief in a creator of great but limited power was supported by the design argument , and one could certainly erect the superstructure of hope upon the base of a belief in a creator who would extend human existence beyond the grave :
Appearances point to the existence of a Being who has great power over us — all the power implied in the creation of the Kosmos , or of its organized beings at least — and of whose goodness we have evidence though not of its being his predominant attribute ; and as we do not know the limits either of his power or of his goodness , there is room to hope that both the one and the other may extend to granting us this gift provided that it would really be beneficial to us .
( Mill 1874 , 210 )
Since we do not know that granting postmortem existence to humans is beyond the capability of the creator , hope is possible .
As Mill puts it :
… in the regulation of the imagination literal truth of facts is not the only thing to be considered .
Truth is the province of reason , and it is by the cultivation of the rational faculty that provision is made for its being known always , and thought of as often as is required by duty and the circumstances of human life .
But when reason is strongly cultivated , the imagination may safely follow its own end , and do its best to make life pleasant and lovely …
On these principles it appears to me that the indulgence of hope with regard to the government of the universe and the destiny of man after death , while we recognize as a clear truth that we have no ground for more than a hope , is legitimate and philosophically defensible .
The beneficial effect of such a hope is far from trifling .
( Mill 1874 , 248–9 )
For our purposes the item of interest is Mill ’s claim that “ any one who feels it conducive either to his satisfaction or to his usefulness to hope for a future state as a possibility , there is no hindrance to his indulging that hope ” ( Mill 1874 , 210 ) .
Mill ’s license to hope is issued on pragmatic grounds : it is permissible to hope if and only if :
L1 .
For all one knows or justifiably believes , the object of one ’s hope could obtain ; and , L2 .
One believes that hoping contributes to one ’s own happiness , or to the well - being of others .
The second condition ( L2 ) is straightforwardly pragmatic and restricts hope to those who have goals either of personal happiness , or of contributing to the well - being of others .
Believing that hope will result in the increase of happiness or well - being is a necessary condition of permissible hope .
There ’s little doubt that Mill agreed with Clifford ’s Rule .
Mill was no subjectivist or fideist .
But hope and belief are not the same ; and the standards for the permissibility of the latter are considerably higher .
Mill thought that ( L1 ) and ( L2 ) were the relevant standards for permissible hope .
If one believes that Clifford ’s Rule should govern any and all propositional attitudes and not just belief , then it is easy to see why Mill ’s liberal treatment of hope would disappoint .
Mill held that one may hope that God exists , but one may not believe that God exists , as the evidence is lacking .
Suppose one agrees with Mill , that faith can subsist on hope , trust , or some other non-doxastic attitude other than belief .
Suppose further that one seeks to build a theistic commitment on hope .
The acceptance of theistic hope provides reason to act as if theism were true , not because one believes that it is true , but because one hopes that it is .
What is it to act as if theism is true ?
It is to put into practice behaviors characteristic of a particular religious tradition , such as Judaism , Christianity , or Islam .
Acting as if a certain religious tradition were true would include reorienting one ’s values , priorities , and life - projects in order to reflect a commitment to a particular tradition .
It would also involve engaging in the rituals and behaviors associated with the particular tradition ; and investing a significant portion of one ’s time and money in support of causes associated with the tradition .
A problem arises however .
Social psychology , with its theories of biased scanning , social - perception theory , and cognitive dissonance theory , advances the idea that behavior can alter , influence , and generate attitudes , including beliefs ( see Jordan 2016 ) .
By regularly engaging in behaviors and practices characteristic of a particular religious tradition , one engages in actions that tend to inculcate religious belief .
Belief is catching , as associating and imitating the faithful is an effective way of self - inducing the beliefs of the faithful .
Those who seek to replace belief with hope will find themselves taking steps to build a theistic commitment on hope , while holding that they ought to avoid theistic belief .
Yet , the very steps involved in fostering a commitment on hope – immersive role - playing as a theist , or acting as if theism were true – tend to generate theistic belief .
Those who habitually or chronically imitate the actions and rituals of theists find eventually that those are not just tasks they perform , but are at the heart of who they are and what they believe .
Yet , theistic belief is off - limits .
One would have to take steps that inoculate against the contagious theistic belief .
Yet , the reasons one has to build a theistic commitment on hope and not belief , would conflict with one ’s reasons to inoculate against catching belief .
One is pushed to act as if theism were true , yet pulled to act to ensure that one does not come to believe that it is .
Whatever commitment might emerge out of this dynamic is not likely one characteristic of a mature or wholeheartedly committed theist .
This problem of catching belief flows out of the fact that chronically acting as if something is true is an effective way of inculcating the belief that it is true .
Any non-doxastic account of faith put into regular practice , coupled with Clifford ’s Rule , is exposed to the problem of catching belief .
Religious Fictionalism , for example , which holds that faith that p does not require belief that p , has to deal with the problem .

In 1770 James Beattie ( 1735 –1803 ) published a long response to Hume entitled An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth , in Opposition to Sophistry and Scepticism .
The essay was a 300 page best seller , which , most commentators agree , was unfair in many respects to Hume .
As was his practice , Hume never made an effort to answer Beattie in public ; in correspondence , however , Hume referred to Beattie as that “ bigoted silly fellow . ” [ 7 ]
Despite the general weakness of many of his arguments Beattie does offer an interesting pragmatic moral objection to Hume ’s attack on religious belief :
… they perhaps have little need , and little relish , for the consolations of religion .
But let them know that , in the solitary scenes of life , there is many an honest and tender heart pining with incurable anguish , pierced with the sharpest sting of disappointment , bereft of friends , chilled with poverty , racked with disease , scourged by the oppressor ; whom nothing but trust in Providence , and the hope of a future retribution , could preserve from the agonies of despair .
And do they , with sacrilegious hands , attempt to violate this last refuge of the miserable , and to rob them of the only comfort that had survived the ravages of the misfortune , malice , and tyranny !
Did it ever happen , that the influence of their execrable tenets disturbed the tranquility of virtuous retirement , deepened the gloom of human distress , or aggravated the horrors of the grave ?
Is it possible that this may have happened in many instances ?
Is it probable that this hath happened , or may happen , in one single instance ?
— ye traitors to human kind , how can ye answer for it to your own hearts ?
( Beattie 1776 , 322–23 ) .
Beattie argues that Hume ’s clear cutting of the theistic forest in his attack on the credibility of miracle reports , his criticism of the design argument , and his attack on the cosmological argument resulted in a desolated landscape that does a serious disservice to humankind .
Since in some cases , Beattie contends , despair flows from the loss of faith .
And he assumes that no justifying good exists for Hume to risk causing despair .
Let ’s understand desolation as a profound sense of hopelessness and purposelessness .
Beattie believed that Christian belief provided consolation , especially to those suffering or oppressed .
His argument might be reconstructed as there exists a person S , such that :
Theistic belief provides the great good of consolation for S . And , S cannot receive a comparable good from any other source .
And ,
The deprivation of this good is a significant loss for S. So , Depriving S of the great good of theistic belief renders S significantly worse - off .
And ,
It is wrong to render someone worse - off without compensation .
And , Public atheistic attacks provide S with no sufficient compensation .
Therefore , Public atheistic attacks are wrong .
While Hume never directly responded to Beattie ’s Consolation Argument , Mill had it ( or something very much like it in mind ) when he wrote :
That what is called the consoling nature of an opinion , that is , the pleasure we should have in believing it to be true , can be a ground for believing it , is a doctrine irrational in itself and which would sanction half the mischievous illusions recorded in history or which mislead individual life .
( Mill 1874 , 204 )
This is an odd objection coming from one who argued in Utilitarianism “ actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness , wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness . ”
If the sole criterion of action is the production of happiness , and if forming a belief is an action , then it is hard to see what answer could be lodged against Beattie ’s Consolation Argument ( or at least some argument very much like it ) .
[ 8 ]
If happiness and consolation are irrelevant , and if Clifford ’s Rule that “ it is wrong always , everywhere , and for any one , to believe anything upon insufficient evidence ” is correct , then Beattie ’s consolation argument can be rejected as being itself an immoral subornation . [ 9 ]
An argument similar to Beattie ’s consolation argument is found in a suggestive passage of John Henry Newman ’s 1870 An Essay in Aid of A Grammar of Assent , famously known as the “ factory girl ” argument .
Newman ( 1801 –1890 ) did not formulate the “ factory girl ” argument as a pragmatic argument , but the argument certainly lends itself to such a formulation :
Montaigne was endowed with a good estate , health , leisure and an easy temper , literary tastes , and a sufficiency of books ; he could afford thus to play with life , and the abysses into which it leads us .
Let us take a case in contrast .
“ I think ” , says the poor dying factory - girl in the tale , “ if this should be the end of all , and if all I have been born for is just to work my heart and life away , and to sicken in this dree place , with those mill - stones in my ears forever , until I could scream out for them to stop and let me have a little piece of quiet , and with the fluff filling my lungs , until I thirst to death for one long deep breath of the clear air , and my mother gone , and I never able to tell her again how I loved her , and of all my troubles , — I think , if this life is the end , and that there is no God to wipe away all tears from all eyes , I could go mad ! ”
Here is an argument for the immortality of the soul ( Newman 1870 , 299–300 ) .
This argument lends itself easily to a pragmatic cast since it places great weight on the idea that certain human needs support the rational and moral legitimacy of religious belief :
We have existential needs – a need for a deep meaning in life , a need for hope , a need for cosmic security , a need for consolation from despair – which are necessary for our well - being .
And , Belief in God satisfies these existential needs .
So , Belief in God is overall justified .
This sort of argument faces many questions and issues that we cannot explore here .
Among these issues and questions are : suppose that one , morally and rationally , may satisfy a need , it does not follow that one can satisfy that need in any old way .
Some ways of satisfying a need are permissible while others are not .
Is belief in God a permissible way ?
Do humans in fact have the alleged needs ?
Is belief in God the only feasible way to satisfy those needs ?
See Williams 2011 for further discussion .
Clifford ’s Rule is a vivid presentation of an influential and long tradition in philosophy that carries the name of Evidentialism .
We can understand Evidentialism as the thesis that :
E . For all persons S and propositions p and times t , S ought to believe that p at t if and only if believing p fits S ’s evidence at t .
Clearly enough , pragmatic arguments run afoul of ( E ) , since pragmatic arguments are employed either when the evidence is inconclusive , or it is conclusively adverse .
Consider the latter case first .
Earlier it was mentioned that Pascal ’s Wager is the most famous example of a theistic pragmatic argument .
Pascal in fact has not one version of the Wager in his Pensées ( 1660 ) but four .
The third version of the Wager is what Ian Hacking ( 1972 ) entitles the “ Argument from Dominating Expectation , ” and it employs the Expectation rule .
We can represent it by letting p stand for a positive probability greater than zero and less than one - half , and letting EU stand for “ expected utility , ” and employing F2–F4 as finite values :
God exists
( p) ~( God exists )
( 1−p ) Believe p , ∞ 1 − p , F2 EU = ∞ ~ ( Believe ) p , F3 1 − p , F4 EU = finite value
No matter how unlikely it is that God exists , as long as there is some positive non-zero probability that he does , believing is one ’s best bet :
For any person S , and alternatives α and β available to S , if the expected utility of α exceeds that of β , S should choose α.
And , Believing in God carries more expected utility than does not believing .
Therefore ,
One should believe in God .
Because of its ingenious employment of infinite utility , the third version has become what most philosophers think of as Pascal ’s Wager .
The appeal of the third version for theistic apologists is its ready employment as a worst - case device .
Suppose there were a compelling argument for atheism .
With the third version the theist has an escape : it can still be rational to believe , even if the belief is itself unreasonable , since inculcating theistic belief is an action with an infinite expected utility .
This use as a worst - case device is something like a trump card that can be thrown down defeating what had appeared as a stronger hand .
Pascal ’s third version clearly violates ( E ) .
Now consider James ’s Will to Believe argument .
As we saw , James ’s contention is that any hypothesis that ’s part of a genuine option , and that ’s intellectually open , may be believed , even in the absence of sufficient evidence .
No rule of morality or rationality , James argues , is violated if one accepts a hypothesis that ’s genuine and open .
If James is correct , then ( E ) should be replaced with :
E′ .
For all persons S and propositions p and times t , if believing p fits S ’s evidence at t , then S ought to believe that p at t .
According to ( E′ ) if the evidence is adequate , then the question is settled .
If there ’s a preponderance of support for p , then one is required to believe p .
Where the evidence speaks , one must listen and obey .
( E′ ) differs from ( E ) in part since it says nothing about those occasions in which the evidence is silent , or is inadequate .
If one assigns p a probability of one - half , then there ’s not a preponderance of evidence in support of p. ( E′ ) says nothing about believing p in that case .
Principle ( E ) , on the other hand , forbids believing p in that case .
While a proponent of theistic pragmatic arguments cannot swear allegiance to ( E ) , she can , clearly enough , adhere to ( E′ ) .
Let ’s call ( E ) Strong Evidentialism , and ( E′ ) Weak Evidentialism .
So , an employer of theistic pragmatic arguments can conform to Weak Evidentialism , but not Strong Evidentialism .
Is there a good reason to prefer Weak Evidentialism to Strong ( in addition to James ’s argument ) ?
A promising argument in support of the moral and rational permissibility of employing pragmatic reasons in belief - formation is erected upon the base of what we might call the Duty Argument ( or perhaps more precisely , the Duty Argument scheme ) :
It is necessary that ( no one is ( overall ) irrational in doing what he ’s morally obligated to do ) .
And ,
It is possible that ( doing α is a moral obligation ) .
So ,
It is possible that ( doing α is ( overall ) rational ) .
The Duty Argument employs the box and diamond in the standard fashion as operators for , respectively , conceptual necessity and possibility .
The alpha is just a placeholder for actions , or kinds of actions .
The locution “ ( overall ) rational ” or “ ( overall ) irrational ” presupposes that there are various kinds of rationality , including moral rationality , epistemic rationality , and prudential rationality . [ 10 ]
The idea that there are various kinds of rationality , or put any way , that one can be under conflicting obligations at a particular time , recognizes that dilemmas are possible .
One can be obligated to do various things even when it ’s not possible to do all of them .
Overall rationality is the all - things - considered perspective .
It is what one ultimately should do , having taken into account the various obligations one is under at a particular time .
Overall rationality , or all - things - considered rationality ( ATC rationality ) , is , in W.D. Ross ’s terms , one ’s actual duty in the particular circumstances , even if one has other conflicting prima facie duties .
The Duty Argument can be formulated without presupposing that there are various kinds of rationality , by replacing the principle that no one is ever irrational in doing her moral duty , with the principle that moral obligations take precedence whenever a dilemma of obligations occurs .
In any case the Duty Argument assumes that if in doing something one is not ATC irrational , then it follows that one is ATC rational in doing it .
The relevance of the Duty Argument is this .
The action of forming and sustaining a belief upon pragmatic grounds can replace α.
That is , pragmatic belief formation could be one ’s moral duty .
Consider the following four cases in which pragmatic belief formation is , arguably , morally required :
Devious ETs : Suppose you are abducted by very powerful and advanced extraterrestrials , who demonstrate their intent and power to destroy the Earth .
Moreover , these fiendish ETs offer but one chance of salvation for humankind – you acquire and maintain a belief for which you lack adequate evidence .
You adroitly point out that you cannot just will such a belief , especially since you know of no good reason to think it true .
Devilish in their anticipation and in their technology , the ETs produce a device that can directly produce the requisite belief in willing subjects , a serum , say , or a supply of one - a - day doxastic - producing pills .
It is clear that you would do no wrong by swallowing a pill or injecting the serum , and , hence , bringing about and maintaining belief in a proposition for which you lack adequate evidence , done to save humankind .
Indeed , it is clear that you are in fact obligated to bring about the requisite belief , even though you lack adequate evidence for it .
Pain case : Jones knows that expecting an event to be painful is strongly correlated with an increase in the intensity of felt pain ( as opposed to having no expectation , or expecting the event to be relatively painless ) .
Jones is about to have a boil lanced , and believing that she is obligated to minimize pain , she forms the belief that the procedure will be painless .
She does so even though she lacks evidence that such procedures are in fact typically painless .
Because of her action , the event is in fact less painful than it would otherwise have been .
Small child :
Suppose you are the parent or custodian of a small child , who has been hurt .
You know that studies support the thesis that the felt pain reported by patients is typically higher in cases in which the patient expected the event to be painful than in cases where the patient did not have that expectation .
You have no idea about the relative pain associated with a particular medical procedure that the child is about undergo .
The child asks you if the procedure will be painful .
Desiring to lower the pain the child will feel , you tell the child that the procedure will not hurt , hoping that the child will form a belief not supported by the evidence , but thereby lowering the child ’s felt pain .
Doctor case : Dr. Jones knows that the prognosis for Smith ’s recovery is poor , but if she acts on that knowledge by telling Smith of his poor prognosis , she may well strip Smith of hope .
Jones believes that maintaining hope is vital for quality of life .
Overall , Jones decides it is better not to inform Smith just how poor the prognosis is and she does not disabuse Smith of her evidentially unsupported belief .
These four cases provide possible scenarios in which pragmatic belief formation , or suborning pragmatic belief formation in others , is morally required .
Although controversial , the Duty Argument , if sound , would provide good reason for thinking that there are occasions in which it is permissible , both rationally and morally , to form beliefs based upon pragmatic reasons even in the absence of adequate evidence .
If the Duty Argument is sound , then ( E ) is false .
The Duty Argument presupposes that there are various kinds of rationality .
Many Evidentialists , as well as many opponents of Evidentialism , also assume that there are various kinds of rationality .
What if however there is only one kind or standard of rationality ?
What impact would that have on the debate ?
Susanna Rinard argues that it is best to reject the idea that there are various kinds or standards of rationality , and replace that idea with an equal treatment idea that all states – whether doxastic or not – face a single standard of rationality ( Rinard 2017 ) .
Equal treatment of states – states like carrying an umbrella , or walking the dog , or voting for this candidate over that , or forming a belief in God – provides greater theoretical simplicity than does the idea that there are various standards or kinds of rationality .
Equal Treatment also better explains the methodological attraction of simplicity in science than does the idea that there are various kinds of rationality , Rinard argues .
If the equal treatment of all states idea is correct , then doxastic states would face the same standard of rationality as states of action .
The Equal Treatment idea provides an additional objection to Evidentialism insofar as Evidentialism implies that beliefs are subject to one standard , while other states are subject to another standard .
Whether it is via Rinard ’s Equal Treatment argument , or the Duty Argument , there is , arguably , good reason to reject Evidentialism .
The idea that persons can voluntarily and directly choose what to believe is called “ Doxastic Voluntarism ” .
According to Doxastic Voluntarism , believing is a direct act of the will , with many of the propositions we believe under our immediate control .
A basic action is an action that a person intentionally does , without doing any other action .
Jones ’ moving of her finger is a basic action , since she need not perform any other action to accomplish it .
Her handing the book from Smith to Brown is not basic , since she must intentionally do several things to accomplish it .
According to Doxastic Voluntarism , some of our belief acquisitions are basic actions .
We can will , directly and voluntarily , what to believe and the beliefs thereby acquired are freely obtained and are not forced upon us .
In short , one can believe at will .
The proponent of Doxastic Voluntarism need not hold that every proposition is a candidate for direct acquisition , as long as she holds that there are some propositions belief in which is under our direct control .
It is widely thought that Doxastic Voluntarism is implausible .
Opponents of Doxastic Voluntarism can present a simple experiment against it : survey various propositions that you do not currently believe , and see if any lend themselves , directly and immediately , by a basic act of the will , to belief .
Certainly there are some beliefs that one can easily cause oneself to have .
Consider the proposition that I am now holding a pencil .
I can cause myself to believe that by simply picking up a pencil .
Or more generally , any proposition about my own basic actions I can easily enough believe by performing the action .
But my coming to believe is by means of some other basic action .
Since I lack direct control over what I believe , and there ’s no reason to think that my lacking in this regard is singular , Doxastic Voluntarism is implausible .
Does the implausibility of Doxastic Voluntarism show that pragmatic belief - formation is also implausible ?
Not at all : think of Pascal ’s advice to act as if one already believes ( by going to masses and by imitating the faithful ) as a way of inculcating belief .
Pragmatic belief - formation neither entails nor presupposes Doxastic Voluntarism .
As long as there is indirect control , or roundabout control , over the acquisition and maintenance of beliefs , pragmatic belief - formation is possible .
What constitutes indirect control over the acquisition of beliefs ?
Consider actions such as entertaining a proposition , or ignoring a proposition , or critically inquiring into the plausibility of this idea or that , or accepting a proposition .
Each of these involves a propositional attitude , the adoption of which is under our direct control .
Indirect control occurs since accepting a proposition , say , or acting as if a proposition were true , very often results in believing that proposition .
Insofar as there is a causal connection between the propositional attitudes we adopt , and the beliefs that are thereby generated , we can be said to have exercised indirect , or roundabout , control over belief - formation .
One objection to the foregoing is that pragmatic arguments are , by and large , pointless because beliefs are , by their very nature , psychological states that aim for truth .
That is , whenever one believes a proposition , one is disposed to feel that that proposition is probably the case .
A person ordinarily cannot believe a proposition that she takes to have a probability of less than one - half or whose probability is uncertain since such propositional attitudes do not aim for truth .
The upshot of this objection is that strong evidentialism is unavoidable .
If it is true , as this objection holds , that believing a proposition ordinarily involves being disposed to feel that the proposition is the case then it does appear at first blush that pragmatic belief - formation , as such , is ineffectual .
But all that follows from this fact , if such it be , is that some sort of belief - inducing technology will be necessary in order to facilitate the acquisition of a proposition that is pragmatically supported .
Now it is true that the most readily available belief - inducing technologies – selectively using the evidence for instance – all involve a degree of self - deception , since one ordinarily cannot attend only to the favorable evidence in support of a particular proposition while neglecting the adverse evidence arrayed against it and , being conscious of all this , expect that one will acquire that belief .
The fact that self - deception is a vital feature of the readily available belief - formation technologies leads to another objection .
This second objection is that willfully engaging in self - deception renders pragmatic belief - formation morally problematic and rationally suspect , since willfully engaging in self - deception is the deliberate worsening of one ’s epistemic situation .
It is morally and rationally problematic to engage in pragmatic belief - formation , insofar as belief - formation involves self - deception .
This second objection is powerful if sound , but we must be careful here .
First , while self - deception may be a serious problem with regard to inculcating a belief which one takes to be false , it does not seem to be a serious threat involving the inculcation of a belief which one thinks has as much evidence in its favor as against it , nor does it seem to be a threat when one takes the probability of the proposition to be indeterminate , since one could form the belief knowing full well the evidential situation .
Even if it is true that believing that p is being disposed to feel that p is the case , it does not follow that believing that p involves being disposed to feel that p is the case based on the evidence at hand .
Second , this is an objection not to pragmatic belief - formation per se , but an objection to pragmatic belief - formation that involves self - deception .
Although it may be true that the employment of self - deceptive belief - inducing technologies is morally and rationally problematic , this objection says nothing about those belief - inducing technologies that do not involve self - deception .
If there are belief - inducing technologies which are free of self - deception and which could generate a belief on the basis of a pragmatic reason , then this objection fails . [ 11 ]
Is there a belief - inducing technology available that does not involve self - deception ?
There is .
Notice first there are two sorts of belief - inducing technologies distinguishable : “ low - tech ” technologies and “ high - tech ” ones .
Low - tech technologies consist of propositional attitudes only , while high - tech ones employ nonpropositional techniques along with various propositional attitudes .
The nonpropositional techniques could include actions like acting as if a certain proposition were true , and morally questionable ones like hypnosis , or indoctrination , or subliminal suggestion .
Consider a technology consisting of two components , the first of which is the acceptance of a proposition , while the second is a behavioral regimen of acting on that acceptance .
Accepting a proposition , unlike believing , is an action that is characterized , in part , by one ’s assenting to the proposition , whether one believes it or not .
One accepts a proposition , when she assents to its truth and employs it as a premise in her deliberations .
One can accept a proposition that one does not believe .
Indeed , we do this much of the time .
For example , think of the gambler ’s fallacy .
One might be disposed to believe that the next toss of the fair coin must come up Tails , since it has been Heads on the previous seven tosses .
Nevertheless , one ought not to accept that the next toss of a fair coin must come up Tails , or that the probability that it will is greater than one - half .
Acceptance , we should remember , unlike believing , is an action that is under our direct control .
If one accepts a proposition , then one can also act upon the proposition .
Acting upon a proposition is behaving as though it were true .
The two - step regimen of accepting a proposition and then acting upon it is a common way of generating belief in that proposition .
And , importantly , there is no hint of self - deception tainting the process .
One might object that employing a belief - inducing technology at all , whether low or high tech , is enough to entangle one in issues implicating the rationality of the belief induced ( see , for instance , Garber , 2009 ) .
A friend of the pragmatic , however , might argue that that this objection presupposes Strong Evidentialism , and arguments found in William James , the Duty argument , the Equal Treatment argument , have already provided a dispositive ruling on that issue .
While not as common as theistic arguments , there have been atheistic pragmatic arguments offered from time to time .
These arguments often arise within the context of a purported naturalistic explanation of the occurrence of religious belief and practice .
Perhaps the earliest proponent of an atheistic pragmatic argument was David Hume ( 1711 –1776 ) .
In chapter X of his 1757 The Natural History of Religion , Hume wrote :
Where the deity is presented as infinitely superior to mankind , this belief ... is apt , when joined with superstitious terrors , to sink the human mind into the lowest submission and abasement …
The idea of Hume ’s argument here and elsewhere in his writings ( see for instance Dialogue XII of his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion , and appendix IV of the second Enquiry ) is that theism , or at least theism of the popular sort — that conjoined with “ superstitious terrors , ” degrades individual morality , thereby devaluing human existence .
Theistic belief , Hume contended , inculcates the “ monkish virtues of mortification , penance , humility , and passive suffering , as the only qualities which are acceptable … ”
But not only does theistic belief harm individual morality , according to Hume , it also harms public morality .
In chapter IX , Hume suggested that theism ( again he qualifies by writing of the “ corruptions of theism ” ) leads to intolerance and persecution .
Another atheistic pragmatic argument is that of Sigmund Freud ( 1856–1939 ) , who in The Future of an Illusion ( 1927 ) contends that religious belief perpetuates psychological immaturity among individuals , and cultural immaturity on the social level .
To make sense of Freud ’s argument requires knowing that he employed the term “ illusion ” in an idiosyncratic way .
An illusion in the Freudian sense is a belief that is caused by and in turn satisfies a deep psychological need or longing .
Illusions are not held rationally .
Illusions stick even in the absence of any supporting evidence .
Indeed , according to Freud , they stick even in the face of strong contra-evidence .
An illusion could be true , but often they are not .
Delusions are false illusions .
Religious belief Freud thought was an illusion .
While it may have been a beneficial illusion at an earlier time , it no longer is .
The religious illusion now , Freud asserted , inhibits scientific progress , and causes psychological neuroses , among its other pernicious effects .
Another atheistic pragmatic argument is Richard Dawkin ’s contention that religious belief is a “ virus of the mind ” ( Dawkins 1993 ) .
One is religious , according to Dawkins , because one has been infected by a faith meme .
A meme is Dawkins ’s imaginative construct , which he describes as a bit of information , manifested in behavior , and which can be copied from one person to another .
Like genes , memes are self - replicating vehicles , jumping from mind to mind .
One catches a meme by exposure to another who is infected .
Dawkins claims that the faith meme has the following traits :
M1 . The faith meme seems to the person as true , or right , or virtuous , though this conviction in fact owes nothing to evidence or reason .
M2 .
The faith meme makes a virtue out of believing in spite of there being no evidence .
M3 .
The faith meme encourages intolerant behavior towards those who possess rival faiths .
M4 .
The faith meme arises not because of evidence but because of epidemiology ; typically , if one has a faith , it is the same as one ’s parents and as one ’s grandparents .
Dawkins ’s meme idea , and his dismissal of faith as a virus of the mind , is both a purported naturalistic explanation of religious belief and a pragmatic dismissal of it as a harmful phenomenon .
A contemporary atheistic pragmatic argument is that the existence of God would make the world far worse in some respects than would be the case if God did not exist , even if it did not make the world worse overall ( Kahane 2011 ) .
As Kahane notes , if God were to exist , then a full understanding of reality by humans , may in - principle be unachievable .
Additionally , if God were to exist , moral autonomy may be limited , since humans , as creatures , might be subordinate to God ’s demands , including demands for worship , obedience , and allegiance .
Finally , if God were to exist , complete privacy may be lost , as an omnsicient being could , presumably , know one ’s thoughts and attitudes .
Kahane ’s intricate argument is counter to the conventional view that God ’s existence is something that all should hope for , since this world would , arguably , be the best or among the best of all possible worlds if God were to exist .
Even so , Kahane argues that one could rationally prefer that God not exist .
The argument invovles a distinction between evaluations from an impersonal viewpoint , and from a personal viewpoint .
It is the latter , which proves the most promising for the argument as Kahane contends that the existence of God could undermine the meaning generating life - projects of some .
If his argument is sound , Kahane has provided a kind of athiestic pragmatic argument that one could prefer that God not exist , even if God ’s existence would render the world better overall than it otherwise would be .
Much of Kahane ’s argument consists of comparisons between possible worlds in which God exists ( “ Godly worlds ” ) , and those in which God does not exist ( “ Godless worlds ” ) .
The modal reliability of these comparisons is far from obvious , since God is standardly seen as a necessarily existing being .
For a critical examination of Kahane ’s arguments , see Kraay 2013 .
The row over publication of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper resurfaced this week as Turkey held up the appointment of Danish prime minister as the new Nato secretary general .
But as the BBC's Malcolm Brabant reports from Denmark , the impact of that 2006 controversy has never gone away for those closely involved .
Dusk was falling , the curtains were open and the house was hyggelig - a Danish word that means cosy , welcoming and enticing - with scores of candles flickering around the open - plan sitting room .
Kurt Westergaard says he is too old to be afraid Dressed in his favourite " anarchist " colours of red and black , Kurt Westergaard sat down to a nourishing Nordic repast of black bread , plaice and prawns .
Unwinding after a day at the coalface of his profession , the bohemian grandfather with a seadog 's beard and Father Christmas trousers appeared to be the epitome of Scandinavian tranquillity .
Except relaxing completely is something that this cartoonist can never afford to do .
Islamic extremists placed a $ 1 m price on his head after he dared to mock Muslim suicide bombers by depicting the Prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban .
For three years he was forced underground to avoid would - be assassins .
I think we are in a period in which this democratic value is under pressure , so it has to be defended
Kurt Westergaard But Mr Westergaard has decided that he will hide no more .
" I am 73 years old , " he says .
" Most of my life is over .
I am too old to be afraid .
I have complete faith in PET [ the Danish Secret Service ] . "
Not only has he emerged from hiding but he has also gone on the offensive , contributing to a recently published Danish book .
His new cartoons are not as provocative as the Muhammad bomb but they satirise Islam and politicians who appease the mullahs .
" It is the question of freedom of speech , freedom of expression , " he says .
" I think we are in a period in which this democratic value is under pressure , so it has to be defended . "
Political repercussions
The re-emergence of Mr Westergaard has the potential to reinvigorate the argument over what is more important - respect for religion or absolute freedom of expression .
The cartoons prompted anti-Danish outrage across the Muslim world
The furore over the cartoons , which reached a zenith three years ago with Danish embassies being burned and Danish products boycotted in Muslim countries , has subsided .
But the debate has simply lain dormant and has never been resolved .
And it resurfaced during last week 's Nato heads of government meeting , attended by US President Barack Obama .
Turkey threatened to veto the appointment of Denmark 's Prime Minister , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , as Nato secretary general because he had refused to apologise for the cartoons .
The charm and intervention of President Obama was required to persuade Turkey to back down .
As the alliance 's new chief executive , one of Mr Fogh Rasmussen 's prime tasks will be to try to heal the wounds between the West and the Muslim world .
It is a matter of finding this balance and we have got to find it , not only in Denmark , but in the rest of Europe
Abdul Wahid Pedersen
Senior Danish Muslim Turkish newspapers say one of the key concessions obtained by President Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is that Mr Fogh Rasmussen will be forced to apologise for the cartoons crisis .
According to the Danish press , one of his first acts of conciliation will be to publicly acknowledge that the 12 cartoons could have caused offence to the world 's 1.5 billion Muslims .
The U - turn is certain to upset a large percentage of the Danish population .
It is not widely appreciated that the explosion of worldwide Muslim anger in 2006 followed a visit to the Middle East by a delegation of Danish imams .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
In a 2006 BBC Radio Four documentary called Denmark In the Eye of the Cartoon Storm , one of the imams , Ahmed Akkari , admitted to me that the delegation had carried three extra images that were even more inflammatory than the bomb in the turban .
" We took them to show that Muslims were being provoked , " said Mr Akkari .
These extra pictures had apparently been produced by right - wing extremists and not by Jyllands Posten .
They included drawings of Muhammad with a pig's head and the Prophet as a paedophile .
Following the imams ' intervention , the lives of the 12 cartoonists changed irrevocably and they paid the same price as author Salman Rushdie .
Only Mr Westergaard has come out of hiding .
The 11 others have followed Danish secret service advice and either have round - the - clock protection or maintain low profiles .
One of them is suffering from post - traumatic stress syndrome .
Still wary Mr Westergaard 's critics accuse him of being a right - wing " islamophobe " and of using the cartoons to bully Denmark 's 250,000 - strong Muslim minority .
Kurt Westergaard 's self - portrait mocks his ability to land himself in trouble Tim Jensen , a professor of comparative religion at the University of Southern Denmark , said : " I think it is simply pathetic .
" I do n't think there is any need for that [ new cartoons ] right now .
I think Muslims have to develop a thicker skin .
" But as long as they have not , let us deal with this in as a civilised manner as possible , let 's have our dialogues . "
Abdul Wahid Pedersen , a Dane who converted to Islam and now sits on the country 's Muslim council , denies that his religion is trying to exert a veto on a fundamental Western freedom .
" If I insult you , I do n't have the freedom of speech as my protector any longer , " he says .
" It is a matter of finding this balance and we have got to find it , not only in Denmark but in the rest of Europe .
If we want to keep our dialogue on the level of insult then we are bound to go down a real dirty track . "
Mr Westergaard denies that he bears any hostility towards Muslims .
" But of course I have an anger against those who want to kill me , " he adds .
Although special security measures have been installed at his hyggelig home , he closes the curtains , just in case an assassin is lurking .
The great irony is that the new Nato secretary general is about to effectively apologise to the Islamic world for Mr Westergaard 's drawing while he , as Danish prime minister , was part of the Bush - Blair alliance which alienated Muslims by invading Iraq .

Los Angeles commuters have been improperly detained , pushed , choked and struck by Metropolitan Transportation Authority security guards , according to interviews and internal law enforcement memos obtained by The Times .
Alleged assaults over the last two years have prompted at least 11 investigations by the L.A. County Sheriff ’s Department , which has repeatedly complained to MTA officials about abusive security officers , as the guards are called within the MTA .
Three incidents were captured on surveillance cameras at subway and light - rail stations .
Although the 97 MTA security guards carry guns , batons and pepper spray , they are not legally authorized to act as law enforcement officers .
Their main responsibilities are protecting MTA property , guarding revenues and closing subway stations when daily service ends .

“ They are not meant to be acting as police officers , ” said Sheriff ’s Cmdr .
Dan Finkelstein , who oversees the department ’s transit bureau , which has a contract with the MTA to police local rails and buses .
“ ‘ Observe and report ’ here has become ‘ observe and take action . ’ ”
MTA security officers operate separately from the Sheriff ’s Department .
The security officers used to report to a Sheriff ’s Department supervisor , but that was changed two years ago and guards now report directly to the MTA .
An MTA consultant , retired Sheriff ’s Department commander Charles “ Sid ” Heal , recently found that the relationship between sheriff ’s deputies and security officers was strained , in part because their roles were not clearly delineated .
In a report to the MTA board , the consultant said security officers sometimes engaged in police activities even though they lack the legal authority and liability protections that sworn law enforcement officers have .

A new contract between MTA and the Sheriff ’s Department is under negotiation , and it is expected to return security officers to Sheriff ’s Department supervision , said MTA spokesman Marc Littman .
“ That should provide better communications , integration and oversight , ” Littman said in an e-mail to The Times .
Sheriff ’s officials have written letters to MTA officials over the last year alerting them to improper conduct by their security officers .
In one such letter , a Sheriff ’s Department captain complained that MTA Officer Miguel De La Cruz had attacked a “ near comatose and intoxicated ” man without provocation at a downtown subway station .
The Sheriff ’s Department sent its findings to prosecutors , who filed criminal charges against De La Cruz .
Last month , a jury convicted him of battery , false imprisonment and filing a false report .
He was sentenced to 90 days in jail and was fired by the MTA .

Art Leahy , newly appointed chief executive of the MTA , said in an interview with The Times that he only recently learned of allegations of misconduct by security officers and that he is adopting a zero tolerance approach to verbal or physical abuse .
“ We are not going to tolerate any employee abusing a passenger or a member of the public , ” Leahy said .
Leahy said he is asking Mike Gennaco , head of the Office of Independent Review , the county ’s civilian watchdog of the Sheriff ’s Department , to immediately advise him of ways to overhaul policies and procedures .
Under the California Public Records Act , The Times requested copies of letters between the Sheriff ’s Department and MTA .

The Times also obtained confidential memos on some of the incidents .
Among the cases :
* A security officer used his baton on an incoherent man in an elevator who was in diabetic shock .
The man suffered two broken fingers and numerous bruises on his arms .
The officer said the man grabbed his shirt with both hands , so he struck him once with a baton .
A Sheriff ’s Department investigation found that the injuries were “ indicative of being struck several times ” and that the officer used “ potentially excessive ” force , then failed to render medical aid .
The officer was the subject of three other excessive force complaints and has recently been removed from field duties to be retrained , an MTA official said .
* A security officer was captured on closed - circuit TV cameras pushing a transient against a ticket vending machine .
As a result , the person fell to the ground , cut his head and lost consciousness .
* A security officer said he used pepper spray on a drunk man who was belligerent during a train sweep at Union Station .
Footage from a surveillance camera , however , showed the officer pushing the man out of a train onto the platform floor .
When the man stood up , the security officer hit him across the chest and legs with a baton and then pepper - sprayed him in the face .

It was a video camera at the Metro ’s 7th Street Station that convinced a jury that De La Cruz battered Carl Gutierrez and filed a false police report accusing the young man of assaulting him .
On the video , De La Cruz is seen discovering the intoxicated young man sleeping on a bench in a subway station , taking a quick look around and then nudging the 22 - year - old to try to wake him .
Unable to stir the man , De La Cruz put him in an arm hold and tried to pull him upright off the concrete bench .
When that failed , he kicked the man in the back and then put his hands around his neck , choking him from behind .
When the man tried to remove the officer ’s clamped hands , De La Cruz slammed him to the ground .
Advertisement
De La Cruz , 55 , filed a police report on the Aug. 21 incident , saying the young man had approached him in a threatening manner .
He said he acted because the young man tried to bite him .
According to a Sheriff ’s Department memo , an MTA security manager initially suggested that De La Cruz -- a tactical instructor -- needed additional training , noting that he had been “ very aggressive ” in several prior incidents .
Leahy said he reviewed the video of the incident and agreed with the jury ’s verdict .
“ When he is tapping on the unconscious person ’s foot , I do n’t think that crosses the line .
It is when he violates the rules and tries to pull the guy up , he goes too far , ” Leahy said .
“ He should have called for backup . ”

The man who was assaulted by De La Cruz said the guard ’s conduct was uncalled for .
“ Some people should n’t be hired to do the job they are doing , ” Gutierrez said , “ and that was the case here . ”

PM Kevin Rudd 's stimulus package aims to give cash to all tax - payers
The Australian government has admitted that cash hand - outs aimed at stimulating the economy have been sent to thousands of people who are dead .
The money was part of a multi-billion dollar package under which every taxpayer was entitled to a payment of up to A$ 900 ( $ 700 , £ 440 ) .
About A$ 14 m of the money went to dead people , ministers said , and A $ 25 m to Australians living overseas .
Local media have dubbed the deceased recipients " the grateful dead " .
Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner said that the money would still help Australia 's economy .
" Even where they go to people who are dead , of course they go to the estate , " he told local media .
" The estate typically is going to consist of ordinary Australians who will in turn get the payments , and on balance over time , will spend those payments . "
He did acknowledge that a " tiny proportion " of the money might be spent overseas , by expatriates .
But another minister said more than 99 % of the money had gone to the right people .
Members of the opposition were not appeased .
" If anybody saw any of the dead out there spending up big at Harvey Norman or Coles or Woolworths , please let me know , " ABC news quoted Liberal Senator Simon Birmingham as saying .
Multiculturalism : Its Nature and Origin
From A Study of Our Decline by P Atkinson ( 18/5/2017 )
People are people , some are good and some are bad — a popular belief circa 2000
Implicit in this claim is that beliefs about good and bad are universal , which is untrue .
Judgement about good - and - bad must reflect beliefs about right - and - wrong , which vary from culture to culture .
For example , the following beliefs are held by different cultures , which consider them right so are Good
Adulterers are stoned to death
Thieves have their limbs amputated
Young men who show contempt for their elders are speared to death
Men can slay female relatives who dishonour their family
But which are considered wrong so are judged as bad in Australia and are forbidden by Australian law .
Hence there is no universal agreement on good and bad , and the cited belief is nonsense because it denies the existence of culture .
Australian Law is Australian Culture
The single set of values that reign in Australia is Australian culture , which is the law of the land , and anybody attempting to inflict opposing cultural values will suffer legal penalty ; which means that to uphold law and order the values of other cultures must be denied .
Indeed , Australian society does not only forbid practices that contravene Australian common law , but have extended Commonwealth statutes precisely to proscribe behaviour that has no impact upon ourselves , but which is considered unacceptable .
Our multicultural regime has judged female excision as too awful to allow , even though it is practised by millions throughout the world and affects only those belonging to alien cultures .
This prohibition is a clear admission that there are barbaric practices that cannot be allowed , which is a claim that there are people who practice barbarism , Barbarians , who must be resisted — a contradiction of their own Multicultural creed .
Cultures Do Not Mix ; They Clash
The difference in understanding between cultures makes different cultures enemies , who will struggle to impose their wills upon each other .
Western civilisation itself is made up of similar but different cultures who themselves have constantly strived to dominate one another , often through war .
The inevitable impact of multiculturalism upon Australia , and all the other countries that adopt it , is cultural suicide .
By allowing the people of different cultures to enter Australia , Australians are allowing their culture , which is their society , to be overrun by alien cultures ( Barbarians ) .
Multiculturalism is not a rational idea , but is part of the tyranny of wishful thinking that inevitably accompanies the decay of reason ( see political correctness ) .
Anyone who tries to resist the hysteria of multiculturalism is immediately stigmatised as a racist , a redneck , a chauvinist , fascist or whatever , and subject to persecution .
In this way the nonsense of multiculturalism is promoted , and truth suppressed .

Dancer Series :
Artwork
John Asaro ’s recent paintings capture the life force behind dance , his main focus of the series 100 Dancers .
With brilliant fauve colors , his admiration for dancers and their dedication is reflected in his own dedication to capturing the lines and forms of the graceful ballerinas .
He follows them from classroom to stage in various poses of relaxation , performance , contemplation , and even the pain that comes with such passion .
On stage or in the classroom , the costumes and lighting are constantly shifting , creating delicate tension between the artists and their environment .
Always listening to the orchestral arrangements as he paints , Asaro ’s inspired works are imbued with music .
He occasionally finds himself of the same ilk , and dances around his studio , paintbrush in hand with his patient cat as a partner .
It ’s easy to give yourself up to the captivating essence of dance ; John Asaro certainly has .
Nude Series :
Artwork
John Asaro ’s brilliantly painted series of nudes is a feast for the eyes .
Using the models as a vehicle for color exploration , each hue is exaggerated and pushed to its extreme , making each kaleidoscopic
painting a tempting platter .
Asaro often creates patterns by duplicating or triplicating the nude across the canvas , exploring the many forms available to the human body .
Whether they be dancers in repose
or balletic swimmers , Asaro ’s nude series shows evidence of his fascination with dance in physicality and lyricism .
A few days ago , a high school student in Sarasota , Fla. , failed history and another failed civics .
As a result , the one wound up shot in the chest and the other jailed on a charge of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon .
Here 's the story , as reported by the Sarasota Herald Tribune :
On the last Friday in April , an 18 - year - old white kid named Daniel Azeff and a friend went riding downtown in a pickup truck , yelling racially disparaging remarks and waving a Confederate battle flag .
Azeff 's grandfather , Joseph Fischer , told the paper he has cautioned his grandson repeatedly about his fascination with that dirty banner .
Azeff , he said , does not really understand what the flag means .
If so , he 's hardly alone in his ignorance .
A generation of apologists for the wannabe nation symbolized by that flag has done an effective job of convincing the gullible and the willfully ignorant that neither the nation , the flag , nor the Civil War in which both were bloodily repudiated , has anything to do with slavery .
It 's just " heritage , " they say , as though heritage were a synonym for " good . "
As though Nazis , white South Africans and Rwandans did not have heritage , too .
For the record :
In explaining its decision to secede , South Carolina cited " an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery . "
Georgia noted its grievances against the North " with reference to the subject of African slavery . "
Mississippi said , " Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery . "
To which Confederate " vice president " Alexander Stephens added : " Our new government is founded upon ... the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man , that slavery , subordination to the superior race , is his natural and moral condition . "
So the notion the Confederacy and its symbols have nothing to do with slavery is tiresome , silly and delusional .
In choosing to adopt one of those symbols that night , David Azeff took a history test of sorts -- and failed .
As noted , Michael Mitchell 's test was in civics .
Police say Mitchell , who is 18 , black and a student at Sarasota Military Academy , saw Azeff 's flag , took offense and , when the white kid parked and walked down the street , confronted him .
Azeff denied being a racist ; he was , he said , just exercising his First Amendment rights .
Police say the argument escalated , until Mitchell pulled a gun and shot Azeff in the chest .
Thus did Mitchell fail his own test .
This is America .
Daniel Azeff has a perfect right to express virtually any opinion he chooses , no matter how asinine or provocative , without being shot for it .
Thankfully ,
Azeff is expected to make a full recovery .
Meantime , Mitchell , said to be a good kid who has never been in trouble before , remains jailed in lieu of $ 50,000 bail .
It is difficult not to see in them a certain symmetry .
That 's not an argument of moral equivalence : Mitchell allegedly pulled a gun , so the moral weight for what happened rests squarely upon his shoulders .
And yet it 's also true that each teenager had what the other lacked .
One knew his rights , the other , his history .
But neither realized you cannot fully appreciate the one without understanding the other .
So each young man fell into the other 's blind spot .
If we were a people with the courage to teach our racial history fearlessly , and the foresight to inculcate in our children a reverence for civil liberties , this tragedy might never have happened .
We are not those people .
And because we are n't , these two boys hurtled toward collision , hopped up on grievances and rage they were ill - equipped to speak -- or hear .
They took a test that night in Sarasota , and let no one be surprised they failed .
They never had a chance .

SWOOPE , Va . 
The white metal sign over the desk at Polyface Farm reads , " Joel Salatin : Lunatic Farmer . "
Salatin is proud of that label .
" I'm a third - generation lunatic , " he boasts while standing in his lush , green central Virginia fields .
Brown chickens strut and peck around his feet .
" I do n't do anything like average farmers do , " he says .
CARBON ' FOOD - PRINT ':
How to eat green
What the 52 - year - old farmer does is let his cows feed on grass instead of corn or grain .
He moves his cows to new fields daily .
Flocks of chickens scratch around open fields , spreading cow droppings , eating flies and larvae , and laying eggs in the Salatin - built eggmobile .
Hogs forage in the woods or in a pasture house where they root through cow manure , wood chips and corn .
The resulting compost gets spread back over the fields , fertilizing the grass for the cattle .
That completes the cycle .
" It 's completely counter to current agricultural wisdom , " he says .
Current agricultural practices often encourage using technology — petroleum - based fertilizers , hormones and antibiotics — to spur growth and reduce costs as much as possible .
Salatin has become known for his unconventional ways .
Highlighted in The Omnivore 's Dilemma , Michael Pollan 's 2006 exploration of what we choose to eat and how it is grown , and himself the author of six books on farming , Salatin spurns pesticides , antibiotics and fertilizers .
" I 'm honoring the traditional natural patterns .
It 's about enhancing the cowness of the cow . "
Now the " lunatic " is about to come to the big screen in a documentary titled Food , Inc. , directed by Robert Kenner .
Due to open June 12 in New York , Los Angeles and San Francisco , the documentary takes a critical look at the American food system , contrasting industrial agribusiness with operations like Polyface .
The film , which builds on the work of activists like Pollan and Eric Schlosser , author of 2001's Fast Food Nation , is financed by Participant Media , which also financed An Inconvenient Truth , the Oscar - winning 2006 documentary that made a global warming star of former vice president Al Gore .
A family business
The director says he chose Salatin for his film because he " is an innovator and a real hero . "
" It 's a dark story , " Kenner says , but " Joel 's there to provide some light .
The way he works — you 'd want to have Joel next to you instead of these incredibly smelly hog farms or cattle depots .
To have Joel there would be beautiful .
His food is beautiful .
And tasty .
Joel is a real Jeffersonian farmer . "
( Thomas Jefferson was an inventive farmer at his Monticello estate , diversifying his crop with hundreds of varieties of plants . )
Like Jefferson , Salatin calls Virginia home .
Polyface Farm began in 1961 when Salatin 's parents , William and Lucille , bought the 550 - acre property , which Salatin describes as being " anything but idyllic " then , and moved the family there .
" They started with raw land , " Salatin says , " and all we wanted to do was farm . "
Salatin took over Polyface in 1982 , six years before his father died .
Salatin lives in the farm 's 200 - year - old white wood - and - brick house .
The farm remains a family operation .
Salatin's wife , Teresa , handles bookkeeping ; their son , Daniel , runs the day - to - day operations ; Daniel 's wife , Sheri , handles marketing .
Counting Daniel and Sheri's three kids and Salatin 's mother , 85 , four generations still make the farm home , although each branch of the family has its own house .
Eating Polyface 's meat and eggs generally means eating fairly near the farm .
Salatin wo n't ship his food farther away than a four - hour drive .
Customers can come to the farm's on - site store , open only on Saturdays , or take receipt of deliveries to nearly two dozen towns in Virginia and Maryland .
Polyface also serves more than three dozen regional restaurants , caterers , bakeries and small food stores in the region .
In addition , Salatin travels around the world giving speeches and presentations on how to copy his success .
According to the Polyface website ( polyfacefarms.com / ) , Salatin charges a minimum of $ 3,500 for speeches and $ 800 for a two - hour tour of his 550 - acre farm .
He is also working on his seventh book and fields requests from people around the country who want to learn his techniques .
More than 40 people have served year - long apprenticeships with Salatin over the past 20 years .
Still more have worked summers on the farm as interns .
Passing on heritage
Daniel began his farm career at 7 , when he launched Polyface 's rabbit business , thanks to a loan he took out from his parents .
Now 27 , he jokes that the pressure is on him to keep the farm successful .
" The law of the third generation is that 's the one that loses the business , " he says .
" I do n't want to do that . "
But he says there was never any pressure to stay in the family business .
If he had wanted to do something else , he could have .
His sister , Rachel , 22 , is pursuing a career in interior design .
Daniel manages the animals and the apprentices , such as Grady Phelan , 23 , a rancher from Oklahoma .
Carrying four Mason jars of raw milk from a neighboring farm , Phelan talks about reading Salatin 's books growing up .
" My dad read his books , consequently , I read his books , " Phelan says .
The books influenced Phelan 's college education .
He decided not to bother learning industrial agricultural methods , choosing zoology instead .
Now he studies the Salatin way at Polyface .
Small scale
Salatin 's gospel is spreading .
Past apprentices have set up farms throughout the country .
Tyler Jones spent a year at Polyface in 2002 - 2003 .
He was 22 at the time and says he " was looking for a way to get into farming that was a little more the way it used to be .
I 'm not real enamored with big agribusiness and was interested in finding a different way of life while producing healthy food . "
Now Jones , 28 , has a 106 - acre farm in Corvallis , Ore. , which he runs with his wife .
They raise cows , pigs , lambs , chickens and turkeys , and they keep bees .
" We 've doubled business every year for the past five years , " Jones says .
As for his apprenticeship with Salatin , " he cut the learning curve by 10 , 12 , 15 years . "
Peter Burns agrees .
In 2004 , when he was 16 , he spent a year on Polyface farms learning the Salatin way .
Five years ago , his 137 - acre family farm , Heritage Farms in Oak County , Pa. , had 250 birds .
Now it is more than 20 times that size .
" If it had not been for the Salatins , I 'd have no idea how to run a 5,800 - bird operation , " Burns says .
Still , such agriculture remains a tiny fraction of the food supply .
" It 's a small part , maybe 5 % , " estimates Jean Halloran , director of Food Policy Initiatives at Consumers Union , publisher of the magazine Consumer Reports .
" But it 's rapidly growing . "
Critics of this kind of local , all - natural farming have said the food is too expensive and would n't work on a large enough scale to feed a hungry nation .
James McWilliams , a professor of agricultural history at the University of Texas - Austin , is n't convinced that local food is the only way to go .
Economies of scale , when it comes to farming and to transportation , are real , he says .
Trains and boats , for example , are efficient ways to move food .
Trucks , especially over short distances , are not .
Halloran disagrees with the critics .
For one thing , she says , large - scale industrial agriculture has many costs associated with it that are n't reflected in the price of food .
" There are other things that have made industrial food production cheap that are of questionable sustainability , " she says .
For example , antibiotics are in widespread use at large feedlots , and that contributes to antibiotic - resistant bacteria .
" We pay a price for that . "
Likewise , typical agricultural operations rely heavily on petroleum - based fertilizers .
" We 've substituted people with machines and petroleum , " Halloran explains , " but the era of really cheap fuel is passing . "
From farm to table
Castigation of the entire conventional food system " is an easy thing to do , but it overlooks the range of farms and the fact that there are plenty of conventional farms that use very small amounts of artificial pesticides and fungicides and fertilizers , " McWilliams says .
As to the argument that Salatin 's methods are n't scalable and not every farm could operate like Polyface , Halloran says small - scale production can work because cutting the distance between the farm and the consumer will reduce transportation costs , favoring the local farmer .
Meanwhile , consumers are starting to place a greater value on the variety and freshness that local farms offer , she says .
Salatin says his farm feeds more people per acre than other farms , though he concedes it requires more labor than most .
To Salatin , his environmental and sustainable approach is n't just the future , it 's the moral way to farm .
He puts down a warm , freshly laid egg and strolls through his herd of cattle .
" Hello , people ! " he calls out , stopping to stroke the nose of one of his grass - fed cows .
" The greatest tragedy , " he says , " is that we 're abnormal . "

Moderate Sufi scholars recently did what so many others have chosen to do in anarchic Somalia :
They picked up guns and entered the killing business , in this case to fight back against the Shabab , one of the most fearsome extremist Muslim groups in Africa .
Michael Kamber for The New York Times
The U.S. Army , which recently canceled PR work in Iraq , is looking for a firm to do media campaigns in Afghanistan .
The contract is worth $ 10 million a year , for up to four years .
" Using posters , billboards , flyers , radio messages , documentaries and TV ads , the campaign will condemn the use of improvised explosive devices " ( IEDs ) , reports O'Dwyer's .
The main messages in the Army 's " counter - improvised explosive device information campaign " include : " IEDs and bomb makers have an adverse impact on civil society " ; " killing Muslims is against Islam " ; the Afghan National Security Forces are " legitimate " and " capable of protecting its communities " ; and the Afghan Government " has been elected by the people of Afghanistan and has a stronger tie to the people than a government in place by force , " providing " services and aid ... while the Taliban bring violence . "
The Army media contract will also promote education and development .
Key messages for these areas include : " [ W ] ith thirty years of war much of old Afghanistan has been lost .
Through education people can reclaim their nation 's past achievements . "
The Army is accepting proposals on the contract until April 8 .
In August 2008 , the Lincoln Group won a six - month , $ 14.3 million Army contract for similar anti-IED messaging in Afghanistan .
But House Democrats easily defeated Republican alternatives and won backing for their budget from all segments of their party , from conservative Blue Dogs to urban liberals .
The 233 - to - 196 vote , though hardly overwhelming , actually reflected a strong show of Democratic support for the budget , since it often barely passes .
It was the first time in a dozen years that a budget had received more than 230 votes .
Twenty House Democrats opposed the budget ; two Senate Democrats did .

The chief Republican alternative , officially supported by the party leadership , was defeated 293 to 137 , with 38 Republicans opposing it .
The total lack of Republican backing for the Democratic plans was reminiscent of the House vote this year on the $ 787 billion economic stimulus program .
But the budget ’s approval was nonetheless viewed as a victory for the new White House , particularly because most moderate and conservative Democrats went along with the president ’s push for more spending .
In the Senate , where lawmakers engaged in their annual “ vote - a- rama , ” discarding or approving piles of amendments , Democrats easily defeated an alternative offered by Senator John McCain of Arizona and a handful of fellow Republicans that would have essentially frozen federal spending except for the military .
“ We are just going on as if it were business as usual , ” said Mr. McCain , asserting that no family in America was increasing spending , while the federal government was .
“ We can , ” he said , “ because we print money . ”
Among the amendments that won Senate approval was a bipartisan proposal that would raise the estate tax exemption by $ 1.5 million , to a total of $ 5 million , and reduce the tax ’s maximum rate by 10 percentage points , to 35 percent .
Both the House and Senate budgets pared spending from the president ’s initial request and made other adjustments intended to reduce the annual deficit to less than $ 600 billion within five years , about half the $ 1.2 trillion projected for the 2010 fiscal year , which begins Oct.

FOR more than a decade , Australia had enjoyed one of the biggest booms in its history , and a robust series of budget surpluses .
When Kevin Rudd led the Labor Party to power in 2007 , he promised , as a “ fiscal conservative ” to keep this ball rolling .
But when Wayne Swan , his treasurer ( finance minister ) , presented the government 's second budget on May 12th , the ball had suddenly stopped .
Mr Swan delivered an underlying cash deficit for 2009 - 10 of almost A$ 58 billion ( $ 44 billion ) , or 4.9 % of GDP , one of the largest ever .
Only last year , an A $ 20 billion surplus was forecast .
The lucky country 's reversal of fortune could hardly have been starker .
It mirrors the global downturn , but especially that in China , Australia 's biggest trading partner .
Just before the budget , the central bank revised earlier hopes that Australia might plough through all this .
It says the economy has been contracting since late last year , and it will shrink by 0.5 % up to mid-2010 .
This may sound mild compared with other rich countries .
But the slump in commodity markets and prices has blown a hole in record company profits that underwrote much of the boom .
The Treasury says that tax revenues over the next four years will now be A$ 210 billion less than expected .
This posed a stark choice for Mr Rudd .
He has promised big spending on health , education and attacking climate change .
Now , he has either to find some way of financing his plans , such as tax hikes , or to drop them .
He chose neither course .
Buoyed by public and pundit support for two stimulus packages since October , he turned the budget largely into a third stimulus .
It invests A $ 22 billion in infrastructure , including ports , interstate roads and new railways in Australia 's big cities .
Clean - energy projects , mainly solar and carbon capture from burning coal , will get A$ 4.5 billion .
Under pressure from an unlikely alliance of business and greens , Mr Rudd recently delayed by a year his plan for an emissions - trading scheme from 2010 .
The green budget measure turns the pressure back on his critics .
Mr Rudd plans to pay for all this by finding savings roughly equal to the infrastructure outlays .
Richer Australians will sacrifice most .
The government will slash tax breaks for private health insurance , pension contributions and other forms of middle - class welfare .
Nevertheless , the government faces net debt to the tune of almost A$ 200 billion in four years from money it will have to borrow to cover projected deficits .
But luck has not entirely deserted Australia .
Having shunned toxic assets , its four big banks look healthy .
The Treasury is predicting that growth will return to boom levels of 4.5 % in just two years .
That must assume China 's demand for Australia 's commodities revives .
The contraction , meanwhile , is expected to raise unemployment to 8.5 % , or about 1 m people , by mid-2011 .
This will worry Mr Rudd as he faces an election by the end of 2010 .
For now , he has avoided imposing quite the horror budget many had feared .
Steve Martin wrote the play in 1993
Comic actor Steve Martin has stepped in to support a school production of his play that was banned after parents objected to its adult themes .
Students at La Grande High School in Oregon were stopped from staging Picasso at the Lapin Agile .
Martin has offered to help pay for the play to be performed off - campus .
He said he was supporting the production because he did not want his play " acquiring a reputation it does not deserve " .
Written in 1993 , the play depicts a meeting between a young Pablo Picasso and Albert Einstein in a Parisian bar in which they get into a discussions on the superior merits of art or science .
Wrong impression
In a letter to the La Grande Observer , Martin said although there were lines in the play he understood parents may feel uncomfortable letting their children say , the students knew the " questionable behaviour sometimes evident in the play is not endorsed " .
He also wrote that , contrary to the protests , the play was not about " people drinking in bars and treating women as sex objects " .
" The play has been performed , without incident , all over the world by professional and amateur companies , including many high schools , " Martin added .
Rehearsals for the play were stopped after the headteacher received a letter from a parent which contained a petition signed by 137 people against the staging of the play .
Teacher and director Kevin Cahill told La Grande Observer that funds were now being raised to put the play on at the nearby Eastern Oregon University .
Any money left over from Martin 's donation will be put towards acting scholarships for students .

The government has unveiled plans for every home in Britain to be equipped with smart meters by the end of 2020 .
Smart meters allow suppliers to remotely record customers ' gas and electricity use , and let consumers see how much energy they are using .
Some 26 million electricity and 22 million gas meters will need to be fitted at a cost of £ 7 bn .
Smart meters end the need to dispatch meter readers , meaning huge savings for energy firms who hope bills will fall .
It is also hoped that smart meters will mean an end to estimated bills and call centre staff who deal with related complaints .
British Gas said the move would reduce the UK 's energy use , cut carbon emissions and save customers money .
Cost savings
Energy providers will have the responsibility to fit the meters in what amounts to the biggest programme of work since British Gas converted appliances in 17 million homes to natural gas back in the 1970s .
Industry sources say that the £ 7bn cost amounts to around £ 15 per household per year between 2010 and 2020 .
I 've managed to save about a tenth , both on energy and gas , since having the smart meter because its made me conscious of the energy I 'm using
Smart reader user Lloyd Matthews
Q&A : Smart meters
But £ 10 of that will be accounted for in cost savings by the suppliers .
That leaves the customer picking up the other £ 5 .
But the average consumer is also likely to save 2 % to 3 % off their energy use each year , and thus cut £ 25 to £ 35 off their bills .
So overall , households could be better off to the tune of more than £ 20 a year .
The government believes we could all save around 2 % of our energy use .
That would cut £ 100 m from our bills by 2020 .
It could also reduce our C02 emissions by 2.6 m tonnes .
A new industry - backed Central Communications body will be established to handle all the meter reading data .
' Benefit '
One of the smaller energy companies , First Utility , has already installed smart meters in the homes of its 10,000 customers .
The firm 's chief executive Mark Daeche says the lower running costs allow the company to offer competitive prices .
" Of course it is a benefit to us , " he said .
" We can provide lower prices as we do n't have the overheads of supporting a customer with lots of customer service . "
Lloyd Matthews and his wife Susanna live in East London .
They are EDF Energy customers and they have been using a smart meter for the past two years .
The meter comes with a display unit that shows Mr Matthews exactly how much electricity and gas he is using .
He can also compare his energy use on a daily , weekly or monthly basis .
Mr Matthews says that knowledge has enabled him to reduce his energy bills without hampering his lifestyle " I 've managed to save about a tenth , both on energy and gas since having the smart meter , because its made me conscious of the energy I 'm using , " he said .
The government is to launch a three - month consultation process on the plans .
BBC
News asked for your comments regarding this story .
Here is a selection of some of the ones we 've received .
I cannot see how these meters will benefit consumers , other than a small minority who have the time and inclination to sit studying their consumption on a daily basis .
And , why should we have to meet the cost of meters that are being forced upon us ?
John - Paul Buck , London , UK Trust the Government to install 10 - yr old technology , 20yrs old by the time it 's finished .
If we 're looking that far ahead we need a system that raises prices according to demand and will work with smart appliances , that will turn themselves off when the price is above a threshold .
Mark Wigmore , Guildford UK
Energy manager for WSCC since 1985 - I wish i had confidence in this scheme - the fact is we stopped getting the information we need to manage energy when meter readers were dispensed with and bill information was reduced to 2 yearly reconciliation our present information is absymal - why not use the money to employ and train local meter readers to advise on energy saving and provide them with a performance related incentive scheme ?
- we 'll then begin to move closely to truly sustainable improvement
John Hoyland , Boxgrove West Sussex
Interesting to note that a recent attempt by the Dutch to make these meters compulsory was withdrawn after objections on the grounds of privacy .
These meters can provide continual monitoring and energy usage can show if the house is occupied , when it is habitually empty , etc .
Roger James , Brighton I can't wait to have a smart meter - I 'm very keen to know where all my bill money is going , and what I can do to reduce it .
I 'd be happy to pay £ 10 or so as I 'm sure it'd result in me saving money as I find things that are wasting electricity and switch them off or replace them .
Alex , UK
We 've been asking ( begging ) for one of these for over 8 years now .
Our meters are in an awkward location .
Meter readers often arrive at an inconvenient time ( and are pushy or rude when you tell them you 'll call in the reading ) - I 've lived in other cities where remote readings are done - it's a huge convenience for the customer .
It 's about time we finally joined the modern age in the UK .
Alexis , London Question .
When you have your electricity meter at the front of your house and your gas meter at the rear of your house how is the meter box to be connected when you have solid floors ?
Will it be another rushed installation by so called engineers who run cables round your rooms pinned only to the skirting boards and then run up the wall to your new meter ??
No doubt it will be the house holder that will have to pay to have the cables set in to the wall to hide them .
Or will the power company 's move their existing meters to one central location - no doubt that will be too troublesome for them .
James Swann , Macclesfield Cheshire I think this is a good idea .
My electricity and gas company have in the past , without my permission increased my direct debit because they have over estimated the energy I have used .
They then blamed it on me for being out or not sending them the meter readings on time .
This is of course money in their bank rather than in mine !
Multiplied by the number of customers they have the sum is not small !
Of course , I still worry that they will still over estimate a year based on a lot of energy use in one week .
David , Bristol
To think this will save consumers money is ridiculous .
Energy suppliers are commercial enterprises - if consumption falls due to customers monitoring their usage , prices will rise to protect profits .
Doug Robinson , Doncaster England Brilliant scheme !
I reckon as long as the initial outlay for the customer is kept to a reasonably low figure , the majority of people would welcome this initiative .
Of course there 'll be few who think it 's another big - brother spy device in our homes but ...
Paul , Pontypool , Wales I think the justification behind the installation of the meters is wrong .
Yes I understand that it 'll be a huge cost saving to the energy companies however I believe the government is underestimating the amount of people who are aware of their own energy usage and are always trying to save as much as they can .
It 's a bad generalization that they say it'll save all households a few percent a year as I 'm sure that there are a lot more people than they think who already save this amount due to submitting their own meter readings and paying attention to where they can save money .
Allex Turner , Trowbridge , UK Brilliant , another automation process putting people out of work .
The poor meter readers all being made redundant .
Martin James , Bristol , UK NPower sent me estimated bills for ages .
When they finally sent somebody to read the meter I was left several hundred pounds in debt .
Its my belief that companies deliberately do this , as they wo n't let you change suppliers while you still owe money .
Once they 've trapped you , they can put their prices to whatever they like and you have no choice but to pay .

According to the latest news on the web , the well known motherboard manufacturer abit , once a leading provider of high - performance motherboards and video cards , will close doors forever in the month to come .
Now we all know that the company halted the production of its motherboards , but it was never meant to close doors forever .
Instead , abit was to move into the consumer electronics market with products like digital picture frames and mobile internet devices .
Yes , but no one thought of the world economic crisis .
HEXUS . net reports that abit 's parent company USI has now decided to pull abit out of the channel market entirely .
abit 's marketing director Thore Welling commented :
If this information confirms , the whole liquidation of abit should be finished in around a month .

Looks like natural selection does work after all .
At least their government did n't try dumping tons of money to keep them floating .
In an oversaturated market , losing one company leaves market space for others to grab hold of and prosper with .
I 'd rather lose the little / poor quality ones , than a big / good quality one .

all these different brands and choices of motherboard to many if you ask me
over saturation to the max
if motherboards have good features and a competitive price ill buy it dosnt matter what brand as long as its is the above and has decent support
to many types of graphics card also , i think we could eliminate about 40 % of cards , now another re branding the gtx255 a gtx 250 with more shaders LOL
or a new dvd drive that has exactly the same specs as every other dvd drive

The AMD version of that was a PITA .
Owned three of them and they all died within 3 months .
Got one replaced and only one DIMM slot and one of my CPU 's worked on it .
The layout was different to every other company ( the pciex1 was switched with the pciex16 ) so allowed for a large gpu cooler and PCI soundcard .

Foxconn may not make that many retail motherboards but they make tons of components and tons of motherboards for oem pc builders like dell and hp .

' Imran Abu Hamdiyeh
Yesterday , 27 April , the Jerusalem District Court sentenced border policemen Shachar Butbika to 8½ years ' imprisonment and Dennis Alhazov to 5 ½ year 's imprisonment for their involvement in the abduction and killing , in 2002 , of ‘ Imran Abu Hamdiya , an 18 - year - old from Hebron .
Two other border policemen were previously convicted and sentenced to imprisonment , one for 8 ½ years and the other for 4 ½ years .
The four policemen threw Abu Hamdiya from a jeep moving at high speed after they had abducted , beaten , and abused him .
His head struck the pavement with great force , killing him .
The policemen also abused other Palestinians in Hebron .
The entire affair was exposed by B'Tselem and the Palestinian human rights organization al - Haq .
It is questionable whether the sentences are compatible with the gravity of the offense .
However , bringing the policemen to justice , even if only partially , is a rare instance in which the justice system in Israel has met its obligation to hold security forces accountable for illegally harming Palestinians .
As a rule , the authorities refrain from enforcing the law on soldiers and police officers who commit crimes of violence against Palestinians .
Presumably , the tragic results of this case , together with the high profile it was given by the media , led the authorities to deviate from their custom and prosecute the policemen .
One significant reason for police not being held accountable for harming Palestinians in the West Bank is that many cases of violence against Palestinians are not properly investigated .
As a result , it is difficult to arrive at the truth and the chance of an indictment being filed is reduced .
It is not surprising , therefore , that most cases of violence never reach the courtroom .
From the beginning of the intifada , in 2000 , to April 2008 , B'Tselem reported 130 cases of police violence against Palestinians ( not including shooting cases ) to the Department for the Investigation of Police ( DIP ) .
Of these , the DIP opened 100 investigations , which led to the prosecution of only nine police officers and disciplinary proceedings against only four police officers .
Background
On 30 December 2002 , at about 8:00 P.M. , a Border Police jeep stopped next to ‘ Imran Abu Hamdiyeh , who was with his friends outside his house in Hebron .
Eyewitnesses related to B'Tselem that border policemen got out of the jeep , put Abu Hamdiya inside the vehicle and drove off .
A few of Abu Hamdiya 's friends headed toward Hebron 's industrial area , a place where they knew Border Police officers beat Palestinians .
About forty minutes after the policemen grabbed Abu Hamdiya , his friends found his body at the industrial area , lying by the side of the road .
Later that evening , B'Tselem began to investigate the incident .
The organization found , among other things , that the same night , Border Police officers severely beat two other Palestinians .
After taking the first few testimonies , B'Tselem immediately demanded that DIP investigate .
At first , the Israel Police denied any connection to the matter , and police spokespersons claimed that no police jeep was in the area .
B'Tselem aided DIP in locating witnesses and brought them to give testimonies to DIP investigators .
Meanwhile , in cooperation with al - Haq , B'Tselem obtained the consent of Abu Hamdiyeh 's family to remove the body from the grave and conduct a forensic examination .
The organizations invited the Danish pathologist , Dr. Jurgen Tomassen to take part in conducting the autopsy .
The findings indicated that Abu Hamdiyeh had been badly beaten prior to his death .
Following publication of the results of the autopsy , the four policemen were arrested , and on 1 May 2003 , indictments were filed against them .
The four were charged with the manslaughter of Abu Hamdiyeh , abuse of three other Palestinians , and obstruction of justice .
Simultaneously , a Border Police investigative committee established following the DIP investigation recommended that the platoon be disbanded and that its commander , and his predecessor , be banned from holding any command position .
The committee also recommended that a Command note of censure be placed in the personal files of the Border Police commander in the West Bank , Yiftach Avraham , and the vice - platoon commander , Eldad Shusaf .
The Border Police commander and the Israel Police inspector general adopted the committee 's recommendations .
Since then , B'Tselem has documented many cases of violence by Israeli police officers against Palestinians in Hebron , despite the disbanding of the platoon .
The indictment against the four policemen stated , in part , that they “ went on a campaign of abuse and cruelty against residents of the city , misusing their authority , by engaging in violent actions intended to cause physical injury and to damage property , their objective being to injure , humiliate , and harass …
During their journeys on the streets of the city .
. . the defendants put into the jeep local residents that they came upon by chance and ordered them to jump from the jeep while it was moving .
One of the local persons who refused to do this while the jeep was moving at very high speed was pushed out of the jeep by the defendants , fell onto the road , striking his head , and died as a result …
In addition , the defendants grabbed other local persons and beat them , a club and rifle butt being among the means used , stole property , and threw tear gas and stun grenades at local residents for no reason . ”
On 16 May 2003 , Yediot Aharonot published , in its weekend magazine , an interview with Bassem Wahabi , one of the four defendants .
Wahabi described in detail how they killed Abu Hamdiyeh : “ I drove at 70 - 80 KMH .
I heard Shachar tell the guy , ‘ Get out of the jeep . '
The guy stood in the middle and grabbed the straps on the roof of the jeep .
He was between Shachar and Yanai .
The two of them pushed him out .
He fell onto the road , and I heard his head crack .
I wanted to stop , and then they shouted , ‘ Drive to the base , he 's dead , he 's dead . '
When we got to the base , we coordinated our testimony , so that we would n't incriminate each other . ”
On 6 July 2003 , indictments were filed against eleven other Border Police officers from the same platoon .
They were accused of harassing residents of the city and damaging their property , robbing shops , and beating passersby .
On 22 September 2005 , Bassem Wahabi , the driver of the vehicle , who was quoted above , was convicted of being an accessory to manslaughter and was sentenced to 4½ years ' imprisonment .
On 28 April 2008 , Yanai Lazla , who threw Abu Hamdiya out of the jeep , and was convicted of manslaughter and other offenses , was sentenced to 6 ½ years ' imprisonment .
As noted , on 1 April 2009 , the Supreme Court increased the sentence to 8½ years imprisonment .
The proceedings against the other two defendants continue .
BANGKOK , Thailand ( CNN ) --
Thousands of anti-government protesters Wednesday called for the resignation of the country 's prime minister as they assembled outside three Bangkok locations , including the house of the king 's top adviser and a government building .
Supporters of Thailand 's ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra rally in Bangkok on Wednesday .
The " red shirt " protesters , named for the color of their attire , amassed outside the house of Gen.
Prem Tinsulanonda , the president of the Privy Council , a group of advisers to the country 's king .
Thousands also were rallying outside Government House -- the seat of the Thai government -- and at the Royal Plaza , a public square in Bangkok .
Demonstrations have intensified in recent weeks , helping to destabilize the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva .

By around 6 p.m. ( 7 a.m. ET ) , Pol. Maj. Gen. Suporn Pansuea said the number of protesters had reached 78,000 .
Ahead of Wednesday 's demonstrations , the protesters had said they would draw up to 300,000 people from all over Thailand .
The protesters are loyal to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted in a 2006 coup .
They accuse Prem of masterminding the coup , which he denies .
Thaksin now lives outside of Thailand .
The protesters have said Abhisit 's government was not democratically elected and want him to resign and schedule elections .
Abhisit , who has held the position for four months , has rejected calls for him to step down .
On Tuesday , protesters rushed Abhisit 's motorcade while it was struck in traffic .
He escaped unharmed .
Lawmakers named the 44 - year - old , Oxford University - educated Abhisit prime minister in December in the wake of months of demonstrations against Thaksin and his ruling party , People Power Party .
The protesters opposed to Thaksin took to the streets last year wearing yellow shirts , occupied the Government House and blockaded Bangkok 's major international airport , stranding throngs of tourists who provide much of the country 's revenue .
The demonstrations ended in early December when a court ruled that the People Power Party was guilty of electoral fraud and threw Thaksin 's brother - in - law out of the prime minister 's seat .
The red shirt protesters said this week they would not take over the airports .

All About Thailand • Thaksin Shinawatra
Imagine walking into a coffee shop , corner market or any grocery store with a state - approved cannabis licenseand buying a joint or an ounce of pot , plus tax .
Or imagine growing marijuana in a fenced backyard without fear of arrest .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's surprise call last week to debate legalizing adult use of marijuana in California has drawn international attention , shifting the prospect of such a change from the fringe to the forefront .
Advocates of legalization , including state Assemblyman Tom Ammiano of San Francisco , whose legislation caught the governor 's attention , have created a concept for a system of regulation and taxation that would make the state 's marijuana laws among the most liberal in the world .
" Suddenly this is all open to discussion , " said Oakland attorney James Anthony , who handles land - use and zoning issues for medical marijuana dispensaries in the state .
" When somebody as conservative and cautious as the governor says it 's time to debate ... then we 're in a very different context . "
California , in 1996 , became the nation 's first state to legalize marijuana for medical use , creating a multimillion - dollar industry and scores of dispensaries where residents buy marijuana with a physician 's approval .
Ammiano's proposal , at the least , would allow personal possession and cultivation of as many as 10 plants .
But if the decades - long federal ban on possessing , growing and selling marijuana were repealed , the state law would legalize pot for adults over 21 years old , create a regulatory system and impose a $ 50 - an - ounce sales tax on marijuana , much like taxes on tobacco and alcohol .
Packaged marijuana would be sold from a locked cabinet behind the counter , similar to hard liquor , under the proposal .
The state Board of Equalization , which collects sales and use taxes , expects cannabis prices would drop , use would increase and the state would take in $ 1.3 billion annually in the fees .
The agency estimates that sales of marijuana for medical use now generate $ 18 million a year in taxes .
Ammiano said the state has a history of bucking federal government regulations with its own , and he thinks the Obama administration may be open to reforming federal marijuana - enforcement laws .
Where could pot be sold ?
He has yet to ask for anyone to co-sponsor the legislation , which he plans to move at a deliberate pace over two years .
But if federal laws were changed , Ammiano 's proposal would present intriguing and banal policy questions :
-- Would it be regulated by a state agency , such as the state Alcoholic Beverage Control department , or would local jurisdictions have that power ?
--
What zoning issues would a cannabis license be subject to ?
-- Could local jurisdictions ban the licenses outright - resulting in " dry " areas ?
--
Where marijuana could be sold , whether in specialty stores or everywhere alcohol and tobacco are sold , would also create intense debate .
Would the speciality stores be run by the state , like liquor stores in Idaho and Oregon , or by private citizens ?
' Coffee - shop model '
Richard Lee , president of Oaksterdam University in Oakland , a marijuana dispensary and education group , said he prefers allowing pot sales only in cafes , as is done in Amsterdam .
" I like the coffee - shop model , " Lee said .
" I think it goes well together , like a restaurant that serves alcohol that goes well with a meal . "
Lee said he doubts Schwarzenegger would sign the legislation in its current form , given that the governor has vetoed laws legalizing the growth of industrial hemp and barring employers from firing workers who use marijuana .
Initiative in the works
But he said marijuana advocates are working on a statewide initiative to carry out the goals of Ammiano 's legislation and allow voters to bypass the Legislature as they did in 1996 , with Proposition 215 , which legalized the use of marijuana with a doctor 's permission .
A spokesman for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration said debate over the effects of legalization is good .
But he thinks most people ultimately would side with the status quo .
" I think there are very simplistic catch phrases put out there , " spokesman Garrison Courtney said .
" This is a complex issue and there does need to be discussion about it .
But the thing is , it 's not like there has n't been discussion . "
Feds say crime a problem
He doubted that legalization would push drug cartels out of the state and said the argument that legalization would reduce violence is just " scratching the surface . "
It 's questionable , he said , whether estimated tax revenues would be offset by the costs of regulation and addiction treatment .
Marijuana advocates challenge those assertions and are ready for debate , too .
Oakland attorney Bill Panzer , who helped draft Prop. 215 , says the state should move ahead without consent from the federal government .
" My feeling is the more you put it in the feds ' faces , the more of a chance you have of actually getting somewhere , " Panzer said .
The Face Of A Boy Hearing For The First Time
“ This photo was taken by photographer Jack Bradley and depicts the exact moment this boy , Harold Whittles , hears for the very first time ever .
The doctor treating him has just placed an earpiece in his left ear .
Date unknown . “
Six suspects , one of them a 70 - year old woman , were detained for questioning and released Sunday on suspicion that they preached in favor of dodging the IDF 's draft .
Police say more suspects have been located and will be detained .
Not the First Time Websites on draft - dodging to be probed Aviad Glickman Organizations offering internet advice on how to evade army service to be investigated by attorney general on suspicion of incitement against IDF ; group members say they operate legally , merely provide information Websites on draft - dodging to be probed
During the searches in homes located in various cities , including Ramat Hasharon and Jerusalem , officers confiscated computers and other materials related to draft - dodging .
Police plan to use the material in order to charge the suspects .
A 70 - year old woman who was among the suspects detained told Ynet she had no regrets .
" Four policemen arrived at my home at 7 am but I was n't home .
My husband opened the door for them and they took two computers ; mine and my husband's .
They took some stickers and then summoned me for questioning , " she said .
" I 'm not nervous about this because my conscience is clear .
We do n't incite .
Everything we do is legal , and that 's what I told them during the interrogation .
I 'm calm .
I do n't know what they will claim , but you can sense a lack of democracy in the air , " the woman added .
New Profile , on its part , stated that it was a public and fully legal establishment and that the interrogation violated freedom of speech .
" The militarization of Israeli society harms the sacred principles of democracy , freedom of speech , and political freedom .
For people who thought that only Israeli - Arabs were being framed for criminal political activity , this morning was proof that none of us can be sure of the permission to express ourselves freely regarding the failings of Israel 's society and regime , " the statement said .
Gene mutations tend to be more common in older fathers Children of older fathers perform less well in a range of brainpower tests during infancy and early childhood , a study found .
In contrast , children with older mothers did well on the tests , which assessed abilities such as memory , learning and concentration .
Experts believe mutations in a man 's sperm , which build over time , may be a factor .
The University of Queensland study appears in the journal PLoS Medicine .
Nature intended us to have our children earlier in our lives than we currently are
Dr Allan Pacey
University of Sheffield
The age at which men and women are having children is increasing in the developed world .
But while the effect of increasing maternal age on reduced fertility is widely known , the impact of increased paternal age is not as well established .
However , older fathers have been linked to a range of health problems , including an increased risk of birth deformities , autism and neuropsychiatric conditions , such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder .
The Queensland team analysed data on 33,437 children born between 1959 and 1965 in the US .
Each child was given a range of tests of cognitive function at eight months , four years , and seven years .
The researchers adjusted their study to take account of socio-economic factors , such as family income and parental education .
They found that the older the father , the more likely the child was to have lower scores on the various tests .
In contrast , the older the mother the higher the scores of the child in the cognitive tests .
Nurturing environment Previous researchers have suggested children of older mothers may perform better because they experience a more nurturing home environment .
But the latest study suggests this might not be the case in relation to fathers .
Genetic factors are likely to be key , as there is evidence that genetic mutations become more widespread in a man 's sperm as he ages .
But the Queensland team said the impact of social factors could also not be ruled out , although they said a child would usually benefit socioeconomically from having an older father , with better access to health and educational services .
The researchers , led by Dr John McGrath , wrote : " Given the trend towards older maternal and paternal ages in the developing world , policy - makers may want to consider promoting an awareness of the risks to children that this study associates with delayed fatherhood . "
Dr Allan Pacey , an expert in fertility at the University of Sheffield , said : " We have known for some time that the children born from older fathers are at increased risk of a number of medical problems and this is almost certainly because as men get older the sperm production gets less efficient and their sperm have a higher number of genetic defects .
" The author 's observation that most neurocognitive outcomes is also reduced in the children of older fathers provides a further piece of evidence to remind us that nature intended us to have our children earlier in our lives than we currently are . "

Digging through a series of patent documents I discovered alternate design documents for the Wii Remote , Nunchuk , and Classic Controller .
The hardware is finalized now , but looking back at what could have been is pretty neat !
One early nunchuck design is shaped like a block .
Does n’t look comfortable to hold either compared to the ergonomic nunchuck in stores .
One version of the Classic Controller is n’t very “ classic ” .
The controller with two analog sticks on the side looks like it ’s made for Katamari Damacy and not much else .
I would n’t want to play any Virtual Console games with a cramped D - pad and face button layout .
Here ’s where we have a lot of variation .
One Wii remote had an analog stick instead of face buttons .
Another design has a flat directional pad .
And then there is a conceptual Wii remote with two extra buttons .
I wonder what Nintendo planned to use those for .
Do any of these scrapped designs look good or better than the final Wii remote ?
Woah !
Movie Monsters !
Oh HELL yeah !
I love me some movie monsters !
There is n’t a movie out there that could not be made that much better by the inclusion of a movie monster or two .
Titanic ?
Damn straight !
A capsizing ship tossing victims to the sea like so many toy dolls is one thing , but mix in the creature from , say , Deep Star 6 and you ’ve got something !
At least then that whiny bitch , Leo De-Crappy - O could have perished a little more sweetly than just freezing to death .
Pussy .
Gone With The Wind ?
Oh you know that massive mansion fire on the plantation was caused by Mecha - Godzilla !
Well , I do love monsters , but I also had to put up a few stipulations to this collection or else I ’d be amassing fifty of them , and that ’s just too big .
So here you will see ‘ creatures ’ as a general term .
This does , however , not include Vampires , Aliens , or Lycanthropes .
Nor does this list include slashers and murderers as ‘ creatures ’ , except in one instance you ’ll see later … but this instance is also a monster , not just a killer .
So , with that , here are the sixteen coolest Movie Monsters of all time .
Bigfoot ( Harry Henderson )
On their way home to Seattle from a hunting trip , the Hendersons accidentally run over a strange and unknown creature .
Unsure what else to do , they strap it to the roof of their car and take it home .
Once there , the revived creature goes wild , rampaging throughout the house .
Eventually , the family realizes that the creature is the legendary Bigfoot , and is actually very gentle .
Given the name “ Harry ” , the creature ’s curiosity leads him to escape , running through the city as sightings of him strike fear into the populace ( and greed into the heart of one French Canadian ) .
Trying to hide Harry from the Seattle authorities and the hunter who wants his hide , the Hendersons come to realize that the best thing for Harry is to return him to his home in the wilderness .
* SOB * So sad …
Swamp Thing
Swamp
Thing is a fictional character ( as opposed to those real , lumbering plant - people ) , and according to the good folks at Wikipedia : ‘a plant elemental published by DC Comics
He first appeared in House of Secrets # 92 ( July 1971 ) , and was created by Len Wein and Berni Wrightson .
The character is a humanoid mass of vegetable matter who fights to protect his swamp home , the environment in general , and humanity from various supernatural or terrorist threats . ’
The movie , starring the voluptuous Adrienne Barbeau was just about as funny as it was kick ass and inundated HBO back in the early eighties .
Ghidra
Created as an opponent for Godzilla , Wikipedia says , ‘ Ghidorah ( Ghidra ) is a golden dragon - like monster with two legs , three heads on long necks , bat - like wings , and two tails .
It was said to be 100 meters tall with a 150 - meter wingspan and to weigh nearly 30,000 metric tons .
King Ghidorah was brought to life on the movie screen by a stunt actor inside an elaborate three - piece costume , with a team of puppeteers to control the beast ’s many appendages .
Its alarming shrieks — a different ringing pitch for each of its heads — are among the genre ’s most recognizable sound effects . ’
Yeah , he kicks ass .
The Creeper ( Jeepers Creepers )
Wikipedia says : ‘ The Creeper is an ancient demonic creature , usually dressed in long , tattered duster and face - concealing cowboy hat .
In the first film , he also wears heavy boots .
In the sequel he appears barefoot , revealing slightly bird - like talons which he uses to pick up his victims .
The Creeper has mottled green and brown skin , and a pair of wing - like mandibles or skin flaps are located on each side of his face .
He also has a huge pair of bat - like wings on his back , which fold up tightly enough that they are completely unnoticeable underneath his coat .
The Creeper drives an old truck with a license plate that reads BEATNGU , which is first interpreted as “ beating you , ” but later read as “ be eating you ” in the first movie . ’
That ’s cool .
The Graboids ( Tremors )
Graboids are depicted as subterranean animals , and as Wikipedia informs us : ‘ superficially resembling gigantic worms with long , serpentine bodies .
When fully grown , a mature graboid will measure up to 30 feet long , and 6 feet across at their widest point , and weigh 10 - 20 tons .
Graboids completely lack eyes ; they do n’t need them , thanks to underground life .
Their heads consist of a massive , black , armored beak , which is used to push aside the dirt as it digs .
The beak opens up like a grotesque flower ; it consists of a wide upper jaw , a thinner lower jaw , and a pair of hooked mandibles on either side .
Whether they possess a skeleton or not is unknown , though a faux scientific document written by the SciFi channel hypotheses they have a semi- rigid internal structure , similar to the internal workings of a cuttlefish .
Graboids have a trio of long , powerful , serpent - like tentacles , which are prehensile and have a reach of at least ten feet . ’
The Creature
From the Wikipedia entry , ‘ The Gill - man is fully amphibious capable of breathing both in and out of the water .
As shown in the first film , it is vulnerable to Rotenone .
The Gill - man ’s scaly skin is extremely tough , which combined with a fast acting healing factor , allows it to survive wounds which would be fatal to humans , such as gunshots and full immolation .
As shown in the third film , the creature ’s body will automatically develop lungs should its gills be irreparably damaged . ’
Rodan
Another of Godzilla ’s rogues gallery , Wikipedia says : ‘ Rodan ’s primary weapons are his speed and agility ; he can create hurricane - force winds in his wake by flying at supersonic speeds at low altitude .
He also uses his beak and talons effectively in battle , the former being depicted as sharp enough to smash through rocks , and his wings despite their delicate appearance , are quite durable .
Rodan possesses great physical strength , able to lift and carry monsters heavier than himself , as seen in Invasion of Astro - Monster , when he was shown to lift Godzilla high into the air , and knock King Ghidorah to the ground in a mid-air collision .
He also could emit a blast of wind from his mouth in the 1956 movie , but this concept was never used again . ’
Too bad , it was really cool .
Frankenstein ’s Monster
When Dr. Frankenstein decided he needed to prove the theory that he could re-animate deceased human flesh , his collection of body parts and a less - than perfect brain proved to be a formidable beast indeed .
Never truly angry , only easily upset , the monster eventually escaped the castle and set out on his own only to discover gentleness and the frailty of human life in a little blind girl , and the inherent disgust of anything unknown by man as a whole .
Never scary , but always grotesque , Frankenstein ’s Monster learned more valuable lessons as a living - dead than he would have anytime alive .
The Balrog
Wikipedia tells us what we all already know : ‘ Balrogs were tall , menacing humanoid beings , with the ability to shroud themselves in fire , darkness , and shadow .
They frequently appeared armed with fiery whips of many thongs .
In Tolkien ’s later conception , they could not be casually destroyed : significant power was required .
Only dragons rivaled their capacity for ferocity and destruction , and during the First Age they were among the most feared of Morgoth ’s forces . ’
“ Thou shall not pass ! ”
The Stay - Puft Marshmallow Man
When told by Gozer that any thought , any idea , any picture in the mind would ultimately prove the destruction of the Ghostbusters , Peter yells for everyone to clear his mind and not to think of anything .
Leave it to Peter to nearly bring on the downfall of the entire city with one innocent thought .
The rest is history .
King Kong
The gigantic ape - like simian from Skull Island was , stupidly , brought to the States to make the discoverers money and fame .
But , as most ridiculous schemes go , this one ended with a monster on the loose bashing buildings and whacking planes out of the sky .
Despite his massive size and cinder - block like intelligence , Kong was ultimately defeated and felled by a woman .
Nice metaphor , there , huh ?
Mothra
Well Wikipedia sure says it best : “ Mothra has proven a formidable adversary in combat : in larval form she may use her silken spray to wrap and immobilize an opponent , and has a knack for biting and clinging to foes ’ tails .
In imago form her powers vary widely from film to film , including very animalistic scratching and dragging , incorporating several bolt and beam weapons in the ‘ Heisei Era ’ , and often concluding with a poisonous yellow powder ( or “ scales ” ) — her last defense .
Mothra is one of the most powerful psychics in the Toho universe .
She has had the ability to use this power benevolently , to communicate with humans , or defensively , to destroy her enemies .
As suggested earlier , Mothra is assumed to be divine and draws many parallels to the Phoenix , which makes her one of the more powerful kaiju of the Toho universe .
Mothra has become one of Godzilla ’s most challenging opponents , having achieved the greatest success rate in battle of any of his foes . ”
Gamera
Gamera ’s size rivals that of his famous Japanese counterpart , Godzilla .
And I ’ll leave the rest to Wikipedia : ‘ Unlike any other species of giant turtle ( ha ha ) , Gamera has the habit of walking upright on two legs rather than on all fours , though he occasionally walked ‘ normally ’ in his first three films .
Gamera was capable of using his upper limbs in the same manner as Godzilla , as his forelegs had appendages much closer in construction to hands than feet , and was capable of grappling with opponents and manipulating objects .
His mouth was filled with teeth , which no species of turtle has had since prehistoric times ( so it ’s got that realism going for it ) , with a pair of large tusks protruding upward from his lower jaw .
Gamera is also usually seen with very large human - like eyes , adding intelligence to his overall appearance . ’
Oh , and he had rockets .
From his shell .
So cool .
The Cloverfield Monster
Scarcely fully seen even when it was coming at the poor camera man head - on , the Cloverfield Monster evidently emerged from the Hudson bay off of New York city , beheading the Statue of Liberty on its way in .
If its grotesque and unstoppable appearance were n’t bad enough , it had little ‘ barnacle ’ type organisms all over its hide that sprung loose and quickly attacked and killed as many hapless humans as they could .
It was large enough to swipe down the side of a building with one crab - like arm and powerful enough to withstand military firepower .
It was a shambling mess of malformed bits and pieces and had almost as complete a conscience .
That is to say , very little .
The Kraken
Released from his underwater cage by Neptune under the orders of Zeus , the Kraken was as fierce as monsters come .
His arrival alone cause a massive tidal wave to flood the land , and then he was there on a mission of complete mayhem and obliteration .
Fortunately , Perseus and his trusty steed , Pegasus - along with the assistance of one tinny , golden owl - used the severed head of Medusa to turn the beast to stone thereby shattering his delusions of grandeur and sending him , in pieces , back to his watery tomb .
Godzilla
The unmatched king of the monsters , Wikipedia says , ‘ Godzilla ’s appearance has changed over the years , but many of his characteristics have remained constant .
His roar has remained the same , only changing in pitch , as has his approximate appearance : a giant , mutant dinosaur with rough , bumpy charcoal gray scales , a long powerful tail , and jagged , bone colored dorsal fins .
Godzilla ’s iconic character design is a blended chimera inspired by various prehistoric reptiles , gleaned from children ’s dinosaur books and illustrations from an issue of Life magazine : Godzilla has the head and lower body of a Tyrannosaurus , a triple row of dorsal plates reminiscent of a Stegosaurus , the neck and forearms of Iguanodon and the tail and skin texture of a crocodile . ’
Sounds like a far deadlier version of Pete ’s Dragon .
The speed of light , one of the most sacrosanct of the universal physical constants , may have been lower as recently as two billion years ago – and not in some far corner of the universe , but right here on Earth .
The controversial finding is turning up the heat on an already simmering debate , especially since it is based on re-analysis of old data that has long been used to argue for exactly the opposite : the constancy of the speed of light and other constants .
A varying speed of light contradicts Einstein ’s theory of relativity , and would undermine much of traditional physics .
But some physicists believe it would elegantly explain puzzling cosmological phenomena such as the nearly uniform temperature of the universe .
It might also support string theories that predict extra spatial dimensions .
The fine structure constant
The threat to the idea of an invariable speed of light comes from measurements of another parameter called the fine structure constant , or alpha , which dictates the strength of the electromagnetic force .
The speed of light is inversely proportional to alpha , and though alpha also depends on two other constants ( see graphic ) , many physicists tend to interpret a change in alpha as a change in the speed of light .
It is a valid simplification , says Victor Flambaum of the University of New South Wales in Sydney .
Advertisement
It was Flambaum , along with John Webb and colleagues , who first seriously challenged alpha ’s status as a constant in 1998 .
Then , after exhaustively analysing how the light from distant quasars was absorbed by intervening gas clouds , they claimed in 2001 that alpha had increased by a few parts in 105 in the past 12 billion years .
Natural nuclear reactor
But then German researchers studying photons emitted by caesium and hydrogen atoms reported earlier in June that they had seen no change in alpha to within a few parts in 1015 over the period from 1999 to 2003 ( New Scientist , 26 June ) though the result does not rule out that alpha was changing billions of years ago .
Throughout the debate , physicists who argued against any change in alpha have had one set of data to fall back on .
It comes from the world ’s only known natural nuclear reactor , found at Oklo in Gabon , West Africa .
The Oklo reactor started up nearly two billion years ago when groundwater filtered through crevices in the rocks and mixed with uranium ore to trigger a fission reaction that was sustained for hundreds of thousands of years .
Several studies that have analysed the relative concentrations of radioactive isotopes left behind at Oklo have concluded that nuclear reactions then were much the same as they are today , which implies alpha was the same too .
That is because alpha directly influences the ratio of these isotopes .
In a nuclear chain reaction like the one that occurred at Oklo , the fission of each uranium - 235 nucleus produces neutrons , and nearby nuclei can capture these neutrons .
For example , samarium - 149 captures a neutron to become samarium - 150 , and since the rate of neutron capture depends on the value of alpha , the ratio of the two samarium isotopes in samples collected from Oklo can be used to calculate alpha .
A number of studies done since Oklo was discovered have found no change in alpha over time .
“ People started quoting the reactor [ data ] as firm evidence that the constants had n’t changed , ” says Steve Lamoreaux of Los Alamos National Lab ( LANL ) in Los Alamos , New Mexico .
Energy spectrum
Now , Lamoreaux , along with LANL colleague Justin Torgerson , has re-analysed the Oklo data using what he says are more realistic figures for the energy spectrum of the neutrons present in the reactor .
The results have surprised him .
Alpha , it seems , has decreased by more than 4.5 parts in 108 since Oklo was live ( Physical Review D , vol 69 , p121701 ) .
That translates into a very small increase in the speed of light ( assuming no change in the other constants that alpha depends on ) , but Lamoreaux ’s new analysis is so precise that he can rule out the possibility of zero change in the speed of light .
“ It ’s pretty exciting , ” he says .
So far the re-examination of the Oklo data has not drawn any fire .
“ The analysis is fine , ” says Thibault Damour of the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies ( IHES ) in Bures - sur - Yvette in France , who co-authored a 1996 Oklo study that found no change in alpha .
Peter Moller of LANL , who , along with Japanese researchers , published a paper in 2000 about the Oklo reactor that also found no change in alpha , says that Lamoreaux ’s assumptions are reasonable .
The analysis might be sound , and the assumptions reasonable , but some physicists are reluctant to accept the conclusions .
“ I ca n’t see a particular mistake , ” says Flambaum .
“ However , the claim is so revolutionary there should be many independent confirmations . ”
While Flambaum ’s own team found that alpha was different 12 billion years ago , the new Oklo result claims that alpha was changing as late as two billion years ago .
If other methods confirm the Oklo finding , it will leave physicists scrambling for new theories .
“ It ’s like opening a gateway , ” says Dmitry Budker , a colleague of Lamoreaux ’s at the University of California at Berkeley .
Horizon problem
Some physicists would happily accept a variable alpha .
For example , if it had been lower in the past , meaning a higher speed of light , it would solve the “ horizon problem ” .
Cosmologists have struggled to explain why far - flung regions of the universe are at roughly the same temperature .
It implies that these regions were once close enough to exchange energy and even out the temperature , yet current models of the early universe prevent this from happening , unless they assume an ultra - fast expansion right after the big bang .
However , a higher speed of light early in the history of the universe would allow energy to pass between these areas in the form of light .
Variable “ constants ” would also open the door to theories that used to be off limits , such as those which break the laws of conservation of energy .
And it would be a boost to versions of string theory in which extra dimensions change the constants of nature at some places in space - time .
But “ there is no accepted varying - alpha theory ” , warns Flambaum .
Instead , there are competing theories , from those that predict a linear rate of change in alpha , to those that predict rapid oscillations .
John Barrow , who has pioneered varying - alpha theories at the University of Cambridge , says that the latest
Oklo result does not favour any of the current theories .
“ You would expect alpha to stop [ changing ] five to six billion years ago , ” he says .
Reaction rate
Before Lamoreaux ’s
Oklo study can count in favour of any varying alpha theory , there are some issues to be addressed .
For one , the exact conditions at Oklo are not known .
Nuclear reactions run at different rates depending on the temperature of the reactor , which Lamoreaux assumed was between 227 and 527°C .
Damour says the temperature could vary far more than this .
“ You need to reconstruct the temperature two billion years ago deep down in the ground , ” he says .
Damour also argues that the relative concentrations of samarium isotopes may not be as well determined as Lamoreaux has assumed , which would make it impossible to rule out an unchanging alpha .
But Lamoreaux points out that both assumptions about the temperature of the Oklo reactor and the ratio of samarium isotopes were accepted in previous Oklo studies .
Another unknown is whether other physical constants might have varied along with , or instead of , alpha .
Samarium - 149 ’s ability to capture a neutron also depends on another constant , alpha(s ) , which governs the strength of the strong nuclear attraction between the nucleus and the neutron .
And in March , Flambaum claimed that the ratio of different elements left over from just after the big bang suggests that alpha(s ) must have been different then compared with its value today ( Physical Review D , vol 69 , p 063506 ) .
While Lamoreaux has not addressed any possible change in alpha(s ) in his Oklo study , he argues that it is important to focus on possible changes in alpha because the Oklo data has become such a benchmark in the debate over whether alpha can vary .
“ I ’ve spent my career going back and checking things that are ‘ known ’ and it always leads to new ideas , ” he says .
DETROIT – About 15 metres before a car from Canada reaches the border inspection booth , the screenings begin .
A camera snaps your licence plate .
An electronic card reader mounted on a yellow post scans your car for the presence of any radio - frequency ID cards inside .
If there is an enhanced driver 's licence embedded with biometric information , its unique PIN number is read without you offering it .
The Customs and Border Protection computer connects with your province 's database and in less than a second – .56 to be exact – your personal information is uploaded to a screen in the booth .
A second camera snaps the driver 's face .
Welcome to the United States of America .
If Canadians were under the impression that the Canada - loving U.S. President Barack Obama would heed pleas to loosen border controls to ease trade and traffic , there should no longer be any confusion .
He has not .
Beginning June 1 , you 'd better have that passport ready .
Or if you have an enhanced driver 's licence from British Columbia , Manitoba or Quebec , make sure it's in your wallet , ready to show .
( Ontario is now processing applications for the cards . )
Some Canadian MPs , border state lawmakers and Detroit - Windsor area businesses expect the worst when the new controls kick in .
" Either it 's going to cause a massive backup , or it's going to cause a dramatic decrease in travellers across the border , or it's going to cause both , " says Melissa Roy of the Detroit Regional Chamber , the largest chamber of commerce organization in the U.S.
" It 's an absolute nightmare . "
Obama 's top officials – Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton – signed off long ago on the June 1 deadline for the infamous Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative .
That 's the George W. Bush - era policy that Congress pushed through under the 9/11 intelligence reform bill , which requires every person entering the United States by air , sea or land to carry a passport or U.S. government - approved secure identity document .
Napolitano says Canadians had better get used to it .
" The future is that there will be a real border , " she told a trade group last month .
This is what that border already looks like :
A post -mounted scanner screens your vehicle for radioactive material that could be used to build a " dirty bomb " – a probe so sensitive it will detect if you 've recently had a medical test that used isotopes .
As you pull up to the booth , a computer monitor may be filling with information about you , even before the guard asks , " Where are you coming from ?
What 's your citizenship ?
Where are you headed ?
Why ? "
If a border lookout , arrest warrant or criminal record pops up on the guard 's screen , or if something does n't quite add up – maybe you 're sweating bullets on a cold day – expect to get hauled over for a secondary inspection .
The port of entry at the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit – the busiest commercial land crossing in North America , through which a quarter of all Canada - U.S. trade passes – has strict controls , as does the Detroit - Windsor tunnel .
Border agents , packing pepper spray , collapsible batons and 9 - mm automatic pistols , are the first point of contact for people and cargo alike .
Sometimes their supervisors order vehicle sweeps at random .
Then for 30 minutes , agents will pop every trunk , just for a look - see .
Down below the 80 - year - old bridge , dozens of long - haul transport trailers are queued up to go through the same checks , and possibly pass through a giant gamma-ray screening facility that peers inside suspicious 18 - wheelers .
Between the legal crossing points , all along the Canada - U.S. border , there 's a new reality .
While the U.S. is not constructing an 1,100 - kilometre fence between itself and Canada , as it is doing along its southern border with Mexico , the makings of a virtual fence are in place along what was once known as the world 's longest undefended border .

High in the sky over North Dakota , an unmanned Predator drone is on patrol , equipped with an infrared security camera that looks forward 24 kilometres .
The drone is not authorized to fly in Canadian airspace , but it can peer across into Manitoba .
Another one is to be stationed near Detroit next year to scan the Michigan - Ontario boundary .
More daytime and nighttime infrared camera , radar surveillance towers and remote motion sensors are being erected across the northern U.S. border with Canada .
And there are more boots on the ground than ever .
Before 9/11 , the U.S. had 340 Border Patrol agents along its Canadian border .
By next year , there will be more than 2,000 .
The Detroit — Port Huron — Sault Ste. Marie regional border patrol operation boasts a fleet of prop planes , small helicopters , a bigger Black Hawk helicopter , speedboats , Coast Guard vessels , even a small Cessna Citation jet .
In Windsor , it makes MPs like the NDP's Brian Masse nervous about " the militarization of the border . "
He points to the helicopters and drones , and Canada 's willingness to accept U.S. Coast Guard training exercises on the Great Lakes , where boats are equipped with machine guns that fire more than 600 bullets a minute .
It 's all " really changed the nature of the border itself , " Masse says .
Edward Alden , an American journalist and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington , wrote The Closing of the American Border , which documented the toll of overzealous border policies on the U.S. economy .
He argues " the biggest mistake of the post - 9/11 period " was the decision to blur the lines between the fight against terrorism and the fight against illegal immigration .
Alden does not see any evidence of change under Obama .
Democrats do n't want to be seen as soft on homeland security , and have been " hawkish since Day One . "
But they also are under pressure by a strong Hispanic voting bloc to treat the southern and northern border with what Napolitano calls " parity . "
Chief Ron Smith , public affairs liaison for Customs and Border Protection in Detroit , concedes that when it comes to the northern border , " A lot of people overstate the security threat .
If somebody 's trying to sneak into the United States along the northern border , it does n't mean they are a terrorist .
We get people trying to sneak across the northern border for the same reasons people try to sneak across the southern border . "

Anti-immigration activists Tuesday tried to link the brutal beating and rape of a Hamden woman who worked in New Haven with the fact that the suspect may be an illegal immigrant .
“ They are members of our community , ” he said of immigrants .
“ If they see a crime , they should report it .
We expect them to work and be part of the fabric of our community , ” he said .
After the formal news conference , DeSefano bristled at a question about a perceived link between poverty and crime and whether New Haven is perceived as having the welcome mat out for illegal immigrants , who may be poorer than other groups .
Several times , he testily asked who was saying that .
He said the suspect was employed .
“ This is a personal act ” and has nothing to do with the group to which the suspect belongs , the mayor said of the crime .
He said people do not commit crimes because of the racial or ethnic group to which they belong .
Mayor John DeStefano Jr. said there is no correlation between crime and the doubling in recent years of people living here without legal permission in recent years .
“ There is no evidence that crime is linked to place of birth , ” he said .
Although the protesters could have fit into a telephone booth , if such still existed on Temple Street , the mayor felt they “ needed to be confronted and be shown for what they are . ”
The group has also called for abolishing of the mayor ’s city identification card .
Read about card protests here .
Temple Grill ’s host on duty Tuesday night , who refused to give his name , said the victim is doing better but declined to answer any more questions .
The protesters reportedly accused Mayor John DeStefano of having “ blood on his hands ” because of his immigration - friendly policies , including the Elm City Resident ID card .
Authorities are investigating whether or not the alleged attacker in this case has legal permission to be in the country .
According to the city , he did not have one of the ID cards .
A 26 - year - old New Haven remains behind bars in lieu of $ 2.5 million bond in connection with the crime .
The 25 - year - old victim , who was beaten and sexually assaulted several times , has improved enough to speak with police , according to a report in Tuesday ’s New Haven Register .
The pair worked together at the Temple Grill .
The attack took place last weekend when the man asked the woman for a ride home after work .
Fewer than three hours after two activists briefly picketed the Temple Grill in downtown New Haven , the visibly upset New Haven mayor told a small group of reporters that the protesters ’ purpose was to perpetuate “ the falsehood of an immigrant crime wave in the city . ”

" There is no evidence that crime is linked to place of birth , " Who is claiming this ?
I have not read anywhere where anyone claimed any particular nationality is more likely to commit criminal acts .

Mr mayor it doesnt matter , hes in this country illegaly .
Stop trying to apease the latin community like you care about the aliens , its about votes and cheap labor .
Why cant the people see through this big front .
Posted by : True New Havener | April 1 , 2009 9:55 AM
Contrast this to the Mayor of East Haven .
To stand up now as a politician is a brave thing , even if it is to just state the obvious , that genetics does not cause crime .
Kudos to the Mayor .
In the Register , the TWO anti-immigrant nuts referred to undocumented immigrants in our town as " monsters " and a " horde . "
How disgusting to use such a tragic and awful act to spread their hate .
It 's important to stand up against hate .
I 'm glad we have a Mayor who does so .
It 's too bad that the press was so interested in covering a protest by TWO nutjobs that the Mayor actually had to do so .

Do n't get me wrong a crime has been commented , and we pray for the speedy recovery of the victim .
And an investigation to the crime and justice to be served .
However , lets not use this event as a blanket characterization of a community of people .

Thank You MR .
Mayor ,
Thats what leaders are suppose to do standup for whats right and speak agaisnt whats wrong .
You could have stayed home , but you knew that the attack on an entire community due to this unfortunate event is wrong .
We the voters support you in this case .
Readers do n't support hate .
Standup for whats right .

If a person is in the country illegally , does n't that mean they are breaking a law ?
If someone is willing to break one law , it is reasonable to belive that they are willing to break other laws .
Just because you do n't agree with a law does n't mean it is acceptable to break it .
Also , if someone is here illegally and , for example , an employer knows it , the employer can then take advantage of that individual and break laws ( minimum wage , safe work conditions , etc ) I believe the majority of Americans have no problem with immigration , that 's how most of us got here .
We just prefer it to be done legally .
When done legally it works better for all involved .

" Give me your tired , your poor ,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore .
Send these , the homeless , tempest - tossed to me ,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door ! "
... Nowhere in this is the word " criminal . "
" Wretched refuse " and " homeless " are not understood to mean " criminals . "
The above comment that " a blanket characterization of a community of people " is " wrong " is right on the money .
However , it is exactly the stubborn refusal of govt .
( both Rep. AND Dem. ) to create AND ENFORCE reasonable standards of legal immigration that leads to this " blanket characterization . "
It 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " for the entire country .
Anyone who thinks all illegals are harmless and innocent is blind or naive -- or does n't read the news very often .
From hit - and - run accidents , to assaults and murders , to molestations , illegals are proportionally represented .
If the public felt trust in our govt .
that immigrants as a whole were properly vetted and documented , there WOULD NOT BE a negative characterization of them as a group .
It is precisely the " unknown " nature of them that sparks fear .
What Mayor DeStefano does n't get is that his idiosyncratic notion of " sanctuary city " coupled with an " us vs. them " attitude toward people who disagree with him is actually HURTING the very people he purports to help by creating an environment of fear and suspicion of immigrants .
We 're not stupid , Mayor .
We know that crime is not linked to birthplace !
But conversely , we do n't need to IMPORT more criminals -- we have enough here already .
If the mayor really wanted to be effective in advocating for the innocent immigrants , he would be promoting better clarification of immigration law , better documentation ( background checks ) , high standards for citizenship , and better enforcement .
In the long run , that would all lead to less fear and more trust -- and better assimilation for all newbies .
( But in the short term a few less votes for Hizzoner ? )

Look Mr Logic ,
What we are talking about is the blanket judgement of an entire community base on an incident where a member of that community is the suspect .
Americans are suspected of crimes in other countires everyday , shoulds we all be judged base on the actions of one indiviual .
Thats what we are talking about today .
Address the hate issue if you can .
Say it its wrong .

Westville Mom with all the respects .
Can you backup your statement up :
" From hit - and - run accidents , to assaults and murders , to molestations , illegals are proportionally represented "
Did you get that from resharch you or someone else did or are you simply projecting your fears .
"
Anyone who thinks all illegals are harmless and innocent is blind or naive - - or does n't read the news very often " .
Again you are judgeing an entire community of people based on what you read in the media .
The mayor has called for immigration reform .
in the meantime he wants all immigrants to be treated with diginity and respect is that to much to ask for in a " civilized society .
Ma
No matter how you cut it hate is hate and its bad .
I hope you are not teaching your children that .
remember treat other how you want to be treated .
Tell them that .

This will no doubt be resolved in court .
If the alleged rapist is an illegal immigrant , and if he has a city ID card , and if he is convicted in a court of law , then I belive this poor victim will have a very good case of collecting substantial damages from the city for encouraging him to be here , and increasing the risk of violence to its citizens .
I would most strongly urge her or her family to contact an attorney immediately .
Posted by : Westville Mom | April 1 , 2009 10:14 PM
ILoveThisCountry : I 'm sorry you do n't take the time to read very carefully .
Look up the word " proportionally . "
It refers to the implication that " illegal " criminals are in the same proportion ( ratio ) to their population as American criminals are to theirs .
( uh ... that would be as in " equal " . )
That 's no excuse , however , for them not being screened , checked , investigated , vetted , documented - - use whatever term you wish .
They should n't be here .
Period .
And since a " sanctuary city " -- by definition -- intentionally rejects this screening ( and its consequences ) , I would say the city bears at least some responsibility for the crimes committed by its illegals .
Pretty simple , really .
If a school district does n't do background checks ( intentionally and deliberately ) and allows a convicted molester to work in a school -- and a crime occurs -- is the school district not responsible ?
It 's the same logic .
I 'm just wondering when someone is going to get the idea to sue these cities ... in cases where the criminal has a " record " , of course .
Having said that , I understand that there will probably be a time ( again ) in this country when amnesty is granted and " illegals " will become " legal . "
I 'm just saying that not ALL are worthy .
Bad guys are bad guys and they should be thrown OUT .
BTW --a " civilized society " IS a society that upholds and enforces its democratically enacted laws fairly and without discrimination .
I 'm fed up with living in an " uncivilized " city that appears to be becoming more so every day .

" From hit - and - run accidents . . . illegals are proportionally represented " Westville Mom -- I imagine you mean disproportionally repreented .
If so , I do n't know if this statement is true .
But if it is , did you think that it might because of the relatively recent idiotic REAL ID
Act that stops states from giving driver 's licenses ( and hence insurance ) to people without immigration status .
If we want to live in a safe country - one that is not blind to the fact that 15 million people live amongst us without immigration status - then states should be allowed to give driver 's licenses out , without checking immigration status .
What on earth does immigration status have to do with driving anyway ?
( one is federal , the other state ; they really are n't related anyhow ) .
These people are here ; we 're not going to deport them , whether or not you want to .
So let 's stop acting like idiots .

The New Haven ID card is in violation of US Immigration law which gives criminal penalities to anyone who induces an illegal alien to enter , reside or work in the United States .
It is that simple .
The New Haven ID card was promoted as an inducement to reside in the United States .
Under Federal Law , the mayor , his staff and those that created and promoted this card , are subject to fines and imprisonment .
The problem is that no one enforces the law at the border , the laws against employment , the laws against housing illegals and the creation of such inducements as the New Haven ID Card .
Clearly , if you are inducing illegals to come into the United States , and remain in New Haven , you become responsible for their subsequent actions .
They could not commit crimes in the United States , unless they were here .
The mayor and the City of New Have have clearly accomodated these illegal aliens .
It is well known that illegal aliens commit crimes at a higher rate than American citizens and one does not have to search the internet very hard to find murders , rapes , assaults and vehicular homicides committed by illegal aliens .
This vicious assault was a crime waiting to happen , and the New Haven ID card was both negligent of the dangers , and a contributory factor .
Because this is a criminal issue , and criminal behavior on the part of the mayor and his staff that has contributed to this horrific assault , the victim has a good chance of millions in restitution coming from the City , Yale University ( whose professor gave legal advice on the card ) , the city councilmen and the adminstrators .
This is personal liability because the normal protections given a government employee do not apply to criminal behavior .
If this person is convicted , and is illegal , the mayor , the officials , the administrators , and Yale University will be facing millions in law suits as contributors to this crime , not by criminal negligence , but by criminal behavior that was a contributing factor to the attack on this woman .
They also face the possibility of criminal charges and years in jail , if and when , we find an adminstration that is willing to enforce federal immigration law .

Borist , I do n't know when your grandparents arrived , or where they came from , but even when I was growing up in the 1970s , it was n't uncommon to have friends whose grandparents spoke only Italian , or Greek , or German -- which is not to deny that they went to work and paid their taxes .
To compare immigration today to immigration 50 , 60 , or 100 years ago is just silly .
For one thing , as has been capably explained in these pages ( see ' Native American 's ' comment to an earlier story about Father Manship ) the numbers show that ' illegal ' immigrants contribute their fair share to the national coffers , while taking much less than their fair share in entitlements .
Second , the romantic picture of plucky Europeans arriving at Ellis Island with their grips and valises comes from an entirely different world than we live in today -- and you do n't really think that people were n't pouring over the Mexican border then , do you ?

One in every 31 adults , or 7.3 million Americans , is in prison , on parole or probation , at a cost to the states of $ 47 billion in 2008 , according to a new study .
Criminal correction spending is outpacing budget growth in education , transportation and public assistance , based on state and federal data .
Only Medicaid spending grew faster than state corrections spending , which quadrupled in the past two decades , according to the report Monday by the Pew Center on the States , the first breakdown of spending in confinement and supervision in the past seven years .
The increases in the number of people in some form of correctional control occurred as crime rates declined by about 25 percent in the past two decades .
As states face huge budget shortfalls , prisons , which hold 1.5 million adults , are driving the spending increases .
April 13 , 2009  --
At least one former SEAL was not surprised that each of the three Somali pirates was killed with just one shot , despite the fact that they were on a rolling sea and the Navy snipers had to make a successful " head shot , " something he said is " extremely difficult . "
Their job was made easier by the pirates ' willingness to allow their boat to be towed , smoothing out the sea and settling them into an even keel .
SEAL sharpshooters are trained to hit targets " under a minute , " meaning they are able to hit within an inch of a target from 100 yards , former Navy SEAL Harry Humphries told ABCNews.com .
For the snipers who killed the three Somali pirates , it had to be a " head shot , " Humphries said , because one of the pirates was holding an AK - 47 pointed at the back of American freighter captain Richard Phllips .
" There 's only one way to be assured no involuntary trigger squeeze , and that is a head shot , " Humphries said .
" If you hit the central nervous system , the probability [ of an involuntary trigger squeeze ] is greatly reduced . "
" The shot 's extremely difficult to make depending on equipment that shooters have , " he said .
" If the sea was flat , the shot would be relatively simple . "
During the five day standoff , the Navy worked to get close to the pirates , but as their patience wore thin , the seas became rougher .
The waves turned the lifeboat into a moving target , and the rear of the U.S.S.
Bainbridge where the snipers were deployed was also heaving with the waves .
The Bainbridge convinced one pirate to come aboard the Bainbridge to seek medical attention and the other pirates allowed their lifeboat to be towed out of rough seas to a calmer area .
During the towing , the boat was pulled to within 40 yards of the Bainbridge , and the act of towing made the snipers ' jobs easier by putting their lifeboat in the middle of the large ship 's wake which calmed the unruly waves and steadied the pirates as targets .
The combination of the one less pirate and the others on steadier water would have " put the sniper team in excellent condition , " Humphries said .
SEALs ' Constant Training
With a gun pointed at Phillips ' back , and tensions rising , the commander on the scene feared for the captain 's life and gave the green light for the snipers to fire .
Standard procedure is for the shooters to be accompanied by a spotter who will gauge the range precisely and any weather conditions that could affect the shot .
At times there is also someone to coordinate multiple shooters and to initiate the firing since it is essential in a circumstance like this that they fire simultaneously .
That role can also be filled by one of the snipers , Humphries said .
When two pirates exposed their heads and shoulders , and the third pirate was visible through a small window of the lifeboat , they fired .
All three fell dead .
Humphries said SEALs ' training requires they be ready for such an emergency at any time .
" It 's the constant training " under realistic conditions , he said , including from a bobbing ship .
" They are trained to shoot in sea , air and land , " Humphries said , echoing the SEALs acronym for Sea , Air and Land .
" Secondly , you know the weapon that you 're shooting .
The weapon is very important , " he said .
Their weapons were likely modified M - 4 rifles , he said , since it was n't a long distance shot .
There are also different strategies for what SEALs call the " cold shot , " or the first shot .
" A cold shot requires different setting than follow - ups , " he said .
Vice Adm. Bill Gortney called the simultaneous shots " phenomenal , " and President Obama said how " very proud " he was of the job carried out by the military .
But while Humphries praised a job well done , he was n't surprised by the deadly outcome .
" It 's a standard , well executed hostage rescue tactical solution ...
They had no other choice , " Humphries said .
" [ This was ] the only way they get the job done . "
" It 's not a bunch of cowboys out there , " he said .
" It was a very controlled situation . "
The database was proposed after the death of Victoria Climbie A controversial database which holds the details of every child in England has become available to childcare professionals for the first time .
ContactPoint , a response to Lord Laming 's report following the death of Victoria Climbie , is beginning its national roll - out in the north west .
But the system , costing £ 224 m , has been delayed twice amid data security fears .
The government says it will enable more co-ordinated services for children and ensure none slips through the net .
It will hold the details of 11 million children and young people aged up to 18 years .
The delays were prompted by concerns over access to the database .
In 2007 , a report into the project by auditors Deloitte and Touche said it could never be totally secure .
Last summer ministers delayed the database , admitting there were some " issues " identified in testing .
It says 390,000 people will have access to the database , but will have gone through stringent security training .
' Save time '
The system will be available to workers in 17 local authorities in the north west of England , before eventually being rolled out across the rest of the country .
More than 51,000 children deemed vulnerable will have their identities and information shielded , the government says , after fears were raised that information about children 's whereabouts could fall into the wrong hands .
CONTACTPOINT DATA
Name , address , date of birth , gender and contact details for parents or carers Each child also has a unique identifying number Details of the child 's school and GP practice and for other practitioners or services working with the child
Whether the practitioner is the lead professional for that child Source : DCSF
The government said the database was vital to prevent any child slipping through the net , and would enable professionals to see quickly and easily which other services and people were in contact with a child .
England 's children 's minister , Delyth Morgan , said : " Under current arrangements if a practitioner believes that a child is at risk or may need additional support , for example if they have a disability , they may have no way of knowing whether other services might already be in contact with that child .
" We estimate that ContactPoint , when fully operational , can save at least five million hours of professionals ' time , freeing them up from trying to track down other practitioners and enabling them to spend more time on the child . "
The Conservatives have called for the database to be scrapped .
But it has been welcomed by the chief executive of children 's charity Barnardo's , Martin Narey , who said it " would make it easier to deliver better - co- ordinated services " .

I must start this review with an admission .
I have not the faintest clue what a “ Radler ” beer is .
However , I will convince you that this knowledge is irrelevant , much like knowing what a scooter is .
This penguin has recently relocated north , in order to study a new species of humans , known as Queenslanderatas Simplisticus .
Or so the Victorian humans told me , they were not exactly neurosurgeons themselves .
While at my local “ Bottle - O ” , known to most of the world as a liquor store , I looked for a beer I had never tasted before .
I was faced with a dilemma .
XXXX Summer Edition , or Barecove Radler – infused with lemon and lime .
My heart was set on trying something new , but this seemed like choosing between being teabagged by a bikie , or watching a Hugh Grant movie .
A very large contrast , but I do n’t feel like admitting to either of them .
I chose Hugh Grant .
Barecove is awful from start to finish .
I ’m not going to spend a lot of time trying to explain it , but it is like drinking a watered down Corona through a lemon and lime straw .
The straw is a similie for the inappropriateness of this addition to a beer in any circumstance .
Most right thinking drinkers will hate this beer .
If you drink this beer and hate it , give yourself 10 points .
Two types of people will love this beer , and they should be avoided at all costs .
The first type are Corona drinkers .
Only ditzy females , effeminate men , or a hardened drinker of lemonade fall into this category .
The radler will taste very familiar to the Corona with lemon and lime they drink in tactless clubs while talking about American Idol .
The other type of person who will enjoy this beer is someone who hates beer .
I do n’t mean this in a “ I only drink vodka and OJ ” type of way , rather like “ I hate alcohol and all people who drink it , they should suffer like me ” .
This is the perfect beer for fundamentalist Muslims and Christians .
Enough said .
Tennant will co-star alongside Elisabeth Sladen , who plays Sarah Jane Smith
David Tennant is to appear as the Time Lord in Doctor Who spin - off The Sarah Jane Adventures , the BBC has announced .
Tennant , 38 , will appear over two episodes of a new 12 - part series of the CBBC show , which starts in September .
Russell T Davies , executive producer of The Sarah Jane Adventures and Doctor Who , said it would be a " full on appearance " and " not just a cameo " .
The show follows the adventures of the investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith - a former Doctor 's companion .
Smith is played by actress Elisabeth Sladen , 61 , who also played the character in Doctor Who opposite Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker between 1973 and 1976 .
' Special treat '
Sladen said she was " absolutely over the moon " to be co-starring alongside Tennant .
" It 's fantastic news that Sarah Jane is going to spend some time working with the Doctor again and is testament to just how successful this CBBC series is . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Davies said : " Viewers thought they may have to wait until November for the next full episode of Doctor Who , but this is an extra special treat .
" And it 's not just a cameo from David .
" This is a full - on appearance for the Doctor as he and Sarah Jane face their biggest threat ever . "
The third series of The Sarah Jane Adventures will feature monsters who want to infect earth and a " living painting " .
Tennant is being replaced as Doctor Who by actor Matt Smith , 26 , who will appear as the 11th Doctor next year .
Tennant will firstly appear in three specials , starting with The Waters of Mars in November .
Meanwhile , Doctor
Who may be heading for the big screen after a spokeswoman for BBC Films confirmed that " a script is in development " .
BBC entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba said there were no guarantees a film would be made and that , if the project went into full production , a release would be a long time away .

He is n't just a Nazi , he has a secret dislike for women .
Maybe that 's because the most successful muscle in his body is his mouth .
He did initially use his mother to boost his ratings .
It 's a very Republican / Conservative trait for men to use women and then discard them .
Gingrich and McCain are good examples .

When I was in the states last month , I was searching for something to listen to in the rental car .
Rush Limdick came on and I hit the scan button as fast as I could so as not to corrupt my beautiful spring day .
So today , I listened to the vet tear down Rush while he made excuses for himself and as soon as the audio finished , my hard disk crashed and my system rebooted .
Coincidence ?
I think my hard drive is as smart as I am ... it knows when a reboot is necessary when that gas bag speaks through its speakers and needs to clear its memory .

They known that Rush Limbugh could not win a senatorial seat and it galls them that Franken , a member of the cast of a cultural icon , SNL ( which during Franken 's tenure was the antithesis of what the Rush Limbaugh Show is ) , could win .
It 's a humiliation that the guy who called Rush Limbaugh a big fat idiot could defeat Rush Limbaugh , the cultural icon of the Republican Party for the past 25 years .
They literally cannot believe it .

If the republican pundits / talking heads / leadership were in tune with conservatives like the caller , the republicans could actually win elections .
I 'm actually happy when the leaders like Rush ' dis their own ranks , because it drives more people away from the current failed version of the party .
Rush is full of crap btw , he equated water - boarding with ' being splashed with water ' and other stupid comparisons like ' being slapped around ' or ' fraternity pranks ' ( in talking about abu ghraib ) .
Video :
http://infidelsarecool.c...ush-limbaugh-on-torture/
There have been deaths , in spite of what Rush claims .
There have been Afghani's that were captured , next seen dead with pulpified legs ( I first read this in the official military report which I 'm too lazy to dig up now ... here 's a news report about it ) : http://www.nyunews.com/o...ture-right-now-1.1601665
Then there are the deaths .
Two prison deaths sparked an internal investigation and made their way into The New York Times : the death of a 22 - year - old taxi driver and the death of a man who happened to be the brother of a Taliban commander .
Their corpses were found hanging from the wrists by shackles .
The coroner ’s report attested that the “ pulpified ” legs of one of the bodies looked as if they had “ been run over by a bus . ”
That ’s Bagram ’s legacy , one that has seen very little of the light of day .
If pulpifying mens legs before they die is n't torture , then I guess Rush is a young slim healthy honest individual .

Man Who Survived Without Chemo : ' I 'd Still Fight '
Man who ran to avoid chemo in 1996 says he'd help mom and teen now on the lam .
May 23 , 2009  -- Billy Best ran away from home in Norwell , Mass. , in 1994 to avoid chemotherapy , and today he offered conflicting words of support and opposition to Daniel and Colleen Hauser .
The mother and son , who are from Minnesota , are now part of an international police search after they fled a judge 's court - ordered chemotherapy Monday for Daniel .
Jason Seidl , chief deputy at the Brown County Sheriff 's office in Minnesota , affirmed Saturday that the pair last were spotted near the Tijuana - California border .
However Seidle said it 's unknown whether they actually crossed the border into Mexico .
" They 're avoiding a court order , which is against the law , so they should n't do that , " Best told ABC 's " Good Morning America . "
" But it 's also a mother who 's looking out for her family .
You know , somewhere in between there 's an answer . "
Best eventually returned home where authorities allowed him to pursue his choice of alternative treatments .
" I ran away because I believe the chemo was poisoning me and it would kill me before it cured me , " said Best .
In the past Best claimed that roots , Indian rhubarb and slippery elm helped him stay cancer - free , but told " GMA " on Saturday he " used something called 714 - X . "
" That 's not an issue here , " said Best , who instead critiqued the widely circulated statistic that Daniel Hauser 's cancer would have 90 percent cure rate with chemotherapy .
When asked whether he would help the family if they contacted him , Best said he would .
" I would because it 's something that 's so close to me , " he said .
" It 's been , almost , 15 years and to see today someone fighting for those same -- freedoms .
I thought we were past that . "
" I 'd fight .
I 'd fight for that freedom , " he said .
Best was 16 when he fled to Houston to escape treatment for Hodgkin 's disease , according to The Associated Press .
He returned home only after his parents promised that they would not force him to have the treatments .
Late Wednesday , the AP reported that Best denied he was with Hauser and her son , saying that he had not spoken to them since they fled .
As of Saturday the Hausers are still on the run instead of fighting the Minnesota courts .
Search For Cancer - Ridden Teen Goes International
The U.S. Attorney 's office and the FBI filed federal criminal charges Friday against Colleen Janet Hauser for fleeing with her son Daniel to avoid giving him chemotherapy for his cancer .
The federal criminal complaint notes that Hauser and her son flew on Sun Country Airlines from Minnesota to Los Angeles May 19 , 2009 , and their current whereabouts are unknown .
The felony charge is fleeing from the state of Minnesota to avoid prosecution for deprivation of parental rights .
The case has now become an international manhunt with Interpol being notified and U.S. Marshals being deployed to Mexico from the San Diego Field Office and the U.S. Embassy in Mexico .
According to one source , the marshals and Mexican law enforcement officers were in Tijuana looking for Hauser and her son .
" I can confirm U.S. Marshals are assisting Minnesota authorities , " U.S. Marshals spokesman Jeffrey Carter told ABC News .
" We have deputy marshals in Mexico now and are working with Mexican authorities to follow up on several leads . "
Earlier , the father of the Minnesota teenager made a desparate plea for his son to return with his mother for court - ordered cancer chemotherapy treatment .
Authorities said they believe Hauser and her 13 - year - old son , Daniel , may be in Mexico -- or trying to get there -- to seek alternative treatments for the teen who suffers from Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
" We 're looking for a hopeful resolution , it 's all about Daniel , " said Jason Seidl , chief deputy at the Brown County Sheriff 's office .
Seidl declined to comment on whether Colleen and Daniel had been spotted and again urged anyone who thinks they may have information that could lead to their discovery to immediately contact the police .
Late Thursday afternoon , Anthony Hauser made an emotional appeal to his wife to return home with their sick son .
" This is for you Colleen if you 're out there , " Hauser said from his farm in Sleepy Eye , Minn. , to his missing wife .
" Please bring Danny home so we can decide as a family what Danny 's treatment should be .
" I know you 're scared and I feel that you left out of fear , maybe without thinking it all the way through , " said Hauser .
" Danny is my son and the rest of the family is worried sick about how he is , " Hauser said .
" Please call me and let 's talk about how we can work this out . "
Hauser repeated , " Please give me a call . "
Brown County Sheriff Rich Hoffman also spoke at Thursday 's press conference , pleading with Colleen to return to Minnesota .
" We 're all working to the same end , to make sure Danny is back home and safe , " said Hoffman .
" I 'm asking you to contact us to arrange your safe return . "
" We will not take an enforcement action if you 've shown a good faith effort to come back , " said Hoffman .
" We are concerned other individuals are going to use this incident as a mean to forward their own agendas which might not be in Danny 's best interest , " he said .
Colleen and Daniel Hauser were last spotted in Southern California Tuesday morning , according to the Brown County Sheriff 's office , who said it was " reliable information " that has led them to believe the duo is heading to Mexico to seek alternative cancer treatment .
Colleen Hauser and Daniel disappeared after a court rejected the boy 's request to refuse chemotherapy treatment for his Hodgkin 's lymphoma disease .
Doctors believe Daniel will die without the treatment .
The Hausers have said that they would prefer a less rigid chemotherapy treatment combined with other alternative treatments .
The family is Roman Catholic and believes in the " do no harm " philosophy of the Nemenhah Band , a Missouri - based religious group that believes in natural healing methods .
The warrant for deprivation of parental rights will ensure extradition to Minnesota if she is apprehended , according to police .
Authorities said the fugitives do not own a car and do n't believe they could have left Sleepy Eye without help .
They say they are following " any and all leads " and have been receiving tips from across the country .
Hoffman said that authorities do not have a specific vehicle they are looking for .
Cancer - Stricken Son and Mom Flee
Colleen Hauser 's husband , Anthony , said that he believes his wife saw X - rays of Daniel that made her scared and prompted her to flee , missing a court appearance Tuesday .
Hauser has been cooperating with police , but Hoffman declined to speculate on the " sincerity of the information . "
Daniel 's name has been added to the database of the national Missing and Exploited Children 's Network , said Hoffman , who hopes the move will help spot the teen if he attempts to cross a border .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
Great Activities You Can Enjoy With Your Dog
Here is an introduction to some great things people do with their dogs .
Most activities welcome all dogs , whether purebred or of mixed breed heritage .
Some of these activities are classed as " working dog " activities , but are also done on a recreational basis , or as a public service .
Some dog activities are purely recreational in nature , while others are competitive dog sports .
Many of these activities may be new to you .
I have chosen my links based upon how welcoming they are to the merely curious .
People who play with their dog , stay with their dog .
Why do dog activities matter ?
Why promote them ?
Dog activities matter because they help dogs keep their homes .
When people and dogs do things together it is good news all around .
Many of these activities provide the structure that helps people learn to better communicate with their dogs .
The dogs have a better opportunity to learn good manners .
That makes them easier to live with and less likely to be given up .
The activities help people get in touch with one another to share information .
That also helps people to learn about dogs , to avoid problems , and to solve them in a healthy way .
The activities provide exercise in a fun way that boosts the relationship .
The exercise , in turn , reduces boredom .
A dog that exercises with its human is less likely to have behavior problems .
A wonderful side benefit is that these activities can be a mental boost for humans and dogs alike .

Do we need lessons on having fun with our dogs ?
All the evidence is , yes , we need to learn how to have fun with our dogs .
Too many people just do n't know how much fun their dog can be .
Their relationship is one way ; they have n't learned to communicate .
They need help learning how to have fun with their dog .
When they enjoy their dog they are motivated to work through problems , to solve them instead of giving up on the dog .
And yes , your mutt can play too .
The big surprise to me was how many activities I can do with my mixed breed dogs .
And the variety of sports , games , and just plain good times was also an eye opener .
Many of the activities listed here will be new to you .
Some of them you may have seen on TV , but never thought of getting involved in yourself .
Well plunge right in and explore .
You and your dog will be glad you did .

Ink stains are some of the most common types of stains we get on our clothing -- and are among the most stubborn to remove .
Like a lot of the stains mentioned here , ink can be tackled with three of our Fantastic Four items : salt , baking soda , and lemon juice .
Back in the day , we used to spray aerosol hair spray on our clothes to make ink stains dissolve .
It was certainly a smelly option and probably not the best for our clothes ( or , considering the fumes coming from the aerosol cans , ourselves ) .
But there certainly are other home remedies to try .
For one , sprinkle a fresh stain with salt and then soak the entire garment in milk ; afterward , launder as usual .

Another method involves making a paste of lemon juice and cream of tartar .
You should first test the fabric for colorfastness :
Paint the mixture onto a hidden area of the fabric and let it sit for 20 minutes .
If the color is fine , then it 's full steam ahead !
Cover the stain with the paste and again let it sit for 20 minutes .
Then check that the stain is removed before laundering the item as usual .
An alternative method would be to cover the stain with cream of tartar and drizzle a little lemon juice onto it .
Rub the mixture in and let it sit for a minute or two , then brush off any excess cream of tartar .
Launder the item as usual .
Here 's a tip for removing ink from white fabric :
Apply the cream of tartar and lemon juice paste and then lay the fabric flat outside in a sunny spot .
The paste will remove the stain , and the sun will brighten the white fabric .
Then , of course , wash as usual .
Say you 're at a party , and you 've managed to swipe your pen on your shirt .
Since most people do n't carry cream of tartar and lemon juice everywhere they go , here 's a trick to use in a pinch : Plain club soda helps keep stains from setting .
Dip the stained area into the club soda and then dab with a hand - kerchief or other lint - free cloth .
If the stain is serious , follow the methods mentioned already , or just launder as normal .

With the series over , Battlestar Galactica will make its way to Blu-ray for the first time in a massive , 20 - disc set that will be released July 28th for an MSRP of $ 350 .
I loved the series ... even if the controversial ending , in which we discover an autistic child had simply dreamed up a galaxy full of sexy robots , was a bit of a stretch .

I ’m back from ILC 09 , slowly digesting all i lived there .
This was my first Lisp conference and my first visit to MIT , a place marked with red big letters in the atlas of my private mythology .
And it was n’t only about places : suddenly realizing that you ’re sitting next to Richard Greenblatt , or enjoying Gerry Sussman ’s talks in the flesh , was quite an experience , with an almost eerie feeling attached to it .
There ’s a problem in meeting your myths : real life is almost never up to the task of meeting one ’s idealizations .
But this was not the case ; i enjoyed every minute , not a tinge of disappointment to be felt .
Lisp has been around for quite a while and its history is an important part of computer science ’s history .
That history comes life in the ILC , and you get a chance to share with the people that were there back in the day , the people you read about in books … i’ve wished many times i was there , and these days in Cambridge i’ve been as close to those halcyon days as i can expect to ever be .
Living history , what a feeling .
Had i to single out just one speaker , that ’d have to be Gerry Sussman .
I just kept finding myself resonating in a deep way with his thoughts .
For instance , during the panel on the future of Lisp , conversation revolved around how to keep the language popular and apt for commercial applications .
Gerry stepped out to point that that was all very well , but that we should n’t forget that one of the key aspects of programming languages is to what extent they allow us to extend our problem - solving abilities by providing new ways of expressing and talking about problems ( as Dijkstra once said : Lisp has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts ) .
Dead on , if you ask me , although unfortunately nobody seemed to have anything else to add , and the debate returned to the far less interesting popularity issues ( well , yes , the conference was n’t perfect after all ) .
Next day we were in a kind of tongue - in - check debate provocatively entitled Are macros a menace ?.
Richard Gabriel was on the wrong side , and arguing along the lines that macros were akin to language design and that he ’d rather not suffer the consequences of letting your average software engineer undertake such a complex task .
Gerry ’s intervention at this point made me nod again : if we cannot trust our software enginneers to proficiently use the tools of our trade , there must be something wrong in the way we educate them ; only those able to judiciously use them should get a diploma , to begin with .
That ’s exactly how i felt during my period as a CS teacher , as i tried , rather clumsily , to explain in one of my first rants in this blog .
It feels great to be in such a good company .
Then there was this unplanned mini-talk on why MIT has replaced the SICP - based introduction to programming with something about robots using Python .
You can read a nice synopsis of the reasons Sussman gave in Andy ’s blog ( together with summaries and comments of many other talks ) .
It was nice in a kind of sad way : at the end , while answering a question , Gerry mentioned that this new computing world was not his , and it was n’t one that he liked [ 0 ] .
‘ But ’ , he said , ‘ that ’s because we ’re old farts ’ .
Although i’m younger than him , i like much better the kind of world that gave rise to SICP , and spent the rest of the evening feeling like a sad , old fart .
I must say , however , that the ideas SICP grew upon , that simple world where you built up complexity out of small pieces and system that you understood completely , have much to offer to new generations .
We should not dismiss them in the name of modernity .
Besides those cameos , Gerry had two official appearances in the regular conference programme , namely , one invited speech on robust systems design and a lightning talk .
( The latter were 5 - minutes long presentations –with Guy Steele and his chronometer strictly ensuring that that was actually the case –followed by a 2 minutes Q&A part , while the next speaker was setting up her laptop .
This formula worked great most of the time , forcing the presenters to squeeze their brains in order to capture as much content , sense and , in most cases , fun as possible in such a short time .
We had a living confirmation that working under severe constraints is a great creativity boost . )
In the invited speech , we had the opportunity of hearing more about Gerry ’s ideas on what makes a system robust .
I say ‘ more ’ because he made public a paper on the subject some time ago , and , actually , his ideas on these issues can be traced back to , for instance , the SICP video lectures , where he already exposes the general strategy to tackle the problem : in order to make a system robust , you do n’t want to solve a strict , narrowly specified problem , but a whole family of them ( or , if you have a very crisp specification , a class of problems in its neighbourhood ) .
That way , when the problem to be solved varies in small ways , your whole solution accommodates to the new situation by small variations .
The solution is not brittle .
To attain such a flexible behaviour , we need to build our system upon components that are lenient on the inputs they accept and as sharp as possible in the outputs they produce .
Ways to attain the above goals include metalinguistic abstraction ( creating a language tailored to the problem domain ) , use of generic interfaces , degeneracy or non-deterministic search in the solution space .
Generic functions were nicely demonstrated with examples from the library used in SICM ( and the delicious Functional Differential Geometry ) .
We got the warning that using generics this way is dangerous .
But they ’re powerful , and one needs powerful methods to solve challenging problems ; one needs to know what one ’s doing , but that ’s part of what we ’re supposed to be good at , right ?
Sussman kept smiling and saying ‘ beware , this is a very dangerous thing to do ’ .
There was also an almost off - the - record comment to the effect that one of the missed opportunities in Lisp ’s design was its not defining all its primitive forms as generics ( converting it definitely in the most dangerous language around ) .
Degeneracy ( using completely different ways for computing the same result ) was illustrated , as much of Sussman ’s thinking on robust programming , by examples drawn from biological systems ( in this talk , it was frogs most of the time ) .
You can find many other examples of this sort of parallelism between computing and biological systems in the paper linked above , a line of thought that i find mixes well with the handful of metaphors i use to reason about my job as a programmer .
In particular , it sort of connects with my bias towards living systems such as Lisp or Smalltalk ’s , where one is evolving more than designing and implementing the program ; which in turn mixes well with the ideas of latent typing and late binding , present in those highly dynamic environments ( Self , Factor , and APL ( as demonstrated in this game of life video ( unintended pun intended ) ) are in the same league ) .
Much more than with beautiful but extremely rigid ones based on static typing , such as Haskell’s .
( That ’s why i keep coming back to Lisp after my Haskell excursions , or why i find R6RS so disappointing .
Or , if you ’ll pardon my keeping on mixing methaphors , why i prefer healing rather than practising autopsies . )
Another venue to flexibility mentioned in the talk are constraint propagation networks in which multiple sources contribute to defining the values of each state variable .
You get that way the possibility of partially defined values , that can be nonetheless useful by themselves , depending on the computation you ’re performing .
Propagator networks also work as additive computation machines able to refine coarse inputs into correct solutions for problems specified as a set of constraints .
One of Sussman ’s students , Alexey Radu , is actively working on propagators , building on work inititated back in the day by Guy Steele .
You can find an extensive report and nice , working Scheme code here .
Finally , Gerry gave a lightning talk with yet another piece of food for thought .
The rub of it was drawing our attention to the possibility of exploiting a posited parallelism between the theory and methods to solve differential equations on the one hand , and programs on the other .
There ’s a way of approaching solving a differential equation that is , if you will , algebraic in nature : one manipulates algebraically expressions to simplify and eventually obtain a closed form solution , or , if that ’s not possible , creates numerical approximations to evolve the boundary conditions in the state space as a function of discrete time steps .
You end up that way with something that works as a solution , but , most of the time , without a deep understanding of the traits that make it a solution : in the spirit of the robust design ideas sketched before , we should probably be asking for more qualitative information about how solutions behave as we change the boundary or initial conditions of our problem .
As it happens , matematicians have a way of analyzing the behaviour of solutions to differential equations by studying their Poincaré maps and sections , which are views into the orbits followed by the solutions in their state space .
Many times , you do n’t have to solve exactly the differential equation to predict its qualitative behaviour ( e.g. , is it bounded ? is it periodic ? ) in state space , and get insight on how it changes in presence of perturbations .
The analogy with computing processes is clear : most of the time , we narrow our efforts in finding , so to speak , algebraic solutions to our computing problems : the program - as - text is the analog to the process of finding an exact formula for the solution of a differential equation .
What we ’re missing , according to Sussman , is a way or reasoning about the qualitative features of our programs à la Poincaré , i.e. , a way or reasoning about programs in the state space of their outputs , beyond the mechanistic algorithmical details .
Gerry admitted that he did n’t know how or in what form this kind of reasoning would proceed , only that his hunch is that it must possible , and exhorted us to find the way .
ILC09 would have been worth it only for those talks , but there was much more : do n’t miss the next one !

As rightly pointed out by Dan Weinreb in his comment below , Sussman endorses the changes in the new curriculum , though .
His post on this issue is worth reading too .
( CNN ) --
Had she been born a generation earlier , Kim Hoffman might have had a shotgun wedding .
As it turned out , she and Steve Miller took the time to plan their dream nuptials -- outdoors , on an organic farm , and with their 10 - month - old daughter in tow .
Kim Hoffman and Steve Miller pose on their September 2005 wedding day with 10 - month - old daughter , Sadie .
A pre-marriage birth certainly was n't what her father wanted for his only daughter , said Hoffman , of Oakland , California .
But seven months into her relationship with Miller , the unplanned pregnancy simply changed life 's course .
" We would have headed down this path .
The pregnancy just accelerated things , " she said of the couple 's cohabitation , the birth of Sadie and their 2005 wedding .
" It was the way it was meant to be . "
Along with magazine - cover grabbers like Angelina Jolie and Bristol Palin , Hoffman , today a 39 - year - old mother of three , is part of a now record - breaking trend of women who give birth outside of wedlock .
Nearly 40 percent of babies born in the United States in 2007 were delivered by unwed mothers , according to data released last month by the National Center for Health Statistics .
The 1.7 million out - of - wedlock births , of 4.3 million total births , marked a more than 25 percent jump from five years before .
Statistics such as these , which include for the second year in a row a bump in teen pregnancies , after a 14 - year decline , leave Sarah Brown concerned .
She worries about the children born to unwed parents -- about the disadvantages they often face , including increased likelihood of poverty and greater high school dropout rates .
See the number of out - of - wedlock births by race and age »
" I wish people spent as much time planning when to get pregnant , with whom , under what circumstances as they do planning their next vacation , " said Brown , the CEO and founding director of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy .
" The stigma [ of out - of - wedlock births ] has eroded , and these numbers made me feel perhaps it 's disappeared altogether . "
That stigma Brown speaks of , however , is n't one that LaShanda Henry , 28 , or the women in her family before her , would have known .
Her parents never married .
And her grandmother only had a wedding when she was in her 60s .
So when Henry , of Greenville , North Carolina , and her boyfriend of now five years , Jean Paul , had Christopher two years ago , there was no pressure to race down the aisle .
" Culturally speaking " taking vows was n't expected , said Henry , who runs the Black Moms Club , an online social network , and the Web - only Mahogany Momma Magazine .
" Do we want to spend that money on a wedding or a house ?
... I guess it 's about priorities .
I was never one of those girls that dreamed about the wedding dress . "
What she said about cultural differences and expectations might help explain some of the numbers .
Other data released last month showed the percentage of unwed mothers differs from race to race .
While 28 percent of white women gave birth out of wedlock in 2007 , nearly 72 percent of black women and more than 51 percent of Latinas did .
" With the publicity of our first family , " meaning the Obamas , Henry said in a discussion group entry , marriage might " slowly become more of a norm for all . "
Henry 's experience also echoes what Paula England , a Stanford University sociology professor , learned when she co-edited " Unmarried Couples with Children , " which was published in 2007 .
That book traced for four years 50 unmarried couples , the majority of them black or Latino , that had babies in 2000 , and the findings shot down some of her predictions .
England assumed many of the fathers would have high - tailed it out of the picture by the sixth month of pregnancy , leaving single mothers " truly single , " the sociologist said .
Instead , she found that in 80 percent of the non-marital births , parents stayed romantically involved and in 50 percent of the cases they were living together .
Still , the bulk of responsibility often falls to the mother .
According to a 2008 survey by the U.S. Census Bureau , there are 9.8 million single mothers versus 1.8 million single fathers .
Support groups , such as Sisters Helping Sisters , exist to help single moms , providing them with resources , tips and empathetic ears .
Founded in 1997 , the Kansas City , Missouri , program was the brainchild of Teri Worton Brooks , now 39 .
She was in her early 20s when she found herself with a baby boy to take care of on her own .
" I had no clue how to raise him and no clue how to better my life , " she said .
" But I knew there was a sisterhood among women .
...
We could learn from one another . "
The bulk of babies born to unwed mothers may be unplanned , but that does n't take into account lesbian couples or women who 've decided to go it alone .
For many of them , the decision is the result of years of thought and emotional soul - searching .
When California Cryobank , which claims to be the world 's largest sperm bank , opened its doors in the late 1970s , 99 percent of its business catered to couples grappling with male infertility , spokesman Scott Brown said .
Now , that market in the sperm donor world accounts for less than 14 percent , according to projections by Charles Sims , the organization 's co-founder and medical director .
About 50,000 women delivering babies each year are single moms by choice , said Mikki Morrissette , author of " Choosing Single Motherhood : The Thinking Woman 's Guide , " and founder of the online resource Choice Moms .
Many of these mothers choose to tap known or anonymous sperm donors as the biological clock begins to pound .
Perhaps they are like Morrissette , who divorced in her early 30s , was n't in a hurry to jump into another relationship and decided to have kids on her own .
While she and many other single mothers by choice can afford this option , David Popenoe worries about the example they 're setting in a society where children still benefit most from married parents , he said .
Other women might look at these single mothers by choice and say , " ' So many people are doing it , why should n't I just go ahead ? ' " said Popenoe , founder and co-director of the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University in New Jersey .
" It 's part of a slippery slope . "
Janet Kaufman was n't looking to influence anyone else ; her personal decision , after loads of research , became a " practical matter . "
The University of Utah English professor was in her mid-30s , single and figured even if she met someone immediately it might be a couple years before she 'd feel comfortable having a child with that man .
Her parents offered encouragement .
In fact her father proposed the idea of a donor .
And her friends stepped up in ways she described as " just extraordinary . "
" I had some concerns and fears , " said Kaufman , 44 , who ended up marrying one year after she had a second child by the same anonymous donor .
" But I felt like with the right kind of support ... somehow I would make it work . "
After her daughter 's arrival came the question of how to discuss this situation with a child .
She found her answer -- talk about it early and often -- through someone in the widespread network , Single Mothers by Choice .
Kaufman began explaining before her daughter , and later son , could talk .
She found books , bearing titles such as " A Family Like Yours , " which she read frequently , and even penned a story of her own .
She knew from the start that she would always be honest .
" I 'm sure they 'll have a lot of feelings as they grow up , but I do n't want it to be complicated by my not being open with them , " she said .
" In communicating with them about their origins , I 'm also communicating with them about me -- the hopes I had , the dreams I had ...
It 's important for them to know how much they were wanted . "

The plight of sweat shop workers in the clothes industry has been well documented , but what about those who toil in exotic countries to satisfy our exotic palates ?
One student tasted life on the gourmet production lines .
A huge percentage of the cheap food we eat in the UK comes from South - East Asia , where it is harvested and processed before being placed neatly in the supermarkets where we do n't even have to think about its journey .
My name is Stacey and I 'm a fashion student .
When I got an offer , along with five others , of travelling to this corner of the world to experience the conditions people working in the food industry face every day , I was curious .
The experience has changed my life .
We were guests of the food producers but we received no special treatment .
We were expected to catch , harvest and produce products we take for granted in the UK , as well as eat , sleep , and exist on the same wages the food workers live on , typically about £ 3 a day .
FIND OUT MORE ...
Blood , Sweat and Takeaways is broadcast on BBC Three , starting Tuesday , 19 May at 2110BST
Or catch up using the iPlayer As far as the factory owners are concerned , the food quality is high , conforming to the strict standards set by the EU , so they had nothing to hide .
And the wages they are paying their workforce are of minimum wage , so nothing to hide there either .
The first factory we found ourselves in was a tuna cannery in Sulawesi , Indonesia .
I was shocked by the sheer size of the place , filled with robotic workers all looking identical and not looking up from their work for a second .
We were shown to our work stations , and handed a cooked whole tuna .
We had to open the fish in two , de - bone it and scrape out all the insides .
The work was so fiddly because you could n't afford to waste a single scrap .
Only the red meat could be removed , if you lost any white meat you were shouted at , which happened to us a lot .
The heat and smell of the tuna factory were overwhelming I was hit by the heat , then the smell , closely followed by the long tedious hours .
When one of my fellow volunteers fainted due to the heat , I was terrified .
It made me realise how dangerous these conditions were to work in day in , day out .
We had to wash the fish blood and guts out of our hair using a well in the back garden .
When shopping for food - anything but fish heads - we were shocked to learn a day 's wages had earned us nothing more than a chocolate bar .
Next on the agenda were the prawn ponds in Kalimantan , Indonesia .
Our living quarters was a wooden shack in a remote part of a jungle .
The work consisted of us maintaining the prawn ponds .
A typical day for us was digging for clay and building higher mud walls , to keep the prawns inside the pond .
Crab wound
After days of rolling around in these disgusting muddy stinking ponds , we eventually got to see how to harvest them .
This was a finely tuned art .
You had to time this just right because of tidal movements .
So after working a 12 - hour day in the ponds , we had a couple of hours sleep before getting back up to do the harvesting .
While I was trying to catch a net of prawns , a crab managed to scratch my leg .
It really hurt , but I felt ridiculous mentioning it , because the locals seem so toughened to the conditions .
Then we moved to the rice fields of Isan , in the north of Thailand .
I had no idea what rice looked like to start with .
I think that shows how much we rely on supermarkets .
Boycotting cheap food made in these countries is not the answer
We were shown the rice field , which looked scarily similar to the prawn ponds .
The work consisted of us pulling up the rice with the whole root intact .
This took us a whole day , with the help of the locals .
The next day we had to replant this rice with a bigger space in between , to allow it to grow .
It felt like we were getting nowhere .
Seeing how fast the locals worked just highlighted how useless we were .
The work was terribly physical , 12 - hour days in 38 - degree heat .
It got to the point where I really did n't think I could bend one more time , I felt like I was going to snap in half .
The more and more I discovered about the food industry the more I wanted to share my experiences as widely as possible when I got home to the UK .
Why do n't people speak about these workers ?
Why has the fashion industry had such a spotlight on it , but not this ?
High mud walls help catch prawns
The view of food has changed greatly in the past five years but attention has been largely focused on the journey - the air miles - rather than the conditions where the food is sourced .
Boycotting cheap food made in these countries is not the answer .
Buying Fair Trade is a start , but I think the answer is to bring in laws that raise standards , to make sure food we buy in the UK is being produced by workers that are living decent lives , rather then just surviving for our benefit .
It is important to say I was never once put off the food we were producing .
Cleanliness and hygiene standards were paramount and I have continued to enjoy tuna , prawns , chicken and rice just as much if not more then before this experience .
I look at food in a different way now .
I see food as fuel , not as something to gorge on purely for pleasure .
Since returning to the UK , I am faced with a moral dilemma every time I visit a supermarket .
I look for the fairer option , but if it 's not available I feel helpless .
Picking rice was hard on the back I still want to support the fantastic people we met in SE Asia , but by doing this I 'm supporting the system that I 'm disagreeing with , a system which shows little regard for workers ' rights .
British consumers are massively benefiting from the cheap labour of these workers , and it 's something I feel we have simply come to accept by pushing it to the back of our minds where no - one can see it .
Well , I find this too hard to swallow .
If there are such strict rules and regulations concerning food quality , why can't we have rules put in place to ensure the lives of the workers are a better quality too ?
Below is a selection of your comments .
Brilliant , absolutely right .
We do n't think about things because they are too far away .
Also , though we do n't always have alternatives , so any changes must affect the whole food chain , from production to supply to consumers .
I 'm desperate for people to take this seriously , but see all my friends say ' I want , so I 'll have ' and not look at the issues behind the product .
Erica , Bucks , UK
Since most of the rice production is concentrated in Asia it 's hardly surprising that Asian workers are producing it !
It 's not our fault that their wages are poor - its up to them to fight for fair wages and for their governments , not ours , to move to introduce legislation to ensure a fair days pay for a fair days work .
Time the West stopped meddling and do - gooders like Stacey and her cronies concentrated on less - fashionable issues at home .
Susie Squeegee , Leicester , England
The economics of food supply and consumer demands for cheap food means costs are cut through cheap labour , addition of cheap bulking agents ie : fat and sugar , or excessive over - production , necessitating all the BOGOFs in the supermarkets while half the world starves .
In my view the food industry could be the next disaster as the continued pressure from the retailers for cheaper and cheaper food and the methods used to achieve it are just not sustainable .
We need to change our views and our habits , and the industry needs to take a more moral approach .
The distribution and nutritional value of food needs a major rethink otherwise we will continue the spiral towards obesity and ill health in the west , along - side the obscene reality of starvation for millions of others .
PW , UK If you purchase the " fairer option " the people mentioned here will be out of work .
Joshua , Cardiff , UK
It is also access to cheap foreign food on such a scale that makes it possible for the UK to support a much bigger population than it could feed with home grown produce .
This in turn drives up the cost of living here thus achieving some kind of balance .
If the food stops coming , then what ?
Steve , Margate England
It 's a shame !
Education does not any longer provide a balanced General Knowledge view of out planet nor its people .
To have the freedom to roam is wonderful but really , did they not read about where they were going ?
Its economics and history ?
The development of mankind ?
Do they see gambolling lambs and never think of the Sunday roast ?
Cheap shoes and not see sweatshops ?
The conscience may prick a little but I note with despair that they still buy ..
Bob , Rhos , Conwy Gradually we are becoming aware of what our creature comforts mean .
I try to source local products , but it is difficult since supermarkets provide minimal information and local farm shops have become hideously expensive - and even then they are often not selling local produce .
I often see a " produced locally " sticker , which means the others are not .
Perhaps a new player in the supermarket war could solve much of the problem by offering only local goods and stating where they were produced .
That would not solve the problems of the SE Asia workers of course , in fact it would leave many of them unemployed .
But there are two separate issues here and buying local food solves the environmental one and fundamentally changes the question on the global workers ' rights issue .
Chris , uk OK , and how exactly does the fascist Blair - Brown junta propose to regulate wages for rice farmers in Isarn ?
Since when has Thailand been under the control of New Labour ?
If they were paid the UK minimum wage they would be the richest people in Isarn : )
Nice joined up thinking as always from student idealists .
David Jones , Worthing Paying employees the minimum that the employer can get away with is the norm in any form of manufacturing and agriculture worldwide .
It is not so much a case of the workers being underpaid as one of many people being grossly overpaid who do not produce anything ie politicians , government employees , media , doctors , lawyers , accountants , etc. basically anyone who works in an office and receives a salary of over £ 25 k .
Keith , Welshpool , UK Firstly how wonderful to see how food is grown at source .
You only have to see how popular allotments are again with the younger generation in UK to know that people are thinking about what they eat more not only for health aspect but for cost too .
Cost to environment and our health .
Having worked in the herb and spice industry where most of the goods came from 3rd world countries and having heard the horror stories about the conditions people lived in there , I am 100 % behind Stacey here .
I too try and be selective with my shopping ... not always easy , especially with small mouths to feed .
I would be happy to sign a petition for example .

Virtual On : Oratorio Tangram Ver. 5.66 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade this spring .
Great news , but fans of the series probably want to play the game with a twin stick controller .
Sega hears you .
In an official post the development team discusses a peripheral , but they do n’t exactly announce it .
They mention tinkering with key assignments and manufacturing costs which sounds like a prototype Xbox 360 twin stick controller is sitting on someone ’s desk .
However , the device is said to be rather expensive and it ’s possible that the accessory could not make it to market .
How much would you pay for a set of Xbox 360 Virtual On sticks ?
This is a good excuse to post some more Virtual On : Oratorio Tangram Ver. 5.66 screenshots so here you go !
For all this , in my view the best sight of all lies just on the outskirts of Palm Springs : the steep - sided hulk of the San Jacinto Mountains , which form the western border of the Coachella Valley .
Easily reached on a 2.5 - mile aerial tramway that whisks passengers up to 8,500ft aboard the world 's largest rotating tramcars , the Mt San Jacinto State Park is a lofty sanctuary that offers 54 miles of hiking trails in Alpine scenery .
From January to April there 's a good chance of snow – with skis and snowshoes for rent – while in summer the woods are a refreshing escape from the desert heat below .
Looking down from the numerous viewpoints , it 's hard not to think that the true miracle of Palm Springs is that so many pleasurable things have come together in one small place .
As Ol ' Blue Eyes sang , it all feels as though " I 've got the world on a string , sittin ' on a rainbow … "
Nobody knows the trouble I 've seen ...

It started out as a skerrick of vague information : an unidentified foreigner , probably an Australian , had been arrested in eastern India after sexually abusing boys at an orphanage .
Months of investigation later , ABC South Asia correspondent Sally Sara has pieced together the full story : a disturbing and bizarre account of Paul Henry Dean , an Australian businessman who dumped family , friends and middle class comforts for a new life among lepers , orphans and the desperately poor of India .
Dean donned an array of names and identities while he operated as a charity worker , masqueraded as a holy man and a healer , and allegedly abused dozens of boys and young men in his wanderings over 30 years .
But the story starts far from the chaos and deprivation of India .
Across the Indian Ocean , in the serene WA beachside city of Bunbury , locals say they remain mystified by the man who grew up among them .
In the 1960s and 1970s Dean was seen as a smart young man on the make - " a go - getter " , full of money - making schemes and big ideas .
He revived the local Young Liberals and won the presidency of the local surf club - a tribute more to his organisational ability than to his surf prowess , club veterans say .
One summer night in 1976 he threw a party , then suddenly vanished .
At first , foul play was suspected .
But police discovered that he had left the country on a fake passport .
More than $ 100,000 was missing from the travel company he had chaired .
It was thought he had fled to the UK , or Indonesia .
But Dean was living among Catholic missionaries in an ashram in southern India , calling himself " Brother Alan " and claiming to have been a professor of agriculture in Australia .
He travelled the countryside pretending to be a Catholic brother and a priest .
He even said Mass for Mother Teresa 's missionaries .
He watched local doctors at work and quickly learned to copy them .
Establishing himself in leper colonies in eastern Andhra Pradesh and Orissa states , Dean signed letters as " Dr Bro Paul , " and began performing cataract operations and limb surgery , including amputations , on lepers .
He became , in the words of a former mayor , " a walking god " , admired for his intellect , feared for his quick temper .
" He could have been Mother Teresa , he could have been Hitler , " says Nathalie Nellens , a young Belgian volunteer who saw Dean at work .
At Titlagarh in Orissa in the early 1980s , Dean surrounded himself with teenage boys who were keen to learn paramedical training and build themselves a future .
Titlagarh is fiercely hot , remote and impoverished .
Most of the former trainees , now men in their 40s , are still there .
Despite the passage of time their memories are vivid .
Dean , they say , had repeatedly used them for sex .
They had complied because they were young and poor and felt they had no choice .
On camera they describe in uncomfortable detail what happened to them .
This is the first time their stories have been told .
The accounts from these men at Titlagarh provided the earliest known evidence of Dean abusing boys .
It was to become a pattern .
Dean operated with impunity , moving into charities that worked with orphans .
He adopted the benign nicknames " Professor " , or " Tata " , meaning grandfather .
" Tata tells me to put oil on his penis and hand - pump him .
He also undresses me and masturbates me .
This has been going on since 2005 .
He threatened to beat me up if I told ... " , a teenage boy said in one of at least eight statements by teenage boys to police in 2008 .
So far Dean has deftly eluded accusations of abusing boys .
The children 's charities where he has worked as a trusted volunteer have mostly accepted his denials .
Frenchwoman Mary - Ellen Gerber , who founded an orphanage near the city of Puri in eastern Orissa , says she twice put allegations of sexual abuse to him and both times he tearfully protested his innocence .
She now regrets backing him .
Dean has also kept authorities at bay .
In 2001 he was arrested and charged with sex and passport offences .
Eight years later those charges have not been to trial .
Now he is facing another set of charges in another state .
He denies all the allegations against him .
Australian authorities have known of the allegations but have shown no inclination to act against the man who fled Australia more than 30 years ago on a fake passport , wanted for theft , and who has roamed India ever since .
Dean has mostly been someone else 's problem , changing countries , moving from state to state , from one charity to another .
No one has put his story together - until now .
- Sally Sara 's report airs on Four Corners tonight on ABC1 at 8:30 pm .
“ As far back as I can remember , I always wanted to be a gangster . ”
Those are infamous words that open Martin Scorsese ‘s genre - defining crime drama , Goodfellas .
This cinematic masterpiece would go on to be nominated for six Academy Awards , set the high - water mark for all future films relating to organized crime and leave an undeniable mark on the pop culture landscape .
For one man , this is more then just a simple Hollywood motion picture , it was his life .
If you are familiar with Goodfellas , you already know a little bit about the world of Henry Hill .
He was born in 1943 in Brooklyn , New York .
At the time , the area was dominated by the powerful Lucchese Crime Family .
Growing up , he became fascinated by the gangsters and their lifestyle .
It would n’t take long for him to become caught up in their world .
He quickly became part of New York ’s mafia scene and even managed to help pull off one off the infamous 1978 Lufthansa heist , one of the biggest airport heists in history .
Henry
Hill was living his dream and was on top of the world , but all good things must come to an end .
By 1980 , his world began to crumble .
He feared for his life and the life of his family as it became more apparent with each passing day , that his associate , Jimmy “ The Gent ” Burke , intended to kill him .
It was for this reason that Hill decided to became a government informant and the self proclaimed “ proudest rat in the United States . ”
His testimony led to approximately fifty convictions and he went into witness protection .
During the closing lines of the film , Hill ’s character laments that he has become “ an average nobody ” and would get to live the rest of his life like a schnook .
Well , life sure has a funny way of turning out a lot differently than you had expected , even in the case of Henry Hill .
So what happened to Henry Hill after he left his mob life and the Witness Protection Program behind ?
We assure you that he is alive , well , enjoying semi-retirement and definitely not a schnook !
Jason Price of Icon Vs. Icon recently sat down with this larger then life character to discuss his past , life after the mob , his artwork , his upcoming line of ‘” Sunday Gravy ” pasta sauce and everything else that he has been planning over the past few years !
Now , go get your f*@kin ’ shinebox !!!
How accurate was Martin Scorsese ’s depiction of your world in his film , Goodfellas ?
Well , it was right out of the book Wiseguy , that I wrote with Nicholas Pileggi .
It was 95 % on the money .
They had to use a little creative license or whatever you want to call it because to fit your whole life into a couple of hours is really difficult .
In the film , it seemed that you had a great time as a kid growing up .
What is your fondest memory from the old days ?
I should have been a good boy !
I came from a large family of eight .
I am dyslexic and they did n’t know what dyslexia was back then .
They just thought I was a little knucklehead , ya know ?
So it was difficult .
That is not really a fond memory , but that is the memory I have .
I did n’t “ get it ” in school .
Everything was backwards to me and I had to memorize everything .
I could n’t read or write until I was in my late teens or early twenties .
So that was difficult , but fond memories — I used to like to make a buck .
I was a little hustler .
My family was typical blue collar family and it was really cool , until I met the guys across the street that had the taxi and limousine service .
[ laughs ]
Then my life started to change , but in the beginning it was really cool .
I used to wash cars and park cars at the age of twelve or thirteen years old .
When I went to school the teachers made me stand out in the hall half the goddamn day because I was disruptive .
It was part of my dyslexia , I guess .
Those guys would pat me on the back or slip me a fin or a sawbuck back in those days .
I thought it was cool back then and I really admired those guys because they all drove big Cadillacs and Lincolns , they had diamond rings and a bimbo on each arm .
[ laughs ]
I was very impressionable as a kid .
There are so many great scenes in Goodfellas .
What can you tell us about the scene were Tommy confronts you about saying he is “ funny . ”
Was Tommy that intense in real life and was that scene pretty true to life ?
He was very intense .
I mean , he was a homicidal maniac and did n’t care about anything .
He had two pearl handle pistols and anytime that he whacked somebody , he would put a notch on the handle of the pistols and brag about it to everybody .
That is how sick the guy was .
So many people love the “ Get your shinebox ” scene in the film .
How true to life was the the verbal exchange in the scene with Billy Batts ’ and Tommy in Goodfellas ?
Yeah , that actually happened .
That is exactly how it happened .
Billy had just come home from prison and he wanted his territory back .
By that time , Jimmy had taken it over , because Billy was away for six years .
So when he got back to New York from doing his time , he wanted his bookmaking and loan sharking business back and Jimmy was about to give it back to nobody .
So that is a back story that did n’t come out the way I thought it should have in the movie .
The insult itself took place at my club , which was on Queens Boulevard at the time .
Absolutely , he did a fantastic job .
I was n’t allowed to meet him or to talk to him while he was preparing for the role , because Scorsese had never directed him before and he did n’t want me to influence him in any way .
I knew nothing about the movie business at that point in my life .
I went along with what Scorsese said because he was the boss .
After the movie was over , we sat down for drinks a couple times and photo ops .
He is a great guy .
He nailed it !
I ca n’t say it any better then that .
He should have been nominated for an Academy Award but he was n’t , everybody else was .
Ya know , he went on to much greater things .
He is a great actor and a great person , I see him occasionally here in California .
Goodfellas ends with you entering the Witness Protection Program .
How difficult was the adjustment to life outside the mob ?
It was a horrible culture shock but really I was so relived to be out of that world and that life .
I knew I was gonna get whacked .
I was the only one left from the Lufthansa score .
Believe it or not , I was really relived .
Ya know , the government had planted a seed in my head after all those guys were getting killed .
I was on Federal parole and those guys were allowed to come to my house anytime they wanted .
They would come with fresh photos of a guy who just got whacked , pictures of their bodies , guys who were part of group .
They kept warning me , “ You ’re gonna be next !
You ’re gonna be next ! ”
So , they we basically planting the seed that I was going to be killed .
I did n’t want to hear it , I did n’t want to believe it — until I heard it on tape !
No , not really .
At that point , for me , I was involved in a lot of projects like writing books , doing articles and appearing on television and that was a thorn in their side for a lot of years .
What happened was that the FBI took over after the U.S. Marshalls left , they still to this day do .
If they hear anything or something comes up from a snitch , I know about it two minutes later .
Ya know , they saved my life .
They protected me for a lot of years and they did a great job .
Kudos to them .
Does having the reputation of a being a former Wiseguy ever make you are target for harassment by the police , just because of your celebrity status ?
Not at all .
At first , I would take it to heart when someone called me a rat but today I am the proudest rat in the United States .
[ laughs ]
It took me eight or nine years to work through that .
It lead to a bit of a downfall for me with my drug addictions , my alcoholism and stuff , but ya know , I worked through that .
It really was n’t difficult .
I was feeling sorry for myself when I really should have been jumping up and down with joy that I was still alive .
People have some strong opinions about you I am sure .
Does that bring some real nuts out of the woodwork ?
Listen , ya ca n’t please everybody .
Believe me , I do n’t take it to heart anymore .
Some people are gonna love me and some people are gonna hate me for what I did , ya know .
More power to them .
Let them walk in my moccasins for one day .
Ya know !
Ya get these whackos from time to time , but very seldom .
A lot of people idolize the lifestyle you ’ve led , probably more from what they have seen on film and on television .
I know you have done a lot of work with at risk youth in the past .
What can you say to people who view the life of a gangster as a glamorous one ?
Kids today are so impressionable .
Some of the best days of my life have been when a kid comes up to me and says to me that he changed his life because of that movie .
These kids are so impressionable , these knuckleheads and gang bangers that have gone down the wrong path in life they think that it is so cool .
Whether it is having a lot of money , fancy cars or power , that ’s what gets ya as a kid .
They do n’t realize what goes along with that , the insanity of going out and beating somebody , popping somebody or whatever it is that they do today .
It ’s all over the news constantly .
These kids , a lot of them are out of control and some of them will never change .
They will end up spending the rest of their lives in prison or dead .
That I am really a nice guy ! [ laughs ]
Some people are deathly afraid of me !
Well , not deathly afraid of me but if we are in the same room they get nervous .
If ya go into a restaurant , sometimes they think we are going to shoot the place up !
[ laughs ]
Some people are just way out there .
That being said , what would you most like to be remembered for ?
For what I did for the government .
I was the poster boy for the Witness Protection Program for a lot of years !
I did a lot for the government , not only myself , but my whole family did .
My family sacrificed a whole lot more then I did .
They turned out fabulous .
My ex-wife and my kids are very successful .
I am really proud of my children and my ex-wife .
They really went through hell with moving so many times and changing their names .
They had it a whole lot worse then I did but they turned out to be gems .
A few years back , your kids wrote a book entitled , On The Run : A Mafia Childhood , did you ever get a chance to read the book ?
If so , what did you think about it ?
I helped write 75 % of that book .
You know , I do n’t have the memories that they have .
I was n’t there .
I was an absentee dad .
I thought that , no matter how I got it , as long as I provided them with money and an education , that is what I needed to do .
You are still in touch with your children and have a good relationship ?
Absolutely !
I talk to them a couple times a week and it ’s the same thing with my ex-wife .
I became a “ news junkie . ” I try to stay on top of all the current events .
I sit home and I paint , in these beautiful surroundings .
I ’ll be 66 in a couple weeks and I am still hustling , ya know .
You gotta make a living !
I have bills just like everyone else .
If I knew I was gonna live this long , I was I would have saved 2 % the money that passed though my hands in my lifetime .
[ laughs ]
I can imagine !
Yeah , but I sit at home and I paint .
I try to relax and I try to be a grain of sand better today then I was yesterday , at my age .
I do some charity work .
If ya can help somebody , ya help them , if it is a good cause .
I spend a lot of the day painting and a couple hours on the computer .
I have some screenplays that I am involved in .
Staying busy .
As you mentioned earlier , you have had some struggles with sobriety over the years .
How are you making out these days ?
I am as sober as a judge !
Believe or not .
Ya know , I have battled alcoholism most of my adult life .
Drugs I gave up many , many years ago .
It ’s a dead end street .
On a weekend , it was nice to do a line or two but then it just snowballed into “ out - of - control -ism . ”
I am half Irish , so I still like to tip ’em but for my own reasons and health reasons , I do n’t do it anymore .
What do you think of shows like VH1 ’s Celebrity Rehab and have you ever been approached to be part of a reality series ?
I went to rehab about two months ago for the umph teenth time and yeah , I have been approached to do a reality show .
In fact , there is one in the hopper right now .
We did a few months of filming and it is n’t quite to the point where they want it to be .
So , whatever will be will be .
If it get it , I get it , and if not there is always something else right around the corner .
There is a movie that I was just approached about , mob related stuff , I think I am going to take the role .
Ya know , I gotta pay the bills and it is cool .
I enjoy working , ya know ! [ laughs ]
You also mentioned your paintings and you have been selling them online for quite a while now .
What made you pick up the brush originally ?
I never thought I had it in me .
It is just fun art and it relaxes me , just like my cooking .
It ’s just like going to a shrink !
[ laughs ]
It just relaxes me and takes my mind off of the rest of the world .
My brain does n’t stop and I can’t shut it off sometimes , and picking up a brush is a good way to shut it off .
I really do some good watercolors , but I like doing that funny art too .
It sells and people like it .
I get a lot of compliments on it believe it or not ! [ laughs ]
I do some really serious work occasionally .

Like I said , I come from a family of eight children , so I was always on her apron strings , just to get a minute or a word in edgewise .
I love to cook and I love to see people enjoy my cooking .
I consider myself an excellent chef and I always said that I wanted to write a cookbook , so I wrote one !
It ’s still in bookstores and it is very successful .
I was always in the restaurant business for one reason or another .
Our restaurants or night clubs were our offices and that is where we conducted business .
Do you have a dish that you consider to be your signature dish ?
Anything with sauce in it .
I have a sauce business that is just getting off the ground .
It ’s called Henry Hill ’s Sunday Gravy .
That is what they call the sauce back east .
The other day , I did two big pans of eggplant parmesan , I like to cook healthy and I like to cook mostly organic .
I just like people to enjoy my food , so there is n’t one that I could pick out as my favorite .
When can we look forward to Henry Hill ’s Sunday Gravy hitting the store shelves ?
Hopefully , very soon .
There are so many hurdles to jump through as far as government regulation and this and that .
Then it is a matter of getting shelf space .
I have some really good people negotiating to get it into major chains .
Do you think we will get anymore books out of you in the future ?
Yeah , I am working on the “ untold stories ” right now .
There are a lot of stories that I have n’t told yet or that did n’t make it into the previous books .
I am also working on another cookbook that is focused on appetizers and desserts .
I like to keep busy because if I get bored , I am susceptible to get into trouble !
[ laughs ]
Yeah and hopefully one or two of them will pan out .
You mentioned that you have been working on several scripts ?
What can you tell us about that ?
We just finished the script for the Boston College fix from the ’ 78 - ’79 season .
We have only approached one person with it and they are still debating .
Hopefully , we will see that movie made , only because they should be paying these college basketball players .
Those kids have to work at Pizza Hut or some place to subsidize their expenses .
A few year back there were a few rumors flying around about a possible sequel to Goodfellas , based on ‘ Gangsters and Goodfellas , ’ any light you might be able to shed on that ?
Yeah , there is a lot of interest in it .
Scorsese does n’t do sequels , so it is about finding the right director and writer attached to it .
Of course , I do n’t see anyone else but Ray Liotta playing me again .
But ya know , it ’s a long arduous process to get something done in L.A .
I got the impression from Goodfellas and your books , that in your past and even today with all your ventures , that you were trying to achieve your version of the American Dream .
Is the American Dream still alive ?
Absolutely .
Even with the economy the way it is .
What is the American Dream ?
To have a million dollars , to have ten million dollars or is it just to provide for your family , pay your bills on time and do n’t let anyone break your balls ?
[ laughs ]
Just do the right thing , that is the American Dream or try and do the right thing .
There are so many stumbling blocks in life , it ’s heaven or hell , it ’s what you make of it .

The US House subcommittee on Financial Services is agitating to legalize payday loans with 391 % APRs .
Key committee members have received large campaign contributions from the " payday " industry , and the committee chairman , Luiz Gutierrez ( who also received contributions from the payday people ) says the reason he 's offering the industry this sweetheart deal after being on record as opposing this sort of thing is that their powerful lobbying has left him powerless to resist them : " … [ T ] hey 're very powerful .
Their influence should not be underestimated . "
After watching members of the military fall prey to exorbitant payday loans , Congress in 2006 capped the interest rates for military payday loans at 36 % .
Fifteen states have similar caps or outright bans .
Congressman Gutierrez is competing with Congressman Joe Baca to see who can author the biggest giveaway .
Baca 's legislation would allow rollovers , higher fees for online banks , and would pre-empt state laws banning payday loans .

CIA Director Leon E. Panetta on Friday fired back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , saying agency records showed officials had briefed her truthfully about its interrogation program .
He also urged the CIA workforce to ignore the political rancor consuming Capitol Hill .
Panetta ’s assertions came one day after Pelosi accused the agency of misleading Congress by failing to inform her during a fall 2002 briefing that the CIA had used waterboarding and other severe methods on an Al Qaeda suspect .
Panetta ’s written statement , which was directed to CIA employees but released publicly , marked a rare instance in which the secretive agency ’s leadership has chosen to publicly challenge a high - ranking lawmaker .
“ Let me be clear :
It is not our policy or practice to mislead Congress , ” said Panetta , a former member of the House of Representatives from Monterey .
“ That is against our laws and our values . ”

The statement is likely to keep Pelosi at the center of a roiling controversy over CIA interrogation methods that President Obama banned during his first week in office .
As it has evolved , it now pits Pelosi against Panetta , another prominent California Democrat .
Republicans have accused Pelosi of hypocrisy for being a vocal critic of the CIA ’s interrogation operations even though she appears to have made little attempt to alter the program when she first learned about it more than six years ago .
CIA records indicate that Pelosi attended a briefing in September 2002 during which she was told about agency interrogation techniques that had been used .
The records do not indicate with certainty that waterboarding was covered .
A month earlier , the CIA had used the simulated drowning method on Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah at least 83 times .

Pelosi has maintained that she was not told that waterboarding was being used , only that it was a method under consideration .
But on Thursday she raised the stakes by accusing the CIA of deliberately concealing the truth .
“ The only mention of waterboarding at that briefing was that it was not being employed , ” she said Thursday .
She acknowledged that five months later she was informed by a senior aide that waterboarding was being used .
The Obama administration has sought to avoid being drawn into the controversy , but Panetta emerged Friday to defend the agency .
Panetta did not directly say that Pelosi was wrong in her assertion , citing agency records .
“ Our contemporaneous records from September 2002 indicate that CIA officers briefed truthfully on the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah , describing ‘ the enhanced techniques that had been employed . ’ ”

In his statement , Panetta also asked agency employees to overlook the controversy .
“ My advice -- indeed , my direction -- to you is straightforward , ” Panetta told employees .
“ Ignore the noise and stay focused on your mission .
. . .
Our task is to tell it like it is -- even if that ’s not what people always want to hear . ”

( I 'm traveling and blogging from Guatemala right now , so expect a number of posts from me specific to this region . – XJ ) .
The excellent work of Guatemala - based photojournalist James Rodriguez has been featured on BB a number of times before .
The most recent photo - essay on his blog documents a protest march that took place a few days ago in the capital here , carried out by indigenous people from San Miguel Ixtahuacan , where the Canadian mining giant Goldcorp operates the Marlin Gold Mine .
Background here on the mine , and Goldcorp 's campaign of harassment and intimidation of indigenous residents .
Snip :
The movement , made up almost in its entirety by indigenous local Mam Mayans , reiterated their intention to pursue a peaceful dialogue so as to bring to a close Montana 's mining activities in the region .
As of now , three people have died due to the toxic contamination in the local water sources and other natural resources .
Gregoria Crisanta Perez , one of the 8 women accused by Goldcorp of sabotaging their electric supply ( read more about the case here ) , declares : " We demand our rights because we do not want to be killed by the mining company .
We ask the government to please listen to our demands , as we are the legitimate owners of the territories .
We are indigenous people , we were born there , and we should die there .
But our death should be decided by God , not by the mining company . "
A few meters down the road from the Canadian Embassy , one of the many Goldcorp billboards that can be found in Guatemala City read : " We invest in the dreams of a developing country . "
Some residents of San Miguel Ixtahuacan identified the billboard and felt it was inappropriate due to the damage they have suffered from the mine 's presence in their communities .
Gradually , protestors began tearing little pieces as an expression of discontent with the mining company that has incited grave social conflicts .
Dozens of people suddenly charged the billboard euphorically in a festive mood .
San Miguel Ixtahuacan is Waking Up : Guatemala City , Guatemala . ( mimundo.org )
By nature a doubting Thomas , I should have distrusted the symptoms when I underwent a " conversion experience " 20 years ago .
Something was happening which was out of character - the inner glow of complete certainty , the heady sense of being at one with the great tide of fellow non-believers .
For my conversion experience was to atheism .
There were several moments of epiphany , actually , but one of the most dramatic occurred in the pulpit of a church .
At St Mary - le - Bow in the City of London , there are two pulpits , and for some decades they have been used for lunchtime dialogues .
I had just published a biography of C S Lewis , and the rector of St Mary - le - Bow , Victor Stock , asked me to participate in one such exchange of views .
Memory edits , and perhaps distorts , the highlights of the discussion .
Memory says that while Father Stock was asking me about Lewis , I began to " testify " , denouncing Lewis 's muscular defence of religious belief .
Much more to my taste , I said , had been the approach of the late Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey , whose biography I had just read .
A young priest had been to see him in great distress , saying that he had lost his faith in God .
Ramsey 's reply was a long silence followed by a repetition of the mantra " It does n't matter , it does n't matter " .
He told the priest to continue to worship Jesus in the Sacraments and that faith would return .
" But ! " exclaimed Father Stock .
" That priest was me ! "
Like many things said by this amusing man , it brought the house down .
But something had taken a grip of me , and I was thinking ( did I say it out loud ? ) :
" It bloody well does matter .
Just struggling on like Lord Tennyson ( ' and faintly trust the larger hope ' ) is no good at all . . . "
I can remember almost yelling that reading C S Lewis 's Mere Christianity made me a non-believer - not just in Lewis 's version of Christianity , but in Christianity itself .
On that occasion , I realised that after a lifetime of churchgoing , the whole house of cards had collapsed for me - the sense of God 's presence in life , and the notion that there was any kind of God , let alone a merciful God , in this brutal , nasty world .
As for Jesus having been the founder of Christianity , this idea seemed perfectly preposterous .
In so far as we can discern anything about Jesus from the existing documents , he believed that the world was about to end , as did all the first Christians .
So , how could he possibly have intended to start a new religion for Gentiles , let alone established a Church or instituted the Sacraments ?
It was a nonsense , together with the idea of a personal God , or a loving God in a suffering universe .
Nonsense , nonsense , nonsense .
It was such a relief to discard it all that , for months , I walked on air .
At about this time , the Independent on Sunday sent me to interview Dr Billy Graham , who was conducting a mission in Syracuse , New York State , prior to making one of his journeys to England .
The pattern of these meetings was always the same .
The old matinee idol spoke .
The gospel choir sang some suitably affecting ditty , and then the converted made their way down the aisles to commit themselves to the new faith .
Part of the glow was , surely , the knowledge that they were now part of a great fellowship of believers .
As a hesitant , doubting , religious man I 'd never known how they felt .
But , as a born - again atheist , I now knew exactly what satisfactions were on offer .
For the first time in my 38 years I was at one with my own generation .
I had become like one of the Billy Grahamites , only in reverse .
If I bumped into Richard Dawkins ( an old colleague from Oxford days ) or had dinner in Washington with Christopher Hitchens ( as I did either on that trip to interview Billy Graham or another ) , I did not have to feel out on a limb .
Hitchens was excited to greet a new convert to his non-creed and put me through a catechism before uncorking some stupendous claret .
" So - absolutely no God ? " " Nope , " I was able to say with Moonie - zeal .
" No future life , nothing ' out there ' ? "
" No , " I obediently replied .
At last !
I could join in the creed shared by so many ( most ? ) of my intelligent contemporaries in the western world - that men and women are purely material beings ( whatever that is supposed to mean ) , that " this is all there is " ( ditto ) , that God , Jesus and religion are a load of baloney : and worse than that , the cause of much ( no , come on , let yourself go ) , most ( why stint yourself - go for it , man ) , all the trouble in the world , from Jerusalem to Belfast , from Washington to Islamabad .
My doubting temperament , however , made me a very unconvincing atheist .
And unconvinced .
My hilarious Camden Town neighbour Colin Haycraft , the boss of Duckworth and husband of Alice Thomas Ellis , used to say , " I do wish Freddie [ Ayer ] would n't go round calling himself an atheist .
It implies he takes religion seriously . "
This creed that religion can be despatched in a few brisk arguments ( outlined in David Hume 's masterly Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion ) and then laughed off kept me going for some years .
When I found myself wavering , I would return to Hume in order to pull myself together , rather as a Catholic having doubts might return to the shrine of a particular saint to sustain them while the springs of faith ran dry .
But religion , once the glow of conversion had worn off , was not a matter of argument alone .
It involves the whole person .
Therefore I was drawn , over and over again , to the disconcerting recognition that so very many of the people I had most admired and loved , either in life or in books , had been believers .
Reading Louis Fischer 's Life of Mahatma Gandhi , and following it up with Gandhi's own autobiography , The Story of My Experiments With Truth , I found it impossible not to realise that all life , all being , derives from God , as Gandhi gave his life to demonstrate .
Of course , there are arguments that might make you doubt the love of God .
But a life like Gandhi's , which was focused on God so deeply , reminded me of all the human qualities that have to be denied if you embrace the bleak , muddled creed of a materialist atheist .
It is a bit like trying to assert that music is an aberration , and that although Bach and Beethoven are very impressive , one is better off without a musical sense .
Attractive and amusing as David Hume was , did he confront the complexities of human existence as deeply as his contemporary Samuel Johnson , and did I really find him as interesting ?
Watching a whole cluster of friends , and my own mother , die over quite a short space of time convinced me that purely materialist " explanations " for our mysterious human existence simply wo n't do - on an intellectual level .
The phenomenon of language alone should give us pause .
A materialist Darwinian was having dinner with me a few years ago and we laughingly alluded to how , as years go by , one forgets names .
Eager , as committed Darwinians often are , to testify on any occasion , my friend asserted : " It is because when we were simply anthropoid apes , there was no need to distinguish between one another by giving names . "
This credal confession struck me as just as superstitious as believing in the historicity of Noah 's Ark .
More so , really .
Do materialists really think that language just " evolved " , like finches ' beaks , or have they simply never thought about the matter rationally ?
Where 's the evidence ?
How could it come about that human beings all agreed that particular grunts carried particular connotations ?
How could it have come about that groups of anthropoid apes developed the amazing morphological complexity of a single sentence , let alone the whole grammatical mystery which has engaged Chomsky and others in our lifetime and linguists for time out of mind ?
No , the existence of language is one of the many phenomena - of which love and music are the two strongest - which suggest that human beings are very much more than collections of meat .
They convince me that we are spiritual beings , and that the religion of the incarnation , asserting that God made humanity in His image , and continually restores humanity in His image , is simply true .
As a working blueprint for life , as a template against which to measure experience , it fits .
For a few years , I resisted the admission that my atheist - conversion experience had been a bit of middle - aged madness .
I do not find it easy to articulate thoughts about religion .
I remain the sort of person who turns off Thought for the Day when it comes on the radio .
I am shy to admit that I have followed the advice given all those years ago by a wise archbishop to a bewildered young man : that moments of unbelief " do n't matter " , that if you return to a practice of the faith , faith will return .
When I think about atheist friends , including my father , they seem to me like people who have no ear for music , or who have never been in love .
It is not that ( as they believe ) they have rumbled the tremendous fraud of religion - prophets do that in every generation .
Rather , these unbelievers are simply missing out on something that is not difficult to grasp .
Perhaps it is too obvious to understand ; obvious , as lovers feel it was obvious that they should have come together , or obvious as the final resolution of a fugue .
I have n't mentioned morality , but one thing that finally put the tin hat on any aspirations to be an unbeliever was writing a book about the Wagner family and Nazi Germany , and realising how utterly incoherent were Hitler 's neo -Darwinian ravings , and how potent was the opposition , much of it from Christians ; paid for , not with clear intellectual victory , but in blood .
Read Pastor Bonhoeffer 's book Ethics , and ask yourself what sort of mad world is created by those who think that ethics are a purely human construct .
Think of Bonhoeffer 's serenity before he was hanged , even though he was in love and had everything to look forward to .
My departure from the Faith was like a conversion on the road to Damascus .
My return was slow , hesitant , doubting .
So it will always be ; but I know I shall never make the same mistake again .
Gilbert Ryle , with donnish absurdity , called God " a category mistake " .
Yet the real category mistake made by atheists is not about God , but about human beings .
Turn to the Table Talk of Samuel Taylor Coleridge - " Read the first chapter of Genesis without prejudice and you will be convinced at once . . .
' The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ' . "
And then Coleridge adds : " ' And man became a living soul . '
Materialism will never explain those last words . "
need to go back to a LONG LONG LONG time ago ... when the sun was responsible for everything .
the sun was probably the first " god " .
hell , food could have been the first god .
animals , plants , water ... these things made hunger go away .
That is pretty powerful .
we now have ipods ... but you need to go back to cimoputers and tapes and dvd's and cd's and electricity , and guitars etc etc .
What has resulted today from the beginnings would be extrmely difficult if not damn right impossible to prove when it was first invented ... or what was first invented that ended up causing the god we have today to exist .
Hell , if constantine doesnt win the war aroudn 350 that he credits to christ , there probably woudl be no christianity today ... or things woudl be quite different than they are .
Look at every culture throughout time , and they ahve always had some god they prayed to ... whether it was the spirit of the animal the indians killed , or the egyptians worhsipping the sun .. or the mayans , etc .
They all had different versions of god/s .
Their gods are as likely and believable of being true as ours is ... THAT IS A FACT .
Anyone who chooses not to beleive that , or is unable to grasp that concept , is either choosing to not look at something they dont want to see , or are that " slow " that they dont have the capacity to .
Whether or not you beleive in this god or not , you MUST give credence to the fact that our god is no different than the gods of other cultures .
Whatever the rationale is for belief in their gods is the same set of reasons for our belief in our gods .
Why is belief in our gods a real fact belief , yet their belief in their gods considered mythology folklore and complete nonsense .
To everyone , the other people 's gods are just fairy tales ... and they say the same thing about your gods as you say about their gods .
Your belief is as foolish to them as their belief is foolish to you .
A top National Rifle Association official said the Obama administration is using the increasingly violent drug cartels in Mexico as an excuse to push for reinstating the ban on assault weapons .
“ They ’re trying to piggyback this whole phony issue on the back of the tragedy in Mexico , ” said Wayne LaPierre , executive vice president of the gun-rights group , on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” program Sunday .
In a speech in Mexico last week , President Obama - who on the campaign trail called for reinstating the ban , which expired in 2004 - said that while the prohibition made sense , pushing for it now would be a political non-starter .
But in the meantime , he said , the country should enforce existing laws more vigorously .
White House senior adviser David Axelrod said in another “ Face the Nation ” segment that the administration will “ monitor ” the issue , which is complicated by opposition from dozens of moderate Democrats from the more - conservative “ red ” states .
“ If there ’s a consensus , we ’ll move on it , ” Mr. Axelrod said on the program .
“ We ’re faced with an enormous array of challenges , and we need to make some choices as to which to pursue first . ”
Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell called on Congress to reinstate the ban , after three Pittsburgh policemen were killed recently by a man with an AK - 47 .
But the Democratic governor said he understands Mr. Obama ’s decision not to raise the matter now , with major issues such as the economy and health care on the table .
“ But I think it has to be brought up in the near future , because every police organization in this country supports , virtually everyone supports , banning assault weapons , ” he said , appearing Sunday on CBS alongside Mr. LaPierre .
Mr. LaPierre said that assault weapons are “ functionally no different than any other gun ” and that Mr. Rendell and other supporters of the ban are distorting the facts .
The 1994 assault - weapons ban “ was enacted … on the basis of saying these were machine guns .
That ’s a lie .
They were rapid - fire .
That ’s a lie .
They made bigger holes .
That ’s a lie .
They were more powerful .
That ’s a lie .
It was lie after lie after lie , ” he said .
“ Congress found it out .
That ’s why they let it expire , and lies that are found out do n’t get re-enacted . ”
Mr. LaPierre also accused administration officials of misstating the percentage of guns used in Mexican crimes that are smuggled into Mexico from the U.S. , challenging a popularly cited figure of 90 percent that Mr. Obama used in his speech .
He said there is no proof for the figure , which has also been referenced by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
“ I challenge the president of the United States and the media to prove that 90 percent of the guns used by the drug cartels are being smuggled , ” Mr. LaPierre said .
“ The only people that have ever put up their hand in the air and testified under oath on this is BATF , two weeks ago in Congress .
And let me tell you what they said : ‘ I ’m not sure where those institutes get these numbers , ’ ” Mr. LaPierre concluded , referring to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
A recent Fox News analysis of the issue noted that the statistic only covers some of the guns that were submitted by Mexico to the BATF for tracing .
Of those 11,000 guns , almost 6,000 could be traced , and more than 5,100 of those were linked to the U.S. - or close to 90 percent .
The statistic excludes the 5,000 guns that could not be traced , and also leaves out the 18,000 guns from Mexican crime scenes that were never sent to the U.S. because it was obvious the weapons came from somewhere else .
Mr. Rendell did not address the statistic .
In the often - tense debate , both men echoed traditional arguments for and against increased gun control .
“ There ’s absolutely no reason under the sun , no rational reason that we should allow people to legally possess these types of semi-automatic assault weapons .
They ’re made for one purpose .
They ’re not used in a duck line for hunting .
They ’re not used in the Olympics for target shooting .
They ’re used to kill and maim people , and most often it ’s police officers , ” Mr. Rendell said .
Mr. LaPierre argued that increased gun-control limits wo n’t deter killers and other criminals .
“ Do n’t you get it ?
They ’re criminals .
They violate all your laws , ” he said .

The Daily Mail has paid £ 10,000 libel damages each to three women after it ran a story alleging they rated their careers and figures more highly than having children .
The three women , Edwina Langley , Lisa Beard - Rogers and Thema Davis , complained to the Mail , through London law firm Carter - Ruck , after the paper published an article on 5 November last year in its Femail section about them choosing to adopt rather than give birth naturally .
Its story was headlined : " For most women , giving birth is the most fulfilling event in their lives .
But some are so afraid of missing out on their careers and losing their figures they refuse to go through pregnancy and choose adoption instead .
Practical , or just plain selfish ? "
A statement issued today by Carter - Ruck said the article contained a number of " false , defamatory and deeply offensive allegations about the three women " and that the Mail had accepted the allegations were " untrue and should never have been published " .
" It would be difficult to overstate just how hurt and upset we were at the way in which the Daily Mail completely misrepresented our views on adoption , " Langley said .
The Mail blamed the offending elements on an unnamed executive who controlled a rewrite of the story , the statement from Carter - Ruck said , rather than the journalists who interviewed the women .
Beard - Rogers , Davis and a fourth woman , Katharine Parker , who was also mentioned in the story , originally complained to the PCC over the article which the Mail resolved by publishing an apology in February this year and writing to each of the women .
The online apology , made to all four women , pointed out that Langley always wanted to become a mother and that neither her figure nor her career played any part in her decision to adopt .
It went on to outline how Beard - Rogers 's views on adoption and pregnancy had nothing to do with her figure or her career .
" Our article did not explain that Thema Davis suffers from a disability that would make having children naturally extremely difficult , " the Mail apology added .
" She did not think of pregnancy as ' hell ' and it had nothing to do with her hip size . "
The online apology also said Parker wanted it made clear adoption did not have a catastrophic effect on her marriage and that she did not choose adoption to protect her figure or her work .

THE EVERGLADES , Florida ( Reuters ) -
The population of Burmese pythons in Florida ’s Everglades may have grown to as many as 150,000 as the non-native snakes make a home and breed in the fragile wetlands , officials said Thursday .
Wildlife biologists say the troublesome invaders -- dumped in the Everglades by pet owners who no longer want them -- have become a pest and pose a significant threat to endangered species like the wood stork and Key Largo woodrat .
“ They eat things that we care about , ” said Skip Snow , an Everglades National Park biologist , as he showed a captured , 15 - foot ( 4.6 - meter ) Burmese python to U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , who was on his first fact - finding mission to the Everglades since the Obama administration took office .
With Snow maintaining a strong grip on its head , the massive snake hissed angrily at Salazar and the other federal officials who gathered around it at a recreation area off Alligator Alley in the vast saw grass prairie .
It took two other snake wranglers to control the python ’s body .
“ A snake this size could eat a small deer or a bobcat without too much trouble , ” Snow told Salazar before the secretary boarded an airboat for a tour of the Everglades .
Everglades biologists have been grappling with the growing python problem for a decade .
The snakes are one of the largest species in the world and natives of Southeast Asia , but they found a home to their liking in the Everglades when pet owners started using the wetland as a convenient dumping ground .
“ They ’re fine when they ’re small but they can live 25 to 30 years .
When they get bigger you have to feed them small animals like rabbits , and cleaning up after them , it ’s like cleaning up after a horse , ” Snow said .
“ People do n’t want big snakes . ”
TRAPPERS AND HUNTERS
Pythons captured in the Everglades are often killed .
Wildlife officials are trying trapping and other eradication methods , and are considering offering bounties to hunters .
Scientists are experimenting with ways to lure the snakes into traps , including the use of pheromones -- chemicals that serve as sexual attractants -- as bait .
“ They are estimating there are 150,000 of these snakes .
They proliferate so quickly , ” said Florida Senator Bill Nelson , who accompanied Salazar on the airboat tour of the Everglades .
“ They ’ve already found grown deer , they ’ve found full sized bobcats inside them .
It ’s just a matter of time before one gets the highly endangered Florida panther . ”
But biologists played down the risk to the panther , the most endangered species in the Everglades .
There are believed to be only about 100 left , but they range over a territory of some 2 million acres .
“ It would take some awfully unique circumstances for a python and a panther to meet up , ” said Darrell Land , a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission biologist .
“ And the cats are very wary and they have very quick reaction times . ”
Pythons are not the only invader troubling the Everglades .
New fish and rodent species have also become pests , and two thriving colonies of the Nile monitor lizard , an Africa native that can grow to 7 feet in length , have established themselves on opposite sides of the state .
Nelson , a Democrat , said the Obama administration had committed $ 200 million , including $ 100 million of stimulus money , so far this year to Everglades restoration , a 35 - year project valued at $ 8 billion when it was started nearly a decade ago .
The project is designed to restore natural water flow and native wildlife populations to the shallow , slow - moving river that dominates the interior of southern Florida .
“ We ’re putting judges in the position to determine sentences based on the facts of a case , and not on mandatory minimum sentences , ” said Jeffrion L. Aubry , an assemblyman from Queens who has led the effort for repeal .
“ To me , that is the restoration of justice . ”
The agreement , which requires approval in the Assembly and the Senate , would allow some drug offenders who are currently in prison to apply to have their sentences commuted .
It was not clear on Wednesday how many current prisoners would be eligible to apply .
Mr. Paterson has pushed to have fewer prisoners than legislative leaders would prefer .
While a few points , like a resentencing provision and the amount the state is willing to spend on the plan , were still being negotiated late Wednesday , lawmakers said they were on track to wipe out the central elements of laws that have been criticized for decades as overly punitive and disproportionately harmful to minorities .
The laws , passed in 1973 , are commonly known as the Rockefeller drug laws because they were championed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller in what was considered a bold response to the sharp rise in heroin use and property crimes among young people .
A spokeswoman for Mr. Paterson , Marissa Shorenstein , said reaching the deal , which she stressed was still being forged , was a personal victory for the governor , who has made drug law reform a priority of his administration .
When he was a state senator , Mr. Paterson was arrested in 2002 at a demonstration outside Gov. George E. Pataki ’s Midtown Manhattan office protesting the drug laws .
Two days ago , General Motors said that it would be killing off the Pontiac brand .
Before the company had even finished its prepared statement , police squads across the country were moaning .
Here 's why : once upon a time , the Ford Crown Victoria was the police car of choice , but some police departments have begun looking to replace their Crown Vic fleets -- namely , with the Pontiac G8 .
The death of Pontiac meant the death of that beautiful , rear - wheel - drive dream .
But all is not lost .
Since the G8 is really just a rebadged Holden Commodore , and since Holden is doing fine and dandy in its homeland of Australia , U.S. police departments could , theoretically , import G8s for their jurisdictions .
And that 's exactly what Australia 's National Safety Agency is hoping they 'll do .
In fact , the NSA has partnered with the Los Angeles Police Department to prototype and refine the G8 for law enforcement use .
If a deal is brokered , it could give American police departments the opportunity to import up to 40,000 G8s per year ( though they 'd technically be badged as Chevrolets ) .
The deal could go further , to include Canada , England , and the Middle East .
So , as the saying goes : Pontiac is dead !
Long live Pontiac !

Hallelujah , praise the Lord , Wise Blood is out on DVD .
John Huston 's hellfire burlesque is one of the great lost films of the 1970s and a movie to stand alongside his Maltese Falcon or The Treasure of the Sierra Madre .
I first blundered across the thing as a teenager , stumbling blind around the late - night TV schedules .
Last night I paid a return trip and was reassured ( I hesitate to say relieved ) to find it just as rich , dark and flat - out weird as it was before .
Adapted ( pretty faithfully ) from the novel by Flannery O'Connor , Wise Blood charts the efforts of a wild - eyed young preacher to establish a new religion .
Rattling around a depressed southern town , antsy Hazel Motes ( Brad Dourif ) preaches the gospel of " the Church of Christ Without Christ - where the blind can't see , the lame do n't walk and the dead stay that way " .
But Motes possesses an achilles heel .
He is at least half in love with what he professes to hate , affecting the outfit and the speech of a Pentecostal Bible - basher even as he urges his flock to throw off their shackles and shrug off their sins .
" Nothing matters but that Jesus was a liar , " he harangues them from the bonnet of his car .
" I ain't saying that he were n't crucified , but it were n't for you . "
Huston ( credited here as " Jonh Huston " ) was 72 when he shot Wise Blood – a Hollywood lion in his dotage .
You 'd never guess .
Wise Blood feels like a first film : energetic , unrefined and a little off - kilter , as though the director was tussling with his material ; slightly flying by the seat of his pants .
And yet for all its berserk gestures and grotesque inhabitants , the end product proves utterly convincing .
Wise Blood is funny , sad and thought - provoking .
It is brilliantly played by a cast of left - field character actors ( Dourif , Ned Beatty , William Hickey , Harry Dean Stanton ) .
It may also be the film that best captures a particularly American strain of craziness - spotlighting a southern subculture where shifty men peddle Jesus on street corners and lonesome kids go quietly insane at the local zoo .
At times , in fact , the film is so peculiarly , locally , pure - bloodedly American that it turns almost otherworldly - as exotic to our eyes as some arcane arthouse delicacy , blown in from Eritrea or the Kazakh steppes .
We do n't know quite why these characters are doing what they 're doing , exactly , but we believe them just the same .
Wise Blood is finally released on DVD in the UK on 2 March .
It is the film that was lost and now it is found , and for that we should be thankful .
But why has it taken so long ?
It 's not as though Huston is an obscure film - maker , or that the 70s American film scene has been starved of attention in recent years .
Perhaps it simply goes to show that , even the most well - mapped , well - settled landscape , there are still some dark corners to hide away .
When setting out the landmarks of 70s American cinema , we inevitably namecheck the usual suspects : Badlands , Nashville , Taxi Driver , The Last Picture Show , Chinatown , etc .
And fair enough : they 're all great films .
But the more light we shine on the anointed few , the more we risk blinding ourselves to the others , to films that are arguably just as interesting , ambitious and unusual but which have been left to languish in the shadows .
Films like Wise Blood , say , or The Hired Hand , They Might Be Giants , Cockfighter , Smile or The King of Marvin Gardens .
Hapless Hazel Motes tries to bury Jesus but can't , because Jesus will not be denied .
He is " the ragged beggar , darting from tree to tree in his mind " .
Wise Blood is a bit like that too , and chances are it's not alone .
What other great forgotten films are still out there in the woods , ragged but alive ; waiting for us to track them down and bring them home ?

The Lithuanian government predicts growth will return in 2011 The Lithuanian economy shrank by 12.6 % in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year , the country 's statistics office has said .
Falling industrial output , lower demand for exported goods and a lack of credit were blamed for the decline .
It is the country 's largest contraction in gross domestic product ( GDP ) since it started official records in 1995 .
Lithuania , which joined the EU in 2004 , has forecast a contraction in GDP of 10.5 % for the whole of this year .
But on a quarter - to - quarter basis , the decline was 9.5 % .
" Our economy is falling into deep hole , and I see no positive signs in the nearest future , " said Gitanas Nauseda , an analyst at SEB Bank in Vilnius .
The country 's Prime Minister , Andrius Kubilius , said , " We hope that next year we shall have a much lower GDP decrease or even stability in GDP , and then we are forecasting that we should return back to GDP growth in 2011 . "
The contraction in the Lithuanian economy is believed to be the largest so far of any country affected by the global recession , and marks a sharp reversal of fortunes for this small Baltic state .
Baltic fears
The Lithuanian economy grew by 8.9 % in 2007 , which was a record increase for the country , but last year growth had slowed to 3 % .
But falls in demand for construction , the retail industry and textile sectors have contributed to the turnaround , according to the Lithuanian office for statistics .
Analysts say the size of the decline suggests the economies of the other two Baltic states in the EU , Latvia and Estonia , are also poised to contract by more than 10 % .
Estonia 's central bank has already forecast that the economy there will shrink by 12 % this year .
Meanwhile Latvia 's Finance Ministry has predicted the country 's GDP will contract by 15 % in 2009 .
According to the World Bank , Eastern Europe is likely to have been the hardest hit by the financial meltdown of any region .
The IMF is expecting to have to lend billions to help bail - out its damaged economies .
Latvia has already sought a rescue package .

This year , we not only commemorate the 50 years of Frank Lloyd Wright ’s death , but also the 50 years of the opening of one of his masterpieces : The Guggenheim Museum .
The museum will celebrate with the exhibition Frank Lloyd Wright : From Within Outward , co-organized by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation .
On view from May 15 through August 23 , 2009 , the 50th anniversary exhibition brings together sixty - four projects by F.L. Wright , including privately commissioned residences , civic and government buildings , religious and performance spaces , as well as unrealized urban mega-structures .
Presented on the spiral ramps of Wright ’s museum through a range of mediums — including more than 200 original Frank Lloyd Wright drawings , many of which are on view to the public for the first time , as well as newly commissioned models and digital animations — Frank Lloyd Wright : From Within Outward illuminates
Wright ’s pioneering concepts of space and reveals the architect ’s continuing relevance to contemporary design .
The exhibition takes place between May 15 and August 23 , 2009 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum , New York .
You can also visit an online version of the exhibition .
Every time I browse EcoEtsy to see what our favorite artists are up to , I ’m reminded that their resourcefulness knows no end .
In the minds of these creative individuals , a clock can be much more than just a face , hands and numbers .
Made from the most cleverly recycled materials , the unique timepieces below are functionally funky works of art .
When was the last time you actually played that backgammon set buried deep in your closet ?
As it turns out , this dusty old game ’s geometric shapes and contrasting colors make the Board Game clock a fun accent for modern interiors .
You can continue your board game collection with the Candy Land Time lunchpail clock from Imotime .
Sweetly vintage !
A temporary brain drain caused me to recycle my newspaper on the fifth of November like it was any other day .
Unfortunately , it was n’t .
Thanks to Makin Time , I can still have a keepsake from this monumental moment in history : the Obama Headline clock ( shown at top ) .

It ’s a good thing with the obesity epidemic that videogame companies here are n’t getting into co-branded snack foods !
However in Japan that does n’t seem to be a worry so far as game publisher From Software has made a deal to create a ninja themed snack to coincide with the release of their game Onore no Shinzuru Michi wo Tatashike .
The game takes place in Edo - era Japan where ninja warriors have to solve puzzles to recuse a princess :
I hope those ninja warriors do n’t get too distracted by junk food to do their job !
Below is the package design which looks delicious :
And here are some screenshots which will give you a better taste of the game :
PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters Life ! ) -
A three - foot telescope used by the Italian astronomer Galileo , whose discoveries revolutionized astronomy , is the main attraction at an exhibition at the Franklin Institute .
On its first trip outside of Italy , the 400 - year - old telescope is one of only two instruments still known to exist that were used by Galileo to support the Copernican theory that the earth and the other planets revolved around the sun , and not vice versa .
“ There will not be a second time in the States , ” said Paolo Galluzzi , the director of the Instituto e Museo Nationale di Storia della Scienza in Florence , Italy , which loaned the telescope , said of the U.S. tour .
The exhibition , “ Galileo , the Medici , and the Age of Astronomy , ” which begins on Saturday and runs until September 7 , is the opening event of the International Year of Astronomy , to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo ’s discoveries .
The 1610 telescope , tilted in its case at a sharp angle as if focused on the heavens , includes an inscription at one end in which Galileo recorded the instrument ’s magnifying power of 20 .
Following the Philadelphia show the exhibition will travel to Stockholm for about a week before returning to Florence .
Dennis Wint , president of the Franklin Institute , said the exhibition examines Galileo ’s impact on science , the relationship between art and science in the renaissance of the Medici family , the relationship of Galileo to the church , and the relevance of the astronomer today .
“ His achievement transformed the course of human history , ” Wint told a news conference .
The exhibition also includes astronomical and mathematical instruments from the 16th century as well as contemporary scientific books , maps , and portraits of the Medici Dukes of Tuscany who ruled the Italian region from the 15th to the 18th centuries .
Galileo dedicated the book recording his discoveries to the Medici Duke Cosimo II , further boosting the family ’s prestige and influence in the courts of Europe , according to the exhibition .
Many of the scientific instruments on display show the intersection of art and science , as championed by the Medici family .
Among them is a brass level from 1560 with intricate inlaid patterning .
Galluzzi said Galileo used a telescope , not necessarily the one in the Philadelphia show , to identify the four moons of Jupiter on January 13 , 1610 .
“ He was the first man who had the privilege of looking at this , ” Galluzzi said .
“ I imagine his first reaction was thinking that Copernicus was right . ”
Update : Sorry , I changed the picture because I sold it to Whiskas .
It annoys me to death that my picture got stolen several times so I decided to upload the calender sheet here instead of the originalpicture .
I would love to show you the original but its impossible because it got stolen way too often ( > 2.5 M links at Google picture search ) .
Of course its some kind of flattering that so many people like this picture but it becomes a bitter taste to see people earning money with MY work without even asking me .
Now I sold it officially to Whiskas and if you steal it now be prepared of a GOOD lawyer company .
Not to forget that I earned some money toimprove my equipment and to buy food for the homeless cats .
If you see this picture in the Internet on commercial sites be sure that thisis stolen ...

How many childhoods were exterminated in the church - run schools and orphanages of Ireland ?
A report to shatter your faith in God reveals how for six sickening decades , Roman Catholic priests and nuns presided over a culture of institutionalised child abuse .
Rapes , beatings and every kind of humiliation of children was commonplace in Catholic homes , the majority run by the Christian Brothers and Sisters of Mercy .
And they ran them like concentration camps .
It was a Holocaust of childhoods .
True , there were no gas chambers .
True , there were no piles of human remains .
But what they exterminated – those pious Christian Brothers , those devout Sisters of Mercy – was innocence .
The report by Ireland ’s Commission To Inquire Into Child Abuse took nine years to compile and runs to 2,600 pages .
It reveals how child rapists were protected by the church .
How sadism was in the air these children breathed .
How every kind of child - abusing creep imaginable was clutched to the bosom of the church , and given full protection .
When reports of rape and molestation emerged , the paedophile priest responsible was invariably moved to another parish , where he was often back abusing children within days .
The report documents 2,000 stories of ritualised abuse , 2,000 stories of vulnerable children who were wickedly tortured and exploited by the very people meant to be protecting them .
But more than 20 times that number of children passed through these hells on Earth , and many of their horror stories will go to the grave with the victims , just as we do not know the stories of everyone who died in the the gas chambers of Nazi Germany .
Let one story speak for them all .
When Thomas Wall was orphaned , he was sent to a home run by the Christian Brothers .
“ From the age of eight I was sexually abused , ” says Thomas .
“ They had access to you 24 hours a day . ”
Was there ever an institution more grotesquely named than the Christian Brothers , a gang of rapists and bullies who appear to embody the exact opposite of Christian compassion ?
And was there ever a bunch of hags more venal and cruel than the Sisters of Mercy , who showed little mercy to thousands of Irish girls unfortunate enough to fall into their clutches ?
And the children who passed through these Catholic homes from the 30s to the 90s have been betrayed twice .
They were betrayed when subjected to the sexual attentions and sadism of priests and nuns .
And they have been betrayed again now .
Legal action by the Christian Brothers frightened the Commission that compiled the report into censoring abusers ’ names .
It is insane .
Even now , more than 60 years after the Holocaust , old Nazis are dragged into the light to face justice – as they should be .
But the Roman Catholic Church still protects the tormentors of children .
Catholic head Cardinal Sean Brady says , “ I am profoundly sorry and deeply ashamed . ”
It ’s not good enough .
Many victims of the paedophile paradises only gave evidence because they believed justice would be done .
Says John Kelly , of the Survivors of Child Abuse campaign group , “ Victims feel that wounds have been reopened for nothing . ”
Thousands were abused by priests and nuns but we do not know the names of the abusers .
They are still being protected .
And it stinks to high heaven .
Conspiracy - minded types can thank Hitachi for something new to worry about – RFID chips so small you 'll never know they 're there .
The electronics conglomerate recently showed a prototype of an RFID chip measuring a .05 millimeters square and 5 microns thick , about the size of a grain of sand .
They expect to have 'em on the market in two or three years .
The chips are packed with 128 bits of static memory , enough to hold a 38 - digit ID number .
The size make the new chips ideal for embedding in paper , where they could verify the legitimacy of currency or event tickets .
Implantation under the skin would be trivial , allowing you to easily swap info with yourwalls or colon .
Beyond that , let your fevered imagination wander .
We , for example , are reminded of the mysterious " Dust " that pervades Philip Pullmans " His Dark Materials " novels .

The light had been traveling a long time , oh , such a long time .
It had passed gas clouds , tenuous patches of dust , interstellar and then even intergalactic space .
It had blasted through countless atoms and unimaginable stretches of space and time , and now the light had been reduced to a mere echo of its once epic luminosity .
But it was enough ... after spending the age of the Universe careening through it , those few remaining photons finally saw something blocking their path that they could n't barrel their way through .
NASA 's Swift satellite .
And finally , after billions of years , in the early hours of Thursday , April 23 , these electromagnetic bullets slammed into Swift 's gamma-ray detectors .
And when they did , they signaled the detection of the most distant discrete object in the Universe ever seen .
Gamma -ray burst GRB090423A , as it's now called , not only breaks but completely destroys the previous record holder .
In astronomical parlance , it has a redshift of 8.2 , meaning the light from this burst has been traveling for more than 13 billion years !
The previous most distant GRB was seen only just last September , but this new one is nearly 200 million light years farther away .
Wow .
Not too long ago , the most distant objects we had seen and been able to measure were quasars , galaxies spewing out huge amounts of radiation .
The record holders were at ( what seems now to be measly ) redshifts of 5 or 6 , corresponding to 12 billion light years away or so .
But then gamma-ray bursts came on the scene , and blew away those distances .
Swift is a satellite designed to detect these distant blockbusters , and has recorded the fading light from over 30 GRBs so far this year , and several hundred since its launch in 2004 .
I worked on the education and public outreach for Swift for several years , and I remember very well when we bagged a redshift 7 burst , blowing away the previous record .
It was around then that I started to suspect that we might actually see much farther ones , even out to a redshift of 10 ( nearly 13.2 billion light years ) .
This detection of GRB 090423A indicates that 's no pipe dream .
Gemini telescope detection of GRB 090423A .
A gamma-ray burst happens when a massive star -- maybe as much as 100 times the mass of the Sun -- explodes in a supernova .
We 're not exactly sure why , even now , but the forces in the heart of this beast can focus the energy of the explosion into two beams of cosmic destruction ; vast death rays blasting out from the core .
The energies are beyond belief , dwarfing even the Sun 's total emitted energy over its entire lifetime .
Any planet in that beam's way within a few thousand light years of the burst is in for some serious hurt ( which I lovingly detail in my book ) .
But I doubt that happened for 090423A .
When it went off , the Universe itself was only 630 million years old !
There probably were n't enough heavy elements to make earth - like planets , though I suppose gas giants might have been around by then ... but even the first stars themselves were hardly more than 200 million years old at that time .
It 's hard to imagine what the Universe must have looked like when it was so young .
Finding such ancient gamma-ray bursts is crucial in understanding what the early cosmos was like .
We can find out what proportion of elements existed in stars back then , and the way the light is absorbed by intervening dust and gas tells us about them as well .
We know precious little from this era of the Universe , because any object in it was sp far away at the time that they are essentially invisible .
Only the titanic brightness of a GRB allows us to see them at all .
The star that exploded to form this GRB was probably not among the very first in the Universe to be born ; even 230 million years is a long time compared to the lifetime of those extremely massive stars , which may have exploded after living only a million years or so .
But it may have been born in the second generation , stars that formed from gas blown out by the explosions of those first stars .
If so , we 're one step closer to seeing what the very first objects in the Universe were , and how they behaved .
That 's a mystery that has been on the minds of many astronomers for many years , and Swift is whispering to us that we 're almost to the point where they are within our grasp .

CHENNAI : A young software engineer working with Tata Consultancy Services was killed in a suspected computer blast at his home on Telugu Brahmin Street in Velachery late on Friday .
The incident took place when Vijayakumar ( 28 ) , hailing from Madurai , was working on the computer .
Police said his charred body was found in a sitting posture .
���We are yet to ascertain the cause of the blast .
The computer was completely damaged and the deceased was charred , ��� a police officer told TOI .
Vijayakumar was sharing the house with two other software engineers , Vignesh ( 26 ) and Ram Prasad ( 26 ) .
When the accident occurred Ram Prasad was in the room with Vijayakumar , police said .
�� �Ram Prasad had gone to take bath .
He told us that suddenly he heard a blast and when he rushed out he saw the charred body of his friend and fainted , ��� the officer said .
However , the case has baffled the investigating officers .
��� It sounds quite unbelievable .
We have not heard of such a case before .
But the scene of the accident seems to suggest that the youth was killed in an accident as his body was in the sitting position in front of the burnt computer , ��� the official added .

As soon as you know that there are a variety of gods .
That means that god becomes a problematical entity
When you consider the great range of different characters that gods are attributed .
When you think of how the Aztecs defined their god .
When you think that Aborigines did n't define a god at all and that the dreaming creatures were pretty much like humans in their fallibilities and their courage and their lusts and their wants .
As soon as you become aware of that , why you should project some old patriarchal figure with very strong views about women 's modesty and call it god , I do n't know , and I think that 's the question .
Mike Shermer
Well I was a born again Christian for a while and then I became something of a born again atheist .
You know , going around knocking on those doors and telling people not to believe .
And it sort of reminds me of that joke about what do you get when you cross a Jehovah 's Witness with an atheist : Someone who knocks on your door for no reason at all .
Narration
Michael Shermer is an American science writer and the editor of Skeptic magazine .
He founded the Skeptics Society in the United States , a group dedicated to exposing and debunking pseudo - science .
Mike Shermer
In my case it was a change of milieu , different friends , a set of arguments , exposure to science and evolutionary theory , exposure to anthropology , to comparative world religions .
You know you sort of put all that together .
I just remember one day taking out my little ichthus - I had this little fish with the Greek symbols that stand for ' Jesus Christ , Son of God , Saviour . '
I remember my girlfriend had given this to me and I just felt hypocritical wearing it , so I took it off and I guess that 's it , I guess I 'm not a Christian any more .
As I got older I mellowed out more , and I decided at first that rationally agnostic is actually the right term .
When T H Huxley coined the term in 1869 he meant it to be , it 's not knowable .
Not , " I 'm not sure , could go this way , could go that way .
I 'm waiting for just a little more evidence you know . "
That 's not what agnosticism is .
Agnosticism says it is n't possible to know .
So therefore no belief in god , because it is n't possible to know .
That 's agnosticism .
I guess that 's probably what I am .
John Gray
I belong to no religion and I have no religious beliefs .
I would define myself as a sceptic .
I prefer not to think , to describe myself as an atheist or an agnostic because that is too restrictive a set of categories .
Narration
John Gray is one of the world 's most eminent and provocative political philosophers .
Until recently he was Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics .
John Gray
Well sceptic is n't one who has no beliefs .
A sceptic is one who keeps belief to a minimum , and also does n't always insist on making a definite decision about which beliefs one has .
Narration
Gray 's philosophical framework is rigorous and uncompromising .
John Gray
I have no reason to think that human life goes beyond bodily death for example , so I take that as a basic assumption .
I do n't believe that humans are especially privileged creatures in the universe in the way that theists think they are ; that they have souls which other animals do n't have ; that they have a kind of free will that other animals do n't have .
So I do have a variety of beliefs about humans and their situation in the world , but I try to work with as few as I can get by with .
Why does atheism matter ?
Narration
For more than a century atheists assumed that with the advance of science religions would die out ... but they 've refused to go quietly .
Indeed they 've turned up the volume , to the alarm of the atheists .
Phillip Adams
We sit in a world now which is on the edge of total disaster because of raging crusades between Christian and Muslims .
The hatreds between the major religions and within them have never been more intense .
Inga Clendinnen
Now there is clearly more aggression on the part of fundamentalist sects as we'd call them , whether they 're Christian or Islamic or whatever .
But I think there 's also a notable increase in aggression on the part of the great organised religions ; a new readiness to intervene politically .
Narration
The turning point came at the start of the new millennium with an event that shook the world .
Mike Shermer
Since 9/11 the game has changed .
It 's become clear that religions in the modern world can still be very dangerous .
And it 's not that only religious people become fanatics .
There are Marxist ideologists that become fanatics for example , but that is n't who is doing that now .
At the moment it 's extreme religionists that are causing the problem .
John Gray
Secularisation was expected to be , believed to be up until quite recently , up until maybe the last 10 or 20 years an almost inexorable almost unstoppable process all over the world .
Now it 's true that some countries have become somewhat more secular , for example .
Ireland , is a lot more secular than it was 20 years ago .
In Britain most people have long since ceased to be practising Christians .
But on the other hand the great secular parties , the mass movements and the great secular ideologies that existed like Marxism have really crumbled away and the vitality , the energy in the world , and also to some extent the violence in the world , is coming from religions .
So we 're really living it seems to me in a post secular period .
And in a post secular period when religion has vitality you 'd expect what in fact you find , which is a revival of atheism .
Narration
The revival is marked by a torrent of words .
In books and the media atheists are taking on religion .
Their best - known proponents are Richard Dawkins & Christopher Hitchens - leaders of the New Atheists .
Richard Dawkins - Root Of All Evil Part 1
The time has come for people of Reason to say enough is enough .
Religious faith discourages independent thought , it 's divisive and it's dangerous .
Christopher Hitchens - Foreign Correspondent 7 November 2001
Civilisation consists of the leaving behind of the religious mentality - of the mentality of faith , of the mentality of fanaticism , of the mentality of certainty , of the mentality of Holy Books and the Word of God - civilisation begins where that stops , in all societies .
Phillip Adams
I do n't disagree with Dawkins arguments .
I do n't disagree with Hitchins arguments .
I disagree with the atmosphere of their arguments .
I disagree with adding , with fanning the flames of bigotry on this planet by taking positions which are that strong .
John Gray
All these new atheists want to convert the world from belief to unbelief .
And like Christian missionaries like Christian evangelists they believe that if they can alter human beliefs on a large scale then the world will be better .
In fact we have plenty of historical evidence from the Soviet Union and elsewhere that when attempts are made to eradicate religion , to eliminate religion from human life , to de-convert people from religious belief to some other type of belief or unbelief , the results are generally pretty disastrous .
Mike Shermer
The evangelical kind of atheism is not my thing because I 'm not a strong atheist .
I just do n't believe .
I do n't think we can prove there is no god .
I just do n't think it is necessary to do that .
Look if you encounter somebody whose deepest most cherished belief is god and you say , " It 's all bullshit man , why do you believe this crap for ? "
That 's the end of the conversation .
It 's over .
You 've lost them .
You have no hope of converting them .
Inga Clendinnen
On the whole atheists seem to me peaceable beings because they have no vision that they have some understanding of what is truth , which they have a moral duty to impose on others .
Mike Shermer
The problem with the word atheism is that it 's become very pejorative .
In America , you may as well call yourself a child molester or a rapist or something , a communist .
That 's how atheists are treated .
Which is why the New Atheist Movement is something of a political social movement , because it is our way of saying , " Hey look , we 're not going to put up with that any more .
You can't say things like atheists are not moral .
That 's wrong .
You might as well say blacks are not moral , that women are not as smart - that kind of thing .
Well you can't say those other things any more , and you can't say that about atheists anymore . "
What do atheists believe ?
Narration
But what do the non-believers agree on ?
Their views are diverse and they do n't all answer to the name atheist , yet most do share a respect for science .
Mike Shermer
These are part of our science education program .
We are pro-science , we 're not an anti-religious group .
Religion comes up a lot .
That 's simply because it has been such a hot button issue in the last 10 years in America .
Narration
Shermer 's latest book defends Darwin 's theory of evolution by arguing the case against Intelligent Design .
Mike Shermer
But in the long run we want to be in favour of something , not just against .
We 're not just against Big Foot , UFOs , psychic power .
We address those things .
What are we for ?
We 're for critical thinking , rationality , reason , science .
Mark Simkin
Forget what you were taught in school .
According to this museum , the Earth is just 6,000 years old ; there were dinosaurs on Noah 's Ark .
Ken Ham
We believe that Christians , those that believe in the Bible , are going to be more equipped to be able to defend their faith and uphold the authority of God 's word
Inga Clendinnen
When I think of the rise of the Intelligent Design people , the new Creationists , I am truly appalled because Charles Darwin is to me one of my great heroes .
Here is a quiet reclusive country gentleman with a giant network of fellow amateur naturalists who had such respect for facts and for care in thinking that he could come up with a theory which shook the world .
And which rendered intelligible to us this whole experienced world around us in a new and absolutely thrilling way .
Now I do n't want to see him not taught in the schools because of some dimwit who wants to go on believing in a six day creation and one day off routine .
There is something to my mind obscene about that denial of human reason and its glory .
Phillip Adams
I thought of a new term about six months ago and I 'm rather proud of it .
Faitheist .
And I think in some ways I 'm a faitheist because I have faith in science .
The same way as my religious friends have faith in god , I have faith in Einstein .
I have faith in the great brains that have been trying to push back the darkness through rational thought .
Where do atheists find meaning ?
Narration
But is faith in science and rationality enough ?
Do atheists have a sense of wonder ?
And , where do they find meaning ?
Mike Shermer
People who do n't believe in god are no less spiritual than those who do .
I do n't think religion has a monopoly on spirituality .
For me my spirituality comes from an awareness of something grander than me , than you than us , something beyond the material world ; whatever you want to call that , the beauty of nature .
For me just like looking at a Hubble Space Telescope photograph of galaxies expanding you know that triggers that feeling of transcendence , like there is something so much grander than me .
I am so unimportant you know .
And that 's what religious people describe .
Inga Clendinnen
I find deep gratification in trying to understand the cultural world of people different from myself .
And that keeps me very happy and it gives me a sense of discovery , and even occasional bliss .
So I suspect I have some of the pleasures of religion from my secular base .
Some of the pleasures typically associated with religion .
Phillip Adams
I 'd borrow the word numinous from the vocabulary of the religious because I think it 's a great word .
The sense of the numinous is when you stand outside at night at the farm and you look up at a clear sky unpolluted by the metropolis , and you 're looking at billions and billions and billions of stars .
More suns out there than there are grains of sand in the Sahara .
And if you 're not overcome by a sense of the numinous - which is a mixture of awe and wonderment and dread - there 's something wrong with you .
It 's a great emotion .
It 's the emotion I think that drives religion and philosophy and science .
Narration
Does nature or even science hold all the answers ?
Can a greater understanding of our universe guarantee human progress ?
John Gray
Science cannot save humanity .
Science is itself a human construction , a human achievement .
It 's embodied in growing knowledge which gives humans greater power to do what they want to do , but science does not make humans wiser or more reasonable .
It leaves them as much ruled by folly as they ever were .
However , science is indispensable .
Science is the only way in which we can accommodate ourselves I think to climate change for example .
Why do we need science ?
Narration
It 's climate change that is bringing atheists and some believers closer , as Christian ideas about life on earth are changing .
Phillip Adams
The Bible got us off to a bad start with a line of argument that said , it 's all here for you to use folks , enjoy .
Very kind of god .
And until very recently that was pretty much the hard line of the hard religious right .
Mike Shermer
There is a small branch of Christians , sort of Millenarians and apocalyptic - oriented , who say , " It does n't really matter what we do with the earth ; it 's all coming , like next Saturday Jesus is coming , look busy ! "
Phillip Adams
For a long time the Bible bashers , the hard right , religious right , took that view and therefore climate change was a great big left wing conspiracy .
Suddenly that has changed and it's changed emphatically .
And although there 's not much of a hint in the good book that we have environmental responsibilities , people are finding it .
And many of the most ardent campaigners now to do something about climate change come from religious organisations .
Mike Shermer
I think it 's more important that I understand and embrace religion because we need to work together to solve say the global warming problem , rather than my first trying to convert them all into secularism and then we 'll solve the global warming problem .
That is n't going to happen .
Before global warming has its problems , OK , we need to address the problem now .
Does religion have a future ?
Narration
So rather than confronting believers , many atheists are now accepting the human need for religion .
Phillip Adams
I think basically it may be a virus .
I 've always hoped that the CSIRO would find a virus so people could be cured of religion .
But short of that , it 's a fact of life and I think we 've all got to try and get on a bit better with each other - atheists with God-botherers , God-botherers with us .
John Gray
It seems almost self - evident to me on the basis of anthropology , literature , observation , that the human animal comes into the world with a variety of needs to which religions answer .
John Gray
That being the case one would then think that if one does n't believe in any supernatural creator one should accept religion is part of human beings , part of human life .
It 's like it 's an impulse like or like the sexual need .
Repressing it or attempting to eradicate it , trying to think of a world in which there is no religion would then seem to me like thinking of a world in which there is no sex .
Phillip Adams
The great problem in discovering that you do n't believe in god is you feel an intense , an all - pervasive sense of loneliness .
And when I found that I did n't need to believe in him , I still felt a great sense of desolation and a high degree of fear .
I 've always understood the religious impulse , the great overwhelming fear of death , of annihilation which is a part of most of it , and a desperate need to find a meaning in a universe which really does n't have one .
If you want to know what happens after , think about what happened before ; infinite , infinite nothingness .
We 've all been dead .
We live briefly , we go back to the same state .
Why can't people see it 's as simple as that ?
Inga Clendinnen
I do n't think we can underestimate the need for explanations among humans .
And some humans will have a greater desire for their daily lives to be made intelligible than others .
Their search for meaning , to coin a phrase , is going to be more intense .
I suspect this has got something to do with individual psychologies and individual childhoods .
Mike Shermer
I think it is probably safe to say religion will not fall into disuse any time soon , so the John Lennonesque , Imagine no religion , I think is probably not realistic in terms of our social needs .
We may even have something in our brains that hardwires us to believe in supernatural entities , whether it is animistic spirits , ghosts , demons , multiple gods , single gods the monotheistic - whatever it is I think we our brains lead us to interpret certain events in the world to be caused by hidden spirits of some kind .
John Gray
The question is , can the point of living as a human being be simply to see .
That 's to say to look at the world to see it as it is or as close as we can get to seeing it as it is , the finding in it perhaps what is of beauty in it .
Can humans adopt seeing as the meaning of their lives ?
Phillip Adams
I still think we 're at the end of the religious era .
It may be , what we see now is the great storms before the lull .
I think in a hundred years almost all of the religious animosities we 're experiencing now will be ancient history .
I think they will ebb away from exhaustion .
And I still believe that as science advances , god recedes ; I still believe that little by little the world is becoming excited by a new form of the numinous as they realise that we are learning more and more and more and more than the people who wrote the Bible and other good books could possibly have imagined .
In the first major disclosure of corruption in the $ 750 - billion financial bailout program , federal investigators said Monday they have opened 20 criminal probes into possible securities fraud , tax violations , insider trading and other crimes .
The cases represent only the first wave of investigations , and the total fraud could ultimately reach into the tens of billions of dollars , according to Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general overseeing the bailout program .
The disclosures reinforce fears that the hastily designed and rapidly changing bailout program run by the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve is going to carry a heavy price of fraud against taxpayers -- even as questions grow about its ability to stabilize the nation ’s financial system .
Barofsky said the complex nature of the bailout program makes it “ inherently vulnerable to fraud , waste and abuse , including significant issues relating to conflicts of interest facing fund managers , collusion between participants , and vulnerabilities to money laundering . ”
Advertisement
The report said little about who is under investigation and how the fraudulent schemes work , but investigators are already on alert for a long list of potential scams .
Such schemes could include obtaining bailout money under false pretenses , bilking the government with phony mortgage modifications , and cheating on taxes with fraudulent filings .
“ You do n’t need an entirely corrupt institution to pull one of these schemes off , ” Barofsky said .
“ You only need a few corrupt managers whose compensation may be tied to the performance of these assets in order to effectively pull off a collusion or a kickback scheme . ”
The risk of fraud is only increasing as the bailout becomes “ more complex and larger in scope , ” he said .
Indeed , much of the 247 - page report released in Washington today by Barofsky ’s office focuses on a segment of the bailout that is only now being put into motion -- an effort to buy toxic securities from banks and other investment groups in which the federal government would provide up to 92.5 % of the money .
That effort could be the most vulnerable to fraud , Barofsky said , because investors would have so little at risk .
Advertisement
Among the toughest recommendations in the report is for the Treasury to abandon its planned structure for buying the toxic securities , which include intricate bundles of bad mortgages and loans , before it gets rolling .
Members of Congress and consumer advocates expressed outrage Monday when they heard about the findings of the report .
“ It should n’t be a big surprise that a huge pot of honey attracts a lot of flies , ” said Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , the senior Republican on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , which is also examining the program .
“ I would guess that 20 investigations , while a good start , is only the tip of the iceberg . ”
“ That ’s an appalling record , ” Barbara Roper , director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America , said of the 20 criminal investigations .
“ In the midst of this crisis from which they are being bailed out , the same people who created this mess are apparently still breaking the law .
What is it with these people ? ”
Advertisement
In a series of recommendations , Barofsky asked the Treasury Department for greater transparency and greater fraud protections .
The Treasury Department ’s bailout chief , Neel Kashkari , said in a letter dated April 14 that the recommendations would be “ considered . ”
The report underscores just how complicated the bailout program has become .
What started out in October as a $ 750 - billion effort only to buy toxic securities has morphed into 12 separate programs that cover up to $ 3 trillion in direct spending , loans and loan guarantees -- an amount roughly equal to the annual federal budget .
Advertisement
Today , banks , insurers , brokerages , auto companies , car parts makers and homeowners are just some of the beneficiaries of the program , known formally as the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
The report dedicated an entire section to what many experts believe is its most risky operation -- a toxic asset purchase plan under a broader program known as the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility , known as TALF .
Originally , TALF was aimed at expanding consumer lending programs for autos , student loans and other types of credit .
But the Obama administration expanded TALF to include funding and federal loan guarantees to purchase toxic securities .
That program has at least two parts : one to buy up bad loans from banks and another to buy up bundled loans in the form of mortgage - backed securities from investment markets .
The government would split any profits with the private investors it partnered with .
Advertisement
The latter has sparked greater concern because of the possibility that buyers could collude to manipulate prices and extract kickbacks , with the government taking virtually all of the risk .
“ When you are buying from the market or the street , transparency comes into question , ” Barofsky , a former federal prosecutor , said .
“ The potential for pricing fixing and collusion becomes greater because the government does n’t have control or knowledge of who ” all the players are .
Members of Congress , who were given Barofsky ’s report Monday , have already expressed concern over the plan .
House Financial Services Committee member Brad Sherman ( D - Sherman Oaks ) , a certified public accountant , said that under the plan , taxpayers would take virtually all the risk , get zero control and only 50 % of the profits .

“ That does n’t sound like a good deal , ” he said .
“ I ca n’t imagine Warren Buffett signing something like that . ”

Three men upset about a perceived slight to their dead hero have been found guilty of recklessly damaging property and endangering life .
Ali Beheshti , 41 , Abrar Mirza , 23 , and Abbas Taj , 31 , conspired to firebomb the house of publisher Martin Rynja .
Rynja ’s Gibson Square Books had been planning to publish The Jewel of Medina , which is a semi-fictional account of the inventor of Islam ’s relationship with his child bride , Aisha .
We all know how distressing it is when people do n’t treat your long - dead warrior - prophet with suitable deference , so it is understandable that the trio decided to punish the publisher by pouring diesel through his letter box and trying to set fire to it .
Fortunately – and perhaps unsurprisingly – the three were n’t in possession of the cleverest heads ever to butt a rug , and had been under police surveillance for days .
Taj , the driver , tried to plead not guilty , claiming that he had just given his mates a lift without any idea of what they were up to .
The jury were not convinced .
On the way to the publisher ’s home , Beheshti , a former member of the banned al - Muhajiroun , rallied the spirits of his fellows with the inspiring words ,
You know what we gotta do , anyway , innit ?
An old hand in the art of holy war , Beheshti had been involved in the Motoon protests in 2006 when he burned himself attempting to set fire to a picture of George Bush .
This may explain why they decided to use diesel in the Gibson Square operation – they might have hurt themselves if they had used petrol .
According to this BBC video report , The Jewel of Medina will be published in October .
Doh !
UPDATE : ( 18 May )
Unfortunately , the BBC report above is contradicted by the author herself , Sherry Jones , on her blog .
Beaufort publisher Eric Kampmann and associate publisher Margot Atwell headed to the London Book Fair in April with a full display of “ The Jewel of Medina ” and confidence that they would find the right distributor to supply stores in the U.K. with the book .
But — no .
Everyone , it seems , is too afraid .
( CNN ) -- Slain attorney Chiquita
Tate was such a believer in the legal system that she had a tattoo of Lady Justice on her back , college friend T. J. Crawford recalled .
Chiquita
Tate was in the midde of a high - profile murder trial when she was stabbed to death in her law office .
" She just had an attachment to justice and doing what 's right by people .
She was always very serious about that , " said Crawford , a teacher and community organizer in Chicago , Illinois .
But Tate , described by colleagues as a tenacious defense attorney who fought for her clients , could not save herself .
Family members and friends in Chicago ; Atlanta , Georgia , and Tate 's adopted home -- tiny Baker , Louisiana -- are reeling from the grisly details of Tate 's slaying , and police say it was at the hands of her husband , Greg Harris .
They had been married about 14 ½ months .
Harris , 37 , is in custody , accused of stabbing Tate to death .
He is charged with second - degree murder and the illegal use of a dangerous weapon .
A judge last week set his bond at $ 500,000 .
In a phone interview with CNN , Harris ' attorney , Lewis Unglesby , said police have the wrong man .
" Greg Harris by all accounts ... is innocent .
I do n't know anybody that thinks he did it , except the police , " Uglesby said .
" There 's nothing in his background .
He has cooperated completely with the police ; he 's signed everything they 've asked him to sign .
He 's let them search his house , his car . "
Tate , 34 , had started her own law firm in downtown Baton Rouge , Louisiana , and was doing well , family and acquaintances said .
" She was up and coming , " said Cpl. L'Jean McKneely , a police spokesman in Baton Rouge .
Tate was representing a defendant in a high - profile murder trial when , police say , she became a homicide victim herself .
Her body was found inside her law office on February 20 .
Tate was stabbed 38 times , according to a police warrant for Harris ' arrest obtained by CNN .
While questioning Harris about Tate 's death , police discovered an outstanding warrant for him in connection with a battery - domestic violence case .
It stemmed from a December 22 , 2007 , incident at the couple 's home .
Harris was accused of using " force and violence " against Tate , according to Baker City Court records .
The court said Harris entered a not guilty plea on March 6 , 2008 , but did not appear for a May 8 pretrial conference .
A warrant was issued for his arrest for contempt of court .
When Tate met Harris in late 2007 , she fell for him , head over heels , said East Baton Rouge Parish Juvenile Court Judge Pam Taylor Johnson , Tate 's mentor and former boss .
" She came in my office one day : ' I met the most wonderful guy !
I need you to perform our marriage -- tomorrow , ' " Johnson recalled Tate gleefully telling her .
" I told her she had to wait three days , " as required by Louisiana law , Johnson added .
Tate did wait a bit .
The couple 's marriage license is dated January 10 , 2008 , just two and a half weeks after the domestic violence report from Baker police .
They married on February 8 , their marriage license shows .
Only the couple 's immediate family members and two friends attended the ceremony at Green Chapel in Baton Rouge , said Tate 's friend Shawn Collins , who was one of those on hand for the wedding .
Neighbors in suburban Baker said the couple seemed to settle into a good life in their home on Charry Drive .
Baker , population 13,000 , was one of the cities that absorbed hundreds of families from the FEMA trailer homes after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
The last families housed in Baker moved out last spring .
Neighbors recalled seeing
Tate frequently driving down the street in her late - model Hummer and Harris steering a Mercedes .
Ethan Koobs , who lives across the street from the couple , said Tate was a " really nice lady , very upper - class , presented herself very well . "
Koobs said he did n't see any discontent in the couple 's lives .
" They seemed like a pleasant couple , just real nice , " said neighbor Don Patton , who lives two houses down .
" They kept their house and their lawn very nice . "
He recalled the couple 's concern for their neighbors after Hurricane Gustav , which raked south Louisiana on September 1 , 2008 , before petering out in southeast Texas .
It knocked out power to 1.5 million homes in southern Louisiana , and thousands of homes were damaged by the wind .
Harris , a carpenter , found his skills useful .
" [ Harris ] was just generally concerned about everybody 's well - being , " Patton said .
" We 'd huddle in the street and he'd ask if anybody needed anything . "
The couple helped their neighbors rebuild .
But the warrant for Harris ' arrest in the murder case revealed a fracture in the marriage .
Tate was " planning on divorcing the defendant due to marital problems " and had leased her own apartment , the warrant stated .
As far as their friends were concerned , there was no trouble in the marriage and Tate appeared to be a doting wife .
She also enjoyed battling it out on behalf of her clients in the courtroom .
Tate , who was raised with six siblings , was tenacious even as a youngster , recalled childhood friend Ursula Bryant - Hill .
" She was always strong - willed and she analyzed everything .
Everybody told her ' You'd be a good lawyer , ' " said Bryant - Hill , of Hueytown , Alabama .
" If you knew Chiquita when she was growing up in Baton Rouge , she was always cautious about who she let in her intimate setting .
' Watch your surroundings , ' that 's how she was , " Bryant - Hill added .
Upon graduation from college , Tate worked briefly as a legislative secretary , recording minutes at Atlanta City Council meetings .
But she longed to return home to Louisiana to attend law school at Southern University .
" When she told me she was in law school , I screamed , " Bryant - Hill said .
Her friend , Juvenile Court Judge Johnson , said Tate lived by one creed : Justice for all , especially for those more vulnerable in society .
" I could n't get her to accept the fact that ' things happen . '
I told her some things you can't change [ about the system ] , but it is our duty to see if we can equalize things , " Johnson said .
Tate is remembered as someone who fought tirelessly for what she believed in .
Now her loved ones hope the legal system will work for her .
The days have been long for Tate 's family .
Asked how she has been coping , Denita Tate , the victim 's sister , said , " I 'm not .
It 's harder every day . "
" We want closure with our family and with our sister , and we want justice , " Denita Tate said .
All About Murder and Homicide • Domestic Violence
The Supreme Court on Monday rejected appeals from two hold - out counties in Southern California that objected to the state ’s 13 - year - old medical marijuana law and claimed it should be struck down as violating the federal drug control act .
Without comment , the court turned down the pair of appeals .
The action probably will clear the way for patients in San Diego and San Bernardino counties to seek county - issued identification cards that show they are eligible to possess and use marijuana .
The identification cards have been required under state law since 2004 , but the two counties have refused to issue them .
Their lawyers said the state ’s authorization for using medical marijuana conflicted with the zero - tolerance policy set by federal law .

“ Our theory is that a state law which authorizes people to violate federal law is preempted ” and , therefore , unconstitutional , Thomas Bunton , a deputy county counsel in San Diego , said last week .
Federal officials have maintained that all marijuana use is illegal , even in states such as California .
But Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said recently that the federal government would not devote great effort to prosecuting low - level marijuana cases .
Lawyers for San Diego and San Bernardino counties had gone to court seeking a clear ruling on whether the state law violated the federal drug law .
San Diego NORML , or National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , had threatened to sue the county in 2005 for not complying with the state law by refusing to issue identification cards .
Last year , a state appeals court upheld the California medical marijuana law and said it was not rendered void by the federal drug law .
The California Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from the two counties .
Advertisement
The counties then appealed to the Supreme Court .
Graham Boyd , director of the ACLU ’s Drug Reform Law Project , said Monday ’s order “ marks a significant victory for medical marijuana patients and their advocates nationwide . ”
It dispels any remaining doubts that the state laws are valid , he said , and it “ leaves ample room for states to move forward . . . with independent medical marijuana policies . ”
Since California ’s voters adopted the Compassionate Use Act in 1996 , 12 other states have approved measures permitting medical use of marijuana : Alaska , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Michigan , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington .
The New Hampshire Legislature passed a similar measure recently that awaits action by the governor .
The federal government , however , has maintained that the sale or use of marijuana is illegal under the Controlled Substances Act .
The 1970 law designates marijuana as a Schedule I drug that has “ no currently accepted medical use ” in the U.S .

Federal authorities say they can arrest and prosecute all who use or sell marijuana in states that have authorized medical use of the drug .
Four years ago , the Supreme Court ruled that Congress and the federal government had the constitutional authority to regulate the sale and use of marijuana under its power over interstate commerce .
The 6 - 3 decision , in the case of Gonzales vs. Raich , rejected the claim that personal use of homegrown marijuana was off - limits to federal authority .
But the court did not rule on whether a state ’s law allowing medical use of marijuana was void because it conflicted with the federal law .
In their appeal , San Diego County ’s lawyers had questioned whether California ’s marijuana law was “ preempted under the Supremacy Clause ” of the Constitution by the federal drug control law .

Make US Treasuries tax deductable ?
A tax advantage might be a nice incentive to get the public involved and take up some of this record supply .
This question was posed to Bill Gross from PIMCO yesterday .
Was this an innovative thought ?
Was the interviewer being fed a question by a higher authority ?
What ever the reason itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a unique idea never the less that solve the demand concerns !
Here are 5 - quick reasons Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœnotÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ to own the USD this morning :
The BRIC countries will discuss the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœdollarÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s dominanceÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ PIMCO is vocal about US ratings again .
South Korea pension funds are looking to diversify away from it .
The strength of commodities .
ECB is openly concerned about the greenback .
The demand for yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 7 - year Treasury auction was less than impressive .
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
AprilÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US durable goods numbers surprised to the upside yesterday .
The +1.9 % print was the largest headline reading since Dec. 2007 .
However , it followed a revised - 2.1 % drop for Mar. , which was more than double the previous estimate ( - 0.8 % ) .
The gains can be attributed to a surge in both auto demand and defense spending which outpaced again any investment in business equipment ( analysts believe that this variable will be the last area of the US economy to gain traction as companies with record spare capacity will shy away from investing in new equipment until sales improve ) .
Ex-transportation , the print advanced to +0.8 % vs. - 0.4 % m/m .
Are the biggest rounds of firings over in the US ?
Last week we witnessed fewer Americans filing for unemployment claims .
It was down on the week by - 13 k to +623 k vs. the previous revised headline of +636 k .
Perhaps with the slowing of job - losses this may encourage the US consumer to loosen their grip on the purse strings ?
It is probably the most important variable in the equation to US recovery happening during the FedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s timeline .
The catch - 22 of course is that companies will be disinclined to hire workers and increase production until sales growth is sustainable .
Pessimists will tell you be weary of the range bound headlines , they expect claims to head even higher over the coming weeks once auto sector troubles fully work their way into the reporting data !
Other US data showed that the purchases of new homes rose for the 2nd time in 3 - months yesterday supported by both lower prices and cheaper financing .
Month - over - month , sales increased +0.3 % to +352 k vs. +351 k , but lower than initial analysts estimates of +363 k .
The median sales price has fallen - 15 % , y/y , and the number of units on the market fell to its lowest level in nearly a decade .
Not such good news was that the MBA ( Mortgage Bankers Association ) reported that delinquencies ( seasonally adjusted + 9.12 % ) and foreclosures ( + 1.37 % ) rose to new records in the 1stQ because of mounting job losses .
No pay , no mortgages !
The USD $ currently is lower against the EUR +0.40 % , GBP +0.66 % , CHF +0.34 % and JPY +0.47 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.76 % and AUD +0.61 % .
The loonie continued its strengthening bias in the O/N session as commodities , especially crude touching a 7 - month high , enticed investors to invest in higher - yielding assets .
With the USD struggling , parity talk is back on the table .
Some are buying into the theory that with Canada being a small , open economy and sensitive to trade flows , if and when the global economy is doing better then Canada is expected to reap the benefits very quickly .
There is no disputing this theory , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s expected over time that the loonie will trade at a premium to its southern neighbor , but , at such an early stage in the game , the move has been too aggressive and too quick .
The month of May has been good for the higher yielding commodity currencies ( AUD , NZD and CAD ) , while the USD is the worst performing currency .
There is nothing fundamentally supporting the currency , even the Canadian finance minister this week said that the proposed national deficit will balloon to $ 50 b from the $ 34b announced in Jan .
The longer term fundamentals certainly support a much stronger CAD , however investors have plenty of time to add to their positions at more favorable levels .
The AUD is heading for monthly record advance across the board ( + 9.4 % ) as investor confidence is boosting the purchases of higher - yielding assets .
Commodities account for 50 % of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s total exports and the weekly price rise is the biggest witnessed in 35 - years .
The countryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s fundamentals remain strong and with commodities nudging forward , one should expect buying on pull backs ( ( 0.7956 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 65.58 up +50 c ) .
For the 2nd time this year OPEC members left production quotas unchanged yesterday in Vienna and will rely on demand to increase by year - end .
They are responsible for 40 % of the worlds supply and agreed to keep production quotas at the 24.8 b level .
OPEC treads a fine line , the world has ample supply at the moment and the organization does not want to send out the wrong signal to struggling economies .
To date members have only completed 77 % of the previous cut implemented last Sept .
A struggling greenback has also lent support to commodity prices .
A day late reporting due to the Memorial holiday the weekly EIA inventories declined - 5.41 m barrels to +363.1 m last week .
It was an eye popping drop and the biggest in 9 - months ( hurricane season ) .
Analysts were expecting a weekly decline of only - 150 k barrels .
Technical analysts say that with oil rising above its 200 - day moving average for the 1st- time in 8 - months is a signal that prices will rally even further .
If OPEC ever fully completes the cut - backs then perhaps the black stuff will manage to achieve their desired target of $ 75 year end .
Some analysts believe that with record 19 - year high inventory levels combined with the contraction in activity in advanced economies , the market should expect some sort of pull back from these levels .
Of course the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdismal dollarÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ will not aid their theory .
A spluttering USD has given new life to the yellow metal .
One should expect speculators and investors to want to own the commodity as a hedge for the greenbacks slide ( $ 973 ) .
The Nikkei closed 9,522 up +71 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,996 up +63 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,442 up +55 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year Treasury eased 4 bp yesterday ( 3.66 % ) and another 7bp in the O/N session ( 3.59 % ) .
Be aware of strong month - end demand today , there is a hefty month end index extension expected , coupled with a new round of Fed buy - backs announced yesterday could give the FI curve more of a bid !

Advertisement The US - Iranian journalist jailed in Iran , Roxana Saberi , has been freed from prison after having her sentence for spying reduced .
Lawyers for Ms Saberi , 31 , whose imprisoning sparked a global outcry , said she left Tehran 's Evin jail hours after her eight - year term was cut .
She will be able to leave the country but has been banned from working as a journalist in Iran for five years .
The White House welcomed the release as a " humanitarian gesture " .
Ms Saberi was convicted of spying for the US in April but denied the charge .
The BBC's Tehran correspondent says the charge against her was reduced on appeal to one carrying a lesser sentence .
The case sparked international attention and protests calling for Roxana Saberi to be released .

US President Barack Obama , who has taken a more conciliatory approach to Iran than his predecessor , was among those who appealed on her behalf .
" He was relieved to see that Roxana Saberi has been released , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters .
" We know this has been a trying time for her family and friends and he looks forward to welcoming her home to the United States .
We want to continue to stress that she was wrongly accused but we welcome this humanitarian gesture . "
During her time in jail the Obama administration described the allegations against Ms Saberi as " baseless " .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was " heartened " by the decision but said the US continued to " take issue " with the charges .
' Very happy '
There was also concern from within Iran : her partner , film director Bahman Ghobadi - whose work has won prizes in Cannes and Berlin - said Ms Saberi was a victim of Iran 's " political games " .
Her lawyer , Abdolsama Khorramshahi , told reporters in Tehran that Ms Saberi 's father , Reza Saberi , confirmed the news of her release .
ROXANA SABERI'S DETENTION January 2009 : Arrested for buying a bottle of wine .
Later charged with working illegally as a journalist 8 April : Accused of spying 18 April : Sentenced to eight years in jail 20 April : Goes on hunger strike for two weeks 10 May : Appeal heard 11 May : Freed from jail
Profile : Roxana Saberi Saberi free but thaw no nearer
The AFP news agency quoted her as saying : " I'm OK .
I do n't want to make any comments but I am OK . "
Speaking after escorting his daughter to an undisclosed location in the city , Mr Saberi said she was doing well .
He implied that they would make a swift return to the US , where he moved from Iran during the 1970s .
The family lives in Fargo , North Dakota , where Ms Saberi was crowned Miss North Dakota in 1997 .
" We will go back as soon as possible , " he told Reuters news agency .
" We are very happy . "
Ms Saberi recently ended a two - week hunger strike and was said to have looked thin and tired during her court appearance on Sunday .
' Fair and open '
That appeal hearing lasted five hours - far longer than the original hour - long trial .
Before it began Ms Saberi was allowed a half - hour meeting with Mr Khorramshahi .
Details of the evidence against Ms Saberi have not been made public Some accounts of the hearing said Ms Saberi - looking a little bewildered - had visibly lost weight from the two - week hunger strike .
Details of the evidence against her have still not been made public , and it is not clear why the appeal hearing was brought forward .
Unlike her original trial , the legal process this time was arranged to appear fair and open , our correspondent in Tehran says .
As well as a reduced jail sentence , the charge against Ms Saberi was changed from one of passing secret information to a lesser count of having access to classified information , he adds .
Closed trial Ms Saberi was held in Tehran 's Evin prison following her arrest in January .
The journalist originally faced a less serious accusation of buying alcohol , and later of working as a reporter without a valid press card .
Several Iranian journalists remain jailed today .
We urge they be given the same opportunity for judicial review
Committee to Protect Journalists
The spying charge was introduced soon afterwards , and she was tried and sentenced behind closed doors by the Revolutionary Court in Tehran .
Ms Saberi , who holds dual US and Iranian citizenship , has spent six years in Iran studying and writing a book .
She has worked as a freelance journalist for news organisations including the BBC and the US - based National Public Radio .
The Committee to Protect Journalists , a New York - based rights group , said it was " thrilled " as Ms Saberi 's release , but urged consideration for Ms Saberi 's fellow journalists in Iran .
" Several Iranian journalists remain jailed today .
We urge they be given the same opportunity for judicial review that was afforded to Roxana Saberi , " said Joel Simon , the group 's executive director .

Right - wing faith - based politics in the US has its counterpart in faith - based economics .
The school of economics that dominates education , journalism , and politics — called “ neoclassical ” economics — has absolute faith in two secular gods .
These are private property and markets .
Neoclassical economists believe that these two institutions cause the maximum achievable economic prosperity and progress for all .
Alternative schools of economics ( Marxian , Keynesian , and so on ) are denounced by neoclassicals as heretical and absurd .
People persuaded by these alternative schools are ridiculed as wrong , insufficiently trained , or simply stupid .
If they persist in the error of their ways , they are said to be driven by sinister , perverse motivations and painted as anti-science , anti-reason , anti-American , anti-prosperity , and so on .
The fervor of the neoclassical faithful determines which epithets get hurled ( and the speaking opportunities denied , the teaching jobs withheld , etc. ) .
The first holy institution for neoclassical economics is private property as opposed to the state itself owning or administering socially - owned property or collective property .
The second is the market ( rather than political , cultural , traditional institutions ) as the means for distributing resources ( land , labor power , and capital ) to the producers and distributing products to consumers .
Private property owners “ freely ” buying and selling in markets is what delivers optimum economic performance and results for everyone .
The neoclassical faithful praise Adam Smith for the insight that private property plus markets function so perfectly that it seems as though God ’s “ invisible hand ” guarantees that everything works out for the very best for all His children .
Right wing evangelical religionists believe that the good life requires absolute subordination and obedience to their interpretation of God ’s word .
Evangelical economists believe that economic prosperity , efficiency , and progress require the same subordination and obedience to the dictates of private property and markets .
Selected Holy books serve evangelicals as final proofs of God ’s word .
Similarly , other selected books — the textbooks summarizing neoclassical economic research — serve neoclassical economists in the same way .
Right wing evangelicals worry about the Devil who always lurks : the threatening other to be banished , defeated , ostracized , silenced , or converted .
For them , the bad are those driven by the Devil to disobey , ignore , or deny God and thereby interfere in his plan for world happiness and salvation .
For evangelical economists , the bad are those who lack faith in private property and markets .
They disobey — usually by getting the state to disobey — the freedom of markets and the liberties of private property .
Thus they interfere in the optimum economic results that would otherwise flow from private property and free markets .
The threatening others for neoclassical economics are the “ heterodox economists ” ( the word currently in vogue ) who dissent from the neoclassical orthodoxy and thus must be banished , defeated , ostracized , silenced , or converted .
For rightist evangelicals , the sick and the miserable are those whose insufficient faith and resulting bad behavior drew God ’s punishment .
Yet , that punishment is also a merciful test of their faith to see if they can and will repent and thereby emerge from their tribulations .
The healthy and prosperous are those who have passed God ’s tests by means of faith and moral behavior .
It follows , for example , that for the state to help the sick and miserable is to interfere in God ’s will and God ’s ways , to deprive sinners of the freedom to respond to God ’s will and pass
His tests which is their only real hope for salvation .
Likewise , for the evangelical economists , if the state helps the unemployed , the poor , etc. , it interferes in the workings of private property and markets .
That precludes the poor and unemployed from learning and responding to market pressures and signals — passing the market test — that alone can enable them finally and permanently to overcome their economic tribulations .
( by working , changing jobs , adjusting “ lifestyles , ” learning skills , etc. ) .
In response to markets , the economically “ disadvantaged ” can pull themselves up by the boostraps .
Only then will they truly emerge from poverty ( acquire property ) .
By contrast , state support will only sap their initiative and deepen their culture of poverty and dependence .
The rightist religious evangelicals recognize that sometimes the Devil wins , but just for a while before God returns the faithful to supremacy .
Dark times occur when people lose their faith , turn to wicked ways , suffer , and thus are eventually brought back to see God ’s light .
The neoclassicals work a parallel story about how , in the Great Depression of the 1930s , people lost faith in private property and markets .
This opened the way for the economic devil — FDR ’s New Deal state — to interfere with private property and markets according to the statist economics of Mr. Keynes .
But the state was eventually recognized as the cause of economic suffering that could only be overcome by returning to full faith in ( subordination to ) private property and markets .
Thus , the right wing evangelical politician , Bush , made common cause with the evangelical economists for the Great Revival we have today .
The arrogance and intolerance of rightist evangelicals makes them disinterested in the details of the Devil ’s minions .
They lump together atheists , agnostics , and those faithful to other Gods than theirs as all simply evil .
The evangelical economists match them by driving from their temples ( the schools , the media , and politics ) every kind of economist other than the neoclassical .
They care little for the difference between Keynesians ( who want state interference to save capitalism from the failures of its markets and private property ) and Marxians ( who think civilization can and should do far better than capitalism ) .
For the neoclassicals , everyone else is dangerous and unacceptable .
And so they justify the fact that nearly all economic teaching , publishing , and politics in the US is exclusively neoclassical .
Once again , in the name of absolute truth , dissent and debate are banished as a moral imperative .
Until , of course , the next revolution and renaissance of genuinely free thought .

The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsubduedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Despite the positive spin in the advanced 1st Q GDP results for consumer consumption ( +2.2 % annualized gain ) earlier in the week , yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s data showed that US consumption fell off in Mar. even after the strong gains in the 1st 2 - months of this year ( - 0.2 % vs. - 0.1 % , m / m ) .
Analysts believe the report suggests that the consumer Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœmay have received a temporary boost from lower tax payments and government transfersÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that with personal income falling ( - 0.3 % vs. - 0.2 % ) for 6 out of the past 7 - months , consumption can be expected to remain weak in the foreseeable future .
With government transfers and lower tax payments supporting growth in Jan. ( + 1.1 % ) and Feb . ( +0.4 % ) , an even faster pace of deterioration in salaries in Mar. , along with weaker proprietors ’ income ( - 0.6 % m / m ) , rental income ( - 3.7 % ) and supplements to wages & salaries ( - 0.1 % ) , have all contributed to this weaker headline .
The personal savings rate advanced last month to +4.2 % , all on the back of job and economic uncertainty , by default this was bound to affect consumption .
With the Fed preferring to use the PCE deflator as their inflation measure of choice as opposed to us using CPI , last monthÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s deflator eased to +0.6 % , y/y , further evidence that this is the lowest growth rate in 50 - years .
With the y/y rate at +1.8 % the Fed should be concerned about disinflationary pressures !
Other data yesterday revealed that continuing claims remain a concern .
The headline surprised to the upside , rising to a new record of +6.27 m high !
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s now nearly oddÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s - on that we will breach that 10 % unemployment rate by mid-summer .
Imagine what the number would look like if we pooled all the millions that do not qualify for UI .
Not as negative , but alas not much better , initial jobless claims came in lower than expected ( +631 k vs. +645 k ) , well within the 600 - 650 k band width that points to another horrible NFP number for April .
We should expect the 6th consecutive decline of around - 500 k +!
The USD $ currently is weaker against the EUR +0.40 % , CHF +0.35 % and stronger against GBP - 0.06 % and the JPY - 0.67 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.26 % and AUD +0.44 % .
The loonie managed to print a new 3 - month high yesterday as global optimism that we may have seen the worst of this recession has helped to promote the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœcarryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and riskier trades .
If the equity market can keep the faith then by default commodity currencies will surely get another leg up in the short term .
With Chrysler filing for Chapter 11 protection , this will hardly aid the currency .
The loonie had remained vulnerable like many other currencies as investors gravitated towards some sort of risk aversion trading strategies as fears that the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœunstoppableÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ virus would curtail a recovery in the global economy .
But , this market has been able to price out this insurance premium by month end demands .
Technically there should be some good market support for the USD at the 1.1850 level .
Analysts expect the currency to once again trade under pressure and head towards the 1.2500 level by end of this quarter , but that all depends on stocks !
Higher yielding currencies are benefiting from that glimmer of hope that we have witnessed the bottom of this recession .
This renewed optimism is dragging the AUD to its 9th consecutive gain .
With S&PÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s rallying nearly 10 % this week has only looked favorably on other commodity currencies .
The trend remains your friend , look to buy AUD on pull backs ( 0.7319 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 50.51 down - 61 c ) .
Well the same reasons has the crude prices range bound for now , record inventories , swine ( H1N1 ) flu potentially curtailing travel demand and renewed optimism that the worst may be over .
One of these variables should eventually dominate and dictate the new range .
The neutral observer must be surprised in how resilient the market is given a 19 - year high inventory record .
Supplies rose +4.05 m barrels to +374.7 m barrels last week vs. an expected increase of +1.8 m barrels .
This headline print prompted LibyaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s top oil official to state that OPEC will Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœkeep all its options open , including a production cut before next months meeting Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Like all fellow members , they remain concerned with the overhang of prices with these elevated stock prints .
Since Sept. OPEC members agreed to slash + 4.2 m barrels from its daily production and to date 83 % of members have been compliant .
However , despite some strong fundamental data of late , anomalies like the Swine flu outbreak could curtail air travel in the short term and by default increase inventories once again .
Already this week the Algerian Oil Minister Khelil stated that non-OPEC members have left the market oversupplied by about +720 k barrels a day .
This bearish report along with demand destruction should provide some muted rallies for the black stuff .
Similar to Bonds , Gold printed another monthly decline as the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ appeal floundered with the surprisingly strong rally in equities of late ( $ 881 ) .
Mind you it was month end yesterday and traders were happy to book any profits !
The Nikkei closed 8,977 up +149 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,769 up +64 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,241 down - 2 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s backed up 1 bp yesterday ( 3.13 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
The FI asset class managed to solidify a monthly loss yesterday , the largest since Jan. , as renewed optimism that we may have seen the worst of the recession combined with record weekly government issues keep depressing treasury prices .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s all about ample supply vs. buy - backÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s that have dictated FI prices of late .
Next week the US government plans to sell a record $ 71 b in long - term debt .
With dealers wanting to cheapen the curve , 10 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s has a chance of trading towards 3.25 % !

A 31 - year - old Chinese man whose body is 96 per cent coated in hair has an extra chunk of DNA that could explain his condition – called congenital generalized hypertrichosis terminalis ( CGHT ) .
A new study of the patient known as “ KK ” – one of the world ’s hairiest men – and three families with a history of CGHT suggests that the disease is caused by vast genomic changes on chromosome 17 .
CGHT is exceedingly rare , with fewer than 100 cases documented in news reports and the scientific literature , says Xue Zhang , a geneticist at Peking Union Medical College in Beijing , who led the new study .
The disease is one of at least several forms of hypertrichosis – all characterised by overgrowth of hair .
One of the earliest recorded cases involved a Mexican Indian woman , Julia Pastrana , who toured Europe in the 1850s and 60s , before dying due to complications from childbirth .
Disturbed DNA
To find the genetic changes responsible for CGHT , Zhang ’s team first scanned the genomes of 16 people with the disease and their unaffected relatives , looking for obvious differences .
A region on chromosome 17 jumped out , and after further study , Zhang ’s team showed that family members with CGHT were missing between 500,000 and 900,000 DNA letters on that chromosome .
Patient KK , on the other hand , had 1.4 million extra nucleotides at the same place on the genome .
Exactly how these changes cause the disease is unclear , says Zhang .
One of the several genes in this region , MAP2K6 , could be involved in hair growth .
But mice missing lacking this gene have normal hair , and a 12 - year - old girl missing this gene shows no signs of CGHT .
More likely , the changes on chromosome 17 affect the expression of distant genes , Zhang ’s team suggests .
Far - reaching effects ?
Large deletions or insertions of DNA can interfere with the relationship between genes and the non-coding sequences that control their activity .
So the gene or genes truly responsible for CGHT could be millions of letters away from the changes that Zhang ’s team found .
“ It ’s not going to be trivial for them to sort this out , ” says Pragna Patel , a medical geneticist at the University of Southern California , who was not involved in the study .
Yet finding the true cause of CGHT will help scientists understand and potentially treat , not just a rare disease , but other conditions characterised by excessive hair growth or loss , Patel says .
“ I think beyond helping these individual patients , clearly there ’s a large segment of the population that would be interested in that . ”

The Thunar file managers is one of the best graphical file manager available for the Linux operating system .
Thunar is the file manage of choice for the Xfce 4 desktop as well as Enlightenment E17 .
Written in GTK +
2 , Thunar can be used in nearly any X Windows graphical environment with GTK + 2 support .
One of the most under - appreciated aspects of Thunar is the ability to create custom actions .
A custom action is a user - configure item that interacts with Thunar plugins so you can quickly take action on files within a directory .
Say , for instance , you want to quickly print a file .
Instead of having to open that file in the dedicated application , you simple right click a file and you will see a newly created Print File custom action that I am going to show you how to create .
Creating custom actions for Thunar will really make this file manager useful .
Depending on how resourceful you are , you could create some really handy actions .
Some of the more useful actions you can create are :
Print a file .
Finding files in current folder .
NOTE : For this action you will need the gnome - search - tool installed .
Manipulating archives .
Playing audio files .
Burning iso CDs from file .
Set as background .
And so much more .
So now let 's take a look at how to create customized actions .
The first thing you need to do is open up Thunar .
This will depend upon the window manager / desktop you are using .
If you can't figure out how to open up your file manager ( it should be obvious ) you can always open up a terminal window and issue the command thunar .
When Thunar opens ( see Figure 1 ) click on the Edit menu to reveal the Configure Custom Actions entry .
Click on that entry to open the Custom Actions window .
By default you will most likely only see one action included , Open Terminal Here .
As you can see , in Figure 2 , I have two other custom actions created : Print File and Set As Background .
First let 's create the Print File action .
Click on the " + " symbol to open the Add Action window ( see Figure 3 ) .
For the most part the configurations for the new action should be obvious .
In the case of the Print File action we will be using the " lp " command in order to make this happen .
For the custom actions you can use anything for the Name and description .
Remember , though , the Name will be what appears in the Right Click menu so you will want to keep that obvious and to the point .
Also notice the " %f " in the command line .
As you can see the New ( or edit ) action window includes a listing of what each of these switches does .
This switch is crucial to the action , because without it the customized action will have no idea what file it is working on .
If you click on the Icon button a window will open with quite a few icons to choose from .
If you do n't find what you are looking for in the window that opens , click the " Select Icon From " drop down and switch to a different listing .
You should be able to find a suitable icon for your action .
Before you click OK click on the Appearance Condition tab .
In this tab you have to select the file types which this action applies to .
Obviously you will want to select Text Files .
You could also select Image Files to print images as well .
After you fill out the necessary information , click OK and your action is complete .
Now , navigate to a file within
Thunar you want to print , right click the file , and behold the new menu entry " Print File " ( see Figure 4 ) .
Now let 's create an action that will make setting a background quick and painless .
This will work for Window managers like Window Maker , Fluxbox , etc .
This action requires the fbsetbg command .
You will create this action similarly to the Print File command .
In the " command " field you will enter :
fbsetbg %f
You will also want to select only Image Files from the Appearance Conditions tab .
Click OK when you have completed this action .
Now when you right click on any image within
Thunar you will see an entry similar to what you configured for the Name of the set background action .
In my case I named the action " Set As Background " .
So when I right click an image in Thunar I see " Set As Background " listed .
By clicking that the desktop wallpaper instantly changes to the image desired .
Final thoughts
The Thunar file manager is an outstanding entry in the file manager space .
It is fast , reliable , user - friendly , and ( with the help of custom actions ) customizable .
See what types of custom actions you can come up with .
If you have a really handy one , share it with your fellow ghacks readers .

After the concrete in the first half egg has dried , mix up the remaining concrete .
Fill the other half egg with the wet concrete .
Now comes the hard part - fitting the two pieces together .
Hold the " wet " half egg in one hand and slowly press the " dry " half egg down into it .
You 'll need to twist the eggs back and forth to push the wet concrete into the space inside the steel loop .
There 's probably going to be concrete oozing out .
Hopefully you did n't make the concrete too wet .
After a few minutes of shoving and twisting , the halves should be pretty close together .
Resist the urge to open the halves and scrape out the concrete as much as possible .
Opening them will likely cause a new mess .
I , of course , opened mine .
If you do the same , you 'll likely be holding two messy half eggs wondering if this is really worth the 60 seconds or so of humor it 's likely to produce .
Reassure yourself that it will and continue on .
As concrete oozes out you 'll be tempted to wash off the outsides of the egg .
Do n't run the egg under a stream of water .
It will only create more mess .
Instead , keep switching the egg back and forth , from hand to hand , and rinse off the hand not holding the egg .
You 'll effectively be wiping off the egg with your hands and washing them with water .
Once I had the halves very close together , I decided to tap the " wet " half on the ground to close it that final 1/8 " .
This resulted in cracking that half .
Undaunted , I set the egg down , got some tape , and taped up th entire egg .
Splitting the egg wo n't ruin things , but it does take away the option of leaving the plastic on the finished egg .
With a split egg , I 'll have to remove the plastic egg and paint the concrete .
Answers in Genesis is an apologetics ministry , dedicated to helping Christians defend their faith and proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ effectively .
We focus on providing answers to questions about the Bible — particularly the book of Genesis — regarding key issues such as creation , evolution , science , and the age of the earth .
In 1993 , Radiohead assured us that " Anyone Can Play Guitar , " but , as that band is composed of admitted creeps and / or weirdos , this supposition is suspect .
The guitar - based rhythm game explosion of the latter half of this decade , however , proves that if nothing else everyone at least wants to play guitar .
Yet while outlets from South Park to XKCD are quick to point out the not - too - subtle difference between playing an instrument and playing a game , Optek Music Systems looks to blur the line between string - picking and button - mashing with their FretLight Interactive Learning System .
Optek ’s innovative approach to musical education is two - pronged .
It ’s most recognizable component is its specially designed FretLight guitar .
Throughout the training process , unmistakable visual cues are provided through a series of – wait for it – " fret lights " mounted beneath the guitar ’s fingerboard .
These lights react to instructions from the second component of the system .
Its companion software package is a unique set of applications and training exercises designed to teach everything from guitar tuning to music theory .
When I opened the packaging to reveal my review unit , a handsome FG - 421 Standard in what Optek calls " Renegade Red , " I was relieved .
It at least looked like a regular guitar .
Moreover , it was solidly constructed , and even through my tiny practice amp provided a warm and substantial sound .
It ’s a relatively respectable Strat copy for the money ( around $ 500 American ) , with a two single - coil / one humbucker pickup configuration and some sharp chrome hardware , but it ’s the innovative fret lights – those tiny red markers that all but scream " put your fingers here " – that really make this axe stand out from you average student instrument .
Also included were the obligatory manual and case full of install discs , as well as another accoutrement that seemed a bit more exotic .
Rather than a typical instrument cable , the FretLight relies on a specialized 8 - pin DIN ( which I originally mistook for a 5 - pin MIDI ) to USB cable with an additional junction for an optional foot pedal .
This cable connects your FretLight guitar to your PC or Mac , thus allowing the software to turn on and off the individual fret lights as necessary .
A closer inspection of the guitar itself revealed that , situated behind the standard ¼ in .
jack , the FretLight boasts the necessary DIN output .
And this is n’t the instrument ’s only interesting divergence .
Upon further scrutiny , its fretboard was revealed to be made not of rosewood or ebony , but of a dense , sturdy polymer .
Between this rather exotic fingerboard and its more conventional maple neck lies the integrated circuit board that truly makes the FretLight a unique training ( and playing ) experience .
Obviously , the FretLight ’s strategically - placed LEDs are of no use without the system ’s specialized software .
Unfortunately , this was where the process first becomes tedious .
The FretLight training system consists of a number of separate discs – an intro DVD , an installation CD - ROM and an additional DVD featuring four free lessons for use with the system ’s Video Player – which could prove a little daunting for folks simply looking to plug and play with minimal fuss .
Thankfully , my intro disc was clearly marked , and proved an ideal place to start .
For the most part , the face ( and voice ) of the FretLight system is that of Nate Comp .
Nate is Optek ’s own Director of Music Education , and he comes through as mellow and confident as any guitar teacher worth his salt as he guides you through the finer points of setting up your new purchase .
His matter - of - fact explanation of the FretLight and its related software made a fairly deep undertaking seem infinitely more accessible .
Sadly , my primary knock against the product became apparent as Nate further elucidated .
This software takes a number of forms and , though Nate capably explains the general aspects of each , the sheer breadth of it still seemed a tad intimidating .
FretLight Video Player ?
Okay .
Lesson Player ?
Check .
FretLight M- Player ?
Guitarz ?
Improviser ?
Uh… AxMaster ?
It ’s obviously a well - intentioned and robust system , but , particularly in one ’s early days with the applications , it can sometimes seem a bit too much .
Mind you , it ’s not the utilities themselves that are particularly problematic .
In fact , each performs its prescribed tasks ably .
It ’s simply that there are so many different apps at work that , once again , it can make an otherwise intuitive system seem daunting .
The core of the Fretlight software package is its Lesson Player .
Not surprisingly , it relies upon downloadable sets of Lesson Packs to deliver proper instruction .
Thankfully , the entire first Lesson Pack ( representing a full 30 lessons ) is included .
In addition to teaching basics like chord structure and scales , these lessons include a robust glossary of musical terminology and an incredibly competent explanation of basic music theory .
Each lesson is broken down into individual objectives and exercises that are fully interactive and use the fret lights to translate the instruction provided into an impossible - to - misunderstand visual model .
Further , things are deconstructed to bite - sized chunks of information – understanding a time signature , practicing a picking exercise , etc. – which serves to make the lessons themselves easily accessible even to new players .
These central lessons are supplemented through the Fretlight Video Player , playing exercises in which the riffs presented on - screen are reflected through the movement of lights on the guitar ’s neck .
A sliding selector even allows you to change the tempo of individual runs so as to keep the level of on - screen action more in tune with your personal skill level .
( Sadly , this particularly innovative control is introduced by the chirpily annoying Brook as opposed to your regular rock ‘ n ’ roll motivational speaker , Nate . )
Four separate video lessons are also freely included , and if they are any indicator this portion of the system provides an even more robust introduction to practical theory , ample opportunities for play - along practice and an enlightening instruction on building arpeggios .
Unfortunately , the Video Player again shows the system ’s structural seams by suggesting that you drag your DVD - based video lessons to your desktop for easy access .
The FretLight system also includes a number of other tools with a less strictly instructional but far more broadly creative scope .
It ’s M - Player , for example , is a MIDI player for song tutorials that breaks a title down into individual guitar tracks , thus allowing players to learn the lead riffs or rhythm chords from pop classics while at the same time gaining a better understanding of song structure .
This is aided by the AxMaster module , a comprehensive reference tool that can highlight any chord , scale or arpeggio on the neck so as to help you learn root notes in all positions .
Likewise , the Guitarz software is a reference tool for chords and scales that allows users to build custom progressions via copious drop - down lists of roots and voicings .
These chord progressions are then displayed via the fret lights to help you take a piece from conception to performance .
It ’s also of note that Guitarz supports tablature files in the .tab format , thus allowing you to import and play tablature using the same visible interface .
Of course , as free guitar tab has , like the noble buffalo , been hunted to near extinction on the modern internet , this innovative feature lacks some of the luster that it might once have possessed .
Perhaps the most pleasantly surprising aspect of the FretLight ’s supplementary arsenal proved to be the Improviser .
This application encourages you to improve your playing by practicing in a truly unique manner .
First you choose a selection from an ample library of 60 or so accompanying tracks , and then , as the selected song plays , Improviser suggests a scale ( or a set of chord tones ) for accompaniment and lights up each note on the guitar .
This is an amazingly empowering experience that allows players to hone their developing chops by doing the unthinkable : playing real music .
The Improviser represents the FretLight system at its best .
While the overall product is a perfectly ample analog for a traditional guitar teacher in most aspects , what Optek has done is truly craft a system that tailors learning to the needs of the pupil and provides adequate hand - holding while still affording the opportunity to feel like a developing musician as opposed to a clumsy student .
That being said , the FretLight is , at its very core , an educational tool and , as is the case with most musical instruction , the fun can sometimes be eclipsed by the hard work inherent in the learning process .
And even putting aside the fact that learning an instrument itself is unavoidably difficult , the overall system is certainly not without its flaws .
To some extent , Optek has adopted a scattershot approach to teaching , and nowhere is this clearer than with regard to the FretLight ’s compulsory software .
Rather than a single , manageable , modular application , it spreads its unique functionality across a number of specialized programs .
Early on it can be a bit of a hassle to try and discern where to go and what to do to scratch each individual musical itch .
Still ,
Optek is a relatively young company , and as technology becomes even more advance and accessible , I foresee further refinement to their products that can truly make the FretLight system achieve its full promise .
In short , the FretLight is a good product and the system 's methods of instruction are sound even if not always perfectly implemented .
From tuning via reference tones to identifying string notes to powering through your first scale , the FretLight system is comprehensive and boasts tons of potential .
Though elements of the training software could certainly do with some refinement , it ’s hard not to recommend this product to new players looking to learn an instrument at their own pace or even to more knowledgeable guitarist who simply seek to gain a more complete understanding of their instrument .
As a player who falls more into the former category than the latter , I can honestly say that my short time spent with the FretLight was both enlightening and productive .
While it certainly did n't turn me into Brian May - a feet that would require not only more than a couple months with a digital guitar tutor , but degrees in Math and Physics to boot - it did afford me far more practical exposure to the mechanics of guitar playing than similar stints with more traditional fare like the obligatory Mel Bay book .
While it may lack the idle appeal of something like Guitar Hero , Optek ’s FretLight is a quality product that is as accessible or as challenging as an individual user needs .
It ’s certainly no game , but it does manage to inject some fun , flexability and much needed freedom into the realm of musical instruction .
WIRED : quality instrument , genuinely innovative functionality , accessible at all skill levels , continually upgradable via additional Lesson Packs
TIRED : cumbersome install process , overly specific software
The Bumpbrella is convenient in the sense that it can be inflated easily with the help of a hand pump and deflated at the pull of a handle , so it does n't take up too much precious space .
Even if you can't help bumping into people , you can spare them the poke in the eye .
This continues to be true even in the dark , thanks to the three bright LEDs which allows you to see and be seen clearly .

GAZA CITY
Over 150,000 Palestinians in Gaza ( around 10 percent of the population ) are struggling without tap water as a result of the damage caused to wells , pipes and waste water facilities during the recent 23 - day Israeli offensive which ended on 18 January .
" Our requests via the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) to the Israeli military during the conflict to allow shipments of construction materials and spare parts to repair wells and facilities damaged during the war were denied , " Coastal Municipalities Water Utility ( CMWU ) director - general Monther Shoblak told IRIN .
Shoblak estimates that 50,000 people lack tap water after losing their homes , while a further 100,000 have dry taps because of damage to the water supply network .
Eleven of Gaza ’s 150 wells , the only source of drinking water for Gaza ’s 1.4 million people ( apart from expensive bottled water and water trucked in by aid agencies ) , are not functioning .
Six were completely destroyed , according to CMWU .
Many residents in the north and in Rafah have water from their taps only every 4 - 7 days .
CMWU is working to rectify the situation , Shoblak said , but is hampered by lack of supplies .
“ Since the end of the war the CMWU has received three out of 80 trucks waiting to enter Gaza containing pipes and spare parts , ” he said , adding that Israel is obliging the utility company to provide proof - in the form of photographs of repair work - that the items received are being used for their designated purpose .
“ The three trucks received by the CMWU contained only half a kilometre of piping , ” he said .
Taxi driver Mohamed Abu Ragheleh , 23 , has tap water in his home in Jabalia only three or four days a week .
“ We have electricity only eight hours per day so it is difficult to pump the water from the roof - top tanks to our homes …
We have trouble bathing , washing our clothes , and cooking . ”
“ There was severe damage to waste water treatment plants in Beit Hanoun and in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City , affecting water quality , ” said Shoblak .
“ After the plant in Gaza City was bombed it discharged raw sewage for 20 days , contaminating groundwater . ”
Shoblak has asked UN agencies to survey homes and hospitals to identify which areas have contaminated water .
Aid efforts
International aid institutions like Oxfam , Action contre la Faim ( ACF ) and CARE continue to deliver containers of drinking water to residents in affected areas , according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) .
The UN Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) has donated US $ 50,000 to CMWU to begin quick repairs to the water network ; ACF has paid $ 50,000 to local contractors to repair pipes and other infrastructure ; and German government - owned development bank KFW had committed $ 60,000 for immediate repairs , said CMWU .
CMWU ’s mid-term recovery plan is to re-establish the destroyed water network .
CMWU has a commitment of $ 2.5 million from what is collectively known as the water and sanitation cluster , including UN agencies like UNICEF and the UN Development Programme ( UNDP ) , and international aid institutions like Oxfam , ICRC , Islamic Relief , and the Qatari Red Crescent .
CMWU ’s long - term recovery plan - requiring $ 3.5 million and falling under the larger UN Gaza flash appeal for US $ 613 million - covers repairs in areas that have been evacuated and will be coordinated with the re-building of homes .
However , major repairs cannot take place without the opening of border crossings to allow in spare parts and building materials .
The Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories ( COGAT ) has confirmed it does not intend to revise its policy of prohibiting reconstruction materials from entering Gaza , according to OCHA .

CNN reports that police are accused of having robbed at least 150 drivers in Tenaha , Texas .
The amount stolen is close to $ 3 million , says a lawyer who has filed a class action suit against the town and police department there .
Some of the victims ( who are mostly African American ) said that when they complained to the police about the police , the police threatened to take the victims ' children away .
In one case , the district attorney sent a couple who'd been robbed a form letter to sign that said , in exchange for forfeiting the $ 6000 that had been stolen from them , " … no criminal charges shall be filed … and our children shall not be turned over to [ child protective services ] . "
The video is loaded with lots of other tragicomically sordid details .
Police In Texas Accused of Committing Highway Robberies
I recently received an e-mail from Ron Katznelson , who is the Founder and President of Bi-Level Technologies in Encinitas , CA .
Dr. Katznelson is a named inventor in more than 25 U.S. patents and his research and development interests include optimal signal design , digital RF signal processing , digital television , signal representation & sampling theory , intellectual property management and patent law .
Over the past several years Dr. Katznelson has been heavily engaged in the patent reform debate , both with respect to reforms the Patent Office has attempted to implement and with respect to reforms that Congress has been considering .
Dr. Katznelson is now attempting to gain support within the inventor and start - up community to request Congress to reconsider the First - to - File provisions that are currently within the current patent reform legislation , which is now pending and widely believed to be a done deal .
Dr. Katznelson believes , as many do , that the first - to - file provisions are not helpful to the independent inventor and start - up communities , and instead favor larger corporations .
I have been on record for years saying that Congress would never pass a first - to - file law because it would substantially impair the ability of individuals , start - ups and research and development based companies to compete against extremely well - funded and established corporations .
If the US patent system becomes a race to the Patent Office this will favor those who are capitalized and be an impediment to those small businesses and start - ups that are the life - blood of the US economy .
Dr. Katznelson is attempting to gain signatures on a letter that he will present to Congress in the coming days .
The companies who have thus far signed the letter are largely unknown because they are in their early stages of development
Any company who wishes to join the list by the close of business on Thursday , April 9 , 2009 , are welcome to do so by contacting him directly at rkatznelson@roadrunner.com .
Send the full legal name of the company and city .
For those who are not familiar with Dr. Katznelson , I can tell you that he is widely respected and can be taken seriously , so if you are inclined to agree with his position I would not hesitate to contact him and join in his efforts .
I would encourage everyone to read the full letter , but what appears below is the Detailed Concerns section of the letter explaining why it is believed that the First - to - File provisions are problematic ( footnotes have been omitted ) .

This month , Finland 's Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor was supposed to begin generating power , a tangible sign of the revival of the nuclear industry outside of Asia after nearly 30 years of no new construction because of accidents , cost - overruns and other issues .
Instead , the reactor wo n't be completed for more than three more years , its price is nearly 60 percent more than anticipated , and it is mired in costly legal squabbles between the builder , Areva , and the Finnish utility , Pohjolan Voima .
In the U.S. , since 2003 , 17 applications for 26 new reactors have been filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission , but not one is yet under construction .
Despite dozens of new nuclear plants ordered or built in Asia in recent years , " increased deployment of nuclear power has been slow both in the United States and globally , " wrote the authors of a new Massachusetts Institute of Technology review of the state of nuclear power .
Those figures , say the authors of the report , an update on a similar report in 2003 , mean that " even if all the announced plans for new nuclear power plant construction are realized , the total will be well behind that needed for reaching a thousand gigawatts of new capacity worldwide by 2050 . "
One thousand gigawatts is the number the M.I.T. professors estimated would be needed to ensure that nuclear power provided 20 percent of global electricity needs as well as cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants .
In the U.S. , the number would be jumping from 100 to 300 gigawatts of nuclear - sourced electricity by 2050 .
After all , once operating , nuclear power plants burn nothing and therefore emit no carbon dioxide as fossil fuel–burning power plants do .
( There are , of course , significant greenhouse gas emissions associated with building and fueling nuclear facilities ) .
But the price of new nuclear power has " escalated dramatically , " according to the report , jumping by 15 percent a year to reach as much as $ 4,000 per kilowatt compared with $ 2,300 for coal - fired generation and just $ 850 for natural gas .
And the industry is asking for at least $ 100 billion in federal tax subsidies and loan guarantees for the 26 reactors currently planned .
The situation is no better in Europe , according to Steven Thomas , a professor of energy studies at the University of Greenwich in London : Finland cannot complete its new reactor ; the U.K. has yet to get started on any projects ; and a new nuclear reactor in France , after 18 months of construction , is 20 percent overbudget and requires complete subsidy by the French government .
" The nuclear power industry in Europe is in the midst of the same kind of regulatory and financial uncertainty that makes the future of the industry murky at best in this country , " Thomas said during a conference call with reporters .
" We 've been waiting for the renaissance for 10 years . "
Nor has there been a solution to the issue of nuclear waste .
In the U.S. , the plan to use Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert as a repository for spent nuclear fuel rods is in limbo , opposed by the Obama administration .
Reprocessing nuclear fuel , currently underway only in France , has proved prohibitively expensive , and it raises concerns about the proliferation of plutonium for nuclear weapons .
" We do not believe a convincing case can be made on the basis of waste management considerations that the benefits of partitioning and transmutation [ conversion of fuel into less radioactive form ] will outweigh the attendant safety , environmental [ and ] security considerations , and economic costs , " wrote the researchers , who included President Obama 's now science advisor John Holdren , in 2003 .
The update ?
" There is no basis to change that conclusion today , " the professors , not including Holdren , wrote in the new report .
Ultimately , the M.I.T. authors warned , " if more is not done , nuclear power will diminish as a practical and timely option for deployment at a scale that would constitute a material contribution to climate change risk mitigation . "
Adds Thomas : " It seems to me highly unlikely that [ investing in nuclear power ] is the most cost - effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Put that money in other sources , such as energy efficiency and renewables , and get a much better return on your money . "

Satisfy your hunger for a cool illustration with this sweet popsicle tutorial .
This summer - themed tutorial will hit the spot for intermediate Adobe Illustrator users .
Let 's get started !
Final Image Preview
Below is the final image we will be working towards .
Want access to the full Vector Source files and downloadable copies of every tutorial , including this one ?
Join Vector Plus for just 9 $ a month .
Step 1
Use the Rounded Rectangle Tool to draw the shape shown below .
Change the radius of the corners by holding the up or down arrow while you draw the shape .
Step 2
Overlap the rounded rectangle shape with another rectangle .
In the Pathfinder select Subtract from Shape Area followed by clicking Expand .
Step 3
This is the shape you 'll be left with .
Use the Direct Selection Tool ( A ) to adjust the bottom two points if you need to make your shape taller .
Step 4
Draw another rounded rectangle for the base of the popsicle .
Make sure the corners are rounded enough , as shown below , which gives the popsicle a fuller look .
Step 5
Layer the two shapes on top of each other .
Ensure that the base is the same width as the top part of the popsicle .
To make the stick simply copy and paste the top part of the popsicle and rotate or reflect the orientation so it 's upside down .
Step 6
Give the stick a subtle gradient .
Select all of the objects and click Horizontal Align Center in the Align Palette .
Step 7
Duplicate the stick and give it a subtly darker gradient .
Step 8
It 's easy to give the popsicle realistic shadows and highlights using a few simple shapes .
Using the Pen Tool ( P ) draw the tall white shape as shown below .
Ensure that your shape overlaps into the base of the popsicle , this way your shadow or highlight will definitely cover the whole top area of the popsicle .
Step 9
In the Transparency Palette select Multiply and change the Opacity to about 60 % .
Step 10
Go to Effect > Blur > Gaussian Blur ...
Enter a number that looks good to you and click OK .
Step 11
Repeat the last 3 steps to make other shadows and highlights .
When making highlights , leave the blend on Normal and the Opacity at 100 % in the Transparency Palette .
Step 12
To make a highlight for the bottom edge we 'll first duplicate the shape and make another copy slightly higher than the other .
In the Pathfinder Palette select Subtract from Shape Area followed by clicking Expand .
Step 13
Here 's the shape you 'll be left with .
Step 14
Give this shape a blur and place it at the bottom edge of the popsicle .
Step 15
Give the base a gradient so it looks as though the bottom is in shadow .
Step 16
Small details go a long way .
Add a subtle inner glow to the bottom of the popsicle by going to Effect > Stylize > Inner Glow ...
Next to Mode select Multiply , change the Opacity to about 25 and select a Blur that looks good to you .
You can also select a color more similar to your popsicle color ( but a little darker ) to help the shadow blend even more , then click OK .
Step 17
Select the stick and base and bring them to the front of all the other elements by going to Object > Arrange > Bring to Front .
Step 18
Here 's what your illustration should look like right now .
Step 19
We 'll add a whimsical bite detail by first drawing a few circles using the Ellipse Tool ( L ) .
Step 20
Use the Pathfinder to merge the shapes by selecting Add to Shape Area followed by clicking Expand .
Step 21
Place the oval shape over the top edge of the popsicle .
Select the oval shape and only the top part of the popsicle , then select Subtract from Shape Area , followed by clicking Expand in the Pathfinder Palette .
Step 22
This is what you 'll be left with .
Note :
Make sure you only select the two shapes in the prior step or your result will not look like this .
Step 23
Using the Ellipse Tool to draw an ellipse and give it a simple gradient that is darker at the center .
Step 24
Place the ellipse behind the popsicle and rotate it slightly to fit the curvature of the popsicle 's edge .
Step 25
Next we 'll make a drop shadow for the main part of the popsicle .
Copy and paste the shapes shown below .
Select the shapes and in the Pathfinder Palette select Add to Shape Area followed by clicking Expand .
Step 26
This is what you 'll be left with .
This shape will fit perfectly behind the popsicle .
Step 27
Give the shape a drop shadow by going to Effect > Stylize > Drop Shadow ...
Leave your X and Y Offset at 0 and change the Blur to whatever you like .
Click OK .
Step 28
Move the shadow behind the popsicle .
Step 29
Next we 'll make a reflection .
Draw an arbitrary shape over part of the popsicle .
Step 30
Copy and paste the shapes shown below before you proceed , this way you 'll be certain that you wo n't mess up or loose any of the work you 've already done .
Select the two shapes below and click Intersect Shape Areas followed by clicking Expand .
Step 31
Now you have a perfectly trimmed highlight that you can place over the popsicle .
In order for the next steps to work you must use black and white ( and not color ) as indicated .
Give the highlight a white fill .
With the highlight selected in your document , go to the Transparency Palette and double - click the area highlighted in yellow .
Step 32
After your double click the area in the Transparency Palette your shape will disappear .
Make sure the black square on the right in the Palette is selected ...
Step 33
Use the Rectangle Tool ( M ) to draw a rectangle over the popsicle .
Now , your highlight will reveal itself again .
Step 34
In the Gradient Palette add a black and a white point then fill the rectangle shape you just drew with the black and white gradient .
It 's important that your colors in the gradient Palette are made up of extreme R , G and B values .
This will ensure your highlight can go as dark or light as you need it to .
Step 35
It 's easy to add some drips and splatters to the illustration using Illustrator 's built - in ink options .
Go to Window > Brush Libraries > Artistic > Artistic_Ink .
Click and drag any of the ink options onto your document .
Step 36
In order to change the fill color of the ink splatters you 'll need to ungroup the splatter .
Go to Object > Ungroup .
Continue to ungroup the object until it can no longer be ungrouped .
This will usually take about 4 times .
Select the ink splatter and give it a radial gradient .
Now the ink splatter looks like popsicle splatter .
Step 37
Now we 'll make the drops of water .
First draw a shape using the Pen Tool , as shown below .
Blur the shape by going to Effect > Blur > Gaussian Blur ...
Step 38
After you blur the shape , just draw a top and side highlight and give them a tenuous blue to white fill .
That 's it !
Step 39
To make sprinkles use the rounded corner rectangle tool .
Leverage Illustrator 's built - in swatches to quickly apply different colors to the sprinkles .
To access the built - in swatches go to Window > Swatch Libraries > Gradients >
Brights .
Step 40
To create the background draw a rectangle and fill it with a bright gradient .
Step 41
Select the rectangle and go to Object > Envelope Distort >
Make with Warp. Select Inflate and change the Bend slider to about 20 % .
Click OK .
Step 42
Give the stick a shadow by duplicating the stick shape and giving it a blur .
In the Transparency Palette Select Multiply so the shadow will blend well with the background .
Step 43
Duplicate the basic shape that comprises the popsicle and use the same technique as the previous step with the exception of applying a blur .
Blur is generally associated with shadows while a solid shape is usually indicative of a reflection .
What we 're aiming for on this step is to create a reflection .

Presto , observe the final popsicle illustration !

Erbin Crowell , Cooperative Business Journal
- Italy is an amazing destination for those interested in history , architecture and food .
But it is also holds important lessons for those interested in cooperatives .
Italy has more co-ops per capita than any other country in the world .
In Emilia Romagna , a region in the country 's northeast with a population of 4.2 million people , you 'll find an astonishing concentration of these enterprises : 7,500 co-ops in total , two - thirds of which are worker - owned .
Cooperatives employ ten percent of the workforce , and the region has some of the lowest unemployment rates and highest standards of living in Europe .
Co-ops are such a common feature of daily life in Emilia Romagna that they are hard to miss .
While there , we often ate lunch at CAMST , a worker co-op that provides catering and food services across the region , and which generates about $ 374 million in annual sales .
A banner at a construction site we passed declared that the project was managed by CESI , another worker co-op .
We visited Emilbanca , a rural credit cooperative with a proud agrarian history , which has evolved into a very modern financial institution with a deep sense of social responsibility .
And the shelves in an outlet of COOP , a consumer co-op federation and Italy 's largest retailer , were lined with products from producer - owned cooperatives .
We visited farmer co-ops , fishing co-ops and housing co-ops .
We even stumbled upon a fair - trade shop and cafe , only to learn that it , too , was a co-op .
The prevalence of cooperation in northern Italy is truly amazing , but it is no accident .
In Italy , they cooperate like they mean it .
The Italian cooperative movement has an impressive history that reaches back to the 1800s . . . [ It ] is , in fact , a movement .
Even the Italian constitution recognizes " the social function of cooperation as a form of mutual aid devoid of all private speculative intent . "
Co-ops also seem to recognize that trade among co-ops of all sectors is not only a philosophical ideal , but is also a lever for economic development , strengthening the movement as a whole .
In this sense , they recognize the true importance of cooperation among cooperatives .
Co-op sectors are better integrated than they are in the U.S. , collaborating through informal networks as well as more formal models such as federations , consortia and funding organizations .
This , in turn , enables the movement to engage the government with greater strength , demonstrating that cooperatives are unique community assets , spanning generations , with strong values and local roots .
. . Prior to my visit , I had heard that Italian law requires all co-ops to contribute 3 percent of their annual surpluses to funds that provide lending , investment and technical assistance support .
But it surprised me that the co-ops themselves had proposed this law .
The development of the " social cooperative " is a particularly impressive example of what I call " co-opreneurship . "
Beginning in the 1980s , in response to the decline in government - sponsored health care , educational services and employment services , people began to form co-ops to offer such services themselves .
In 1991 , the national government passed a law that formalized the model , which contributed to a dramatic expansion of these co-ops into areas such as job training , and care for the elderly and disabled .
By 2001 , Italy had about 6,000 social co-ops , which employed 160,000 people , 15,000 of whom were disadvantaged workers .
The War On Capitalism Continues
The bear rally continues … it is about to enter its 9th week .
And the War on Capitalism continues !
The Dow rose again yesterday – up 101 points .
Oil went up too – to $ 56 .
The dollar held steady .
And gold was up again … to $ 911 .
“ Emerging market surge … Investors pile in on hopes of improved global economy , ” says the Financial Times .
And this from the Telegraph : “ Recession ‘ over by Christmas , ’ says Fed chief Bernanke . ”
He did not say “ Mission Accomplished . ”
That phrase was used too recently by another high official .
In that event , the mission turned out to be not as accomplished as he thought .
Will the government ’s War on Capitalism turn out better than their War on Terrorism ?
Or their War on Drugs ?
Or their War on Poverty ?
“ The last successful government program was WWII , ” said Jimmy Breslin .
Since then , almost all of them have been useless or counterproductive .
But year in and year out , they ’ve given federal hacks more money and power .
The current War on Capitalism did n’t begin a year ago , by the way .
The feds have been conducting a dirty , undercover campaign against the free market for many years .
Instead of permitting willing lenders and borrowers to set the price of credit , for example , the Federal Reserve imposed its own short - term rates many times over the last 50 years .
Eleven times during that period , capitalism tried to correct the “ borrow and spend ” economy .
Each time , the feds rushed in with more credit on even easier terms .
By the recession of 2001 - 2002 , the feds were intervening with such heavy hands that it set off the bubble in housing prices in the 2002 - 2007 period .
And when the bubble exploded , the fed ’s dirty campaign turned into a major war with huge pitched battles …and millions of casualties .
Bloomberg reported yesterday , “ nearly a quarter of US homeowners are underwater . ”
When the Fed flooded the market with so much easy credit , it pushed up housing prices way beyond what people could afford .
Capitalism struck back – blowing up the dikes that held all that liquidity in place .
But the explosion blew out the cushion of equity that kept homeowners afloat .
House prices are still falling at a 14 % annual rate .
“ Less than before , ” say the bulls .
But still going down .
This has left some communities – such as Salinas , California – with as much as one - third of the housing stock worth less than the money owed against it .
And in Victorville , California , the bank decided it had too many foreclosed houses .
An entire new development of 16 houses – some completed , with granite countertops and all … some incomplete – had been foreclosed .
Squatters and vandals were making a mess of the place .
So the bank demolished the lot of them .
And overstretched homeowners who have an “ Alt - A ” or “ Option ARM ” mortgage are in trouble come 2011 … when the majority of these loans will reset at a higher rate .
You think it was bad when the first wave of defaults hit the United States ?
This could have even more catastrophic consequences .
Today , the results of the stress test on banks are out .
They show some banks in good shape .
Others need more capital .
Bank of America , for example , is said to need another $ 34 billion .
Wells Fargo needs $ 15 billion .
GMAC and Citi both need more cash .
But investors decided to look at the part of the glass that was full rather than the part that was empty .
They pushed up financial sector stocks generally .
If capitalism had its way , it would sort out the banks quickly .
Banks that could n’t raise the money they needed would go out of business .
Their assets would be bought up by the solid banks .
Life would go on .
But the feds ’ war against capitalism prevents this kind of simple resolution .
Instead , weak , mismanaged institutions are kept alive with taxpayers ’ money .
“ Trillions of dollars have been thrown at the system so that we can avoid the natural process of creative destruction , ” write Matthew Richardson and Nouriel Roubini in today ’s Financial Times .
Our next question : where is all this money going to come from ?
“ This morning , all we can do is cringe .
Miller is setting himself up as the historical proxy for the mainstream disaster of the day .
“ The current ‘ bull market ’ , reasons Mr. Miller grasping at straws , is behaving ‘ much more like the rally that ended the 1973 - 1974 bear market or the one that began off the bottom in 1982 , or even that which erupted in March 2003 from the last debt deflation scare . ’
“ Banks , he believes , ‘ have the biggest potential to outperform . ’
Wells Fargo , Capital One and American Express are his favorite speculations .
This guy will chase anything .
In response , we ’d like to announce our latest addition to the short watch - list : Wells Fargo , Capital One and American Express . ”
Back to Bill , with more thoughts :
On page one of the Telegraph is another headline , which is almost sure to be correct .
“ Your country needs YOU to work five years longer . ”
And accept big cuts in health and education spending .
And pay more taxes .
There is no mystery to this news item .
You do n’t have to be a clairvoyant like Ben Bernanke to see that 1 ) living standards are certain to go down in England and America … and 2 ) governments will have to raise taxes and / or cut ‘ services . ’
We have put the word ‘ services ’ in quotes because we do n’t you to get the wrong idea .
Most government services are not services at all … but disservices .
Each year since the war , government budgets have gone up .
Now , there are more people getting money from the government than there are taxpayers .
And what do the taxpayers get for their money ?
Is the country really a better place than it was in the Eisenhower era ?
Are we better governed ?
Are we safer ?
We are certainly better off in many ways … but all the ways we are better off are the result of technology and private innovation , usually in spite of government .
A couple of inventions have made life much more agreeable .
Air conditioning is a major boon to gracious living in the southern states .
And the Internet – with free telephone service , via Skype – is another major boon .
And while we ’re on the topic of technological innovations , we ’d like to alert our dear readers that the DR has entered the social media realm , by way of Twitter .
Historians , economists , and contrarian investors alike use Twitter to communicate current information throughout the day that you may not find in our daily columns .
You can sign up for a free account and follow us here .
Of course , there are many innovations that are probably net negative too .
Television , for example .
It ’s brought entertainment and companionship to millions over the years .
But it ’s also expanded popular , brain dead culture and disseminated propaganda .
People seem stupider today than they did when we were young … TV is probably largely to blame .
But returning to the feds …
This year , the U.S. stopped being the United States of America .
Yesterday , it was reported that the states now get most of their money from the feds .
“ He who pays the piper calls the tune , ” is the old expression .
The feds are paying the piper ; the states have to dance to whatever tune they propose .
That ’s the end of the federal system … the end of the system announced in the U.S. Constitution … which was a union of sovereign states .
Now , it ’s a fully centralized system …a popular democracy of the worse sort … in which celebrity hacks are elected and rule without any real shame or limit .
Even Louis 14th , France ’s Sun King …an absolute monarch … knew he was subject as well as monarch .
He was God ’s man on the throne of France .
Now , America ’s leaders answer to no one …except the mob of TV - addled voters .
The song the feds are singing is a song of higher taxes … more regulation … bigger government budgets … and huge new deficits .
The War on Capitalism will cost trillions .
The direct costs – and the indirect cost of a battered , shackled , tortured market system – will have to be paid somehow .
The good news is that citizens will get fewer services from their government .
The bad news is that governments will reduce services in the worst possible way – firing teachers , rather than educational bureaucrats … filling holes in bank balance sheets , but failing to fill the potholes in the roads … and so forth .
And more bad news is that they will raise taxes …
The good news is that you can protect yourself from the feds ’ bad decisions .
Think of it as your own ‘ personal bailout ’… since they certainly do n’t have your best interests in mind .

Poor old Ireland .
It ’s been a terrible year on Erin ’s Isle .
The country that most benefited from the boom suffers more than others from the bust .
That ’s just the way it works .
Property prices are in free fall .
Unemployment is soaring .
And now comes Mr. Obama , pulling the bog out from under the bog trotters .
Your editor operates a mini-multinational .
Yes , we have offices all over the world – in Paris , London , Madrid , Buenos Aires , Johannesburg , Melbourne , Bombay … and Waterford , Ireland .
That is why we spend so much time traveling … just trying to keep up with business .
We moved to Waterford to take advantage of the 12 % corporate tax rate .
You gotta be somewhere ?
Why not go somewhere where they do n’t tax you so much ?
In practice , this has not proven very important , because we never made enough money in Ireland for the tax rate to matter .
Still , it was nice to know that if we ever did make any money in Ireland at least we would n’t have to give so much of it to the Irish government .
But along comes Obama ’s anti-tax haven initiative …and poor old Ireland is even poorer .
The American president proposes to do away with Ireland ’s tax advantage altogether …at least as it applies to American firms , who are the main beneficiaries .
In fact , he ’ll penalize U.S. firms abroad .
Not only will they pay local taxes … but they ’ll pay U.S. taxes too !
Yes , our poor little micro-multinational will have to pay more taxes .
And your poor editor too .
Dear reader … please do us a favor .
Please write your congressman .
Tell him to drop dead .
Until tomorrow ,
Bill Bonner
The Daily Reckoning
It 's been a long , long time since the first information about Dell 's update to the venerable XT convertible tablet snuck out of Texas , and while we got some choice morsels of information last month , we were still missing any semblance of a release date ( that original November 2008 target proved to be a bit optimistic ) .
Now we have what could be the official spec sheet for the series and a date to boot , confirming much of what we'd heard before , like your choice of 1.2GHz SU9300 or 1.4GHz SU9400 Intel Core 2 Duo CPUs , a 12.1 - inch multitouch display , up to 5GB of DDR3 memory , and either 80 GB worth of platters or 64GB of SSD .
Base weight is 3.62 pounds , just over the 3.5 pound target the company had been aiming for , and if this source is correct the machine will be getting an official unveiling on February 11 -- close enough that we 'd advise holding off on any other tablet purchases for a few days .

About a week ago , blogger Perez Hilton issued a DMCA takedown notice , asking YouTube to remove a video created by the National Organization of Marriage ( NOM ) .
The video used a clip from Hilton 's blog in which he strongly criticized Miss California USA Carrie Prejean , in response to comments she made criticizing gay marriage .
NOM 's use of Hilton 's video clip was clearly fair and non-infringing — it is brief , transformative , critical , and does not pose a competitive threat to Hilton 's market .
As such , Hilton 's takedown notice was , like takedown notices from Universal Music , Warner Music , Uri Geller and Michael Savage before him , a baseless attack on free speech .
Here 's what 's different about this takedown : NOM 's lawyer asked YouTube to restore the video immediately , rather than keeping it off - line for the standard 10 - 14 business day counternotice period .
And YouTube , after doing its own fair use analysis , agreed and obliged .
YouTube 's decision is both laudable and perfectly sensible — as we 've often noted , there 's no need to follow the DMCA safe harbor procedures if the disputed content is a clear fair use and , as a result , there 's no risk of liability .
That said , NOM 's sudden championship of fair use rights is striking , considering that NOM appears to have sent a slew of improper takedown notices of its own recently .
The irony is palpable , especially for critics of NOM who 've been denied the same free speech rights that NOM is now enjoying .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
A deadly swine - flu outbreak took its toll on airlines and cruise operators and rocked markets across the globe Monday , as traders feared a repeat of the SARS epidemic that ravaged Asia six years ago .
With cases spreading across continents , the World Health Organization late Monday raised the level of its alert on the disease to phase 4 , two notches below the widespread pandemic level .
Mexico City 's streets were empty as an estimated 1,614 people in Mexico contracted the swine flu .
At last count , the suspected death toll in Mexico stood at 149 , according to an Associated Press report .
The Mexican government has closed schools in Mexico City and nearby states , and the U.S. declared a public health emergency .
Forty Americans have caught the disease in five U.S. states , according to the Center for Disease Control .
The CDC said it will also recommend avoiding non-essential travel to Mexico .
In Canada , six cases were confirmed , and suspected cases were found as far as Israel and New Zealand .
So far , all the deaths have been limited to Mexico .
On Monday , Spain 's government confirmed one case of swine flu and said it was investigating at least 17 others .
The concern is that the disease reportedly has been transmitted not simply from pig to human , but from human to human .
" Given that the virus strain is apparently transmissible from human to human , a feature that none of earlier bird flu outbreaks displayed , there is reason for concern , " said analysts from the Swiss brokerage Sarasin .
News of the swine flu spread across markets worldwide Monday morning , starting in Asia and rolling west .
Mexico's IPC equities index slumped as much as 5 % before recovering some ground and ending down 3.3 % .
The Mexican peso plummeted , losing more than 5 % against the dollar .
See Emerging Markets .
" This is an already dangerous time for financial markets so to have this specter developing right now is certainly just cause for some very real concern , " said James Hughes , analyst at CMC Markets in London .
Investors sought refuge in safe - haven currencies , which helped the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen .
See Currencies story .
Corn futures earlier slumped about 4 % at the Chicago Board of Trade , while soybean futures lost nearly 6 % .
See full story .
Wall Street 's mixed reaction
On Wall Street , the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , +1.30 % finished in the red after vacillating between gains and losses .
The broader market was somewhat supported by shares of pharmaceutical firms , as evidenced by the Amex Pharmaceutical Index $ DRG -- including potential makers of a vaccine for the swine flu .
See Market Snapshot .
All in all , U.S. stocks seemed to handle word of the swine - flu outbreak in stride .
" This is not enough to knock this market down , unless we see something much more significant develop , " said Paul Mendelsohn , chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services .
" If anything , it was an opportunity to bring those drug stocks back to life , after they 'd been left for dead in this rally , " he said , referring to the stock market 's gains of nearly 30 % since early March .
Still , concerns that a pandemic could break out and further hit an already fragile global economy kept futures contracts for crude oil and industrial metals such as copper under heavy selling pressure .

Travel sector hit
Most of the impact on the market was focused on the travel sector .
Hong Kong , at the heart of a SARS epidemic in 2003 , imposed some strict travel regulations .
And European Union health officials said people should avoid traveling to affected areas of Mexico and the U.S .
Shares of US Airways Group Inc. LCC , dropped as much as 27 % , and UAL Corp.
UAUA fell as much as 18 % in New York , among a number of U.S. - listed airlines losing altitude .
UAL is the corporate parent of United Airlines .
In Hong Kong , China Southern Airlines ( 1055 ) slumped more than 14 % , while Air France - KLM ( AF ) dropped more than 6 % in Paris .
Read more on airline stocks .
It was a similar story for hotel operators .
Shares of InterContinental Hotels Group ( IHG ) IHG , +1.21 % and Marriott International MAR , +1.57 % both dropped more than 5 % in New York .
" Much like SARS did in 2003 , this would deal another blow to the travel and leisure industry , as travel gets curbed from current low levels , " said analysts at NetResearch Asia .
Meat producers also felt strain , with shares of Smithfield Foods SFD , - 5.66 % down 12 % and Tyson Foods TSN , +1.13 % down 9 % .
Drug makers on the rise
Drug makers advanced on news of the flu virus .
Roche Holding ( ROG ) RHHBY , - 0.66 % , the maker of the Tamiflu antiviral , rose more than 3 % .
GlaxoSmithKline GSK , +1.06 % ( GSK ) , which sells the Relenza anti-flu drug , rose more than 7 % .
And shares of Biota ( BTA ) BTAH leaped more than 80 % .
The Australian company licensed Relenza to Glaxo and gets royalties on sales .
Read Biotech Stocks story .
Both Roche and Glaxo have been in contact with the World Health Organization and U.S. and Mexican officials over potential delivery of stockpiles .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia is taking preventative measures , including military ones , after North Korea tested an atomic bomb , Interfax news agency quoted an unidentified official in Russia ’s security services as saying on Wednesday .
The official said the measures -- which did not include troop movements -- were needed in case a nuclear war broke out on the Korean peninsula , Interfax reported .
Virgin margarita on Cinco de Mayo for Ms. McCahill ( right ) ?
We must hand it to Playboy Miss May Crystal McCahill .
She ’s not scared of the judicial system over some stupid DUI case .
Just because she has a court case hanging over her head does n’t mean she ca n’t hit the bars for Cinco de Mayo .
And get silly enough to wear the sombrero and present us with photos that show she ’s pure fun .
The DUI happened back in March and will drag on into the summer .
McCahill was stopped by police after running a red light Jan. 7 at Chicago Avenue and Wood Street in Chicago , according to a published report .
McCahill , 25 , showed blood - alcohol levels more than twice the legal limit , a police report said .
Playmates , not known to be the brightest bulbs , do n’t seem to have an idea how the judicial system works .
McCahill wants evidence thrown out of her case and then goes and posts images from her Cinco partying .
Smart move , Einstein .
But this seems to be a pattern from a chick who ’s real first name is Princess .
She gave the Chicago media plenty of fodder on April 24 at her hearing on the DUI case .
Before the hearing , McCahill politely refused to talk about her case â€ ” but asked reporters if they were coming to her Playboy autograph - signing event at Club Crescendo nightclub later today .
Damn , smart move .
Use the court system to promote your upcoming vagina spread .
Awesome !

The moment Damian McBride clicked the " send " button on a rushed email was the moment Gordon Brown was brought uncomfortably close to gutter politics .
The prime minister 's adviser was replying to a request for help from his old colleague Derek Draper seeking material to post on a website Draper was considering setting up to air anonymous gossip about the Tories .
Did McBride have any ideas ?
He certainly did .
As Draper , a former aide to Peter Mandelson , put it yesterday : " Some were in bad taste , though I have to admit some were also brilliant and rather funny . "
But even though they never saw the light of day , these mini-scandals have created a much larger one .
The problem for Draper and McBride is that it is engulfing the man they were trying to support .
Just as Brown was basking in a rare upturn in the polls following Barack Obama 's visit , he has been derailed .
And the scandal lapped closer to him last night as it became clear the emails were copied to Charlie Whelan , now a senior union official but another former Brown aide who remains close to the prime minister .
McBride , a football - loving and pugnacious former Treasury civil servant drawn into Brown 's inner circle , paid yesterday with his career .
Draper , who is not a party employee , will still run his LabourList blog but is likely to find himself cold - shouldered by Labour colleagues .
This is his second major brush with controversy : after the last , when , while working as a lobbyist , he boasted to an undercover Observer reporter about how " intimate " he was with key New Labour figures , he abandoned politics to train as a psychotherapist .
He married the GMTV presenter Kate Garraway and disappeared from Westminster .
But then shortly after Mandelson returned to the Cabinet , Draper re-emerged to set up LabourList .
The emails show how quickly he had settled back into his old network .
If the prime minister was unaware of this muckraking , the Tories say , he should have known ; and it reflects badly on the culture of his administration that his aides thought such practices acceptable - particularly as they involved MPs ' families .
" It 's not just about me : it 's my daughters at school , it 's my parents , it 's the embarrassment of everyone else involved , " says Nadine Dorries , a Tory backbencher , the victim of allegations she says are utterly untrue .
Smears are , of course , a staple of politics not confined to any one party , but the charge against McBride and Draper is not just one of dirty tricks but of hamfisted meddling in a new media world they did not properly understand .
The vendetta between senior Brownites and Guido Fawkes , the Westminster blogger who obtained the emails , dates back to stories Fawkes - whose real name is Paul Staines - posted about the Smith Institute and its relationship to Ed Balls , also a close friend of McBride .
Shortly afterwards journalists began being offered snippets designed to undermine Staines , including news of his drink - driving conviction .
Coincidence ?
Staines , say friends , does not think so .
His blog continued targeting senior Labour figures , and its waspish attacks got under Labour 's skin .
When Draper launched LabourList , it was not long before they crossed swords - with Staines questioning Draper 's qualifications as a therapist and Draper threatened to sue .
Draper also clashed with Iain Dale , accusing the Tory blogger of being a racist over comments he made defending Carol Thatcher .
Both Tory bloggers suspected McBride was guiding the attacks on them - a suspicion understood to be confirmed in the emails .
The standoff culminated in a picture of McBride posted last Thursday , with the red crosshairs of a rifle sight superimposed on his head and no further explanation .
A day later , the Telegraph ran a front page story on the leaked emails , but without revealing their contents .
Was the story released by Labour in a desperate bid to spoil a scoop being prepared by the Sunday papers ?
But yesterday , as senior Labour as well as Tory figures demanded his head , it was clear McBride could not survive .
Losing him will have been painful for Brown : but when he warned last night that such tactics had no place in politics , it became clear he was using his loyal aide 's departure to distance himself from a toxic episode .
If he can not do so , then the scandal is far from over .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement Five US police officers in Birmingham , Alabama have been fired for beating an unconscious suspect who had crashed his car in a police pursuit .
The attack on Anthony Warren took place in January 2008 , but police video footage has only just been made public .
It was uncovered in March by prosecutors preparing a case against Warren for assaulting an officer , for which he was later convicted .
Officials said other officers had seen the video but never reported it .
The video was captured on 23 January 2008 by a camera mounted on a police car dashboard .
It shows Warren , who had been questioned about possible drug activity , driving at speed along a motorway , pursued by at least three police cars .
As horrific as the beating is , the deliberate tampering of evidence is just as horrific

Warren then turns onto a slip road and appears to swerve before the car rolls into a ditch , but a cut in the video makes it unclear how he came to lose control of the car .
He is thrown from the car window and lies in the ditch not moving before the policemen rush over and begin beating him .
At least one officer jumps onto Warren with his fist raised and another uses a baton to hit him .
Warren does not move throughout the attack .
' Horrific tampering '
Warren 's lawyers said he did not know about the attack until he saw the video
The footage emerged as state lawyers were preparing a case of attempted murder against Warren for the police officer he hit on the road .
District Attorney Brandon Falls said the video police provided as evidence stopped before the footage of the beating and he only saw the full version by chance a week before the trial .
But Mr Falls said he did not believe race was a motivation in the attack on Warren , who is black , saying both black and white officers were involved .
Wendy Crew , who is representing Warren in a civil case against the police , accused the police of interfering with evidence .
She said there had been no reason to use " excessive force " against Warren but that the " deliberate tampering of evidence " by police was " just as horrific " as the attack itself .
Lawyers for Warren said he was hospitalised after the incident and was not aware that he had been beaten until the video came to light .
The five policemen have not been identified but Police Chief AC Roper said they were veteran officers who had acted in a " shameful " manner .
He said his department had " terminated 50 years of combined service due to 10 seconds of injustice " .
In Birmingham , Alabama , in the present day , it is not acceptable
Mayor Larry Langford
" No doubt this guy was a menace to society , but he did n't deserve what happened to him , bottom line , " Mr Roper was quoted as saying by Birmingham News .
" I fully support our officers and fully believe in officer safety , but this video speaks for itself . "
The authorities believe that many police officers and supervisors had watched the video in the year before it was made public but had not reported it .
Mr Roper said a review would be carried out into " supervisor 's actions , reporting mechanisms and policies " .
The officers can appeal against their dismissal .
Warren pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was given a 20 - year prison sentence .
Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford said the incident was a reminder of Alabama 's history of police brutality and segregation .
" In Birmingham , Alabama , in the present day , it is not acceptable , " he said .

So what ’s all this about a new C++ standard , Verity ?
Why you asking me ?
I know nussing .
I ’m down to write ‘ Porcine influenza — a programmer ’s perspective ’ this month .
Do n’t fib .
Oh very well .
The enthusiasts imprisoned in the ISO C++ bunker are reputedly on the point of lighting a white smoke bonfire to indicate they have a new version of C++ ready .
It ’s provisionally called ‘ C++0 x ’ , where the ‘ x ’ stands for the year of its release .
This being 2009 , there surely cannot be much doubt , can there ?
I mean , next year will surely be too late for an ‘ 0 x ’ standard ?
Actually the C - plus - plusers point out it could be delayed until 200A , or indeed until 200F .
D’oh !
How could I forget the joys of hexadecimal - based humour ?
No doubt about it , those C++ guys have still got it .
But I guess this will be a conservative little standard , dotting a few semicolons and crossing the odd +?
By no means .
This is to be a grand simplifying standard , making the old language accessible to dribbling dolts like you and me , who have so often struggled in the past .
Sounds wonderful , dribbling excepted .
How about an example ?
For example , what was the first bit of C++ that ever gave you trouble ?
Before you found out about multiple inheritance or default copy constructors or template template parameters ?
Well , now you mention it , I never really got the hang of references .
Could n’t quite see why we needed them , what with the blessed K&R having bequeathed us pointers .
Exactly .
You will be pleased to hear the new standard addresses your confusion head on .
Whereas the old C++ let one write this
int& r1 = i ; // i is an int
the new C++ one can do this :
int&& r2 = foo( ) ; // foo( ) returns an int
Neat , eh ?
I think you may have skimped a little on your research there , Verity .
I ’m pretty sure you were always allowed to call functions foo( ) , pretentious though it is in a Tech Model Railroad Club sort of way .
No , silly .
Look at the declaration of r2 .
Look at the double ampersand .
Eughh !
Cripes !
I had noticed that but I thought that must have been some sort of typo that had unaccountably penetrated El Reg ’s usually impeccable proof - reading system .
So what does that mean ?
Some kind of reference to a reference , I guess ?
Somehow r2 is extra referency ?
Nope .
And ?
Well , I think it is really for passing big structures into functions .
You know how those OUT parameter references you get in some languages , for when you need extra return values ?
And that have no meaningful value when passed in ?
I think these rvalue references are in some sense the opposite .
You use them to make an IN parameter , but instead of being passed by value , it is a reference to a value that is about to die .
You can trample all over it , because nobody will use it again .
But it does n’t cost loads and involve making copies as passing - by - value does .
I must say that was about as lucid as the text of a software licence agreement and half as amusing .
Is there anything else to which you would like to draw my attention ?
Ok , dig this new syntax :
int i = {} ; // initialise an int
Do n’t tell me .
I can guess .
It declares i and initialises it to the body of the first function that I thought of .
Nearly right .
It means
int i = 0 ;
but brings the twin gifts of prolixity and obscurity to the party .
So why would they bother to …
Oh , never mind .
Bound to be some template tomfoolery .
Presumably it works with pointers , like this :
int * p = {} ; // initialise a pointer // same as int* p = 0 ;
Right ?
Wrong .
In the new C++ , you have to write
int * p = nullptr ;
Oh no .
You are not getting me like that .
That is what we used to write in C .
These days you have to write a zero , or produce a letter from Andrew ‘ Lookup ’ Koenig letting you off .
That is not what we used to write in C .
We used to write NULL in C .
Do pay attention or I will send you back to learn your regex rhymes .
Now , can you guess what this is ?
auto i = 0 ;
Wait a moment .
I have come across auto thing before .
Is n’t it a K&R keyword meaning the variable declared in the common segment of a different other FORTRAN program ?
Nearly .
It means that you do n’t have to bother to declare the int type — the compiler guesses it .
Bully for the compiler .
Actually , I think I ’d rather type int and save keyboard wear .
You can also use it to declare iterators and stuff
auto it = stlContainer.begin( ) ;
instead of
vector < int >::iterator it = stlContainer.begin( ) ;
You know , that ’s about the first nearly practical thing you have mentioned .
So if I write
auto i = {} ;
then it automatically initialises i to be the correct type and value , right ?
Do n’t be silly .
Anyway , there is another use of auto I want to tell you about .
You can use it to write functions the wrong way round .
Um …
Since time immemorial , curly brackets languages have let you make a function like this :
int someFunc ( ) { // function body ... }
But in C++0 x you can write
auto someFunc( ) -> int { // function body ... }
with the function ’s return type supplied at the back of the function .
What ?
Why would I want to do that ?
That is completely mad .
What is that , some politically correct adaptation of C++ for left - handed programmers or something ?
If I wanted to do that , I would code in Pascal .
It has many advantages .
I believe it allows you to overcome C++’s most vexing parse .
No , wait a moment , perhaps that ’s the curly bracket initialisers .
I ’ll give you a most vexing parse if you do n’t look out .
You are definitely deliberately winding me up now .
Absolutely not .
There ’s lots of other good stuff you must hear about .
You can stick in lambda functions anywhere you want , so that the appalling for_each template and its brethren suddenly become usable — as per my earlier petition — complete with a wonderful [ square bracket ] syntax for deciding which bits of local state will arise from the undead when the thing is called .
And you can make for loops in a style I last saw in CORAL 66 , where one provides the list of values the loop variable takes .
One , two , miss out three , five , six , now do four .
And there are heaps of Boost library functions ( of course ) , a scary new template programming concept called , um , ‘ concepts ’ , a scary new template programming thing called ‘ variadic templates ’ , constructors calling constructors , more fruitful unions …
You know , rather than bother you further , I think I will go read up on it for myself , if it ’s all the same with you .
Where can one find the dope on this ?
Well , Bjarne Stroustrup ’s site and the Wikipedia article are n’t bad places to start .
Please shut the door on your way out .
I want to concentrate on my new pet project .
Nothing like the imminent arrival of a new C++ standard to encourage one to learn .

As an intern , you work closely with FSF staff members in your area of interest , such as campaign and community organizing , free software licensing , systems and network administration , GNU Project support , or Web development .
All applicants must be :
open - minded and tolerant of others ,
able to work as part of a team , and
interested in the ethical ramifications of computing .
We strongly prefer applicants able to work in - person at the FSF headquarters in downtown Boston , but applicants based elsewhere may also be considered .
The FSF office is currently closed due to the COVID - 19 pandemic , so all internships will be remote until the office is formally reopened .
Unfortunately , due to the complexities of US immigration law , applicants who are not US citizens or permanent residents and do not have a visa allowing them to work in the US must work remotely from outside the US .
These positions are unpaid unless you are doing your internship through Outreachy , but in either case , the FSF will provide any appropriate documentation you might need to receive funding and school credit from outside sources .
We place an emphasis on providing hands - on educational opportunities for interns in which they work closely with staff mentors .
Take a look at our past interns and some of their projects , including promoting GNU , launching the free Javascript campaign , contributing to Defective by Design , and updating the Email Self - Defense project .
You can also see dozens of blogs from past interns who worked for our tech team here .
A small number of past interns have even become full - time employees at the FSF .
The campaigns team is particularly interested in interns interested in working on the End Software Patents campaign or the International Day Against DRM .
The End Software Patents campaign works to end the patentability of ideas in software .
While other advocacy groups focus on bad or stupid patents , and on patent trolls , we emphasize that these are only symptoms of a fundamentally broken system .
* No * software ideas should be patentable .
Schedule
The application period for fall internships has closed .
Each position lasts for one twelve - week term .
There are three terms : summer , fall , and spring .
There can be some flexibility with start and end dates if necessary .
Any of the terms can be worked as either full time ( forty hours per week ) or part - time ( twenty hours per week ) positions .
We will prefer candidates able to work full time , particularly during the summer term .
From time to time , remote internships are possible , but we prefer in - person internships .
How to apply
Send a letter of interest and resume with two references by email to hiring@fsf.org .
Make sure that your materials are in free software friendly formats ( PDF and plain text work well ) , and include " Internship " in your subject line .

A pagan protester named Arthur Pendragon who believes he is an incarnation of King Arthur was yesterday ordered to halt a 10 - month sit - in close to Stonehenge .
Pendragon - John
Rothwell before he changed his name by deed poll 30 years ago - set up camp at the edge of the site last summer to protest against the restricted access to the stone circle .
He believes visitors should be allowed to walk close to the stones and touch them rather than being confined to a visitor centre and a pathway well away from the monument .
Pendragon also believes the fence designed to keep visitors out has a damaging impact on the stone circle itself , holding it " in a stranglehold like a snared animal " .
Wiltshire county council launched legal proceedings to force Pendragon to move away .
Salisbury crown court granted a possession order , in effect giving him until Sunday to pack up and leave .
But outside court , bearded Pendragon , who was flanked by supporters in white robes , said he would not be budging .
" It 's a complete travesty and there was simply no justice in today 's ruling , " he said .
" Papers were only served on me on Friday afternoon so I had no time to seek legal advice and the judge told me I have no right of appeal .
" I 'm not hurting anyone and I 'm standing on a public road , the A344 , so I do n't see how I was trespassing .
I 'm just a thorn in their side and they want me to go .
" I will be appealing to whatever court will listen and get this ruling overturned .
In the meantime I will continue my protest and go back to the site tomorrow , regardless of what they say . "
Pendragon , 55 , who plans to stand as a parliamentary candidate for Salisbury , also complained about the visitor centre .
He said : " It was supposed to be a temporary building .
It 's awful .
It is a national disgrace so what I am hoping to do by my protest is embarrass the government . "
The care of Stonehenge has long been controversial , and not just among druids .
Plans to build a road tunnel to take away some of the traffic noise that blights the site have been shelved on cost grounds .
Many visitors are amazed at the state of the visitor centre .
General access to the stones was halted in the late 1970s , although visitors are allowed within the circle on special occasions such as the summer and winter solstices .
Pendragon faces forcible eviction by bailiffs if he fails to leave his camp by Sunday .
Should he return , he could be arrested for trespass .
A relatively quiet week ensued , after the Election Contest Court 's Monday ruling , but a few pertinent if seemingly unrelated events did transpire .
I 'll cover two events , as reported by the two major Minnesota papers , and present the time frame for Norm Coleman 's potential appeal to the MN Supreme Court .
Our first event features a meeting between Norm Coleman and the Minneapolis Star Tribune 's Editorial Board .
The meeting took place on April 16th , and a small portion of the video has been posted online at the Star Tribune website .
The excerpt shows Norm Coleman visibly upset over the Star Tribune 's conduct , with regard to the allegations of money laundering , in the days directly preceding the election .
I covered the allegations back in November , if you 're curious about the back story .
It 'll be interesting to see if the Star Tribune alters their reporting procedures in the coming weeks to make amends ; even though they already tend to lean right .
Our next story involves another act of vandalism levied against Norm Coleman 's house ; as reported by the Pioneer Press :
St. Paul police are investigating after eggs were thrown at former U.S. Sen .
Norm Coleman 's house in the Crocus Hill neighborhood .
It happened about 9:20 p.m. Tuesday , according to a police report that recorded the incident as misdemeanor criminal damage to property .
After eggs had hit the front door of Coleman 's home in the 600 block of Osceola Avenue , a resident of the home saw a man who appeared to be in his 20s outside , said Peter Panos , police spokesman .
The report did n't say who the resident was or whether Coleman was home , Panos said today .
The resident then saw the man throw a few more eggs , Panos said .
The number of eggs thrown was n't in the report , he said .
The egg thrower was n't caught , Panos said .
Coleman said Wednesday that a young man had bicycled past his home this week and thrown eggs at him .
... Republican Coleman has said he will appeal this week 's court ruling that Democrat Al Franken won last year 's U.S. Senate race .
Source : St. Paul Pioneer Press
I do n't know if this is particularly important , but it happened , so I 'm reporting it .
The last line of the excerpt does however provide a perfect segue .
Norm Coleman , lost his election contest , and now he has the opportunity to appeal the ECC 's ruling ; which he has indicated he will do .
Let 's began by looking at the relevant law proscribing the time frame in which an appeal must occur :
Subd .
4 .Appeal .
The judge 's decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court no later than ten days after its entry in the case of a general election contest or five days after its entry in the case of a primary contest .
The record on appeal must be made , certified , and filed in the Supreme Court within 15 days after service of notice of appeal .
The appellant shall file in the district court a bond of $ 500 for the payment of respondent 's costs if appellant fails on appeal .
The appeal from an election contest relating to the office of state senator or representative takes precedence over all other matters before the Supreme Court .
A copy of the decision must be forwarded to the chief clerk of the house of representatives or the secretary of the senate , as appropriate .
Source : § 209.10 , 2008 Minnesota Statutes
We know that Coleman has " ten days " to appeal , but the above article makes no reference to calendar days , business days or whatever ; so the question then becomes , when does the tenth day occur ?
Another Minnesota Statute seems to outline the proper interpretation :
6.01 Computation
In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules , by the local rules of any district court , by order of court , or by any applicable statute , the day of the act , event , or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included .
The last day of the period so computed shall be included , unless it is a Saturday , a Sunday , or a legal holiday , or , when the act to be done is the filing of a paper in court , a day on which weather or other conditions have made the office of the court administrator inaccessible , in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not one of the aforementioned days .
When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than seven days , intermediate Saturdays , Sundays , and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation .
As used in this rule and in Rule 77 ( c ) , " legal holiday " includes any holiday defined or designated by statute .
Source : Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure
The ten day appeal period began on Tuesday , April 14th because the day of the ruling , Monday , " shall not be included . "
It 's not clear whether the judgment was actually legally entered on Monday , as MN Rule 58.01 dictates that order " shall be entered forthwith by the court administrator " , which may or may not be the date of filing .
There may exist other legal contingencies that could extend the start date for the appeal window .
If we assume that the judgment took effect on Monday April 13th , that makes the tenth day Thursday , April 23th as weekends and legal holidays are included because the prescribed time is more than seven days .
Therefore , the Notice of Appeal must be filled on or before Thursday , April , 23 ; unless weather or other extenuating circumstances arise which facilitate the closure of the court offices .
In this event , the Notice of Appeal must be filed on the next day the court office is open and this " next day " can not be a weekend or a legal holiday .
I doubt , the Coleman campaign is in a hurry to file their appeal , my guess is at least Wednesday .
In the mean time , Franken will still not be seated in the US Senate without an Election Certificate which , according to MN § 204C.40 , cannot be issued until after " a court of proper jurisdiction has finally determined the contest . "
In the case of an appeal , this would be the MN Supreme Court .
If by next Thursday ( or Friday ) , an appeal is not filed by the Coleman campaign , a Minnesota Election Certificate could be legally issued to Al Franken .
Update [ 9:31 PM CT ] : I clarified some of the appeal deadlines and accounted for other contingencies that could alter the window for appeal .

You ’re ready for the boutique hostel .

The term boutique hostel is so new that you ca n’t even find it in Wikipedia .
Go on .
Try it .
In fact , boutique hostel may even be an oxymoron , and I ’m sure backpackers of the world will not be taking a particular shine to this phrase .
Nonetheless , something that seems to fall between a regular hostel , B&B , guesthouse , and boutique hotel has cropped up .
Of course , it ’s all marketing — they ’re really just “ very nice hostels . ”
What ’s going on ?
According to Benji Ladyano at the Guardian , vacationers are looking for more budget accommodations in these difficult economic times , and the entrepreneurial spirit of hostel owners is leading to better and increased services in the typical hostel .
It seems the backpackers and flashpackers are going to have to move over to make room .
So where can you can find one ?
Guardian.co.uk has started an interactive directory of worldwide boutique hostels .
Categorized by continent , there are already boutique hostels listed in Ghana , Morocco , Thailand , Germany , Portugal , Peru , Canada , and Australia , among many other countries .

If you ’ve stayed in one and want to share it with others , pop in a review and they ’ll consider adding it to the growing list .
Of special note , the boutique hostel El Diablo Tranquilo is owned and operated by our very own Matador Community member Brian Meissner .
The hostel in Punta del Diablo , Uruguay is found under L. America in the World ’s Best Boutique Hostels list .
Brian has his own take on why we ’re starting to see boutique hostels emerging :
Boutique hostels let you sleep comfortably , enjoy creative design ideas in interesting locations , give you all the services of a specialty hotel , yet still allow for that impromptu drinking game in the lobby and the liberating idea that the guy next to you at breakfast might be a doctor from Germany or a student from Chile , but he ’s also left his friends and his home and is right in the same boat you are , ready for anything and looking for people to share it with .
Whatever the reason , if it leads to more Internet , less hair in the drain , and a smilier host , I ’m all for it .

Rush Limbaugh responded to the Obama administration ’s release of the four OLC torture memos by , not only defending torture , but by using Sen .
John McCain as an example that torture works .
He claimed that the North Vietnamese broke McCain , but according to McCain , this is n’t true .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
Advertisements
Rush asked , “ The idea that torture does n’t work - that ’s been put out from John McCain on down -
You know , for the longest time McCain said torture does n’t work then he admitted in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last summer that he was broken by North Vietnamese .
So what are we to think here ? ”
The problem is that this is n’t exactly true .
McCain has often used his story as evidence that torture does n’t work .
According to McCain ’s book Faith of My Fathers , he gave his captors information that he made up , or was useless to the N. Vietnamese , “ Eventually , I gave them my ship ’s name and squadron number , and confirmed that my target had been the power plant .
Pressed for more useful information , I gave the names of the Green Bay Packers ’ offensive line , and said they were members of my squadron .
When asked to identify future targets , I simply recited the names of a number of North Vietnamese cities that had already been bombed .
[ Page 194 * ] . ”
This is a story that McCain told numerous times during the 2008 presidential campaign , although he tended to adjust the name of the football team involved , the story stayed the same .
The one thing all of these people who support torture have in common is that they never served in the military .
I may not have supported John McCain in the last election , but he made one of the most extreme sacrifices that a person can make for their country .
It is sickening that those on the right , including Limbaugh would seek to warp his service .
I suggest that we let all of the torture advocates try out these techniques .
If they think it easy as pie , then get water boarded , be placed in restraints and be left standing or hanging for hours .
I ’ll bet that all of these cowards would be crying by the end .
If anyone wants to support torture as a political position , they are free to do so , but do n’t demean the service of someone else while doing so .
Economy Good According to Realtor
I was talking to a very dear friend of mine who has been a real estate investor for a few years and just recently received his real estate license .
Now , Aaron is always busy , thank God for voicemail as I leave them often , but he is always courteous and gets in touch with me promptly , as anyone in a service field should .
When I talked to him today , he said he could n’t figure out why the news media was painting such a bleak outlook regarding the economy because he has about eighty clients looking for homes .
Now , I should probably tell you that my friend is an ex-Army Ranger , very personable and unstoppable .
I let him know that he always succeeds because of his positive outlook and he agreed that might have something to do with it .
I call it the Law of Attraction in Manifestation .
You might be asking about now , “ Well , what about all the news reports ?
Are they wrong ? ”
They can be , depending on your attitude .
How do I know this ?
I ’ve been studying a book called , Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill .
Dr. Hill interviewed many self - made millionaires and published his research in 1937 .
Every week , I mastermind with a group of people all studying this book and I can’t tell you what a difference it has made in my life , both personally and professionally .
What ’s really funny , well , it was n’t funny then , but I thought I was done working on me .
I had focused on me for many years , okay , at least eight years straight and I wanted a break !
One of my mentors told me that “ to get more , I have to become more ! ”
Oh , my !
I was kind of discouraged right there , but now , almost two years later , I can tell you it has been so worth it .
I ’m not the same person I was then and I ’m truly enjoying my life .
I know who I am , where I ’m going and enjoying the journey .
Do you want to succeed for the first time in your life ?
Have you already experienced success and seem to be on a plateau ?
Do you just desire to find out who you really are ?
If you answered yes to any of the above questions then I personally invite you to mastermind with us .
You grow at your own pace .
Start now by clicking on the ebook in the upper right corner .
The book is totally generic and I assure you , you will not only learn some myths and truths about this wonderful industry , you ’ll enjoy the humor too !
So , just like my friend , Aaron , you too , can have a very successful life .
The buck starts here !
Call me and let me know what you think or if you have any questions .

WOW OKAY that was the most risque thing I 've ever drawn .
Sheesh .
Ironically , I have a completely nudity - free guest strip running over on Anders Loves Maria on Friday !
Enjoy your weekend and I will see you Monday .
Anthony Barnett ( London , OK ) : The Observer ’s Rafael Behr has written a wonderfully ridiculous column today proclaiming that we live in the “ golden age of liberty ” .
Perhaps he was jealous not to have been invited to the Convention .
For he complains that “ The story most often told about modern liberty is one of tragedy , not triumph . ”
Most often ?
I thought the story had just begun !
But Behr counters our anxiety with extraordinary precision and wit , for example : “ We are free to blaspheme , to swear .
Holy shit !
How free are we ? ”
Or again , “ We have the maximum political , moral and cultural licence of any people ever ” .
License indeed .
Is this the same Behr who was recently warning against license , generously warning the liberal left against surrendering ‘ society ’ asking “ But what about ' old - fashioned ' codes of public behaviour - politeness , civility ?
Those are part of the contract that binds individuals together into a society . ”
OK , that was in his Observer column nearly two years ago , when unlike the public he sensed nothing wrong with the ultra-boom .
Why do people complain , he asked , when “ By objective measures , we have never had it so good ” and are mostly “ living the life of Riley ” .
Perhaps he has the same cloth ear for what is going on now .
Certainly he has yet to discover the difference between license and liberty .
But before we bestow upon him the honour of engaging with his concepts , if such they are , perhaps he could deal with our basic arguments .
In patronising terms he pretends to be grateful for the “ well - mobilised artistic , media and political lobby exercising the necessary eternal vigilance . ”
“ I ’m glad ” , he adds , that , “ there are intelligent , dedicated people carefully monitoring our progress down the slippery slope , demarcating in units of kilo - outrage our incremental creep towards the thick end of the wedge .
But by fixating on the menacing detail of current state oppression , we miss the big historical picture .
Go back a couple of centuries and most of us lived in perpetual fear of arbitrary violence .
We could n't read or write .
Independent thought was a sin . ”
So it ’s all right now , you see .
William
Blake had a case perhaps back then , but today we can safely turn to Behr for reassurance .
However , is he really so glad about those “ intelligent people ” who I suppose must include myself ?
I suspect not , as by the end we are being described as nostalgics who “ secretly crave repression ” to gain an “ easy sense of political purpose ” with a “ craving for the existential certainty of the great moral struggles of the 20th century .
But this is the 21st century . ”
So , not intelligent at all then – ca n’t even get the century right .
I suppose what I most resent about such floppy verbiage is a failure to read before he writes .
I am sure there is a case against the arguments researched by Henry Porter above all .
But this would necessitate Behr , for example , going through the Convention briefing paper on What We have Lost ( pdf ) and replying to its case .
It is true that our potential for liberty has grown , if this is his point .
But so too have the threats .
If you want to sing in London you have to fill out form 696 which feels like the racial profiling of your music , puts you on a police database and is both threatening and unnecessary .
That is before we get to holding three innocent people for 27 days without charge and then releasing them .
The case is not , Timothy Garton Ash put it well , that we are in a Stasi state .
But that , and this is the aim of the mobilisation Behr complains about , we can defeat the threats – this is indeed the freedom we still have .
We will exercise it while he indulges in blaspheming .

Vultures are often described as " nature 's cleaners "
Farmers are to be allowed to leave dead livestock in their fields in parts of Europe - to help starving vultures .
MEPs voted for a change in the law after the hungry birds , most often found in Spain , had been spotted as far away as Brussels , scavenging for food .
The move allows farmers to leave dead livestock in their fields - providing it is deemed safe and hygienic .
Vultures are capable of stripping a dead cow or sheep carcass in a matter of hours .
Environmentalists describe the birds as " nature 's cleaners " .
But many vultures have been starving to death since European rules aimed at tackling mad cow disease forced all dead livestock to be cleared away .
This forced the birds to embark on some rather long - haul trips - one was even spotted recently perched on top of a bus shelter in Brussels .

They 've sung his praises on social networking pages , calling him a " hero , " " the greatest man of our time , " " a legend . "
They 've said he deserves to be knighted and should be decorated with medals .
They 've cried out for his amnesty and have even proposed serving time for him .
A Lebanese student in Beirut attends a December rally to support the shoe - throwing Iraqi journalist .
The man many hundreds of thousands of Facebook users honor is no other than Muntadhar al - Zaidi , the Iraqi journalist who was sentenced Thursday to three years in prison for hurling his shoes at then - U.S. President George W. Bush .
The double - whammy size 10 shoe toss , neither of which hit Bush , took place in December at a news conference in Baghdad , Iraq .
In many traditional Middle East circles , throwing shoes at someone is considered a grave insult .
To do this to an American president surrounded by Secret Service agents , no less , was as shocking to riveted viewers who watched the footage later as it was to the president himself .
Watch video about the shoe thrower 's sentencing »
" First of all , it 's got to be one of the most weird moments of my presidency , " Bush said later .
" Here I am getting ready to answer questions from the free press in a democratic Iraq , and a guy stands up and throws his shoe .
... I 'm not angry with the system .
I believe that a free society is emerging , and a free society is necessary for our own security and peace . "
Expressing their own freedom on Facebook , a worldwide fan base rose up to laud al - Zaidi 's actions .
They formed hundreds of fan pages and groups , big and small , serious and light .
One is even called the " Shoe - Throwing Appreciation Society . "
Mike Trainor , 28 , was watching a football game when a news break brought footage of the incident across his TV screen .
" I thought it was the funniest thing I 'd ever seen , " said Trainor , a Queens , New York , stand - up comedian behind " Guy Who Threw His Shoes at Bush , " which has attracted nearly 270,000 fans .
The comedian may have created the post for laughs , but he quickly learned how loaded the issue was .
" It grew into this crazy thing , " in which Bush supporters began to weigh in on message boards calling al - Zaidi supporters " a threat to America " and insults in reaction flew , he said .
" It shows people have a lot of passionate feelings about it , that 's for sure . "
One message board on his page , titled " YOU GUYS HATE AMERICA , " drew 384 posts in reaction .
The creator started it with these words : " seriously you guys are all a ** holes .
why would you be happy about some freaking foreigner throwing his shoes at the leader of the free world ?
I do n't care if he 's dumb he 's my president of my wonderful country [ sic ] . "
And interspersed amid the groups of fans were those that spoke out against the al - Zaidi worship .
" That shoe thrower is not a hero , " attracted 94 members , many of them with Arabic names .
One London poster said the shoe thrower " did nothing but bring shame upon us iraqis [ sic ] , " and another from Halifax , Nova Scotia added , " I dont care about bush but this guy was very disrespectful to the Iraqi Prime minister who was standing right next to him [ sic ] . "
But the shoe - thrower fans , at least in the world of Facebook , seem to far outweigh those who decried his actions .
" This site is intended to express the appreciation of those who share the frustration and anger that you expressed when you blew Mr Bush those boot - kisses [ sic ] , " reads the description on " Thank you Muntadhar al - Zaidi , " a nearly 500 - member page created by a teacher at the University of Auckland in New Zealand .
Protests of the journalist 's arrest and now sentence brought Arab and Muslim demonstrators to the streets .
But what Facebook has shown is that al - Zaidi's angry expression resonated with those beyond his religion and region .
From England and Uruguay to China and Bush 's own red , white and blue , supporters have made noise , at least virtually .
" We 're talking about a common man , like me and you , " who was " tired of years of lies from a self - called ' freedom saver , ' " said Matteo Ferigo of Padova , Italy , the 30 - year - old creator behind " Save Muntadhar al - Zaidi , " which has 116 members .
" I understand that his act was not so civil , polite or ' politically correct , ' but I also understand how Iraqi people can see George Bush and what he represents to them . "
Ari Vais , the creator of the page , " Free the Iraqi shoe throwing journalist ! , " said his own history taught him the value of free expression .
" I was born in the Soviet Union , where dissent like this was cracked down on severely , " said Vais , a 39 - year - old Queens , New York , musician .
" We came to America when I was a boy because we knew that people should be free . "
What al - Zaidi did was a reflection of the democracy Vais thought Bush intended to spread .
" We were supposed to be liberators , and what America stands for is freedom of self - expression and human rights , " he said .
" All he did was throw a couple shoes .
And he missed !
It was political theater and not jail - time stuff . "
But it was serious business .
Anyone , no matter where they live , would be tackled by Secret Service and face charges for such an attempted assault on the president .
And if al - Zaidi had done this to Saddam Hussein , one has to wonder what would have come of the man who 's now celebrated .
The shoe throwing , because it was so shocking , proved great fodder for late - night talk shows .
Comedians , beyond Trainor , had a field day with this one .
It inspired online games for people who wanted to play al - Zaidi .
Matt Love of Edmonton , Alberta , in Canada called the Iraqi journalist 's move " an act of great courage " and said that in showing his disdain for Bush , " He spoke for many millions of people . "
The 52 - year - old retired Washington state department of transportation worker believes everyone can learn from the shoe thrower .
Commenting Thursday on several fan pages , including one calling for a Nobel Peace Prize for al - Zaidi , Love suggested that people turn out for Bush 's March 17 speech at the TELUS Convention Centre in Calgary .
" Lets [ sic ] show some solidarity ... and lob some loafers , " he wrote .
" Will the Canadian government lock us up for 3 years ?
Let 's find out . "
Reached later in the day , however , he assured CNN that this was written tongue - in - cheek .
" Let me be clear , " Love said .
" I wo n't be throwing shoes at anyone . "

Opium trafficking provides the Taliban with much of its income
International and Afghan troops have killed 60 militants and made a record drugs haul in an operation in southern Afghanistan , the US military has said .
Its statement said the four - day attack targeted the town of Marja in Helmand province - a Taliban stronghold .
The troops seized 92 tonnes of opium poppy seeds and other drugs , " severely disrupting " a key narcotics centre and command hub of the insurgency .
The US denied reports that civilians were killed during the operation .
However , a spokesman for the Afghan defence ministry told the BBC that it was investigating the reports .
Taliban militants have so far not commented on the US statement .
Weapons seized
On Saturday , the US military said the joint operation focussed on Marja , south - west of the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah .
It said the troops targeted the town 's bazaar , describing it as a key hub for militant and criminal operations .
The area was emptied of civilians overnight on Friday , before precision airstrikes were launched , the statement said .
The international and Afghan forces then seized the poppy seeds , along with tar opium , processed morphine , heroin and hashish .
Helmand is the main producer of Afghan opium , which accounts for more than 90 % of the global supply .
The US military also said that a large amount of weapons and bomb - making equipment was seized during the operation .
Different ways to save money and protect the environment
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found that levels of organic pollutants indoors - where we spend 90 percent of our day - are two to five times more polluted than the air outside .
That 's an alarming statistic .
But unlike most other alarming statistics floating around these days , this is actually one you can do something about .
Not only will going green improve indoor pollution , it can also fatten your wallet .
We 've outlined 10 simple things you can do to become a little greener - all you have to do is organize your errand and shopping lists accordingly .
Combined , these ideas could save you more than $ 1,000 this year .
1 . Ditch the dry cleaning : Dry cleaning uses harsh chemicals and it's expensive .
And do n't kid yourself - you bring those harsh chemicals home with you on your dry cleaned clothes .
Try to steam your clothes as much as possible while you 're in the shower and buy fabrics that are washable .
2 . Buy green and concentrated :
What you spray on surfaces in your home interacts with your body in some way .
Many household cleaning products have toxins and are dangerous , causing serious skin reactions and even asthma .
Look for products that are organic , toxin - free , and do not say dangerous .
Products like Clorox Green
Works are at least comparable in price to other toxic products on the market .
To save money , check out concentrated cleaners , where you simply add the water yourself .
3 . Use a water filter : Americans use 3.3 million plastic bottles every hour , but recycle only 1 in 5 .
Skip the $ 2 bottles of water and instead , purchase a water filter system and a metal water bottle ( to take your filtered tap water to go ) .
In doing so , you 'll not only prevent plastic from entering landfills , you also will save a few bucks a day by refilling your own bottle .
Or go one step cheaper , and just drink from the tap .
4 . Break your paper towel habit : Paper towels are so easy to use , and downright addictive if you have messy kids to clean up after .
But they are far from a necessity .
Rather than sacrificing more trees and adding to our landfills , use sponges and rags made from old cotton T - shirts or towels .
They 're great for cleaning up little ones , spills , and your house .
Keep rags and sponges right near the sink to prevent temptation .
5 . Visit your local library :
You do n't need to buy so many books when you 've got public libraries .
Visit on a Saturday , pick out a good book or two , and return it in the next week or two when it is due .
6 . Reduce the paper trail : Sign up for electronic bills for your business credit card , bank statements , electric bills , etc. and pay online .
Then print only the confirmation of payment page .
Still need the individual transaction documentation ?
Print it off on the recycled paper yourself instead of the credit card company sending you 20 pages of bill on regular paper with envelopes .
Also , you save money on postage and envelopes .
Sometimes you can actually get a credit by having the money automatically deducted from your account .
7 . Make your own cup of joe :
If everyone in your office drinks a grande latte every morning from the local coffee shop , think of how many paper cups are tossed in the trash AND how much money you 're spending on that overpriced cup of coffee .
Buy coffee in bulk , make it at home , and use a travel mug because $ 3 per day , five days a week adds up to a whopping $ 780 per year .
8 . Turn on the energy - saving lights : Energy Star - rated light bulbs and fixtures use at least two - thirds less energy than regular lighting , so yes they truly do save you money .
Another option is to use motion sensors that automatically shut off lights when no one is in a room , saving energy for the planet and money for the company .
9 . Inflate your tires : Proper tire inflation can improve your gas mileage up to 3 percent .
10 .
Get power strips for your rooms :
Even when turned off , things like hair dryers , cell phone chargers and televisions use energy .
Cut down on your own electric bill and do something good for the environment by getting an energy strip .
Plug in all your phones , chargers , and small appliances into the strip , and unplug the strip when you are not using the items .

Archaeological Coverup ?
Rumors are rampant on the Internet that the archaeology is suppressing the true human past .
We take a look at the origins of a modern myth .
by Jason Colavito >

Read more in my FREE , expanded eBook Mysteries of Ancient America HERE
In the April - May 2002 edition of Nexus Magazine , William Hart asked whether archaeology engaged in a coverup to suppress hidden aspects of the human past .
Similarly , in the winter 2001 - 2002 edition of the pseudo - scientific magazine Ancient American , author Jack Andrews asks the question " Did Ancient Chinese Visit the Grand Canyon ? " ( vol. 6 : i. 41 )
Here now a LOST CIVILIZATIONS UNCOVERED exclusive , the side of the story that Ancient American and Nexus did not tell their readers .
On April 5 , 1909 a Phoenix newspaper called the Arizona Gazette published an article in its evening edition which claimed the an Egypto - Tibetan culture lived in the Grand Canyon .
Running on the front page under the headline " Explorations in the Grand Canyon , " the anonymous story claimed that the find was " not only the oldest archaeological discovery in the United States , but one of the most valuable in the world . "
Furthermore , the article claimed the project was " under the direction of Prof. S. A. Jordan " with Smithsonian - backed adventurer G. E. Kinkaid .
The duration of the article is an account of the find by G. E. Kinkaid .
In his narrative Kinkaid described a series of tunnels and passages with a cross chamber near the entrance in which stood a statue : " The idol almost resembles Buddha , though the scientists are not certain as to what religious worship it represents .
Taking into consideration everything found thus far , it is possible that this worship most resembles the ancient people of Tibet . "
Kinkaid allegedly says that he found an unknown gray metal resembling platinum in the cave , and tiny carved heads were scattered on the floor .
Urns bore " mysterious hieroglyphics , the key to which the Smithsonian Institute hopes yet to discover . "
In another room he said he found mummies : " Some of the mummies are covered with clay , and all are wrapped in a bark fabric . "
Then we take leave of Kinkaid , and the anoynmous reporter offers an epilogue : " The discoveries in the Grand Canyon may throw further light on human evolution and prehistoric ages . "
From this strange story written at the dawn of the twentieth century came a web of intrigue and deception that alternative historians say they have uncovered .
This is but one aspect of a growing paranoia among alternative authors that sees conspiracies threatening to destroy the " true " history of man 's past .
We shall examine several aspects of this alleged coverup .
THE GRAND CANYON
Off the bat , there are a few signs that point to a hoax on the part of the paper or Mr. Kinkaid .
First of all , this is a one - source story without comment from Prof.
Jordan or any other person , though some canyon mystery enthusiasts like Jack Andrews point out that the Gazette rarely used bylines on its stories .
" It was a unique story in an otherwise dull , routine mainstream paper , " Andrews said .
On March 12 of that same year , the Gazette had reported on an earlier phase of Kincaid 's adventure .
However , there is no documentary evidence to back up Mr. Kincaid 's existence .
Secondly , the Smithsonian is an Institution , not an Institute .
Anyone who really worked for them would know that .
Third , when the article is read in full , it seems like a regurgitation of the 19th and early 20th century stories about Lemuria and Mu .
In fact , even if the paper were blameless in the affair , the alleged Mr. Kinkaid , for whom no Smithsonian record exists , could easily have been a local liar who read all about the lost continent of Atlantis or Lemuria and spun it into a local tale bought by the yellow press still reeling from the Pulitzer - Hearst tabloid fever .
How could even the most " dull , routine " paper pass on a story that seemed so good ?.
As Mike Mahanay comments on his Grand Canyon trek and exploration page , " Please remember that although this article was published in 1909 , it is pure fiction , and has led many a fortune hunter to frustration and despair ! "
Mahanay has worked in the Grand Canyon for years and leads tours through the region .
However many people ignore this warning , and the story has a sinister aspect .
The belief in this lost Egyptian / Tibetan temple has consequences today .
Ever since unorthodox researcher David Hatcher Childress published the newspaper hoax as fact in his book Lost Cities of North and Central America , the story took on the trappings of truth , without regard for actual facts .
In his web article about maverick archaeologist John Ora Kinnaman 's attempts in the 1950s to prove a 35,000 - year - old date for the Great Pyramid , Stephen Mehler writes :
" By virtue of the huge crystal stored in a chamber 1,100 feet below the bedrock of the Giza Plateau , Egyptian priests could send telepathic messages around the world !
According to [ Dr. Albert J. ]
McDonald , one of the places Dr. Kinnaman said these messages were sent was the Grand Canyon !
Dr. Kinnaman may have known about the find in the Grand Canyon in 1909 and even known Professor S.A. Jordan , but we have no documentation of this as of yet . "
For his part , Kinnaman claimed to have found the Atlantean Hall of Records beneath the Sphinx , where he said the Ark of the Covenant rested .
Obviously , there is not truth to this , and Kinnaman sought to validate the Atlantis prophesies of alleged psychic Edgar Cayce .
Jack Andrews said that while he has no definite proof that any aspect of the Grand Canyon story is true , " I find that most outspoken critics of the 1909 story are generally slim to none in the ' evidence ' to back their outrageous claims that the story is automatically a ' myth ' or ' hoax ' .
I have not seen one piece of genuine evidence to back the claims . "
Yet there is evidence that the story does not hold up .
There once was a Prof. S. A. Jordon , with an 'o ' not an 'a ' , but this Jordon was a European archaeologist , not an American one .
Jordon did not work the Grand Canyon .
On the Cyber Space Orbit website , John Winston comments :
" Several professional inquiries into this matter ten years ago made it clear that to Smithsonian authorities , this was indeed a hoax , and that the fact there is no record of any Professor S. A. Jordan ever existing , or ever being associated with the Smithsonian . "
He then paradoxically cites the existence of Prof. Jordon as proof of a Smithsonian cover - up of the information in the Gazette article .
More likely is the idea that Jordan with an ' a ' never existed .
As for the Smithsonian itself , when asked by Peter Hay of the Sightings website , a representative for the Institution had the following comment :
" From : Smithsonian Information < Info@info.si.edu To : < pmh@direct.ca Sent : Thursday , January 13 , 2000 8:16 AM
Subject : Re : Fw : SIGHTINGS
" Peter Hay
" Your e-mail of January 11 has been received .
" The Smithsonian Institution has received many questions about an article in the April 5 , 1909 Phoenix Gazette about G. E. Kincaid and his discovery of a ' great underground citadel ' in the Grand Canyon , hewn by an ancient race ' of oriental origin , possibly from Egypt . '
According to the article , Prof. Jordan directed a major investigation of the ' citadel ' that was mounted by the Smithsonian .
" The Smithsonian 's Department of Anthropology , has searched its files without finding any mention of a Professor Jordan , Kincaid , or a lost Egyptian civilization in Arizona .
Nevertheless , the story continues to be repeated in books and articles .
" We appreciate your interest in the Smithsonian Institution . "
Lost Civilizations Uncovered asked Ancient American writer Jack Andrews to write an article detailing why he believes the Grand Canyon story is true after he e-mailed us his detailed criticisms , some of which appear in this story .
Andrews declined our invitation , saying : " I cannot , however , write an article stating why I believe the story is true , since I have not yet been convinced conclusively of the ' truth ' of the story . "
HOW THE STORY GREW Nevertheless , many continue to believe faithfully in the story of the prehistoric cave , a story that has grown and metamorphosed into a subterranean city as the story is told and retold again and again .
Author David Icke is typical of the true believers .
From his book The Biggest Secret :
" In 1909 a subterranean city which was built with the presicion ( sic ) of the the Great Pyramid was found by G. E. Hincaid ( sic ) near the Grand Canyon in Arizona .
It was big enough to accomidate ( sic ) 50,000 people and mumified ( sic ) bodies found were of oriental or possibly Egyptian origin , according to the expedition leader Professor S. A. Jordan .
My own resaerch ( sic ) suggests that it is from another dimension , the lower fourth dimension , that the reptilian control and manipulation is primarily orchestrated ( sic ) . "
In Icke 's telling , the cavern tomb of legend becomes a precise city with a sizable population .
Icke also names its inhabitants as reptiles from the fourth dimension , a concept first put forward in H. P. Lovecraft 's fictional story " The Nameless City , " where a hapless traveler discovers a subterranean city in Arabia populated by the mummies of prehistoric reptiles .
Except for a difference in location , Icke 's version of the myth reads like Lovecraft warmed over , with a good dose of Robert Temple : " There were other extraterrestrial races at large on the Earth , and still are , as well as the extraterrestrial race which the Sumerians called the Anunnaki and other ancient texts called the serpant ( sic ) race . "
Once again , those pesky Annunaki make their way into the myth of lost civilizations .
( see my article From Cthulhu to Cloning for more )
Of course , Icke also believes that Princess Diana died as a result of an extraterrestrial cover-up .
The common thread running through all of these articles and posts is a common source : the David Hatcher Childress article hinting at a vast archaeological conspiracy to cover up Egyptian relics .
Let us take a quick look at Childress and his ideas .
He claims that at the age of 19 he left on a six - year , around - the - world adventure in the style of ancient astronaut theory founder Erich von Däniken .
He says he studied first - hand the ruins of cultures spanning the globe , and WexClub.com called him a " real - life Indiana Jones " for his archaeological adventures .
Childress calls himself a " lost science scholar , " and claimed in his book Extraterrestrial Archaeology that the moon and nearby planets contain pyramids , domes and spaceports visible by telescope and satellite .
He has a profound respect for the scientist Nikola Tesla , who Childress believes invented anti-gravity , time - travel , death - ray and thought machines .
Childress is also prone to seeing conspiracies , arguing in his book The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla that the U.S. government conspired to supress the discoveries made by Tesla to protect big business .
Incidentally , Childress claims only to be the posthumous co-author of Fantastic Inventions with Tesla as the main author .
In his most recent book , Technology of the Gods ( 2000 ) , he claims that ancient cultures possessed advanced technology far beyond what humanity can achieve today .
Childress also wrote a series of Lost Cities books in which he compiled anomolous , questionable and apocryphal stories to prove his thesis that extraterrestrials influenced early man and current governments are suppressing this fact .
It appears that Childress discovered the story of the Gazette article while researching Lost Cities of North and Central America , in which he repeated apocryphal stories of pterodactyls alive in Texas .
He took the official denials of the Gazette story as proof of a cover -up .
He included the story and the denials in a chapter of Lost Cities , and he excerpted that chapter for the disreputable Nexus magazine in 1993 .
After publication in Nexus ( volume 2 number 13 ) , the article was posted on KeelyNet BBS on May 8 , 1993 under the inauspicious heading of CANYON .
ASC .
KeelyNet issued the disclaimer that anything it published was free to copy , and an internet revolution was born .
Soon the Childress article appeared all over the internet and hundreds of websites carried the news that ancient Egyptians lived in the Grand Canyon .
( A Google search turned up 974 pages with the story . )
By 2001 , the story was firmly embedded in the alternative community as proof that the Smithsonian covered up parts of history .
NEXUS : CONSPIRACY CENTRAL
Nexus magazine is a strange story all on its own .
Founded in Australia in 1987 , the magazine focused on unconventional and occult stories , often without second thought to the veracity of information .
In 1990 , Duncan Roads purchased the magazine and attempted to make it the paper of record for the alternative community :
" It was a magazine that addressed itself to the alternative fringe of society and thus it carried many ' alternative ' points of view on the subjects of health , human rights , the environment , human potential and suppressed information .
I revived this magazine by deleting all articles on the new age , the occult , environment and similar subjects , and by concentrating on what I call ' suppressed information . ' "
In the April - May 2002 Edition of Nexus , author Will Hart alleged that a massive archaeological coverup to suppress what he believes is the true history of humanity : " The conspiracy is global and there are many vested interest groups .
A cursory investigation yields the usual suspects : scientists with a theoretical axe to grind , careers to further and the status quo to maintain . "
Hart reiterates many of the so - called mysteries of the human past , and he presents each as an attempt by mainstream science to " suppress " information .
For example ,
He alleged that scientists used fallacious logic and ad hominem attacks to discredit researchers challenging the orthodox view .
Citing the Sphinx - weathering controversy , Hart charged that Egyptologists tried to hide evidence for a 10,000 year - old Sphinx ( currently believed to be about 4500 years old ) by attacking the character of the major proponent of the old - Sphinx theory , tour guide John Anthony West : " Shifting the focus away from the issues and ' personalising ' the debate is a highly effective strategy -- one which is often used by politicians who feel insecure about their positions . "
Yet Hart commits the same offense , opining that evolutionary theorist Richard Dawkins is a member of the " Brain Police " and smearing his intergrity .
Notice more of Hart 's own faulty logic .
He claims that scientists cannot be trusted , saying , " Did n't those meek fellows in the clean lab coats give us nuclear bombs and biological weapons ? "
Yet he is quick to confuse to issues , folding archaeology into nuclear physics and conflating evolutionary biology with bioterror in order to paint one discipline with the bad brush of another .
Calling it " The Big Lie , " Hart claims that Egyptologists are purposely suppressing the true age of Egyptian monuments to protect not just themselves , but the entire scientific world - view .
If ancient monuments are more ancient than believed , then cultural evolution is not true .
" Since , " Hart wrote , " the theory of ' cultural evolution ' has been tied to Darwin 's general theory of evolution , even more is at stake .
Does this explain why facts , anomalies and enigmas are denied , suppressed and / or ignored ?
Yes , it does . "
What we can clearly see here is a hidden agenda , a hidden creationist agenda that loathes science because it challenges the religious explanation of human life .
Yet even if ancient cultures went a few thousand years further back in time , it in no way invalidates the idea of biological evolution .
In fact , cultural evolution is no longer the favored theory , having gone out of fashion decades ago .
Today most researchers believe that human culture is cyclic , with periods of great development and periods of decay .
However , creationists , firmly rejecting any form of evolution seek to link the idea of cultural evolution to its biological counterpart so that attacking one can discredit the other .
" Are we hearing the faint echoes of religious zealotry ? "
Hart asks of science .
Yes , but not from the scientists .
Like those who sought to claim the Grand Canyon as the nexus of an alien underground , those who claim archaeological coverups around the world routinely rally against the twin blasphemies of " credentials " and " peer - review , " arguing that science perpetuates its coverups by the ridiculous idea of demanding its researchers to have an understanding of their subject and submit it for other scientists to comment upon and review .
The alternative historian instead relies on single sources and questionable sources , like a 1909 newspaper article citing men who many never have existed .
That one source , for these people , is worth more than all the reports of science .
Unfortunately , no one bothered to check the source .
POSTSRIPT 2002 Jack Andrews wrote Lost Civilizations Uncovered on August 5 , 2002 to take issue with our coverage of the 1909 Grand Canyon tomb story once again .
He asked that we run a statement from him clarifying his position .
" ' Skepticism ' does believe in fairness , right ? " he asked .
STATEMENT FROM JACK ANDREWS AUGUST 5 , 2002 I would guess that you will reduce all and any arguments for the possibility of the 1909 cave 's existance to an " either or " " black and white " " true or false " scenerio .
You are correct .
I " did " say " I cannot , however , write an article stating why I believe the story is true , since I have not yet been convinced conclusively of the ' truth ' of the story . "
I never said that I am convinced that the story is false , or a hoax , or an exaggerated fable .
I am not convinced of that , based on my 250 miles of hiking experience in the Grand Canyon and several boxes of research information I have collected over the years and most certainly not convinced of the possible falseness based on the weak arguments for a " hoax " or " falseness " presented to me and presented on " skeptic " web sites based on shallow to no research on the 1909 story , the Grand Canyon 's geology , hydrology , geography , history and history of human habitation , and arguments spoken by many with little to NO Grand Canyon hiking experience .
It all adds up to a slim poorly researched arguments from the " skeptical " community who appear to be to [ sic ] lazy to do any serious research into the 1909 story and it's [ sic ] relationship to the Grand Canyon .... and yes you " do " have to present convincing evidence that the story is false .
Armchair critiques , from my experience , generally contain the weakest arguments of all .
Mr. Andrew 's research may be viewed at his website where the reader can also view his three dimensional artwork from " another cosmos , " including his impressions of the supposed Grand Canyon 1909 cave .
UPDATE 2005
In March 2005 , Lost Civilizations
Uncovered received the following letter : I am a great niece of John Ora Kinnaman .
He married my great Aunt Flossie .
I spent time with him when I was young and my father was raised by John and Flossie in Georgia as a young boy .
He was a very bright man and had many good qualities but unfortunately was not truthful about many things .
He copied the works of others and took them on as his own .
His biography is full of untruths , his travels to Europe and the Middle East for instance .
My family and I are amazed at some of the things we have read .
In his day people never checked facts : no computers , etc .
When I log on to the Kinnaman Foundation and see how they are trying to get donations for this " research " it really bothers my family and myself .
I hope all of these " theories " will be debunked .
Thanks .

It 's finally here , and even a few minutes early .
Skype for iPhone is now available in the US iTunes store , free of charge .
We 've heard great thing from the folks in Japan who 've been fiddling with it for the last twelve hours , and so far it 's sounding pretty good for us , too , with only minor hiccups .
Not sure if it's a glitch , but despite what we heard earlier , we seem to be able to dial out while on 3G and not over WiFi ( at least running OS 3.0 beta ) .
Hit up the read link for quickest route to the app store page , and let us know what you think .
Betcha wish you could ditch that AT&T voice plan now , huh ?
We 're getting reports the app is crashing for jailbroken iPhones -- and possibly non-jailbroken ones as well .
We just got our first denial when dialing out over 3G via a popup notification , but it only happened once and we were back to old habits one call later .
We did experience a brief period where no sound was coming through , but that might have something to do with using OS 3.0 and was remedied by restarting the phone .
So far , it looks like dialing over 3 G's only working for those with OS 3.0 beta , but unfortunately all of us in that situation are now suffering from frequent crashes and loss of audio .

Cat Shit
One is a new lifelike anime series for Japan that features animals , primarily rabbits in a war zone .
The series from Studio Anima has 12 episodes so far , and is being pitched at “ survival game fans and military fans . ”
As per our now near regular disclaimer on all things Japanese : we are not making this up .
The series is called Cat Shit One , and here ’s the proof :-)
Teams :
Chelsea : Cech ; Bosingwa , Alex , Terry , A Cole ; Ballack , Essien , Anelka , Lampard , Malouda ; Drogba
Subs : Hilario , Ivanovic , Di Santo , Mikel , Kalou , Belletti , Mancienne
Barcelona : Valdez ; Dani Alves , Piquye , Toure , Abidal ; Busquets , Keita , Xavi Hernandez ; Messi , Iniesta , Eto'o
Subs : Pinto , Caceres , Gudjohnsen , Krkic , Sylvinho , Hleb , Rodriguez
Ref : Tom Henning Ovrebo ( Nor )
Sky : Blue tarnished with urban filth
Humidity : 52 % , since you ask
Preamble :
Calling this match is harder than Michael Essien , but one thing is fore sure : it will be a lot closer than last night 's Mancunian mashing of Arsene Wenger 's godzookies .
Chelsea were fluid and cutting in attack at the weekend – even though Frank Lampard could n't wangle his way into Didiier Drogba , Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda 's exchanges , and Fulham 's defence is better than the slapdash one Barca have to field tonight .
Mind you , Chelsea 's offensive verve was offset by defensive sloppiness on Saturday so , despite Thierry Henry 's absence , the chances of Barca scoring an away goal have got to be decent .
My hardly - earned money 's on 3 - 1 to the home team .
And yours ?
Why ?
" Hello from Istanbul ! " booms Phil West .
" I thought Frank was replicating the famous Scream by Edvard Munch .
The photo that was taken a few seconds later showed him with his hands covering his ears .
Having just put the ball in row W , he is trying to shut out the ' screams from nature ' emanating from accountants , wearing Chelsea strip , in their private boxes . "
A magnificently odd fawner writes :
As always I 'm really looking forward to your mbm , which is sure to add a revelatory third dimension to the experience of the game for one and all .
" At the beginning of your piece on the Chelsea v Fulam game you wrote " Sweet dreams are made of this " ... and I thought " Who am I to disagree " ? " chortles Jesualdo Ferreira .
" You did a very nice analysis of the problems and opportunities Chelsea will face against Barca .
I completely agree that the result will hinge on how Drogba , Anelka and Malouda combine .
By the way , did you see that Hiddink is saying this is maybe the last opportunity for some of the old Chelsea players to win the Champo League ?
A sad thought ... but life goes on ... perhaps you are familiar with the old Portuguese folk song which goes ' Love is a retired footballer in an open car ' ? "
7:23 pm : " I predict 2 - 0 Chelsea , " hallos K Brady from Tampa .
" A scrappy first - half goal by Drogba and a second half counter - attack strike by the Incredible Sulk . "
Now hold on , that 's one of the most unfair nicknames in football .
He was burdened with that tag for demanding a move from Arsenal to a Real Madrid as youngster - hardly a diva - esque rider - and he 's folks have n't bothered to remove it since despite much evidence suggesting he 's an affable guy .
I will grant you , however , that his moaning after being asked to take a penalty in last year 's shoot - out was despicable .
A hypothesis : " Against Sevilla Iniesta played as a linkman behind Henry and Eto'o , " builds up someone called Roberticus Sweeney .
" Against Real Madrid he lined up at left central midfield .
Going by the Bernabeu derby , I 'd say Iniesta outside left , Eto'o outside right and Messi as a false centre - forward who drops off , Terry and Alex marking thin air . "
7:25 pm : " 3 - 2 to the home side , simply because there 's no way that Barca wo n't score , but there 's also no way that Barca 's sub -La Liga defending will do well at Stamford Bridge , " guffs James Taylor .
" Their backline would be leaky even by Eredivisie standards . "
7:29 pm : In a prematch interview Hiddink has just suggested that Busquets , not Toure , could play at centreback .
All will be revealed soon ...
7:30 pm : " Did I really just read a Godzooky reference in this column ? " barfs James Colern .
" So I am not the only person in the world who remembers that horrible cartoon from the late 70's ( that I remember it with fondness , does not make it any less horrible of a cartoon ) . "
Godzilla , I submit , was a great cartoon , right up there with Battle of the Planets .
Godzooky ruined it in much the same way as Scrabby Doo ruined his uncle 's show .
7:31 pm : Oh dear
7:33 pm:" Any chance you can let us know who is a booking away from missing the final on either side ? " demands Simon Horwell .
" As I United fan I want to be on the lookout ! "
The men you want cautioned , Simon , are Ballack , Alex , Anelka , Alves and Busquets .
7:35 pm : " King 's Road was lively round 6 pm this evening with loads of fans of both persuasions in full voice , " reports Colm Devine .
" I thought it was ironic to see Chelsea fans clustered round the front of La Rueda ( Spanish restaurant ) , glowering at the hundreds of Barca fans trudging past .
I could stand in my patio and gauge the mood of the match , like I
usually do for Chelsea home games , but I reckon I 'll find out more by
reading your mbm report ( and keep tabs on The Apprentice , too ) . "
Wise choice , Colm .
As it happens , I was down that way myself a couple of hours ago and witnessed the jollity to which you refer .
There also seemed to be dozens of enterprising folks trying to flog tickets .
Are n't Uefa supposed to have stamped that out ?
7:39 pm : Lest we forget .
7:40 pm : Out march the teams , to an unusually loud din at the Bridge , albeit one artifically enhanced by some crummy song over the tannoy .
7:42 pm : " Guus Hiddink famously claimed that South Korea would approach their semi-final with Germany ' like a pack of young dogs ' , " spews Justin Kavanagh .
" My guess is that his efforts to convince his Chelsea old dogs that they could soon be bound for the pound will result in a similar 0 - 1 disappointment ? "
I think we have established , Justin , that there 's no way on Geezer Butler 's earth that Barcelona are going to keep a clean sheet .
1 min : Barcelona , in Watford yellow , set the game in motion .
Early signs are Toure is at centreback , Busquets holding in midfield .
2 mins : Barca were strokign the ball daintily around the middle until Terry crunched into Messi and sent a fine pass through to Drogba .
Aiiee !
The Ivorian 's control betrays him , otehrwise he would have had a clear run on goal !
4 mins : Nifty stuff from Barca as MEssi Eto'o combine well at the edge of the Chelsea box .
Alex brings their fun to a halt with a well - timed tackle and then boots the ball long towards Drogba - that has been Chelsea 's tactic of choice so far .
5 mins : " I suggest Chelsea let Barca score early doors , " moots Tim Buckingham .
" Then they 'll defend that lead , except , well , they can't defend .
When Chelsea score through Terry ( though it might be Alex ) , Barca wo n't be able to amend their game plan to get back up the pitch and Lampard is going to bundle something in with about 15 minutes to go .
You can all go home now , glad to be of help . "
Well , the first part of your forecast could be correct , as Barca have started very brightly and most of the game is being played in the Chelsea half .
Messi just flipped a decent ball across the face of goal but no one was on hand to turn it in .
8 mins : Alves is getting forward to good effect and really tormenting Cole .
Xavi just picked him out with a fizzed crossfield pass , but the Brazilian 's volley flew way off target .
GOAL ! Chelsea 1 - 0 Barcelona ( Essien 9 ' )
9 mins : THAT'S A PHENOMENAL GOAL !
For practically the first time in the game Chelsea strung neat passes together in the opposing half but then Lampard 's attempted chip into the box was hooked out by a defender - no matter , Essien stepped up and enflamed a ridiculous 25 - yard , left - foot volley in off the underside of the bar !
11 mins : Decent riposte by Barcelona , who 've resumed their zippy possession play .
Chelsea , meanwhile , have reverted to launching the ball long to Drogba .
" 52 % humidity ?
Really ? " quibbles an incredulous Danny Stracey .
" At this time of night ?
Where is this game being played exactly , Florida ? "
Hey , do n't bust my chops , Danny , that there is an official Uefa figure , so it must be right .
Oh yes .
13 mins : " While you are by far my favorite of the Guardian MBM'ers , " smarms Marc Howlett , who knows how to get published .
" Your
analysis cannot quite match the magnificence of that goal .
Echoes of
Zidane , 2002 ? "
Considerably better , I reckon .
15 mins : Chelsea catch the visitors on the counter , Cole racing behind Alves down the left and cutting the ball back to Lampard .
From 16 yards he blazes high and wide with his left foot .
17 mins : Chelsea rumbled forward anew , and Malouda has a reasonable long - range effort blocked by Pique before it can trouble Valdes .
" That photo of Lamps reminds me of the 1978 version of ' Invasion of the Body Snatchers ' , " confesses Eliot Crowe .
" That 's a film that gave me some serious nightmares when I were a lad .
See number nine on this top ten list of scary films , if you do n't know what I 'm talking about . "
20 mins :
More pretty embroidery around the box by Barcelona but when it comes to threading through the crucial final ball , they 've goofed .
So far .
But Chelsea would be unwise to bank on that clumsiness continuing .
" So , Lampard , everyone 's favourite deflected goal specialist , is now trying his hand at deflected assists , hurrah ! " exults Paul Carter .
" What next ?
Deflected bread in the toaster ?
Curling off deflected number twos ? "
21 mins : Alves tonks a 25 - yard freekick three metres wide .
23 mins : Lampard hoiks one over the top for Drogba to chase and the Ivorian does just that .
He gets there fractionally before Valdes but the keeper reads his attempt ot lift it over him and whacks the ball clear .
25 mins :
That should be a penalty to Chelsea !
Alves held Malouda back after the Frenchman skinned him but referee reckons - wrongly - that it was just outside the box , so it 's only a freekick , from the left by - line .
Drogab fires it across the face of goal and Valdes scrambles it out for a corner .
Terry soars above Keita to meet Lampard 's delivery and sends his header just wide .
27 mins : Chelsea are denied another penalty !
Abidal tugged Drogba 's shirt as he latched on to another lofted pass from Lampard .
The striker goes down a la Fabregas last night but the ref awards neither a penalty nor a red card .
Lasta night 's official was a goofer who saw fouls where there were only robust challenges , tonight 's men in black is the opposite .
28 mins : Malouda retreats diligently to thwaert Alves after Cole was again caught unawares .
" Much as I hate Chelsea , as all right thinking people must , I can't help having a sneaky hope that they will win this - simply to be able to see what the Spanish press will whine and whinge over this time , " rolicks John Beaven .
" Mr Essien kicking the ball too hard ?
The grass not quite the right shade of green ? "
30 mins : Iniesta curls the ball high and wide from 25 yards .
For all their sweet passing , Barca have yet to force a save from Cech .
31 mins : Alves booked for a fairly inoffensive challenge on Cole .
He 'll miss the final for that , in the unlikely event of Barca getting through .
Absurd .
32 mins : A pause in play as Lampard receives treatment to a bloody lip .
" And the Danny Alves enigma continues , " blurts Loig Thivend .
" Is this guy good , let alone " brilliant " ?
Really ? "
He 's probably good in the run -of - the - mill confines of La Liga .
34 mins : " What do you mean ' in the unlikely event of Barca getting through ? " steams Gareth Douglas .
" They only need one away goal . "
And they might just get such a goal .
But there 's no way they 'll go the rest of this game without conceding at least one more goal .
36 mins : Messi , who has re-appeared after a 20 - minute shopping excursion down the King 's Road , I assume , tries to pick out Eto'o with a cross from the right but Cole gets a touch to it and that 's enough to divert it into Cech 's arms .
38 mins : Messi dodges past Cole with ease that should mortify the Englander , but then wafts in an even more embarrassing attempted cross .
Cech is courteous enough not to laugh as he collects it .
40 mins : Essien aborts a Barca attack by pushing over Alves as the fullback raced towards the danger zone .
I can only assume the ref is infatuated with the Ghanaian following his sublime goal .
There is no other reason for not booking him there .
" This question is the appropriate one , " ahoy - theres Thomas Saylor .
" What will the Spanish press whine about this time ?
Make excuses is more on the mark .
Yes it 's true Barcelona put in six at Real Madrid last week , but let 's face it they have ' earned ' their offensive credentials through maulings of teams like Numancia , Malaga , or Gijon - these and other flotsam from the Primera Division would be lucky to finish mid-table in the Championship .
End of the day : offense sells tickets , defense still wins big matches .
Boo hoo Barca . "
42 mins : Chelsea try to knock the ball around in the Barca half but the visitors ' pressing is frenetic and they eventually force Essien into smashing the ball back to Cech from the half - way line .
a
44 mins : Drogba slips a ball between Alves and Abidal for Anelka to chase , but Abidal gets to it first and taps it back to Valdes to punt .
" I keep hearing that Barcelona are the reincarnation of Brazil 1970 , " but bellows Gary Naylor .
" On the evidence of nearly three halves of football , they are more Middlesbrough 2009 - can't defend and can't make a chance , never mind score a goal .
La Liga must be like the SPL if Barcelona are unstoppable . "
Half - time : Here 's a statement of the obvious : this game is not over .
As already noted , Barcelona are well capable of scoring , assuming , that is , they can figure out how to top off all their neat build - ups by actually creating a shooting opportunity - instead of sending high crosses straight to Terry , Alex or Cech as soon as they get near the box .
Chelsea are content to sit back and try to hit them on the break with long ball for Drogba to chase - not an especially imaginative tactic but meancing nonetheless .
" Here 's my reply to Gary Naylor , " mewls James Tyler .
" Brazil , 1970 they most certainly are not , but they could be in with a shout of Holland ' 74 .
Wonderful team , wonderful organization , scored goals , defended reasonably , tons of hype , yet came completely unstuck against the one and only team they played in that tournament year who was n't afraid of their reputation before the match . "
Never forget , never forgive .
" As an Arsenal fan , I am very concerned for Alex Hleb 's safety now that he is back in big , bad London , " guffaws Jeff Woodman .
" Can you please provide a status on his well - being ? "
He looks as well as ever , the poor lad .
46 mins :
We have go .
There will surely be goals in this period because if Chelsea keep conceding ground and passing sloppily , Barca are eventually going to get things right up front .
Hiddink will surely have ordered his troops to go for a second .
Meanwhile , have a gawk at this
47 mins :
The game has quickly settled into the same pattern as the first half , Barca dominating possession but unable to find any sort of incisiveness in the final third .
Iniesta has jsut thumped the ball miles wide from 20 yards .
" Hey , does Thomas Sawyer think that Stoke , Hull , Sunderland and West Brom would set La Liga on fire , " fumes Ed Rostron .
49 mins : Corner to Barca , in front of the admirably noisy travelling fans .
Essien nuts it clear at the near post .
51 mins : Iniesta fires a fine ball into Keita in the box , but the Malian 's touch let him down and Terry is able to boom the ball clear .
" Chelsea 's style of football is truly horrible , and thoroughly unbefitting of a second successive final , " weeps Nicholas Davies .
" It does n't seem to matter who their manager is - they just turn up with a stick topped by a great steaming pile of dung . "
53 mins :
What a miss !
Malouda scampered down the left and slipped the ball in to Anelka , who teed up Drogba .
The Ivorian 's first touch is poor but he redeems himself by sidestepping the defender ... but the shoots straight at Valdes from 16 yards !
That wasz easier than the chance he wasted at the Nou Camp last week .
55 mins :
Alves dashes down the right and crosses teasingly into the centre , but Bosingwa is alert and wellies the ball up the park .
" Did Guus lock his players in a room with their eyes taped open a la
Clockwork Orange and show the Manchester United - Barcelona tie from
last year on repeat ? " wonders Jonathan Francis .
" I 'm experiencing a strange feeling of deja vu ... and what 's happened to Leo Messi ?
Did he miss the flight to London ? "
56 mins : Lampard finds Drogba with another loft over the top and the striker jostles with Toure before barging into the box and going down under a sliding tackle by his compatriot .
The crowd bay for a penalty but this time the referee is correct not to award one - it was a splendid tackle by Toure .
" Note to Mr. Davies : Barca can't play Madrid and La Liga every game ,
now and again they are compelled to play against proper teams . "
That 's from Michael Aston , in case you were wondering .
And no , I do n't know who he is .
58 mins : Corner to Barcelona .
Xavi passes it straight to Essien , which was nice of him .
61 mins : Barca are beginning to look more threatening but still their crossing and shooting is woeful .
Moments after Alves ballooned an cross into no-mans - land , Messi shanked a shot into the stands .
" I 'm supposed to be studying for a Chinese Masters exam next week , so I 'm watching the football with Chinese commentary ( cos that counts as studying , right ? ) " intones David Batchelor .
" Anyhoo , footballers names in Chinese are often comical .
Lampard= Lan pa de = Orchid Handkerchief Virtue ; Messi = Mei xi = Western Plum .
And , not related to this game , but my old favourite is : Freddie Ljungberg - Yong Bei Ke = Inside the everlasting shellfish . "
63 mins : A break in play for Drogba to get the attention he craves .
His flouncy flop to the ground was , as usual , outrageous .
64 mins : Iniesta collects a long diagonal ball , then scurries in from the left and dinks a neat pass through to Eto'o ... who had n't read it .
66 mins : A lovely little slalom by Messi to eliminate two defenders .
But , yet again , his 25 - yard shot hurtles miles wide .
Barca still have n't had a shot on target .
67 mins : RED CARD FOR ABIDAL Drogba flicked on a long ball , Anelka set off in pursuit and Abidal collided with him , preventing him from entering the box .
Not sure how intentional that was , or even if the contact was sufficient to send Anelka crumpling .
The replay suggested Anelka 's trailing foot connected with Abidal 's accidentally .
Harsh on Abidal .
Still , it 's a freekick just outside the box .
68 mins : Lampard 's freekick trickles wide .
70 mins : Another wonky cross from Alves .
" For the love of Geezer Butler , will someone please tell Barcelona that it sometimes helps if you take a shot ! " strums Nick Wiliamson .
" No chance to over - elaborate is passed up , when all they need to win it is a Lampard - style deflection to go through .
If they fail they will have no one to blame but themselves , and their whinging will be all the more pathetic as a result . "
Well , in fairness , they'd be entitled to whinge about Abidal 's expulsion .
71 mins : A trademark deflected shot from Lampard wrongfoots Valdes , who does well to adjust his position and clasp the ball .
72 mins : Chelsea substitution : Drogba off - and he shakes his head in dismay at that decision - and Belletti on .
So Hiddink removes his most effective weapon and declares his intention to hold on for the 1 - 0 against 10 men ?
It would appear so .
74 mins : Essien booked for clattering into Iniesta .
76 mins : A slightly better cross by Alves is cleared by Ballack at the near post .
Chelsea hurtled forward , until Belletti's cross from the right is cut out .
Chelsea regain possession and Essien picks out Anelka with a cute ball .
But the Frenchman had wandered offside .
78 mins : Terry slips and Messi springs through the heart of Chelsea 's defence .
Alex flicks out his leg to bring him down - and is deservedly booked .
He will miss the final , if Chelsea get there .
With Barca about to take a 25 - yard freekick , that suddenly seems less likely .
But no , Alves smacks the ball over the bar .
Still Barcelona have not mustered a shot on target .
79 mins : Anelka races into the box again , and again goes down under a challenge .
This time it was from Toure , and it was immaculate .
" The red card was completely justified , " hollers Igor Bratic .
" Abidal went in hard enough that , somehow , Drogba was hurt in the collision as well and had to come off . "
81 mins :
The ball bounces around the edge of the Chelsea area until Pique tries to send it goalward .
And fails .
82 mins : Another Chelsea shout for a penalty .
The ball blatantly hit Pique 's hand after Anelka tried to scoop it over him .
Another bad decision by the ref .
The officials in the two semi-finals have been absolutely awful .
83 mins : Lampard wins a corner for Chelsea .
Malouda 's outswinger is cleared by Pique .
85 mins : Barca attempt to pick their way through Chelsea 's massed defecne again , but are thwarted when Iniesta strays offside .
" I 'm sure MBM readers are n't lawbreakers ( and if they are , they are n't idiots ) but just in case , I 'd like to point out that some enterprising nerd has posted Essien 's goal on a well known video sharing website , " reveals civic - minded Jack Lee .
" Yes , it really is good . "
85 mins : Barceloan change : Bojan on , Busquets off .
" Surely Barcelona should consider introducing Lionel Messi at some stage , " quips Michael Aston .
87 mins : Lampard 's reverse pass is just behind Essien , who has to adjust his run before shooting , and that gives Pique enough time to get across and block the shot .
88 mins : Now that really was world class from Messi !
A textbook theatrical fall on the edge of the Chelsea area .
The ref , surprisingly , does n't award a freekick .
89 mins : Cole intercepts a Messi pass on the rim of the Chelsea area .
Barceloan retrieve and work it wide to Alves , whose cross , YET AGAIN , sails off into the London night .
90 mins :
There will be at least four more mintues .
And on that note , Eto'o cops a booking for taking down Lampard .
" Barca are pants , " spurts Tom Rooney .
" The ref is pantser . "
90+1 mins : A mistake by Keita lets Belletti in , but as Toure comes across to tackle , the former Barcelona man miscues his shot .
GOAL ! Chelsea 1 - 1 Barcelona ( Iniesta 90+3 ' )
90+3 mins : Alves delivered his first decent cross of the night .
Terry got his head to it but could n't send further than a Barcelona player , and got no help from Essien , who swiped at fresh air .
It 's worked to Iniesta at the edge of the box and he fires a wonderful shot into the top corner !
90+4 mins : Chelsea wallop the ball forward .
Alex wins a corner , Lampard comes across to take it .
Cech gets his head to it .. . but knocks it backwards to Ballack , whose shot is fired straight at Keita , who beats it away with his arms !
No penalty says the strange referee , who then books Ballack for his outraged protests .
90+5 mins : Barcelona changes : Iniesta and Eto'o off , Gudjohnsen and Sylvinho on .
Full - time Terry leads a Chelsea charge over to the ref , who was disgraceful .
But that should n't deflect attention from the fact that tactical genius Guss Hiddink 's masterplan was to take off his most effective striker , and replace him with a defensive midfielder , against 10 men .
Barca 's scored with their only shot on target ; the final will probably be more entertaining than a United - Chelsea one would have been .
The far more clinical United have got to be favourites .
Meanwhile , Drogba is booked for arguing with the ref as the inept Norwegian tries to make his way off the pitch .
" It 's a fucking disgrace " shouts Drogba into the camera .
Mind you , it would n't have come to this if he had n't missed a superb chance just before his substitution .
You know what : I 'm going to stick around to bring you any post - match interviews .
They promise to be quite amusing .
Anyone still with me ?
9:46 pm : In Sky 's studio , Jamies Redknapp is echoing Andy Gray 's gripes throughout the match , viz : that for a match of this magnitude it is crazy to appoint a referee from a backwater such as Norway .
That is jingoistic crud , in my view .
How good was England 's Graham Poll at the last World Cup ?
And did n't Howard Webb have a shocker in Europe the other weeK ?
And was n't last night 's clown Italian ?
9:48 pm : " I honestly thought Ballack was going to deck the referee there ! " gusges Niall Caldwell .
" Now THAT would have been entertaining . "
Indeed .
9:50 pm : " Chelsea arrogance poured through the mbm emails and ultimately Chelsea 's performance , scoffs Dave .
" Look who 's whinging now . "
Funnily enough , I 'd say their performacne was n't arrogant enough : it was meek .
9:52 pm : " That was truly incredible , " stammers Steven Beijer .
" uefa must be pleased that the referee 's off decision averted anothger all - English final .
Hmm ... "
9:54 pm : Lots of incredulous fury in the Sky studio , where Messers Redknapp and Souness can't believe that Chelsea did n't have at least three ... no , make that four ... penalties .
" I could n't be any happier with the result , even if it was a complete travesty , " sermonises Zachary Taylor .
" By the way , you want to learn a thing or two about divine justice , read the Book of Job .
Good guy sits on dung heap contemplating dead sheep and children , all because the big fellas are conducting a little experiment .
That tale should put things in perspective for the outraged Chelsea fans . "
9:56 pm : The first post - match interview : " At one point in the game it was really hard when we had 10 men and they were attacking .
But finally in the last minute we scord a goal and I have no words to describe how happy the team is at this moment . " drones a remarkably sober Gerard Pique .
In fairness to the former Manchester United defender , he admitted the ball hit his hand in the box when Anelka tried to knock it past him and that the ref was wrong not to award a penalty .
Anyone else think that admission could make Chelsea 's interviews even more entertaining ?
10 pm : " Here 's some news from the backwater ! " announces Frode Arnesen .
" On Norwegian TV they are giving the ref stick too , especially for those two handball - no - penalties ! "
10:02 pm : " Should n't Ballack and - particularly - Drogba be more severely punished for their protests ? " lectures Stuart Chapman .
" No matter how hard done by they are , no matter how inept the referee , his decision is final .
Drogba is the disgrace ! "
That was just one of approximately 1064858952952025 emails to that effect .
And you can bet Uefa will indeed impose a stiffer penalty , particularly if , as one David Williams claims , Drogba made some angry allegations to French TV just now .
10:05 pm : " On 5 Live Tim Lovejoy sounds like he has been shot , " whoops Chris Murray .
So he 's totally silent then ?
10:08 pm : " I switched on 20 minutes from the end and heard a commentator say " ... has been sent off , " dribbles Alex Sharkey .
" For the next five minutes I sat admiring Chelsea 's resolve in defending with only ten men , before realizing it was the attacking team who were a man down .
So let 's put an end to all that " Barca did n't deserve it " nonsense right now . "
It 's fair point , folks .
10:10 pm : I am shocked and outraged that no Chelsea player has yet come to share his views .
Or is it just that Sky have n't been able to find one who wo n't spit swear words into their precious camera ?
10:13 pm : " Shocking refereeing but what a contrast between the mob hysterics of Terry , Ballack , Drogba & Co and poor Darren Fletcher 's reaction yesterday , " observes Rupert Maitland .
" He was dignity personified .
After an excellent personal performance and what looked like a half - decent tackle , his sense of injustice must have been even greater - and he had to take it completely on his own .
What a star .
Thanks for the brilliant mbm .
Are you doing the final ? "
C'mon , do you really think we plan these thigns that far ahead ?
HERE'S GUUS HIDDINK : " We are so disappointed .
There are two issues .
WE could have and should have sacored in some open sitautions .
Of course we talk a lot about the not - given penalties .
There was the shirt - pulling on Didier ...
Ok , we had the Henry - situation in Barcelona but we had three others here .
I wo n't say what the boys feel ...
OK , they feel it was an injustice .
Hiddink on the penalty decisions : " If you have seen clearly the one ball on Pique , on a reflex the arm is going up .
If he is blocked by not seeing it , then there is also an assistant referee ...
On suggestions that some influential people did n't want an all - English final :
You can never prove this .
It 's just ... out of emotion .
Five or six situations - not just one - the Malouda situation ... he was grabbed inside the box .
It 's not just one doubtful situation as the Henry situation was in Barcelona , it 's three , four .
But we should have scored ourselves , whether some people do n't want an all - English final again .
On the reaction of the Chelsea players at the end : I can fully understand in the emotion of the game .
As long as they do n't touch him .
It 's not just one decision in doubt , it 's several not - made decisions .
I protect my players on this .
Thanks for tuning in .
And for your very many emails , some of which were good .
Please call again .
Bye .

s for sine
c for cosine
a for arctangent ( in radians )
Space to separate numbers in an array
i for a range of numbers ( APL iota , but zero - based )
@ to explode an array onto the stack
, to combine the top two stack items
?+ for an array sum , ?* for product
You can compute most common functions this way .
log base 10 is " L10L / " , sin of degrees is " 1A4*180 / * S " , cube root is " L3/E " or " 3r^ " .
I used techniques like this to find that 1 /(( arctan (.5 / ( exp ( ( ln ( 1 - (.5 ^ 2 ) ) ) / 2 ) ) ) ) / ( ( arctan 1 ) * 4 ) ) is 6 , which was sort of what I was hoping — I managed to take the arcsine of 0.5 .
For a good time , try " 40 " , Enter , Enter , " i " , Tab , " /1a4*4**s2 ^ " .
To compute 10 ! , try " 10i1 + ? * " .
To evaluate 3x3 - 1.5x2 + x - 3 at x=5 , try " 3_1,1.5_,3,4i5 " , Tab , " ^*?+ " .
To numerically integrate sin( sin(x ) ) from 0 to 1 with 20 points , try " 20i20/ss20 / ?+ " .
( The results are n't very good with 20 points . )

The 60th anniversary of the Federal Republic has helped renew German pride .
By Steve Rosenberg
BBC News , Berlin
Forty years ago , the President of the Federal Republic of Germany ( then West Germany ) Gustav Heinemann was asked if he loved his country .
" I do not love the state , " President Heinemann replied .
" I love my wife . "
It was a sign of how reluctant Germans were back then ( even the country 's president ) to display patriotism .
Memories of World War II and the horrors inflicted by the Nazis were still fresh .
Germany felt a collective responsibility for what had happened .
German pride was something which needed to be kept under wraps .
Times have changed .
Today Germany celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Federal Republic , which rose out of the ashes of the Third Reich .
Thousands came to the Brandenburg Gate for Germany 's birthday party .
There were big celebrations in Berlin with concerts and fairs .
The city was awash with German flags .
" We have accomplished a lot , " the country 's President , Horst Koehler , told parliament on the eve of the celebrations .
" We can be proud of what we have achieved . "
Germany has achieved a great deal .
After the war , the country lay in ruins , defeated and divided between the victors of World War II .
But as the Cold War blew in , the Western powers - Britain , France and America - backed the establishment of a new German state , in the zones they controlled .
The Federal Republic of Germany would be a democracy .
It would respect human rights .
A new constitution , the Basic Law , would help transplant democracy into soil tainted by the Nazis , transforming this Germany into a reliable ally of the West .
Worst recession Very quickly the Federal Republic became a success story .
There was the economic miracle of the 1950s which saw the country rebuilt and prosper .
It became a dynamo for European integration - and , eventually , a vehicle for German reunification .
After the fall of the Berlin Wall , communist East Germany became part of the Federal Republic .
There have been problems along the way , too .
In the 1970s terror groups targeted the state , assassinating judges and industrialists , in protest at the Establishment 's Nazi past .
Reunification brought an enormous financial burden .
And there is economic hardship today , as Germany suffers its worst recession since the war .
No passers - by could fail to notice the exact age of the Federal Republic .
Despite the difficulties , in recent years Germans have felt more able to express their love of their country .
It was evident during the 2006 World Cup in Germany , when fans painted German flags on their faces .
A recent survey by the Identity Foundation discovered that more than 70 % of people believe they should show more confidence about being German .
More than 60 % said they were proud to be German .
At the Brandenburg Gate , the centrepiece of Sunday 's celebrations , I noticed a giant queue snaking round the square .
I wondered what everyone was standing in line for .
Then I saw .
Someone was handing out German flags to wave , and carrier bags decorated with another German flag .
National pride was in big demand .

Breaking down the agreement
Help us analyze the county 's agreement for the Medical Mart by joining our collaborative reporting project using Diigo .
See the graphic below for instructions on how to access the agreement and share your thoughts .
The long - awaited deal for the proposed $ 425 million medical mart and convention center ensures that Cuyahoga County taxpayers can track every penny of the public 's money spent on design and construction .
That guarantee of public accountability -- all construction and design bills will be public records -- is just one provision in a 48 - page contract that commissioners expect to sign next week with Chicago - based Merchandise Mart Properties Inc .
The contract , called a development agreement , lays out how the public 's money will be spent .
In all , about $ 900 million will go toward the project , including interest payments on construction loans .
Commissioners , following an agreement reached two weeks ago with The Plain Dealer , released a draft of the contract on Wednesday , giving the public a week to review it before they vote on it .
The newspaper had threatened to sue the county to obtain the contract because commissioners had been conducting negotiations in private .
MMPI is expected to sign the agreement today .
The deal is n't final until commissioners sign it after voting to approve the deal .
Fred Nance , who negotiated the agreement for the county , said on Wednesday that " every penny that is spent is subject to public record . "
Among other highlights of the deal :
• MMPI pays no real property tax on the land it will control .
It is unclear whether the county will owe any .
• Specific deadlines are in place that could lead to groundbreaking by fall 2010 .
• Either partner has multiple chances to back out of the deal before ground is broken .
• Commissioners are forced to decide soon where to build the complex .
They prefer to rebuild on the existing Cleveland Convention Center site .
• The county will not pay construction cost overruns .
MMPI 's general construction contractor will be required to cover those .
" I think under the circumstances , we negotiated as good a deal for the taxpayers as possible , " said Commissioner Peter Lawson Jones , who sat in on many negotiating sessions with MMPI .
Yet , Jones said , " MMPI can secure a handsome profit if this is successful . "
That is because taxpayers , not MMPI , will pay for construction of the complex .
MMPI will be paid millions annually by the county to help pay operational costs , and the company is entitled to all revenues resulting from operating the mart and convention center .
The medical mart complex is viewed by many people as a way to bolster the region 's staggering economy .
Mark Chupp , assistant professor of community development at Case Western Reserve University 's Mandel School of Applied Social Science , said further public oversight of the project is needed .
Chupp likes the requirements for county approval at each planning step , but said there should be a public hearing at each of the stages .
He also suggested a public oversight board akin to the Cleveland school district 's Bond Accountability Commission to watchdog spending .
" Given the state of our commissioners and their standing in the community , it seems you need to have some other public voice , " Chupp said .

Commissioner Tim Hagan , a driving force behind the project , recently defended his close relationship with MMPI President Chris Kennedy .
Commissioner Jimmy Dimora is a target of a federal investigation into county corruption .
Hagan and Dimora voted to raise the sales tax a quarter of a cent , to 7.75 percent , in 2007 to pay for the project .
Jones , the third commissioner , voted against it .
The hike , expected to generate about $ 40 million annually , expires in October 2027 .
The 20 - year life of the tax increase is the basis for the county 's payments to MMPI , even though that money , by law , cannot pay off bonds issued for economic development .
Instead , the county will pay for the project using money from other accounts , and replenish those funds with the sales tax money .
The county will borrow money next year for construction .
Proceeds from the loan -- up to $ 425 million -- will be transferred to MMPI .
The county will pay MMPI $ 40 million a year for each year until 2027 .
MMPI will use $ 36 million of that money to pay back the loan .
The company can use the remaining $ 4 million each year for its own purposes .
The county will make " supplemental " payments to MMPI each year to subsidize day - to - day operations of the convention center .
That payment starts at $ 6 million a year and could escalate to $ 7.8 million a year .
The county has not determined where that money will come from .
Before construction begins , MMPI is required to sign up 10 makers of medical equipment to lease space in the medical mart for at least three years .
MMPI also must arrange for five medically themed trade shows within the first year of operation .
Still to come are operating , lease and financing agreements .
The deal does not mention meeting city of Cleveland goals for hiring local businesses , as well as those owned by minorities and women .
If you would like to install solar panels , but do n’t like the aesthetic appearance of conventional , or older style solar panels then a great alternative might be solar roof tiles .
Also known as solar roof shingles , solar tiles look just like normal black roof tiles .
The difference is they are covered with a thin film photovoltaic ( PV ) material which generates electricity .
Solar tile systems can incorporate traditional roofing materials such as slate , asphalt , metal , and fiber - cement with the solar tiles .
In this way , the appearance is not much different from a regular roof , which makes it aesthetically pleasing .
Most solar tiles are generally a dark bluish - purple in color , which makes them suitable for most homes .
Many types are even compliant with areas that have strict rules regarding historic preservation of local buildings .
Even though one tile by itself does n’t produce much of power ( usually between 50 and 200 watts , or about enough to power a small window fan ) covering an entire roof can be quite substantial .
In fact , an entire roof covered with solar tiles can easily generate enough power for your entire home .
However , you still will need to maintain ties to the local power company since even the sunniest climates have cloudy days , which limits how much power the tiles can actually generate .
Still , the savings in power costs should be huge over a period of time .
The benefits of solar roof tiles over regular solar panels are :
Aesthetics – solar tiles are virtually invisible , as part of your roof .
No extra planning – no need to alter roof lines , colour or pitch .
Solar tiles and slates sit flush with conventional roof tiles .
Reliability – The average lifetime of Solar Roof Tiles is in excess of 20 years .
There are no moving parts to the system and very little maintenance is necessary .
Solar Roof
Tiles usually have a self locking fixing system that allows the glass laminate to be easily removed for inspection , cleaning or replacement .
Standard installation – tiles and slates fit with conventional roofing practice without the need to adjust battens .
One solar tile takes the place of four standard tiles .
No specialist skills – depending on the type of system that you purchase , all the roofing work can be carried out by the roofing contractor allowing electrical and plumbing work to follow build programme .
This is an excellent time to go solar powered .
There are many excellent state and federal tax incentives ( up to 80 % of the cost ) and dealers looking to sell their product in the down economy .
You can increase the value of your home , reduce dependance on the electricity grid and save on utility bills all in one go .

Rembrandt , the second - largest impact basin on Mercury , was discovered during the Messenger spacecraft ’s second flyby in October 2008 .
Researchers are now puzzling over features found near its centre ( pictured ) , which show a spoke - like pattern of ridges and troughs that is reportedly unlike anything else in the solar system ( Image : NASA / JHUAPL / Smithsonian / Carnegie Institution of Washington )
A bizarre spoke - like pattern of troughs and ridges has been found on the surface of Mercury by NASA ’s Messenger spacecraft .
The feature is unlike any to be found in basins on Mercury or elsewhere in the solar system .
The feature sits in the Rembrandt impact basin , the second - largest impact scar on the planet .
The basin was discovered during Messenger ’s second flyby of the planet on 6 October 2008 , a manoeuvre that allowed the probe to photograph 30 % of the planet ’s surface not previously seen by spacecraft .
By examining the craters that formed on top of it , researchers estimate that Rembrandt formed in an impact some 3.9 billion years ago , near the end of a barrage of impacts in the inner solar system known as the Late Heavy Bombardment .

The impact that created Rembrandt also fractured the crust beneath it , allowing magma to flow to the surface and partly fill the 700 - kilometre - wide basin .
But researchers cannot yet explain some of the features etched in that volcanic material : a spoke - like pattern of troughs and ridges emanating from the centre of the basin .
Side by side
The pattern is even stranger than a mysterious spider - shaped pattern of troughs found in Mercury ’s Caloris basin , during Messenger ’s first Mercury flyby in January 2008 , says team member Thomas Watters of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , DC .
Troughs and ridges , which are thought to form through very different processes , are not expected to be found lying side by side .
So - called “ wrinkle ridges ” are caused when the crust compresses , while troughs are formed when it is stretched , causing the surface to separate .
‘ So bizarre ’
“ What ’s so bizarre is these features are sitting beside each other .
We ’ve never seen anything like that – not in Caloris , not anywhere , ” Watters told New Scientist .
Models cannot yet explain how this feature might have formed , Watters says .
Multiple episodes of volcanic material bubbling up from below may be needed to explain the features .
A 1000 - kilometre - long cliff , or scarp , though to be formed as Mercury ’s surface contracted , was found , cutting across the rim and floor of the Rembrandt basin .
It is the longest such scarp to be discovered on Mercury .
Messenger will make one last flyby of the planet on 29 September before entering into orbit around Mercury on 18 March 2011 , where it is expected to operate for at least one year .

A woman who lives with chronic pain said to my mom the other day , “ You ca n’t sit around and wait for the storm to be over .
You ’ve got to learn how to dance in the rain . ”
That ’s a perfect description of living with depression , or any chronic illness .
But what do you do on the days you do n’t think you can take the pain anymore ?
When you want so badly to be done with your life … or at least be done with the suffering ?
What do you do when anxiety and depression have spun a web around you so thick that you ’re convinced you ’ll be trapped forever in those feelings ?
I ’ve compiled a few tools for moving past that harrowing darkness , suggestions on how to emerge from a place of panic , and techniques on how to dance in the rain .
1. Escape from the pain .
Lately , when my thoughts turn dark , I ’ve been telling myself that I do n’t want another life … I want a reprieve from the pain .
I ’m usually at a loss on how to get there .
I ’m tired , frustrated , desperate , so my thoughts follow the path that has already been blazed throughout the years … and I fantasize about intoxication or some other destructive behavior that does n’t require a lot of imagination .
How else can I escape … in a positive way ?
Instead of romanticizing about death or inebriation from booze , I can research new kayaking routes , bike paths , hiking trails , and camping sites .
I can invest the time I lose in unproductive and dangerous thoughts into planning creative outings for myself and for the family that will give me / us the reprieve that I ’m craving .
I can be proactive about finding sitters for the kids so that my thoughts wo n’t revert back to “ stinking thinking . ”
2. Track your mood .
An essential piece of my recovery is keeping a mood journal .
This helps me to identify certain patterns that emerge .
As I said in my “ Me on the Bad Days ” post , depression can flare up seemingly out of the blue , like a thunderstorm .
But often there are telltale signs that can clue me in as to why I ’m feeling so fragile .
You can catch these if you ’ve been recording your mood over time .
3 . Talk about it .
I ca n’t get a therapy appointment round the clock , so I had better invest in some friends that wo n’t tire of me telling them that my thoughts are turning to mush again .
Over the weekend I called two friends and my mom .
“ I ’m going there again , ” I explained .
They know what THERE means … without my having to explain or justify .
I do n’t fully understand how gabbing heals , the scientific explanation of why venting does so much good , but I can surely attest to it , and confirm the connection between talking about something and feeling better .
It ’s like you ’re a scared little kid in a lightning storm , and a neighbor , seeing that you ’re locked out of your house , invites you inside and makes a cup of hot chocolate for you .
Well , maybe it ’s not that good , but it ’s close , which is why our phone bill is way up this month .
4. Repeat : “ I WILL Get Better ” !
As I said in my video , “ I WILL Get Better , ” I think about my Aunt Gigi every time I wind up in the depression tunnel , and remember her repeating to me over the phone a few years back : “ You will get better .
Repeat that .
You WILL get better . ”
Peter J. Steincrohn , M.D. , author of “ How to Stop Killing Yourself ” wrote : “ Faith is a powerful antidote against illness .
Keep repeating – and believing : I WILL get well .
If you believe , you help your doctor and yourself . ”
And this paragraph from William Styron ’s “ Darkness Visible ” always reassures me :
If depression had no termination , then suicide would , indeed , be the only remedy .
But one need not sound the false or inspirational note to stress the truth that depression is not the soul ’s annihilation ; men and women who have recovered from the disease–and they are countless –bear witness to what is probably its only saving grace : it is conquerable .
5 . Take baby steps … a day at a time .
On mornings that I wake up with that nauseating knot of anxiety in my stomach , everything seems overwhelming .
Getting myself to the bathroom so that I can brush my teeth feels seems like a triathlon in August .
So I do n’t attempt the triathlon .
I only have to worry about getting my left foot down on the ground .
And then my right one .
And then I have to stand .
I ’ll look at my to - do list and cross off two - thirds of it .
“ What on this list do I absolutely HAVE to do ? ” I say so myself .
Everything else can wait .
And then I start with the first thing , and do the first mini-movement that I need to do in order to accomplish that .
If it ’s getting Katherine dressed , that means 1 . Finding Katherine .
( That ’s harder than it sounds . )
2 . Picking out an outfit . ( Ditto . )
3 . Helping her out of her nightgown and into her clothes .
( That ’s where my nervous system almost shuts down . )
And so on .
Each item on the list can be broken down into a dozen mini-steps .
6. Distract yourself .
Some days I ’m just not worth much .
All I can do is distract myself … to keep myself from thinking about how awful I feel .
Just like Fr. Joe carved figurines out of soap when he was depressed , and Priscilla made jewelry to keep her mind off of her anxiety , I will try to do anything to keep my brain occupied and away from my hurt , sort of like I did when I was in labor : baking chocolate - chip cookies , looking through old pictures , listening to Beethoven and Mozart , watching a comedy , swimming , running , biking , or hiking through the woods .
( I did n’t do all of that in labor , though . )
7 . Get out your self - esteem file .
For the past few days I ’ve been carrying around letters from my self - esteem file in my pocket like a baby blanket .
Some people have told me that my self - esteem must be shallow if I have to rely on praise from other people .
Maybe it is .
But I have to start somewhere , and anyone who has sat in that panic place where you want to end it all , knows that it ’s virtually impossible at that time to come up with a list of your own strengths .
So you have to believe what other people say .

7 Ways To Keep Going
The Great Income Tax Hoax
Welcome to the Net - based copy of 16 chapters of Irwin Schiff 's masterpiece on the US " Income Tax " !
Laws are the whitewash that governments use to disguise the ugly fact that they steal money from productive people , then use it to control how they live their lives .
Being merely one - sided contracts , laws have no moral validity whatsoever ; but eight generations of government schooling have conned Americans into supposing that they are magic , to be held in respect and awe .
Accordingly , if there is a tax law , most people tend to obey it .
In this masterpiece , perhaps the most important book he ever wrote , Irwin Schiff shows that there is no such thing ; how even that veneer of respectability falls off the " income tax " when its origins are systematically probed .
Chapters 17 and 18 are omitted , for they have been superseded by all of the extensive , legal avoidance techniques that he has developed since completing the book in 1985 and which can be downloaded from his web site .
Also omitted for brevity 's sake are the extensive Appendices .
Each page of the book is accessible through this Home or Index page as below , just as one might access the pages of the physical book .
Each ( except this one ) consists of an .htm " frame " and a .gif image that was scanned for the purpose ; the reader is welcome to save any page on his own PC but to do so , both those files need to be downloaded to the same subdirectory .
However the book can be read on - line , turning the pages just as one would in an armchair - each takes a few seconds to download .
For one 's first read , it 's best to start at the beginning and proceed in sequence .
At the foot of each page are links to the one previous , the one following , and to this index ( " any page " . )

Throughout the long history of the Afghan War , the United States has never accused the Taliban of using white phosphorus weapons -- until now .
Suddenly , after the emergence of glaring evidence of Afghan civilians being seared and maimed by these chemical weapons following American airstrikes and combat operations , the Pentagon has released " classified information " claiming that the Taliban have actually been using white phosphorus weapons for six years , since 2003 : a practice that the Pentagon -- which has been using white phosphorus weapons in Afghanistan since 2002 if not before -- denounced as " reprehensible . "
This is very curious .
The bipartistan managers of the Terror War have always been eager to trumpet -- even exaggerate -- the atrocities committed by the various armed groups opposing the imposition of foreign troops in Afghanistan .
But now we are to believe that the Pentagon has been keeping evidence of the Taliban 's chemical weapons use -- chem weapons !
WMDs ! -- under wraps for years .
The " classified intelligence " was released in friendly territory : The Times ( UK ) , owned by Fox News ' own Rupert Murdoch .
( By the way , is n't it strange that super - duper top - secret material which would threaten the very existence of the United States and its way of life if it were divulged to , say , lawyers for torture victims or members of the public who 've been illegally spied upon , can always be released when there are PR gains to be made ?
Why , it almost makes you think that Arthur Silber might be right when he tell us that " the ' secret ' knowledge , which goes by the viciously misnamed designation ' intelligence ' ... is almost always wrong ... and is primarily used as propaganda , to provide alleged justification to a public that still remains disturbingly gullible and pliable -- and it is used after the fact , to justify decisions that have already been made . "
Could that really be true ?
Would they really , you know , just lie and exaggerate and make things up ?
Perhaps we could ask the brand - new commander whom Obama has appointed in Afghanistan : Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the Special Ops honcho who ran covert ops and commandos in Iraq ( see " Ulster on the Euphrates " for more on such activities on " the dark side , if you will " ) , and later signed off on the shameful concoction of the " heroic death in battle " of the war - questioning , Chomsky - reading Pat Tillman , who was in fact killed by his own men . )
In any case , Murdoch 's minions in The Times dish up the murky Pentagon stew with nary a leavening of skeptical salt .
While stovepiping assertions of " hundreds " of Western soldiers and Afghan civilians burned by the Taliban 's Willy Pete ( again , glaring war crimes that the Americans have mysteriously failed to highlight over the years ) ,
The Times does not fail to push the new " get Pakistan " line as well .
After first noting that much of the alleged Taliban WP seems to have been leftovers from the mountains of ordnance dumped in the country during decades of war , some of the rounds are , we 're told , " newer models which , it is suspected , had been smuggled across the border from Pakistan . "
Straight from those halal - eating surrender monkeys in Islamabad , I 'll bet !
We need to go in there and clean that nest of vipers out !
What 's more , the Pentagon is now trying to claim that the mass slaughter of more than 140 civilians last week -- killed after a sustained bombing raid destroyed a compound where children , women and old men were sheltering from a battle miles away -- was really the Taliban 's fault .
How can that be , when officials of the U.S. - backed Afghan government , the International Red Cross and eyewitnesses on the ground all say that the compound , and three surrounding villages , were pulverized by a raid lasting several hours ?
Why , the discovery that some survivors were also by white phosphorus proves it !
Because although the Pentagon routinely uses white phosphorus all over the country , it did n't use it on the day of the slaughter !
And how do we know this ?
Because ... the Pentagon said so !
Case closed !
Just as it was when General McChrystal signed off on Tillman 's medal for his heroic death in battle , despite knowing the truth about the " friendly fire " killing .
I hold no brief for the Taliban -- or rather , for the collection of various armed groups battling the occupation , when they are not battling each other or creating their own brand of " collateral damage . "
I 'm sure if they got hold of some white phosphorus , they 'd use it .
Why should they , in their small - scale way , be any more moral or humane than the full - blown , world - straddling war machine of the American empire ?
For those who turn to violence , who make blood their argument , there are rarely any restraints .
But it remains extremely puzzling -- not to say unbelievable -- that the Americans would simply sit on all this " hard evidence " of chemical weapon atrocities by their relentlessly demonized enemies , for years on end , without ever saying a word .
Whatever the provenance of this " secret knowledge , " it was in fact the glaring evidence of the occupation forces ' own " reprehensible " activities that has panicked the Pentagon into these " revelations . "
Yet even this is a curious defense ; it essentially boils down to saying : " Hey , we are n't the only ones who burn people with chemical weapons and kill civilians !
The Taliban does it too ! "
What a worthy stance , eh ?
But such is the moral level of this very dirty war -- a war which is about to get even dirtier , as the new appointment by Obama and his Bush carryover , Robert Gates , clearly shows .
The Hubble Space Telescope took a closer look at this triple galaxy group on April 1 and 2 after 140,000 people around the world voted on six potential targets .
The areas have previously only been photographed by ground - based telescopes .
The Arp 274 galaxy group won the competition with more than 67,000 votes .
Hubble 's image suggests the galaxies may not be close enough together to interact as they appear to be in the image taken by the Palomar Observatory near San Diego .
The galaxies to the right and left show blueish lights , evidence of rapid star formation .
Older stars are more yellow .
The group is located in the constellation Virgo , 400 million light years away from Earth .
The two bright stars at the right of the image are actually located in our own galaxy .
NASA held the contest as part of the International Year of Astronomy in celebration of the 400th anniversary of the telescope .

72 - Mbit QDR™II SRAM Delivers World ’s Fastest Operating Speed of 550 MHz ;
Dramatically Expands the Performance of Networking and Signal Processing Applications
SAN JOSE , Calif. , April 27 , 2009 – Cypress Semiconductor Corp. ( NYSE : CY ) , an industry leader in SRAMs , today announced it is sampling the industry ’s first Quad Data Rate™ ( QDR ™ ) and Double Data Rate ( DDR ) SRAM devices on 65 - nm linewidth .
The new 72 - Mbit QDRII , QDRII , DDRII and DDRII memories leverage process technology developed with foundry partner UMC .
The new SRAMs feature the market ’s fastest available clock speed of 550 MHz and a total data rate of 80 Gbps in a 36 - bit I/O width QDRII device , using half the power of 90 - nm SRAMs .
They are ideal for networking applications , including Internet core and edge routers , fixed and modular Ethernet switches , 3G base stations and secure routers , and also enhance the performance of medical imaging and military signal processing systems .
The devices are pin compatible with 90 - nm SRAMs , enabling networking customers to increase performance and port density while maintaining the same board layout .
Compared with their 90 - nm predecessors , the 65 - nm QDR and DDR SRAMs lower input and output capacitance by 60 percent .
The QDRII and DDRII devices have On - Die Termination ( ODT ) , which improves signal integrity , reduces system cost and saves board space by eliminating external termination resistors .
The 65 - nm devices use a Phase Locked Loop ( PLL ) instead of a Delay Locked Loop ( DLL ) , which enables a 35 percent wider data valid window to reduce development time and cost for the customer .
“ We continue to expand our Synchronous SRAM portfolio to broaden our target markets and grow market share , ” said Dana Nazarian , Executive Vice President of the Memory and Imaging Division at Cypress .
“ Cypress is committed to supporting the SRAM market long - term and building on our leadership position . ”
Availability and Photo
The 65 - nm QDRII , QDRII , DDRII and DDRII SRAMs are all currently sampling , with production expected in Q3 2009 .
Each device is available in multiple configurations based on I/O width ( x18 or x36 ) , burst length ( B4 or B2 ) and latency ( 1.5 , 2.0 or 2.5 ) .
The 65 - nm 72 - Mbit SRAMs are available in a standard 165 - pin Fine - pitch Ball Grid Array ( FBGA ) package and are pin-compatible with existing 90 - nm QDR and DDR devices for easy migration .

And the salutations and regards of Allah to his prophets , from Noah to Abraham , Moses , Jesus Christ , and his last prophet Mohammed .
Peace be upon them all who are the harbingers of monotheism , fraternity , love , human dignity , and justice .
Mr. Chairman .
Honorable Secretary General of the United Nations .
Madam High Commissioner .
Ladies and Gentleman .
We have gathered here in the follow up to the Durban conference against racism and racial discrimination to work out practical mechanisms for our holy and humanitarian campaigns .
Over the last centuries , humanity has gone through tremendous suffering and pain .
In the middle ages , thinkers and scientists were sentenced to death .
It was then followed by a period of slavery and slave trade , when innocent people in millions were captivated and separated from their families and loved ones , to be taken to Europe and America under worse conditions ; the dark period that also experienced occupations , lootings , and massacres of innocent people .
Many years passed by before nations rose up and fought for their liberty and freedom , and they paid a high price .
They lost millions of lives to expel the occupiers and proclaim their independence .
However , it did not take long that the coercive powers imposed two wars in Europe which also plagued a part of Asia and Africa .
Those horrific wars claimed about 100 million lives and left behind massive devastation .
Had lessons been learned from the occupations , horrors , and crimes of those wars , there would have been a ray of hope for the future .
The victorious powers called themselves the conquerors of the world while ignoring or downtreading the rights of other nations by the imposition of oppressive laws and international arrangements .
Ladies and gentlemen , let us take a look at the U.N. Security Council , which is one of the legacies of World War II and World War I .
What was the logic behind their granting themselves the veto rights ?
How can such a logic comply with humanitarian or spiritual values ?
Could it be in conformity with the recognized principles of justice , equality before law , love , and human dignity ?
[ Applause ]
Or rather , with discrimination , injustice , violation of human rights , or humiliation of the majority of nations and countries ?
That Council is the highest decision - making world body for safeguarding the international peace and security .
How can we expect the realization of justice and peace when discrimination is legalized and the origin of law is dominated by coercion and force rather than by justice and the right ?
Coercion and arrogance is the origin of oppression and wars .
Although today many proponents of racism condemn racial discrimination in their words and in their slogans , a number of powerful countries have been authorized to decide for other nations based on their own interests and at their own discretions .
And they can easily ridicule and violate all laws and humanitarian values , as they have done so .
Following World War II , they resorted to military aggression to make an entire nation homeless on the pretext of Jewish sufferings .
And they sent migrants from Europe , the United States , and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied Palestine …
[ Delegates walk out in protest .
Applause ]
And in fact in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe …
Okay , please .
Thank you .
And in fact in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive , racist regime in Palestine .
[ Applause ]
The Security Council helped stabilize this occupation regime and supported it in the past 60 years , giving them a free hand to continue their crimes .
It is all the more regrettable that a number of Western governments and the United States have committed themselves to defend those racist perpetrators of genocide whilst the awakened conscience and free minded people of the world condemn aggression , brutalities and bombardments of civilians in Gaza .
They have always been supportive or silent against their crimes .
And before that , they have always been silent with regard to their crimes .
Distinguished delegates , ladies and gentlemen , what are the root causes of U.S. attacks against Iraq or invasion of Afghanistan ?
[ Shouts from audience ]
What are the root causes of U.S. attacks against Iraq invasion of Afghanistan ?
Was the motive behind the invasion of Iraq anything other than the arrogance of the then U.S. administration and the mounting pressures on the part of the owner of wealth and power to expand their sphere of influence , seeking the interests of giant arms manufacturing companies , affecting a noble culture with thousands of years of historical background , eliminating potential and practical traits of Muslim countries against the useful Zionist regime , or to control and plunder energy resources of the Iraqi people ?
Why , indeed almost a million people were killed and injured and a few more millions were displaced and became homeless .
Why , indeed the Iraqi people have suffered enormous losses amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars .
And why was hundreds of billions of dollars imposed on the American people and its allies as a result of these military actions ?
Was n’t the military action against Iraq planned by the Zionists and their allies in the then U.S. administration in complicity with the arms manufacturing companies and the owner of the wealth ?
The invasion of Afghanistan ; restore peace , security , and economic well being in this country .
The United States and its allies not only have failed to contain [ ? ] in Afghanistan , but also the illicit cultivation of narcotics multiplied in the course of their presence .
The basic question is :
What was the responsibility of the job of the then U.S. administration and its allies ?
Did it represent the world ?
Have they been mandated by them ?
Have they been authorized on behalf of the people of the world to interfere in all parts of the globe ?
And of course mostly in our region are n’t these measures a clear example of egocentrism , racism , discrimination , or infringement upon the dignity and independence of nations ?
Ladies and gentlemen , who are responsible for the current global economic crisis ?
Where did the crisis start from ?
From Africa ?
From Asia ?
Or was it first from the United States , then spreading to Europe and to their allies ?
For a long time they imposed inequitable economic regulations .
By their political power on the international economy they imposed a financial and a monetary system without a proper international oversight mechanism on nations and governments that played no role in the repressive trends or policies .
They have not even allowed their people to oversee of monitor their financial policies .
They introduce all laws and regulations in defiance to all moral values only to protect the interests of the owners of wealth and power .
They further presented a definition of market economy and competition that denied many of the economic opportunities that could be available to other countries of the world .
They even transferred their problems to others whilst the wave of crisis lashed back , plaguing their economies with thousands of billions of dollars in budget deficits .
And today , they are injecting hundreds of billions of cash from the pockets of their own people into the failing banks companies and financial institutions making the situation more and more complicated for the economy and their people .
They are simply thinking about maintaining power and wealth .
They could n’t care any less about the people of the world and even about their own people .
As software developers , we 're seen as by the world as the Experts of All Things Computer .
Want more RAM installed ?
Of course we can help , we know C ++!
Blue screen of death ?
Our day job calls for .NET , so we know exactly what to do !
Need a monitor plugged in ?
That 's basically the same thing as programming !
Fortunately , our hard - earned skills of “ reading an instruction manual ” and “ applying common sense ” enable us to solve most of these vexing computer mysteries .
But when it comes to anything more advanced than rudimentary , we tend to be as lost as our laymen counterparts .
Take , for example , that little paintbrush - looking button in Excel .
Did you know it 's called the “ Format Painter ” and can magically copy / paste cell formatting ?
Did you even know it was there ?
I did n't until recently , and holy crap is it awesome .
Of course , since we 're the Experts of All Things Computer , when a computer conundrum comes our way , we have to address it .
Especially when the call for help comes from an attractive member of the opposite sex .
And that 's exactly how Alex W. found himself staring at the contents of Cell 24Z .
“ My spreadsheet does n't seem to work anymore , ” the cute brunette in accounting told him , “ It does have a few complicated formulas , but I 'm sure you can figure them out . ”
Expecting a SUM here and a COUNTIF there , Alex obliged .
It was just an Excel spreadsheet , after all .
How hard could it possibly be ?
“ I did make a small change to 24 Z a while back , ” the accountant added , “ but for the life of me , I can't figure out why it 's not matching up billing terms . ”
“ Matching up ” was not a phrase that Alex associated with Excel formulas , and assumed she meant IIF or COUNT .
“ Let 's see what the problem is , ” Alex confidently replied just before he clicked on Cell 24Z and saw the following .
= DATE ( YEAR ( H$ 1 ) , MONTH ( H$ 1 ) + CHOOSE ( MATCH( F$ 1 , {" 5Y " , " Y " , " H / Y " , " 5 M " , " 4M " , " Q " , " B i - M " , " M " , " 4 W " , " F " , " W " , " D " , " 365D " , " 90D " , " 30D " , " 12W " , " 13P " , " 26 W " , " T" },0 ) , 61,13 ,7,6,5,4,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,IF(H$1<=FLOOR( DATE(

“ Oh ” was the only word that came out when Alex saw that formula .
“ Yeah , this may take a minute . ”
And actually , it took more than a minute .
After spending a few minutes reading about how CHOOSE and MATCH worked , he spent the rest of the afternoon “ debugging ” the spreadsheet .
He eventually figured it out , thus maintaining his position as an Expert of All Things Computer .
Natasha Mitchell : Welcome to All in the Mind on ABC Radio National , Natasha Mitchell joining you , great to have you on board .
Every year in Las Vegas an unusual gathering called The Amazing Meeting is held .
It 's become the annual celebration of the so - called skeptics movement something of a faith gathering for the critically minded if you like .
Its founder , the magician The Amazing Randi , who some Australians will remember from the famous Carlos Hoax which he orchestrated and televised with 60 Minutes in 1988 .
Excerpt , The Carlos Hoax :
Richard Carleton :
The plane that brought Jose Alvarez , Carlos 's channeller , and his manager Jorge Grillet to Sydney also carried another important passenger , the skeptic and magician James Randi .
You see together with James Randi 60 Minutes created Carlos .
Carlos ( Jose Alvarez ) : I am an attended master , I am a very old spirit .
Richard Carleton : Remember that first press conference hosted by our mystic ?
Carlos ( Jose Alvarez ) : First question ...
Can you give us any idea what this event might be ?
James Randi :
It will be astronomical in nature .
Carlos ( Jose Alvarez ) :
It will be astronomical in nature .
Richard Carleton : While Carlos spoke to Sydney 's assembled media , James Randi spoke to Carlos .
He was concealed in the room next door and made less than spiritual contact with Jose Alvarez through high tech radio equipment .
Carlos ( Jose Alvarez ) : Next question .
Will this have worldwide implications ?
James Randi : Worldwide , of course ...
Richard Carleton :
In fact , there is no Carlos , nor was there one when we laid the seeds of this hoax in James Randi 's home town of Fort Lauderdale in Florida .
Randi is known throughout the world for his crusade to debunk mystics , but in this case we asked him to help ...
James Randi : Well I 've been to laboratories all over the world .
Now I 'm not , as I say , a scientist .
And my other book I 'm coming out with , this is going to be called ' A Magician in the Laboratory ' .
That 's provocative enough I think just from the title , you know , what is a magician doing in the laboratory ?
But you see I have my expertise , I know how people are fooled and I know how they fool themselves .
And many times I have been in the laboratory and I 've found that that particular talent , although it 's not an academic — I can't get a degree in how people fool themselves , or in magic or in conjuring for that matter , but it 's a very valuable sense .
Richard Feynman the Nobel Laureate many years ago once told me — and Isaac Asimov essentially the same thing — that my particular expertise should be given some sort of status in the educational system .
I 'm flattered by that of course but I think that people like myself who have this knowledge of how people fool themselves should be called in more frequently .
Natasha Mitchell : Illusion is James Randi's trade and he 's notorious for exposing the tricks of psychics , even offering a million dollars to anyone who can demonstrate evidence of the paranormal or supernatural .
But it 's been over a decade since he made that challenge and not a single soul has come close .
Australian science communicator and searching skeptic Mike McRae was at this year 's Amazing Meeting hosted by Randi and today on All in the Mind he 's excavating the skeptical mind in the classroom and beyond .
What does it mean to call yourself a skeptic ?
Mike McRae : I 'm skeptical .
About what ?
Well , pretty much everything .
Is there anything I do believe in you might ask ?
That 'd be a fair question if I were a cynic , a nihilist or a solipsist .
So what then is a skeptic ?
Skeptics have long been associated with doubt .
The roots of the philosophy lie in ancient Greece where the teachings of a school of philosophers called the Skepticoi maintained that it was impossible to know anything with absolute certainty .
This philosophical skepticism forms the core of today 's scientific method .
Over the past century though a more active form of skepticism has developed with skeptic societies , clubs and gatherings sprouting up across the world .
They mostly focus on investigating paranormal and pseudo scientific claims with a critical mind while promoting the benefits of thinking objectively , critically and scientifically .
Yet to many , skeptic remains a dirty word .
Are skeptics really like their closed - minded and dogmatic stereotype , or are they true free thinkers ?
James Randi .
James Randi : I think that many people mistake the word skeptic for the word cynic .
' Cynical ' , ' skeptical ' seem to be rather the same word to them and that 's not correct at all of course .
A cynic is a much stronger term and I think it is not what we mean when we say skeptic .
We mean people who demand evidence and think that they should require evidence before firming up their beliefs .
Now science is the most skeptical art or discipline that I can imagine , because science always demands evidence .
Not just suggestions and not just hints or possibilities and such , although some scientists will tell you , they say science does n't discover facts , science discovers laws or rules that seem to govern the universe , that seem to express how the world works .
But discovering facts , that 's too strong a statement for some of them .
So again we 're in another semantic morass of the actual meaning of words .
And many people mistake another fact too , they think the dictionaries define words .
They do n't define words , they give common usage .
So where are we , how do we know what we mean by words , or should mean by words ?
It 's a difficult art .
Mike McRae : I 'll come back to the conflict between , say , the words ' cynical ' and ' skeptical ' very shortly .
However , I just want to pick up on your use of the term ' evidence ' there .
Skeptics are known for being , ' show me ' people .
Show me the evidence .
Skepticism is quite right in suggesting that evidence is needed to make beliefs .
Could it be though that people do believe that they use evidence even if that evidence in itself was not weighed perhaps as a scientist , or a skeptic , or a critical thinker might , and that could be a sticking point for skeptics communicating with people ?
James Randi :
Well again we 've got definitions and usage for ' evidence ' .
I 've never even thought of the idea of how do I go about defining ' evidence ' ... and then you 've got the difference between evidence and hard evidence , and faith and blind faith .
Now many people say oh faith is not science .
But a scientist has faith in the fact that the sun will probably rise tomorrow and the sky will be blue if the clouds are n't there , and gravity will work tomorrow , it worked today , I remember I fell down stairs .
So that 's an expectation based upon again , evidence , you see .
Now as a magician — there 's an interesting parallel — as a magician I know two things with a fair degree of certainty ( a ) how people are deceived , ( b ) how they deceive themselves , and that 's a very important factor .
In fact the more important of the two factors in my estimation .
Mike McRae : Magician and acclaimed skeptic James Randi .
Excerpt , Mythbusters :
When Kari , Tory and Grant zapped cockroaches with lethal radiation they found that the creepy crawlies could out - survive humans after a nuclear blast .
They are still moving ...
But to truly test the invincibility of the roach they had one final trial .
All right the next myth is you cannot drown a cockroach .
Supposedly they can survive a long time under water , much longer than humans .
That 's the myth , but what 's the plan ?
Now to test this we 're going to take five cockroaches , five little plastic containers , and just add water .
Mike McRae :
The hugely popular TV show Mythbusters might not overtly describe itself as skeptical but amid the entertaining banter , the cockroaches and the explosions , the philosophy is n't hard to find .
Adam Savage with co-host and straight man Jamie Hyneman has had a long and distinguished career in the special effects industry .
As with James Randi , he knows all too well what it takes for the human mind to be fooled .
Excerpt , Mythbusters :
Okay guys , it 's 30 minutes .
Let 's see if they went into some sort of hibernation survival mode .
They look pretty dead to me .
Maybe a little CPR can kick - start these cockroaches .
Adam Savage :
One of the best jobs I 've had in the past ten years before being a Mythbuster was working as a special effects artist in Industrial Light and Magic for the Star Wars movies .
And when I first got up there I was working next to a friend of mine who'd also just gotten up there and he said , ' Dude , you know what we are now , now that we 're working at ILM ? '
And I said , ' What ? '
And he said , ' We 're special effects wizards . '
Because they always referred to us as that in interviews .
And there is very much — the whole art of special effects is exactly the same kind of things that a magician is doing .
They are grabbing your attention with one thing to keep your attention away from another thing .
When I detail the side of a space ship I am placing some details to capture your eye and to help you ignore that you might recognise other details from a model car kit .
I 'm using painting techniques to trick your eyes and absolutely that exercise in empathy , which really magic is , I mean fooling people 's senses is an exercise in putting yourself in their heads and figuring out what it would take to fool yourself .
And this exercise is what I think leads one towards a skeptical view of the universe , because you realise that properly applied even you can be fooled .
In fact magicians make some of the best audiences because they know how it 's supposed to have been done and when you foiled that look then they go completely haywire .
So yeah , I absolutely think that portion of work in theatre , work in animation , work and special effects and model making , all of that informs the way I look at the world critically and a desire to break it down and see — you know , ask what the bigger questions are .
Mike McRae : Could that be a large key in how a lot of people become skeptical is that they have some life experience which shows that they have been tricked , or they have been fooled by their senses in some way ?
Adam Savage : I wonder , it would be lovely if there was a simple formula with which you could give someone an ah ha moment because I 'm sure that every single skeptical scientist and atheist has a moment when they just concluded that things were this way and it was n't a bad thing , that it was n't a battle between one thing and the other , it was a simple conclusion based on empirical data .
If there is such a formula I 'm searching for it .
Excerpt , Mythbusters :
Tomorrow arrives today , and ...
What in the heck is going on ?
Oh , he 's alive .
Wow .
That one is climbing up on the wall .
Number five is alive .
That one is alive , that one is alive .
They are all alive .
They are like little zombies , they came back from the dead .
Natasha Mitchell :
Go the cockroaches and if I was pushed to admit it I do think the Mythbusters crew are thinking women 's crumpet .
There you have it .
Adam Savage there , from the TV show Mythbusters .
And there might n't be a simple formula but are some people simply born to be skeptical thinkers ?
That 's the question Mike McRae is asking for us today on All in the Mind .
You 're with ABC Radio National going global on Radio Australia and as podcast .
Excerpt , Mythbusters :
So we 're going to call this one confirmed ?
I guess so .
Absolutely .
That 's cool , and I do n't feel bad because we did n't kill any cockroaches .
Mike McRae :
As social animals we are deeply influenced by what others think .
And throughout most of evolutionary history , with life balanced on a knife 's edge , it 's been dangerous to question what 's worked for our ancestors .
Myths have long been used to account for natural events we can't explain .
Today 's world affords us the luxury of challenging what 's been taken as truth .
But we do this with brains perhaps better suited to helping us survive , wandering the land in small , nomadic groups .
Being skeptical simply might not be compatible with how our brains work .
Dr Martin Bridgestock is a senior lecturer in Griffith University 's School of Science .
His university course on skepticism is surprisingly one of the few taught in Australia .
Martin Bridgestock :
There was a course offered in skepticism at the University of Queensland I believe a few years ago but that petered out and there 's a scattering of courses , probably about 10 or 15 at any one time in the United States .
Why people do n't offer it more I do n't know , I mean universities , if you look at the mission statements of universities , many of them say that they want to induce in their students some kind of critical , analytical thinking capacity and skepticism is one way of doing this because it combines critical and analytical thought with paranormal issues which students are often interested in .
So to me that question is one which makes my mind a complete blank .
I enjoy the course so much that I do n't regret bringing it on at all .
Mike McRae :
Now when it comes to combating mis-beliefs or misunderstandings most people just offer a contrary answer , almost a form of correction .
Is it possible to teach people to be skeptical simply by providing them with contrary views ?
Martin Bridgestock : I understand from certain courses that have been run in America that yes that can work up to a point .
That is , if people think that something constitutes evidence for the paranormal and you produce an alternative explanation , you will affect some people 's views .
But there 's a big catch with that .
The catch is that nearly all students are young adults and they absolutely hate being told what to believe .
So if you 've just come into the lecture theatre and you give opinion , opinion , opinion , my explanation , my explanation there 's going to be quite a lot of resentment , people are going to hate that .
And after all it's not really what a university is about ; a university is about telling people how to think and how to think in better ways .
So what I focus on much more is the tools of critical and skeptical thinking .
I do n't actually bother what people come out believing in the end , what I want them to do is to show that they can understand these valuable critical methods of thinking .
And to give you a couple of examples of how it works , the second year we ever ran the course back in 2004 , the student who came top of the entire year was in fact an advocate of alternative medicine .
He believed quite strongly that some alternative medicines were very valid .
And this year the student who 's come top is in fact a devout Christian who actually believes that God created the universe and that does n't bother me at all because both of these students demonstrated very clearly that they had mastered critical and analytical thinking .
Their beliefs are their business , what 's my business is whether they 've actually mastered these methods of thinking .
Mike McRae : Can you really compare the two though with , say , a student who believes that God created the universe , which is really not something you can approach in a skeptical sort of fashion if you think , it 's not like there 's a for and against evidence , it 's simply a faith .
Whereas using alternative medicine is something which is a little more evidence based .
So do you find that you have a lot more students coming out at the end who might retain certain religious or faith based beliefs , whereas a lot of other students tend to criticise their evidence - based beliefs a little bit more ?
Martin Bridgestock :
You quite astonish me with that question , Mike , because I 've just been doing some research on what effect the course has on students ' beliefs .
As I say influencing their beliefs is not what the course is about , but obviously I wanted to know whether it was happening .
So I gave them before and after questionnaires asking them what they believed in before the course and afterwards .
And the effects are very dramatic .
For some beliefs , such as extrasensory perception and clairvoyance , belief dropped like a stone , 20 % , 30 % fewer of them at the end believed than they did at the start .
Creation science , there was almost no difference , basically the same percentage believed at the beginning and at the end .
So yes , they are substantially different .
My point is that I 'm not out to tell them what to believe or to change their beliefs , that 's not the primary purpose of what I 'm doing .
What I 'm doing is trying to inculcate in them to certain methods of thought .
And if at the end that student , that Creationist student , says at the end of it well yes , I understand these methods , I 've shown you how I can apply them , I can criticise the evidence for various paranormal beliefs but nonetheless as a matter of faith I believe in one particular interpretation of the Bible .
I have to say , fair enough .
Mike McRae :
Now there are a lot of skeptics who might actually feel that skepticism and atheism are two things that go hand in hand .
Do you follow that same philosophy ?
Martin Bridgestock : Personally no I do n't , my course does not deal with religion at all except where the religious belief can be tested .
For example religious based healing , the kind of faith healing .
Creationism where the Creationists believe that there is scientific evidence which shows that God created the universe in six days 10,000 years ago .
But generally speaking I do n't at all criticise or comment on religious beliefs , I try to keep them out of the course and that works both ways .
I 've had students in seminars take swipes at religious belief and I immediately intervene and say hey no , we do n't do that .
And on the other hand I 've had students who have turned their seminars into basically forums for preaching their religious beliefs and again I 've had to tell them no , that 's not what the course is about .
So I stay clear of religion .
My own view is that if you imagine a person with religious belief , OK they believe in God but they also can see that this universe does obey scientific laws .
and in that case there is nothing to stop them using the skeptical methods of thinking as a method for weeding out what 's reliable or what 's not in this world , regardless of their belief in another world .
So I do n't believe that the two necessarily go hand in hand and it bothers me a little bit that so many skeptics do link them .
Mike McRae :
How important is it that communicators of skeptical thinking understand the psychology of learning ?
Martin Bridgestock :
It 's certainly very valuable for them to do so because if you have valuable ideas which the public could benefit from but you do n't know how to communicate them , you do n't know how to get them across to people and bring them alive and get people to see their value , then pretty well you 're going to be a very ineffective skeptic indeed .
And I think one of the problems of skepticism is the problem of public image , the problem of communicating what we 're actually about .
I 've been quite amazed at how many cases people have said things which basically say that skeptics are nothing more than closed minded and naysayers , all they do is doubt things .
And I had a very bright post - grad student from another university send me an email yesterday in which he said I am part way between a skeptic and a believer .
Well in my view you can't be part way between a skeptic and a believer .
A skeptic is somebody who believes if the evidence is sufficient to justify belief .
And therefore a skeptic can be a believer , there 's no middle ground .
Mike McRae :
While many people might show themselves to be critically minded they might n't describe themselves as skeptical .
What , in your experience , does it take for somebody to nominate themselves as a skeptic ?
Martin Bridgestock : I do n't know .
Clearly skepticism is a sub-set of critical thinking .
Skepticism is critical thinking applied to paranormal claims , I think that 's the simplest way of defining it .
Now what therefore does it make for a person who is a critical thinker to regard themselves as a skeptic ?
Possibly it 's a matter of interest , I could imagine critical thinkers about politics and critical thinkers about economics not having any interest in paranormal issues and therefore they would n't identify themselves as being skeptics .
So possibly what it is , is simply that skepticism is critical thinking plus an interest in and a concern for paranormal issues .
Mike McRae : Now with shows like Mythbusters and recent books like Myth Conceptions by our own Dr Karl , it might be tempting to think that 's becoming popular to become skeptical .
Is this a sign of a change in public attitude towards skepticism ?
Martin Bridgestock : I 've seen no sign whatsoever of a change in public attitudes towards skepticism , none whatever .
And all the polls , there 's a lot of polls in the United States , are seen to show that there has been very little change indeed .
We still have a situation in which something like 80 % of the population subscribe to one or more paranormal beliefs .
It may perhaps be that there are some people who are becoming more outspoken but I 've seen no particular sign of a large scale change at all , no .
Mike McRae :
Are you optimistic that there will be in the future ?
Martin Bridgestock :
We can always hope but that 's not really what I can do .
As I say , I do n't presume to tell my students what to believe , but what I 'm hoping is that if we can get enough people to be capable of thinking critically and skeptically so that there are people in every workplace , in every school staff room , in every family who know how to ask the right questions , who know how to talk about evidence and think about evidence , then that might possibly make a difference overall .
That 's all I 'm really hoping for .
Mike McRae : Dr Martin Bridgestock from the School of Science at Griffith University .
George Hrab :
There is no magic , there are no vampires , there are no werewolves .
Mike McRae : Skeptics are familiar characters in movies or television shows .
For example , where would the X - Files be without Scully balancing Mulder 's desire to believe ?
Yet they 're typically portrayed as close - minded and naïve , unwilling to accept what 's obvious to all and often dogmatically sticking to their preconceived notions of what the world should be like .
We 're led to believe it 's a good thing to follow your heart over reason and saying you know something to be true is far more appealing and far easier than saying something 's false .
Could this be the reason the word ' skeptic ' is avoided in shows like Mythbusters , which is clearly skeptical in nature .
Presenter Adam Savage .
Adam Savage :
You know it 's funny , it occurs to me that the word ' skeptic ' does n't appear on the show not by any design it just has never occurred to us but now that you 've reminded me of this I am going to go back on Monday morning and start saying ' skeptic ' on camera .
Yeah , I do think the skeptics ' movement has a negative public image , when I came down to the first Amazing Meeting with James Randi my higher - ups at the Discovery Channel were actually a little nervous and said do you really want to throw your lot in with them , they have a kind of a negative reputation .
And my thinking is if that 's a negative reputation it 's exactly the kind of reputation that I want .
These guys are fighting absolutely the best kind of fight and they are fighting it against — a good portion of the time it 's against ignorance but a lot of the time it 's against active avarice and thievery .
And that 's the part that gets me upset , psychics and faith healers , and ghost hunters — all of that crap .
Mike McRae :
The word ' skeptic ' means different things to different people .
And as with atheism many are shaking off its negative connotations to reclaim it as a positive philosophy .
Skepticism is a process of evaluation , we live in a world where information is in no short supply , where Google and Wiki have become verbs but not all information is useful .
So what approach should self - described skeptics take ?
Without seeming arrogant , aggressively combating popular misconceptions with corrections might have actually done more harm than good .
But research indicates we have a tendency to mis-remember the context of the information we receive and , after all , 150 years of skeptics questioning the effectiveness of homeopathy has n't dissuaded its believers .
Perhaps skeptics should be concerned less with informing people what 's incorrect in the world and more with educating young people in critical thinking .
George Hrab :
There is no God , in the end that 's more fair , is n't it ?
James Randi :
Well the first problem we have in the United States is we 're just coming out about faith based administration .
Oh , what a notion , faith based administration , almost a theocracy .
Until we get a new administration in here we 've got to think about the basic problem , we 've got to get back to education .
Mike McRae : Magician and skeptic James Randi runs the James Randi Educational Foundation and is a founding fellow of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal .
James Randi :
We have classrooms where kids are not allowed to be told that organisms evolved over time and that if the word ' evolution ' is used you 've got to throw Creationism in at the same time which is an absolute pseudoscience , it 's a pleasant notion for the feeble - minded , in my estimation .
I 'm very angry about this situation here in the United States so I would say the first stage we 've got to go through is recovering .
Let 's move 20 years into the past and start again , because we have been plagued by this administration that as just stifled real education .
Teachers here at this conference you 're attending right here , we 've got a lot of teachers out there and they 've all come up to me one after the other saying let 's get straightened out again .
The door has been closed in our faces , we 're on an escalator and we 're going the wrong way .
Education prepares you to observe how the real world works and deal with the real world and make it work for you .
We called it the James Randi Educational Foundation because I am not an academic , so I do n't make any pretensions of being a scientist .
I believe I 'm a logical thinker as a matter of fact I have an honorary degree but it's a degree of humane letters and I do n't even know what the letters are .
Maybe only A through B , I 'm not sure .
Now nonetheless
I 'm proud of the honour of a degree but we called it educational because that 's our bottom line , our purpose is to educate people not by jamming it down their throats but by making it entertaining , making it something that they 're going to raise their eyebrows about and come over and want to take a closer look .
You have a very active skeptical communities in Australia of course , Richard Saunders for example spoke today .
I look upon Australians in some ways 20 years in the past compared to certain other parts of the world but 30 years in the future in comparison to others .
It 's more or less a frontier country , it always has been and maybe it always will be , and I think that 's a healthy attitude .
We 've got a horizon to go beyond .
We 've almost lost that in America I 'm afraid .
That 's why I hope that Australia really adopts a good skeptical attitude .
I found it present when we did the Carlos hoax over there .
I was in Copenhagen about two and a half months ago and a fellow ran through traffic , he came over and he said , ' Hi mate , I 'm from Australia . '
I shook him by the hand and I said , ' I doubt that because I 'm a skeptic . '
And he laughed , thank goodness , and he remembered the Carlos thing that we did .
And he said , ' Oh , that was great , that was really great . '
He really enjoyed it and he remembered it .
Now that is an important fact , that they remembered the Carlos hoax that we pulled on Australia and that so many people were fooled by it for the moment and then they learned and turned around and said , oh , wow , I can be fooled .
Excerpt , The Carlos Hoax :
Carlos ( Jose Alvarez ) : I have come to teach you .
Richard Carleton : First , just how easy is it to fool people .
but even more importantly how easy is it to fool the media into giving out essential free publicity ?
Carlos ( Jose Alvarez ) : For ever , and ever , and ever .
So be it .
James Randi : I can sit in a chair and I can say .
' I am very old ' , I can change my voice and they say .
' His voice changed ! '
Wow !
My voice changes when I get a cold or a drink too much coffee .
Richard Carleton : Australia has a reputation for having the toughest interviewers anywhere , could our phoney mystic get past them and then go on to win himself a following ?
Mike McRae : Carlos the phoney mystic did gain quite a following in Australia in 1998 .
Nobody likes being told their way of thinking is flawed or that their most cherished beliefs are based on myth and misconception .
Add to that the fact that humans tend to like absolutes — true and false , believer and heretic — and it 's easy to see why age - old cultural beliefs often win out over science 's dispassionate objective enquiry .
Encouraging a society to be more critical is no easy task .
If you ask me if it 's possible , I have only one answer : I 'm skeptical .
Natasha Mitchell : Science communicator and educator Mike McRae there with that feature on skeptical enquiry .
So I 'm interested to know , do you identify as a skeptic ?
Pop into the All in the Mind blog on the show 's website and let me know abc.net.au/rn/allinthemind which is where you 'll also find the transcript , downloadable audio and email address .
I'm Natasha Mitchell , not a card carrying member of the skeptics myself , but ever skeptical .
Bye for now .
