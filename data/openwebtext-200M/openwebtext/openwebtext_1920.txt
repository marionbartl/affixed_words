Strategic thinking is a skill that leaders and managers need to develop in today ’s new environment .
The last thing we want to do in business is launch a “ big campaign ” or initiatives before we know what we really want to achieve .
When focusing on a strategic outlook , it is critical to have a clear target in mind .
In order for “ optimum ” success , a target needs to be well defined and describe what we want the end result to be .
This is one of the main topics we cover in CMOE ’s strategy consulting .
In the 2001 rendition of the movie Oceans Eleven , there is a scene in the movie where the character played by George Clooney and Brad Pitt meet in a coffee shop to discuss their strategy to accomplish a big heist .
Clooney begins a conversation by saying “ this project is tricky and it has never been done before . ”
He continues by saying “ it needs timing , planning , and a large crew . ”
Pitt then asks the question “ What ’s the Target ? ” Clooney gives the answer – to rob three casinos .
The scene then shifts to an office where the two characters are looking at the architectural plans of the casino vault – the target .
Pitt suggests that “ this may be the least accessible vault ever designed . ”
As Pitt begins his own strategic thinking process he suggests they will need at least half a dozen people , financial support , and personal enemies of the casino owner to accomplish their strategy .
Much like the movie , strategic thinking at all levels in a business requires us to strategically scan our targets accurately , look ahead , and anticipate the requirements and effort that will be needed for success .
Strategic thinking at the individual level in an organization requires the contributor to constantly evaluate new ways to update , improve , and refine , products , processes , and services to reach our target customers and business goals .
So how do you select the right target ?
One way is to use CMOE ’s criteria for a C.L.E.A.
R™ strategic target .
These criteria will help to ensure you ’re focusing time and effort in the right areas .
Controllable –
Is it something you can control and within your scope of capabilities
Linked –
Is it aligned and linked with the goals and outcomes of the organization , department , or environment you are operating in ?
Energizing –
Is it something you want to go after and accomplish ?
It should be a target that is rewarding , fun , and exciting .
Actionable – Will you be able to implement your plan of action .
Do you have the resources needed ?
Results - Oriented –
Will the trade off or investment be a good deal ?
What does the risk - to - reward ratio look like ?
Try this new approach to the age old concept of strategic planning and ss you implement these criteria for a strategic target , you will be better prepared to face future challenges and obstacles that arise .
You will begin to plan strategically , as George Clooney and Brad Pitt did in Oceans Eleven , thinking beforehand of all possible problems , challenges , and solutions .
Strategic thinkers think and act proactively instead of reactively .
It applies to all industries , people , and walks of life .
Strategic thinking will empower you to be in control of your life and your job .
An excellent new work by the acclaimed filmmaker whose movie “ Iraq for Sale ” , brought home the ugly truths about the real motivations behind our invasion and ongoing occupation of Iraq .
Ever worry you ’ll arrive at work to find that your swivel chair has been replaced by a super - intelligent software appliance that can create seven user - centered websites in a single CPU cycle ?
Have n’t we all ?
OK , maybe it ’s just me .
But at some point you ’ve probably been asked by a boss or client to squeeze the time and money it takes to design a website to the minimum — by cutting down processes , speeding up your work , and reusing possibly inappropriate code .
It seems to me that the ultimate fantasy of this kind of uninformed decision - maker is a robot that can do everything a web designer can , only faster , cheaper , and without asking so many difficult questions — which explains my robot phobia .
But do n’t give it all up for your backup career as a rock climbing instructor just yet , because it is n’t going to happen this side of the next millennium bug .
Nevertheless , we can learn a few things from our fantasy of robot domination .

Design on a production line #section2
Web design is still a young discipline , and it ’s generally poorly understood .
As the web becomes mainstream , an increasing number of people and organizations want websites — and so more people are involved in commissioning , managing , and designing them .
It ’s not surprising that many of these people are n’t familiar with how web design works .
Clients , managers , and colleagues often assume that web design is a subset of some other discipline , like advertising , graphic design , or software engineering .
This creates a tendency to write it off as a low - value , straightforward process that can be streamlined and automated , like a production line .
The result is unhelpful pressure on you , the web designer .
You ’re asked to design faster , using a smaller budget , and without access to key stakeholders — which can make it difficult to maintain your professionalism , leaving everyone unhappy with the final design .
The logical conclusion of this perpetual streamlining would be to stop using your judgment altogether , as if you were a piece of off - the - shelf software : a robot .
A lack of respect#section3
The problem I ’m describing is a lack of respect for web design as a profession , primarily caused by ignorance .
My proposed solution is to educate , by demonstrating that the value you add to the design process comes from using human judgment and experience — in a way that ca n’t be replaced by streamlined or automated processes .
But why could a robot never do your job ?
Because machines can’t generalize .
An essential element of a web designer ’s job is generalization : a human skill that neither computers nor simplistic processes can simulate .
In this article I ’m going to describe generalization using some examples , explain why it ca n’t be done by machines , and conclude that talking about it is a powerful way to demonstrate the value of web design .
The Oxford English Dictionary defines “ generalize ” as :
To form general notions by abstraction from particular instances ; to arrive at or express general inferences . [ sense 4 ]
In the context of web design , generalization is the process of creating a concrete , coherent design from a disorganized and conflicting set of needs and objectives .
In this article I use the term “ web designer ” in the broadest sense : someone who makes websites .
Technology is your servant #section5
One of the most obvious things you could observe about web designers is that we spend a lot of time using computers .
Perhaps this is the root of a common misconception : the idea that the main output of web design is a type of computer program — and that , therefore , once we ’ve written this computer program , it should be easy to create as many websites as we need .
People probably assume that we spend the rest of our time surfing the web .
But why is this attitude mistaken ?
Web design is about communication .
We need to use technology like servers , browsers , code , and databases to make that communication happen .
But in a successful website , the technology is the servant of the communication — not the other way around .
A professional web designer starts with the communication needs of the organization and its users , and then exercises her judgment to create abstractions of those needs that ultimately end up as web pages — a process of generalization .
These abstractions still need to be technically feasible in order to make it into the final release — but that ’s something you deal with after you ’ve decided what the “ ideal ” approach is .
The fact that the ACME Content Management System — or even your last project ’s CMS — ca n’t handle your new architecture does not justify ruling it out during the scoping phase .
Web design is a discipline #section6
The mistake of starting with the technology is just one example of the “ subset ” error that I described above : web design as a subset of software engineering .
Other common errors include starting by designing a visual treatment ( web design as graphic design ) , or coming up with a grand concept without considering the user experience ( web design as broadcast advertising ) .
There ’s nothing wrong with using the approaches of these other disciplines on the web , of course , but they need to be part of a web design process .
Web design is n’t rocket science , but it ’s not a subset of another discipline — and it ’s not as easy as it looks .
So web design is a discipline of its own , and it requires generalization .
But what does generalization actually look like ?
Generalization in action#section7
Because all websites have different needs and objectives , web design projects need to follow some kind of process in order to be successful .
Whatever the details of the process , each stage can be seen as a set of decisions that move us a step further from abstract needs and objectives towards a concrete final website .
Every time we make one of these decisions we are generalizing .
Here are a couple of examples .
Example 1 : scope#section8
Imagine you ’re involved in a project that ’s based on Jesse James Garrett ’s user - centered design process ( PDF link ) , and you ’re talking about scope .
You ’ve already agreed on your strategy — “ improve the efficiency of the rock climbing school by offering online booking ” — and now you need to come up with content requirements and a feature set .
What ’s needed ?
A page for each lesson , or one for each course of ten ?
A separate section for mountaineering , or is that overkill ?
Does the children ’s intensive summer course need its own booking process , or could it share a generic one with the weekly adult course ?
You need to involve the client in the process so that the decisions you make are workable , but they ca n’t make them on their own , because they do n’t have enough expertise in web design ( which is why they hired you in the first place ) .
You ’re practicing user - centered design , so the users ’ needs are paramount , but you also have a limited budget , a deadline , and the school only has a part - time web editor .
The decisions you make will affect the chances of meeting the deadline , the quality of the user experience , and the profitability of the school .
To add to the confusion , none of these questions has a “ right ” answer — that is , you and I could reasonably come up with different answers without one of us being wrong — and our answers will change over time as circumstances change .
Together , you decide that a page for each course is adequate , and that mountaineering is n’t sufficiently different from rock climbing to justify its own section .
The summer school needs its own booking form , though , because it needs an upfront payment instead of a recurring one , and some extra fields for parental consent .
From a logical point of view , you ’re making a number of assertions : that all 10 - week courses can be represented as a single entity ; that a generic layout can represent both mountaineering and rock climbing ; and that booking the summer course is so different from booking the weekly one that it ’s not practical to design a generic form without it becoming cumbersome .
This is generalization in action : “ abstraction from particular instances ” as we defined above .
Example 2 : structure #section9
Fast - forward to a later meeting where you ’re working on the site ’s information architecture .
The school has seven types of climbing courses , and the client originally planned to present each in its own section .
You ’ve agreed that this is a bad idea , because it ’s confusing for users .
But how can you break the list down into two or three broad categories that will make sense to both the users and the client ?
To come up with a successful architecture you need to think about semantics .
The way the school describes its courses internally includes jargon that could be confusing to its audience — but you do n’t know much about the subject , so you ’re dependent on the client to tell you what ’s commonly understood .
You also need to consider web conventions that most users will understand , irrespective of whether they ’re familiar with rock climbing , and you want to build enough flexibility into the architecture to allow it to last for a few years , without overdoing it .
When you decide on the three categories , you are asserting that each course can be grouped into one of them — and that most users will be able to find the course they are looking for using the resulting architecture .
As with the scope , the decisions you make about structure are generalizations .
A matter of judgment # section10
Deciding on scope and structure is n’t the only time web designers generalize .
Throughout the design process , you continually exercise your judgment to make decisions that often have far - reaching consequences .
You use your experience and knowledge of working on the web to make the best decisions you can ; and the quality of those decisions is a key source of your value in the design process .
Machines can’t generalize # section11
When we generalize , we are using inductive logic , which is the type of logic that the human brain typically uses to make everyday decisions .
A classic example of inductive logic is the way we respond to danger .
For example , the first time we touch a steaming kettle , we notice that it is dangerously hot , and a reflex makes us move our hands away immediately .
In the future , whenever we see a steaming kettle , we infer that it must be hot and therefore dangerous , and so do not touch it .
Because all steaming kettles we have observed so far are dangerous , we infer that this one is too — an inductive inference , or generalization .
When we reach conclusions using inductive logic , they are not certain — it could be something other than the steam that makes the kettle dangerous ( although I ’d have a hard time convincing you of that in this example ) .
This explains why , when we generalize , we can come up with two different answers that are both “ right . ”
Computers are good at mathematics and deductive logic , but they are useless at induction , and therefore ca n’t generalize — which is why artificial intelligence is still just science fiction .
Computers can’t make the abstractions necessary to design a successful website — for that matter , neither could a human who was forced to follow a mechanical process instead of using his judgment and experience .
User - centered websites can’t be manufactured on a production line .
The value of a brain # section12
In this article I ’ve argued that because web design is poorly understood , the instinct of our bosses and clients is often to squeeze web designers to the point where it ’s difficult to maintain our professionalism .
This is n’t only bad for us — it ’s bad for them too , because the final design will be inferior , and therefore less likely to meet its objectives .
One way to stop this from happening is to convince them that web design is a discipline in its own right , and that it requires human judgment and experience to succeed .
Forever demanding that we work faster is a bit like asking us to behave like robots — streamlining to the point that we hardly use our judgment at all .
But professional web designers ca n’t be replaced by robots — at least , not without seriously damaging the product — because generalization by human brains is an essential part of web design .
So next time your boss or client asks you to design a website in ten seconds flat , consider whether they ’re effectively asking you to work like a robot .
Explaining that a robot is n’t what they really need might persuade them to think again .
The hot corporate scandal today involves the CEO of supermarket chain Whole Foods using an assumed identity on Yahoo Finance message boards to hype his own company and bash a competitor that they were looking to acquire .
Unfortunately for John Mackey , using the rather cryptic alias “ Rahodeb ” ( an anagram of his wife ’s name : Deborah ) was not enough to fool investigators at the Federal Trade Commission , and he is now coming under fire from both the FTC and investors in the organic foods giant .
Whether you are the CEO of a billion dollar company or just an average Internet user , remaining truly 100 % anonymous online is incredibly difficult .
However , here are a few basic strategies and services you can use to try and maintain your privacy , particularly in countries that seek to limit your freedoms :
Use Throw Away Email Addresses
Most online services require a valid email address in order to sign up .
While you can always use an address from a web mail provider like Gmail or Hotmail , the easier and more anonymous way to keep your information private ( and prevent Google and Hotmail from tracking information on you ) is to use a “ throw away ” email address .
There are a variety of different options and services available for doing so :
Mailinator –
When you come across a web form requiring an email address , you can simply enter anything@mailinator.com and then go to the Mailinator web site to get your message .
There is no password and thus no real privacy , but your email is automatically deleted after a few hours .
Mailinator also includes an RSS feed for keeping up with your messages .
SpamBob –
If you would like to receive email at your regular address but keep it private , SpamBob allows you to setup a forwarding account @spambob.com .
You can activate and de-active forwarding at any time .
Spamgourmet –
This service provides anonymity while giving you a little more control over who can message your masked address .
With Spamgourmet , your anonymous address takes the form of “ someword.x.user@spamgourmet.com ” where someword is a word you have never used before , x ( optional ) is the number of email messages you want to receive at this address , and user is your username .
Surf the Web Anonymously
If you work for a big company , chances are you web browsing habits are being monitored by your employer , and if you ’re spending too much time checking sports scores or searching HotJobs , you might receive an unwelcome visit from your boss .
Beyond corporate snooping , marketer ’s increasingly place cookies on your hard drive so they can monitor your preferences and serve up more relevant advertising .
The best way to avoid this type of snooping is to surf anonymously , which can be achieved in several ways :
Tor –
One of the most popular programs for remaining anonymous ,
Tor is a downloadable application that looks to protect your web browsing , instant messaging , and more .
The service operates on its own “ network of virtual tunnels ” and claims to be used by the US Navy in addition to law enforcement around the world .
Torbutton is a Firefox plugin for turning
Tor on and off while you ’re browsing
Use a Proxy Server – Most basic logging is done by tracking your IP address .
By using a proxy server , you are essentially using a networked IP address , which makes tracking your individual location difficult .
Setting up a proxy server can be done in your Web browser , and a good list of available proxies is available at Public Proxy Servers .
Use a Web - Based Proxy –
If you do n’t want to go through the hassle of setting your browser up to use a proxy server , there are dozens of web - based services for browsing anonymously .
With these , you simply type in the URL you wish to visit and the proxy service will load the page for you , usually in a frame .
These types of services are ideal for circumventing blocks that schools or employers may put on certain web sites .
Kaxy and Proxify are two popular services .
Keep Your Phone Number Private
While it ’s usually not a good idea to post your personal phone number on the Web , there are ways to let people call you without sharing your digits .
If you ’re trying to sell something on a classifieds site or want to chat with people on a dating service , you will want to provide a phone number in an anonymous way .
Here are a few of the leading services and how they work :
Jangl – Operating as its own anonymous phone system , Jangl lets you enter any email address and provides you with a random phone number to call them .
If they are a Jangl user , your call will be connected to them , if not , a voice message will be send to their email address and they will be given an anonymous number to call you back .
Jangl also provides a widget that you can place on your blog , profiles , and anywhere else you want to allow users to call you .
Jaduka – Formerly known as PrivateTel , Jaduka offers a service called “ My Private Line ” that is essentially a toll - free number that forwards to your real phone line , thus keeping your number private .
Numbr – Originally targeting Craigslist users ( and dubbed “ craigsnumber ” ) , Numbr provides you with a disposable phone number that last for an hour , a day , a week , or a month .
Numbr offers phone numbers in most major area codes and provides you with a number and three digit extension that forwards to the phone of your choice .
Use Common Sense
Perhaps the most important part of maintaining your privacy online is using common sense .
A few obvious but often ignored tactics :
1 . Use a completely non-descript alias - While John Mackey was able to foil the Yahoo Message Board community for 8 years , he was eventually uncovered because of his obvious alias .
2 . Use avatars , not photos –
If a site requires you to have a photo , use a random image , not your yearbook picture .
3 . Assume what you post will be on the front page of the NY Times – No matter what lengths you go to in order to protect privacy , someone that is truly determined can probably find you out .
Thus , even if you ’re under an alias , you should n’t post things online you would n’t want the world to see at some point .
Additionally , with services like Facebook and Zooomr allowing users to tag people in photos , you could end up online against your will , so try and avoid unflattering situations when cameras are present .
—
In reality , if you ’ve been using the Internet for any length of time , chances are you have made a digital fingerprint that is fairly permanent .
However , with the increased risk of identity theft , employer ’s propensity for snooping on workers , and advertisers looking to acquire as much knowledge as possible about you , protecting your identity where feasible is a prudent decision .
Are there other measures you use to protect your privacy ?
Feel free to add your tips for staying anonymous in the comments .
Gelatin tape can be used to collect fingerprints and " chemically photograph " them using highly sensitive instruments for chemical analysis .
A victim might not care if a murderer is a smoker or a vegetarian .
But having such knowledge could help police solve a case .
Details like this could one day be at their fingertips if a new fingerprinting technique pans out as expected .
Standard methods for collecting fingerprints at crime scenes , which involve powders , liquids or vapors , can alter the prints and erase valuable forensic clues , including traces of chemicals that might be in the prints .
Now researchers find tape made from gelatin could enable forensics teams to chemically analyze prints gathered at crime scenes , yielding more specific information about miscreants ' diets and even possibly their gender and race .
Nimble technique
The gel tape can gather prints from a variety of surfaces , including door handles , mug handles , curved glass and computer screens , just as conventional fingerprint techniques can .
The gelatin is then irradiated with infrared rays inside a highly sensitive instrument that rapidly takes a kind of " chemical photograph , " identifying molecules within the print in 30 seconds or less , said physical chemist Sergei Kazarian at Imperial College London .
Fingerprints contain just a few millionths of a gram of fluid , or roughly the same amount of material in a grain of sand .
That might , however , be enough to determine valuable clues about a person beyond the print itself , such as their gender , race , diet and lifestyle , Kazarian and his colleagues find .
For instance , preliminary results could identify males based on the greater amounts of urea in their fingerprints — urea being the key ingredient of urine .
The complex brew of organic chemicals within prints might also shed light on the age and race of people , and hold traces of items people came into contact with , such as gunpowder , smoke , drugs , explosives , or biological or chemical weapons .
Even a person 's diet might be determined from fingerprints , as vegetarians may have different amino acid content than others , Kazarian said .
" More volunteers need to be tested for statistical information on fingerprints with regard to race , sex and so on , but we believe this will be a powerful tool , " he told LiveScience .
Much faster
In addition , unlike conventional fingerprint techniques , the new method did not distort or destroy the original prints , instead keeping them intact and available for further analysis , the researchers said .
Their findings are detailed in the Aug. 1 issue of the journal Analytical Chemistry .
Other techniques can analyze chemicals in fingerprints , including methods that use X - rays .
Still , Georgia
Tech analytical chemist Facundo Fernandez noted this new technique " is very rapid .
You can not say the same for other approaches . "
Fernandez was not involved in the current study .
Kazarian said his group 's technique is especially good at identifying organic deposits , the main components of fingerprints .
Would the news director be sitting there laughing as some pundit described the fun he had as a kid going to a KKK rally ?
Would he be giving another news caster the high - five after the fellow described how he broke up a NOW meeting by setting the building on fire ?
Tucker Carlson admitted on national television that he attacked another man because the man expressed sexual interest in him .
Rejecting a would - be suitor is one thing , but leaving and then returning to beat him is a premeditated assault .
Tucker Carlson admits committing a criminal hate crime and his compatriot , Scarborough , and his boss , Abrams are laughing about it like it is both perfectly reasonable and amusing .
This is beyond the pale for a news organization .
I had to explain to my son that you do NOT beat up people that may make a pass at you .
You say , " No thank you .
Please leave me alone . "
And LEAVE THE ROOM .
And you do NOT go back with a friend to harass the person or assault them .
I am disgusted with the performance of all three of these " newsmen " .
I am especially appalled that Abrams , the News Director , would laugh at this criminal action .
I will no longer watch Tucker Carlson ’s program , period .
He is a thoughtless , violent , completely self - unaware jerk , apparently , who does n’t have the intelligence to realize that he committed an assault .
( His protestations of his gay - friendliness to the contrary . )
He should be fired immediately .
Someone should explain to Carlson that there are a lot of annoying people in the world : panhandlers , street squeegee guys , folks begging on subway cars , loud teenagers in the street , and people who litter , to name the more harmless .
Because you are annoyed , irritated or even nervous does not give you the right to assault them .
That is the exact opposite of the message MSNBC delivered last night .
But if Dan Abrams does not acknowledge that he made a mistake , and apologize for giving the impression that Carlson ’s actions were appropriate and amusing , the tv get tuned to CNN instead , for good .
If this appalls you as much as it did me , please write a letter or an email to viewerservices@msnbc.con , asking that they immediately fire Tucker Carlson and have Dan Abrams explain why the man has been canned .
In my case , if MSNBC will not , they will have permanently lost a long - time viewer who has praised their news coverage in the past - even if it means no more " Countdown " .
Sorry , Keith .
But these guys ' behavior - on your channel - was beyond the pale .
UPDATED : Tucker Carlson , through an MSNBC spokewoman , has emailed a self - defense memo to Media Matters , which broke the story .
Let me be clear about an incident I referred to on MSNBC last night :
In the mid-1980s , while I was a high school student , a man physically grabbed me in a men's room in Washington , DC .
I yelled , pulled away from him and ran out of the room .
Twenty - five minutes later , a friend of mine and I returned to the men's room .
The man was still there , presumably waiting to do to someone else what he had done to me .
My friend and I seized the man and held him until a security guard arrived .
Several bloggers have characterized this is a sort of gay bashing .
That 's absurd , and an insult to anybody who has fought back against an unsolicited sexual attack .
I was n't angry with the man because he was gay .
I was angry because he assaulted me .
We all heard what you said last night , Tucker , and this explanation does n't wash .
You were angry because you described being approached and being " bothered " in a public restroom ..
You at no time described it as an " assault " , or mentioned that you were scared of bodily harm .
You said you were " bothered " - and you did n't ask for being " bothered . "
You never mention being touched .
much less attacked , which implies violence .
YOU are the one insulting " all those who have fought back against an unsolicited sexual attack " , by comparing some guy making a pass at you to actual rape .
The fact that Tucker is now defending himself by describing this incident as an " assault " , and that he is attacking bloggers ' comments as " absurd " , shows that MSNBC is hearing our feedback .
Thank you , fellow Kossacks .
Kerry : Bush prefers ' paying off cronies ' to selecting good ambassadors Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday June 26 , 2007 Print This Email This A government watchdog sided with the White House Monday on the legality of a controversial recess appointment by President George W. Bush .
The Senators who sought the Government Accountability Office 's legal opinion renewed their sharp criticisms of the president for his elevation of St. Louis , Missouri - based businessman Sam Fox to the ambassadorship of Belgium .
" The White Houses abuse of the recess appointment made it clear they care more about paying off cronies than nominating ambassadors with good judgment , " said Amy Brundage , a spokesperson from Senator John Kerry ( D - MA ) .
" Congress has had enough and is going to find every way possible to ensure President Bush listens to Congress about the judgment , character , and honor of those who represent our country all over the world . "
Fox , who was sworn in earlier in June as Ambassador to the small European country , made a large donation in 2004 to the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
Senator Kerry was targeted by the group during his presidential campaign , and Fox failed to show much remorse for his contribution when the Massachusetts Democrat confronted him in a confirmation hearing earlier in the year .
Shortly before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing which would have recommended against sending Fox 's nomination to the Senate floor for a vote , President Bush withdrew the Republican donor 's nomination .
When the Senate went into recess , Bush made an April 4 recess appointment late in the day .
Senate Democrats immediately raised legal objections to Bush 's move .
They claimed that Fox could not draw a paycheck for his government service because the Senate had not confirmed him , and that it was also illegal for an ambassador to serve voluntarily .
They sought a opinion from the Government Accountability Office , Congress 's chief independent oversight entity , on whether Bush 's recess appointment was legally sound .
On June 8 , the GAO responded , although its letter to Senators Chris Dodd ( CT ) , Kerry , and Bob Casey ( PA ) was not publicized until Monday .
The GAO agreed that Fox could not receive a paycheck for his service .
" Mr. Fox is prohibited from receiving compensation for his recess appointment as Ambassador to Belgium until his nomination is approved by the Senate , " wrote Gary L. Kepplinger , the GAO 's General Counsel , a fact that the State Department had already apparently acknowledged .
But Kepplinger went on to say that Fox was allowed to serve voluntarily , as his circumstance was an exception to laws that ban voluntary service by government employees .
" Similar to the situation in which an employee gratuitously waives his compensation in advance , which is an exception to the voluntary services prohibition , Mr. Fox accepted the ambassadorial appointment with full knowledge that he would not be entitled to compensation , " he wrote to the senators .
The GAO counsel also argued that a restriction of the president 's recess appointment authority in this situation would have ramifications on the separation of powers .
" Serious constitutional issues would arise if Congress attempted to use the power of the purse to directly restrict the President from making a recess appointment , just as the courts have prevented Congress from restricting the Presidents pardon authority , " he argued .
Senator Dodd said he appreciated the GAO 's work , but continued to criticize the president for his action .
" I am glad that we were able to seek clarification from the GAO regarding the legality of this matter .
However , I still stand by my assertion that the manner in which the President recess - appointed Ambassador Fox was underhanded at best , " Dodd said in a statement released to RAW STORY .
" The American people deserve better from their President and their Ambassadors . "
It was unclear whether there would be any subsequent steps on the part of the Senate with regard to the Fox nomination .
RAW STORY reported in April that the Senate was considering forcing the President to send Fox 's nomination back to the Senate , where it would certainly face defeat .
But the Secretary of State 's legal counsel , John Bellinger , wrote to the GAO that " The President has not decided whether to renominate Mr. Fox . "
The Thirteen Towers constitute an ancient solar observatory
It comprises a group of 2,300 - year - old structures , known as the Thirteen Towers , which are found in the Chankillo archaeological site , Peru .
The towers span the annual rising and setting arcs of the Sun , providing a solar calendar to mark special dates .
The study is published in the journal Science .
Clive Ruggles , professor of archaeoastronomy at Leicester University , UK , said : " These towers have been known to exist for a century or so .
It seems extraordinary that nobody really recognised them for what they were for so long .
The towers have inset staircases
" I was gobsmacked when I saw them for the first time - the array of towers covers the entire solar arc . "
The Thirteen Towers of Chankillo run from north to south along the ridge of a low hill within the site ; they are relatively well - preserved and each has a pair of inset staircases leading to the summit .
The rectangular structures , between 75 and 125 square metres ( 807 - 1,345 sq ft ) in size , are regularly spaced - forming a " toothed " horizon with narrow gaps at regular intervals .
About 230 m ( 750 ft ) to the east and west are what scientists believe to be two observation points .
From these vantages , the 300 m - ( 1,000 ft - ) long spread of the towers along the horizon corresponds very closely to the rising and setting positions of the Sun over the year .
When viewed from the western observation point , the Sun appears to the left of the left - most tower
" For example , " said Professor Ruggles , " if you were stood at the western observing point , you would see the Sun coming up in the morning , but where it would appear along the span of towers would depend on the time of the year . "
" So , on the summer solstice , which is in December in Peru , you would see the Sun just to the right of the right - most tower ; for the winter solstice , in June , you would see the Sun rise to the left of the left - most tower ; and in - between , the Sun would move up and down the horizon . "
This means the ancient civilisation could have regulated a calendar , he said , by keeping track of the number of days it took for the Sun to move from tower to tower .
Sun cults
The site where the towers are based is about four square kilometres ( 1.5 square miles ) in size , and is believed to be a ceremonial centre that was occupied in the 4th Century BC .
It is based at the coast of Peru in the Casma - Sechin River Basin and contains many buildings and plazas , as well as a fortified temple that has attracted much attention .
The authors of the paper , who include Professor Ivan Ghezzi of the National Institute of Culture , Peru , believe the population was an ancient Sun cult and the observatory was used to mark special days in their solar calendar .
The site contains a number of interesting structures

Professor Ruggles said : " The western observing point , and to some extent , the eastern one , are very restricted - you could n't have got more than two or three people watching from them .
And all the evidence suggests that there was a formal or ceremonial approach to that point and that there were special rituals going on there .
" This implies that you have someone special - the priests perhaps - who watched the Sun rise or set , while in the plaza next door , the crowds were feasting and could see the Sun rise , but not from that special perspective .
Written records suggest the Incas were making solar observations by 1500 AD , and that their religion centred on Sun worship .
" We know that in Inca times , towers were used to observe the Sun near the solstices , which makes you speculate that there are elements of cult practice that go back a lot further , " Professor Ruggles told the BBC News website .

Angela Merkel faces determined opposition from Poland
The " constitutional concept ... is abandoned " , says a paper circulated by Germany , which will chair the summit .
The paper makes several concessions to EU member states opposed to key parts of the failed constitution .
But Poland and the UK are still warning they could use their vetoes if they do not get their way on a new treaty .
Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski said a veto remained " highly likely " while UK Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said no deal was better than a bad deal .
It does seem the British government has largely got its own way , although there 's a lot of detail to be settled
Mardell 's thoughts in full
Mrs Beckett told Parliament : " If it comes down to deal or no deal at this European Council the UK government is clear ... no deal is better than buying any old pig in a poke . "
She added that Britain wanted a Europe " of sovereign nations , not a superstate " .
The summit is intended to issue a mandate for an intergovernmental conference to agree the precise wording of a treaty to replace the failed constitution .
If it fails , it will plunge the EU into a political crisis as deep as the one that followed the rejection of the constitution by French and Dutch voters two years ago .
The German paper proposes that the new treaty is called " The Reform Treaty " , accepts that the EU will not have a " foreign minister " , and provides countries with a chance to opt out of EU policies in the area of policing and criminal law .
Correspondents say the biggest remaining problem for the UK could be Germany 's continued support for the idea of making the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding .
The UK fears this could allow the European Court to make decisions that would change British labour law .
Olive branch
We realise we cannot stop the process [ of reform ] - that would be too risky for the future
Jaroslaw Kaczynski
Q&A : EU constitution EU summit sticking points
However , the BBC's Oana Lungescu in Brussels says the German paper offers Poland a " discreet olive branch " .
For the first time it mentions , in a footnote , that the Poles , backed by the Czechs , want to raise the idea of changing the voting system at the summit .
The new system would benefit larger member states to the detriment of smaller and medium - sized ones , and have the effect of reducing Poland 's clout .
Despite his warnings of a possible veto , Mr Kaczynski hinted Poland could drop its opposition if it guaranteed a strong voice in EU decision - making .
" We realise we can not stop the process [ of reform ] - that would be too risky for the future , " Mr Kaczynski told Reuters news agency .
He said there was a 50 - 50 chance of the summit ending in agreement .
Under the latest German proposals , Britain gets reassurances that the European Courts will have no power to examine foreign affairs policies .
And at the request of the Dutch , the draft gives more power to national parliaments to block EU laws .
But a Dutch proposal to enshrine criteria for further enlargement in the treaty , is not fully satisfied .
That would send a very negative signal to Balkan countries , an EU diplomat said .
My Analysis of the Oregon FISA Decision :
1. Statutory Background
2. The Mayfield Case
3. My Take
There are two issues here , standing and the Fourth Amendment .
I am no standing expert , but Judge Aiken 's analysis of standing and ripness seemed quite weak and unpersuasive to me .
On the other hand , I thought her Fourth Amendment analysis was plausible on existing precedents but that the issue was too murky to call one way or the other .
a ) Standing
I find myself puzzled by Judge Aiken 's view that Mayfield has standing to bring a facial challenge to FISA because the government apparently coninues to possess " derivative evidence " of the earlier FISA searches .
As I understand it , the claim is that there are government agencies that still have files on Mayfield that contain information about the monitoring and searching of him .
I 'm not a standing expert , but I do n't understand why that could be a continuing injury in fact : what is the " concrete " and " particularized " injury to Mayfield if somewhere there is a file that has information about him ?
Under Judge Aiken 's approach , it would seem that everyone who was investigated in the past has ongoing injury in fact :
Investigators keep files , and those files say what the investigators learned .
Does the fact that somewhere some government computer has a record create an ongoing , concrete , and particularized injury in fact ?
I find this unlikely .
( As an aside , I wonder how this applies to human memory .
If an agent remembers what he saw inside Mayfield 's house , does the presence of that memory , stored as a network of neurons in the " computer " of the agent 's mind , create an ongoing injury in fact ? )
I was particularly unpersuaded by Judge Aiken 's conclusion that it is " likely , as opposed to merely speculative , that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision , " as required for standing by Lujan .
Judge Aiken 's theory here is obviously speculative : she hypothesizes that " it is reasonable to assume that [ if Mayfield wins , ] the Executive Branch of the government will act lawfully and make all reasonable efforts to destroy the derivative materials when a final declaration of the unconstitutionality of the challenged provisions is issued . "
But why ?
I do n't think I have ever heard of " purge of the files " as a Fourth Amendment remedy .
True , Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a suspect to file a motion for return of property unlawfully seized by a warrant search ; if granted , the remedy is return of the property .
But I do n't think I have ever heard of the government actually purging its files of all evidence or derivative evidence from a search — every report , every mention , etc .
The standard available remedies in Fourth Amendment cases are suppression of evidence and civil damages :
Is there now some kind of Constitutional requirement that all data collected has to be deleted , as well ?
Perhaps legislatures or courts should create such a requirement — very interesting question , I think — but Judge Aiken 's expectation that the government would sort of " do the right thing " and delete the files struck me as precisely the kind of speculation that does not satisfy Article III standing requirements .
b) The Fourth Amendment
The Fourth Amendment issues here are trickier , I think .
My tentative bottom line is that this issue is just really murky and there is no clearly correct answer : reasonable minds can differ .
Why do I think that ?
The problem is the fundamental murkiness of the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision in [ W ]e do not hold that the same type of standards and procedures prescribed [ in criminal cases under the Wiretap Act , known as " Title III " ] are necessarily applicable to this case .
We recognize that domestic security surveillance may involve different policy and practical considerations from the surveillance of " ordinary crime . "
The gathering of security intelligence is often long range and involves the interrelation of various sources and types of information .
The exact targets of such surveillance may be more difficult to identify than in surveillance operations against many types of crime specified in Title III .
Often , too , the emphasis of domestic intelligence gathering is on the prevention of unlawful activity or the enhancement of the Government 's preparedness for some possible future crisis or emergency .
Thus , the focus of domestic surveillance may be less precise than that directed against more conventional types of crime .
Given these potential distinctions between Title III criminal surveillances and those involving the domestic security , Congress may wish to consider protective standards for the latter which differ from those already prescribed for specified crimes in Title III .
Different standards may be compatible with the Fourth Amendment if they are reasonable both in relation to the legitimate need of Government for intelligence information and the protected rights of our citizens .
For the warrant application may vary according to the governmental interest to be enforced and the nature of citizen rights deserving protection .
. . .
It may be that Congress , for example , would judge that the application and affidavit showing probable cause need not follow the exact requirements of § 2518 , but should allege other circumstances more appropriate to domestic security cases ; that the request for prior court authorization could , in sensitive cases , be made to any member of a specially designated court ( e.g. , the District Court for the District of Columbia or the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ) ; and that the time and reporting requirements need not be so strict as those in § 2518 .
The FISA statute is dealing with a slightly different issue :
It is dealing with warrants for " foreign " intelligence collection , not " domestic " intelligence collection , the issue in the Keith case .
The U.S. Supreme Court has never decided whether some kind of warrant is needed for the collection of foreign intelligence collection , and if so , what kind of warrant is needed .
There are some pre-FISA circuit court precedents that allow totally warrantless monitoring in some circumstances , but they do n't address the constitutionality of the FISA standard under Keith .
But you can see the murkiness of the issue : According to Justice Powell 's reasoning in Keith , the government needs to chose a legal standard that is " reasonable both in relation to the legitimate need of Government for intelligence information and the protected rights of our citizens .
For the warrant application may vary according to the governmental interest to be enforced and the nature of citizen rights deserving protection . "
That does n't give us much guidance at all , so it 's not too surprising that you would have disagreement as to whether the Patriot Act 's standard is permitted .
The Foreign Intelligence Court of Review reached one conclusion ; Judge Aiken reached another ; and I do n't think the existing legal materials really give us very firm guidance as to which of those decisions is more correct under existing law .
I did find some of the characterizations of the FISA law in Judge Aiken 's decision to be incorrect , but I think there 's room in the cases to come out the way she does .
I should say that as a matter of policy , I think the Patriot Act amendment to FISA is a good idea .
If the government can establish probable cause to believe someone is a terrorist or a spy possessing foreign intelligence information , that should be enough to monitor them ; allowing the government to then use the evidence to prosecute the terrorist or spy in a criminal case seems sensible to me .
Indeed , there is an apparent irony in this entire topic :
Here the government actually wants to use the criminal court system in terrorism cases , which is usually seen among civil libertarians as a positive thing .
Forcing the government to conduct monitoring entirely outside the criminal court system seems unnecessary and unwise to me .
Nor am I particularly persuaded that this is " watering down " the traditional Fourth Amendment warrant process .
First , the government still needs to establish probable cause to a federal judge that someone is a terrorist or a spy with foreign intelligence information ; that 's not exactly a low standard , as the FISCR properly recognized .
It seems unlikely to me that the government would seek to circumvent the traditional Fourth Amendment standard of pc that a person committed a crime ( however minor ) simply by establishing pc that a person was a terrorist or a spy ; if that 's an easier threshold to meet , it 's not clear to me why .
Second , the Keith case that first held that there was a warrant requirement at least in domestic intelligence cases was also quick to say that it was n't the same warrant requirement as applies in criminal cases .
So if there was a watering down , it was in the same Keith case that first imposed warrant requirement in the first place .
Anyway , that 's how I tend to approach the policy question ( although I take it as a given that my answer to the policy question is n't relevant to the issue of whether Judge Aiken 's decision is right or wrong as a matter of Constitutional law -- except to the extent it would inform how I personally might balance reasonableness if I were the one wearing the robe , which obviously I 'm not ) .
The government will no doubt appeal , so we 'll have to see what happens next .
I 'm guessing the Ninth Circuit will reverse on standing , but that prediction is heavily dependent on the panel this case happens to draw .
And finally , I should emphasize that my analysis is tentative ; I 'm offering my instant reaction , but I do n't claim to have all the answers .
If you disagree with my take , I would greatly appreciate you calmly and carefully explaining why I am wrong and the basis for your disagreement ; that way I can understand my error and correct the post .

The problem is the fundamental murkiness of the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision in the Keith case in 1972 .
It 's one of these early 70s Powell opinions that leaves you scratching your head as to what it means .
( Powell had just become a Judge , and I think his early opinions in particular reflect him struggling with the craft . )
In that case , the U.S. Supreme Court held that if the government wants to wiretap members of a purely domestic group for national security reasons — that is , a group unrelated to any foreign power — it needs a warrant but the warrant does n't need to be a traditional criminal law warrant .
Some kind of " reasonable " warrant procedure was enough .
The FISA statute is dealing with a slightly different issue :
It is dealing with warrants for " foreign " intelligence collection , not " domestic " intelligence collection , the issue in the Keith case .

Yesterday , Judge Aiken of the U.S. District Court in Oregon handed down a decision that strikes down Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act 's provisions for granting warrants .
In this post , I wanted to explain the issue in the case and the decision 's reasoning , and then I wanted to offer some commentary on the decision .
My tentative bottom line : I found Judge Aiken 's decision unpersuasive on the question of Article III standing .
On the merits of the Fourth Amendment issue , I think the law is just too murky to call this one way or the other : Judge Aiken 's result appears plausible , although so does the contrary result embraced in 2002 by the Foreign Intelligence Court of Review .
First , some background .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act is the law the government uses to get warrants to monitor suspects terrorists and spies inside the United States .
Before the Patriot Act , the government could obtain a FISA warrant to search or monitor someone based on a probable cause showing that the person " is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power and that the primary purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information . "
The basic idea was that the government had to believe the person was a spy or terrorist ( an agent of a foreign power ) and that the real reason behind the evidence collection had to be to to protect national security by having the information ( that is , so the government can know what the spies and terrorists are doing ) .
The Patriot Act changed that standard , and it's those changes that are the issue in the new case .
The Patriot Act changed the language so that the standard for obtaining a evidence is probable cause showing that the person " is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power and that a significant purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information . "
The difference is subtle : the change from " the primary " to " a significant .
"
Why the change ?
The basic idea is to allow the government can get a warrant to monitor spies and terrorists without knowing ahead of time whether it wants to just collect information and keep it or whether it wants to bring a criminal prosecution .
Before the Patriot Act , the government had to choose at the beginning whether to take the criminal law route with traditional warrants ( based on probable cause that the search would reveal evidence of a crime ) or whether to take the FISA route and collect evidence to learn of terrorist plans without thinking about a possible criminal prosecution .
After the Patriot Act , the government can get a FISA warrant in a terrorism investigation and keep open whether it wants to treat the case as a crimal case or an intelligence case .
The intelligence information can go to the intelligence agencies , and the evidence of crime can go to the criminal investigators .
The Fourth Amendment issue raised in the Mayfield case is whether a warrant issued under the amended Patriot Act standard is good enough for Fourth Amendment purposes or whether it is too " loose " a standard to make FISA searches constitutionally reasonable .
This case is a civil lawsuit by Brandon Mayfield , an Oregon attorney who was surveilled and lated arrested and detained for two weeks as part of an investigation into the 2004 Madrid train bombings .
It turned out that Mayfield had nothing whatsoever to do with the bombings , and he was released .
After he was released , he sued the government on a range of claims .
The only issue left at this stage of the game is Mayfield 's Fourth Amendment claim .
Mayfield 's Fourth Amendment claim is somewhat unusual .
He does not argue that the government violated FISA when it obtained orders to monitor him and search his home .
Nor does he argued that his particular Fourth Amendment rights were violated in an as applied manner , the usual argument in Fourth Amendment cases .
Rather , he argues that the Patriot Act amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act made FISA warrants constitutionally inadequate as facial matter , such that the FISA warrants that were used to authorize surveillance of him were unlawful .
This particular opinion concerns Mayfield 's request for declaratory judgment that the Patriot Act amendments to FISA are constitutionally inadequate under the Fourth Amendment .
Judge Aiken granted the request , and struck down what is really the heart of FISA — the provisions allowing the FISA court to issue search warrants both for physical searches and for electronic surveillance .
There were two main issues in the opinion : First , did Mayfield have standing under Article III to bring the case , and second , did the FISA law actually violate the Fourth Amendment . a)
StandingJudge Aiken ruled that Mayfield did have standing to challenge the facial constitutionality of FISA because the government retained derivative evidence from the wiretapping against him .
That is , the government still had in its files records of items that had been collected from him .
According to Judge Aiken , this continuing possession of information in their files established an ongoing injury in fact .
Further , the injury in fact would be cured if Mayfield won the case , Judge Aiken ruled : " it is reasonable to assume that [ if Mayfield wins , ] the Executive Branch of the government will act lawfully and make all reasonable efforts to destroy the derivative materials when a final declaration of the unconstitutionality of the challenged provisions is issued . "
According to Judge Aiken , the government 's possession of derivative evidence and the possibility they would be destroyed if Mayfield won conferred Article III standing .b)
The Fourth AmendmentJudge Aiken then reaches the merits , and concludes that the Fourth Amendment does not permit the government to obtain warrants based on probable cause to believe that a person is an agent of a foreign power if foreign intelligence collection is only a significant purpose of the monitoring .
This standard lets the government search the homes and listen in on the calls of terrorist suspects and spies when the government is planning on bringing a criminal prosecution in the case .
But that 's not good enough , Judge Aiken concludes :
If the government is really approaching an investigation of a terrorist suspect or spy with an eye to charging them with a crime , they need to follow the traditional criminal law standard for a warrant .
That is , they need to obtain a warrant under the standard of probable cause to believe a crime was committed , not probable cause to believe the person is a terrorist or a spy .
Judge Aiken notes that her conclusion is contrary to the legal ruling of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review decision in In Re Sealed Case .
She concludes that In re Sealed Case is incorrect , and that the FISCR 's analysis is unpersuasive .
Because the current version of FISA adopts the Patriot Act standard , the provisions of FISA that authorize FISA warrants to be issued are invalid .
R. Stanley Williams , a Hewlett - Packard physicist , said this week that his group had begun manufacturing prototypes of a silicon chip that combines both conventional microelectronics and molecular scale components .
Their first hybrid device is a circuit called a field programmable gate array , or F.P.G.A. , using molecular - scale components as the configuration circuitry , an approach that will save tremendous space in the chip design .
A team of I.B.M. researchers at the company ’s Almaden Research Center in San Jose , Calif. , were able to use a scanning tunneling microscope to observe the magnetic orientation of iron and manganese atoms at low temperatures .
Controlling magnetic direction is a crucial technique that is used in reading and writing digital information on magnetic storage disks like standard hard drives .
In addition to the potential storage applications , the researchers noted that atomic - scale magnetic structures are also of scientific interest because they may be harnessed for quantum computing , a technology that would be far faster than current computers for some specialized uses .
A second group of I.B.M. scientists in Zurich were able to place two hydrogen atoms in an ultrathin insulating film and switch them back and forth between two states , creating the equivalent of the ones and zeroes used in standard chips .
They were also able to use the same switching process to inject an electric charge into one molecule and link the effect to a neighboring molecule .
That suggests it might be possible to extend the effect into a fabric of trillions of atom - size switches in the future .
The laboratory advances are far from being ready to commercialize , but they provide hope for the electronics industry , which has grown steadily because of the continuous shrinking in size and falling cost of components for more than four decades .

More than 50 % of Russians asked about global warming say they have n't heard much about it , according to a BBC World Service poll of 22,000 people in 21 countries .
It 's not easy to grow tomatoes in northern Russia
There are burning social issues , there 's uncertainty about the security , there 's a falling - out with the West , and , crucially , it is a very cold country .
A meteorologist in Arkhangelsk , in the north of Russia , once told me : " I know global warming is a problem , but I would welcome a bit of warmth up here .
Then I could grow my own tomatoes . "
We spoke as we stood on ice in the middle of the frozen Dvina river .
The temperature was approaching - 25C .
Melting permafrost
This meteorologist is by no means the only person in Russia to think this way .
His view virtually mirrors the state 's official position .
As the climate warms , more of Russia 's territory will be freed up for agriculture
Rinat Gizatullin , Natural Resources Ministry
Poll : Man fuels climate change
" If anything , we 'll be even better off : as the climate warms , more of Russia 's territory will be freed up for agriculture and industry . "
Alexey Kokorin of WWF in Russia says Russians who are aware of global warming tend to live in some of the worst affected areas , such as Siberia , with its melting permafrost , or the Caucasus , with its regular heatwaves .
The real problem , Mr Kokorin says , is not that people do n't know what 's going on , it is that they have some of the " weirdest ideas about what causes global warming , and they do n't feel the need to change things " .
Quota sale
The government says it is trying to educate people .
But , so far , most of the steps that have been taken have been aimed at businesses , not at ordinary Russians .
Russia has signed up to the Kyoto treaty , and the country is now expecting millions of dollars ' worth of investment .
Moscow 's hope is that Western polluters will be queuing up to buy its carbon emission quotas .
The money will then go into improving infrastructure and energy efficiency .
This approach alone - focusing more on the economy than ecology - may not convince Russians that the whole world is heating up .
But at least it will give the issue more prominence .
The survey was conducted for the BBC World Service by the international polling firm GlobeScan together with the Program on International Policy Attitudes ( Pipa ) at the University of Maryland .

Sometimes it does n’t matter whether you use language correctly , because people will think you ’re wrong even when you ’re not :
In your Fair Shake article , which was the New Urban Legend earlier this week , you have a link to other legends that include a thief or other wrong - doer getting a proper comeuppance .
Unfortunately , the link is title “ just deserts ” , and while some of the tales may indeed take place in the Mojave or the Sahara , you probably intended to link to legends involving “ just desserts ” ; that second S makes all the difference .
For example , when we established the “ Crime and Punishment ” section of this site , we created a category for tales about criminals whose punishments were meted out in unusual ways .
Like so many others before us ( particularly operators of bakeries and pastry shops ) , we played on the “ desert ” - “ dessert ” pun and called the section “ Just Desserts . ”
Before long we started receiving mail from readers chiding us for misspelling the phrase “ just deserts . ”
Eventually we gave up , removed the punning references , and renamed the section to the correctly spelled “ Just Deserts . ”
Then we began to receive even more mail from readers informing us that we had misspelled the phrase “ just desserts ” and providing us with mnemonics to help us remember the difference between “ desert ” and “ dessert ” :
You spell “ Dessert ” wrong in this link .
I think your intention is to refer to metaphor using the term for after dinner snack .
The way you spell it , “ Desert ” means a region that receives little rainfall .
A rule of thumb — Dessert has 2
S ’s because more people would select to have dessert than spend time in a desert .
It ’s lame but it helps you remember .
Just wanted to point out that under your “ Criminal ” section , you spelled “ Just Desserts ” wrong .
A desert is a barren expanse of land .
Desserts are yummy .
Just remember “ strawberry shortcake ” has two s’ and that ’s how many s’ desserts has !
The confusion is understandable , because it involves a little - known word whose correct spelling and pronunciation runs counter to that of two similar and much more commonly used words .
The noun “ desert ” ( accent on the first syllable ) is generally used to refer to an arid , barren expanse of land , while the noun “ dessert ” ( accent on the second syllable ) is a sweet course or dish usually served at the end of a meal .
However , the word “ desert , ” when spelled like the former but pronounced like the latter , also refers to a deserved reward or punishment .
Therefore , someone who does wrong and is punished in a suitable manner has received his “ just deserts . ”
Many people , unfamiliar with the “ reward or punishment ” meaning of the word “ desert , ” mistakenly assume that the phrase “ just deserts ” should be properly spelled as “ just desserts ” because of its pronunciation .
( The usual reasoning is that a dessert is a type of reward one is given at the end of a meal , so someone who receives suitable rewards or punishments for his actions has gotten his “ just desserts . ” )
When one gets what one deserves , good or bad , one is getting one ’s “ just deserts , ” accent on the second syllable but spelled like the arid , barren lands .
The central fact is that overwhelmingly suicide - terrorist attacks are not driven
by religion as much as they are by a clear strategic objective : to compel modern
democracies to withdraw military forces from the territory that the terrorists
view as their homeland .
From Lebanon to Sri Lanka to Chechnya to Kashmir to the
West Bank , every major suicide - terrorist campaign–over 95 percent of all the
incidents –has had as its central objective to compel a democratic state to
withdraw .
That ’s Robert Pape , author of Dying to Win : The Logic of Suicide Terrorism , an in interview from several years ago .
Steve Levitt points to the interview in one of his best posts .
Here ’s one bit from Levitt .

Schools are paying £ 200 to send teachers on courses where they learn how to help pupils cheat in exams and coursework , it was claimed yesterday .
Examiners were said to be doing a ' lucrative ' trade in seminars where they give teachers tips on how to inflate their pupils ' grades .
A - Level and GCSE examiners are charging teachers up to £ 200 - a- time to show them how to be ' generous ' in marking coursework without attracting the suspicion of exam watchdogs , it was claimed .
A new book , Education By Numbers : The Tyranny of Testing , says teachers are being given scripts of oral exams and a ' swag bag ' of key phrases guaranteed to score higher points .
Other tips include making children
aware of typical questions and model answers , which they are urged to memorise months in advance of exams .
Youngsters are also advised that they do n't need to master some of harder material .
Professor Alan Smithers , director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University , said the practice , which will fuel the debate on the pressures put on schools to meet Government targets , should be banned .
He said : " The gap between education and results is growing all the time .
These examiners are , in my view unethically , contributing to that process .
" It needs to be controlled in the same way that drug - taking by athletes needs to be controlled .
Just in the same way as drugs give a false impression of the capabilities of athletes , so does this kind of intensive preparation and teaching to the test give a false impression of abilities of children . "
The book 's author , education journalist Warwick Mansell , said he was allowed to attend two seminars held by French and history examiners , on condition their identities were not revealed .
The seminars are among hundreds run by private firms and exam boards .
The French examiner told teachers to advise pupils on what to write in coursework and give them a store of key phrases to write in exercise books and transfer into coursework later .
The examiner - who described this as the ' Burglar Bill swag bag ' - added : " If you do that , you are in with a shout .
Children like this idea of stealing . "
He urged teachers to be " realistically generous " in marking coursework so as not to attract the attention of moderators .
Teachers were also advised against teaching low - ability pupils much French grammar because it did not attract many marks at GCSE .
At the history seminar , the examiner told teachers not to bother aiming for the highest quality work because it was not necessary for achieving an A* grade .
" This is realpolitik , a question of ends justifying means , " the examiners said .
" The grade boundaries are lower than you might think . "
Professor Smithers said the problem was state schools were held to account via exam results which dictated their league table positions .
A spokesman for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority , which regulates exams , said : " The awarding bodies have common rules that govern the outside activities of examiners that work for them .
" The awarding body would take action if any outside activities represented a breach of contract . "
We were talking to Michael Isikoff of Newsweek on Friday 's show .
He pointed out that Democrats in Congress have more options in the US attorneys scandal than most people realize .
As most people already know , they could hold Harriet Miers , Josh Bolten , Karl Rove and Scott Jennings in contempt of Congress for not testifying about what they know in regards to the US attorney firings .
Then they would take it to the courts and wait for the judiciary to resolve executive privilege claims .
But that process would drag out for a long time and might not have a practical effect .
But there is another option .
They could order the Sergeant at Arms to arrest Harriet Miers and bring her in .
I want to be absolutely clear here , Isikoff is a reporter and he is not suggesting that they carry this option out .
He is simply pointing out that it is possible .
Here 's the relevant part of the transcript :
Michael Isikoff :
There is , very quickly , another option .
There 's something called inherent contempt where they can enforce contempt themselves .
They can have the Sergeant at Arms arrest Harriet Miers in the state of Texas and bring her to Washington for trial before the House , and incarcerate her .
That 's an option that has n't been used for years .
But it is a Constitutional option .
You can listen to this portion of the conversation or the whole interview here .
Now , how fun would this option be ?
Could anyone accuse the Democrats of not being strong enough if they had Harriet Miers arrested for contempt of Congress ?
How bad ass would it be to have the Sergeant at Arms handcuff her and bring her in to the Capitol ?
Of course , it 's really sad that a woman who was nominated to the Supreme Court a short while ago faces such legal trouble now because she and the president have decided that they are above the law and above the Congress .
Harriet , please turn yourself in peacefully .
Do n't make us send the Sergeant at Arms after you .

No one keeps track of time better than Ferenc Krausz .
In his lab at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching , Germany , he has clocked the shortest time intervals ever observed .
Krausz uses ultraviolet laser pulses to track the absurdly brief quantum leaps of electrons within atoms .
The events he probes last for about 100 attoseconds , or 100 quintillionths of a second .
For a little perspective , 100 attoseconds is to one second as a second is to 300 million years .
But even Krausz works far from the frontier of time .
There is a temporal realm called the Planck scale , where even attoseconds drag by like eons .
It marks the edge of known physics , a region where distances and intervals are so short that the very concepts of time and space start to break down .
Planck time — the smallest unit of time that has any physical meaning — is 10 - 43 second , less than a trillionth of a trillionth of an attosecond .
Beyond that ?
Tempus incognito .
At least for now .
Efforts to understand time below the Planck scale have led to an exceedingly strange juncture in physics .
The problem , in brief , is that time may not exist at the most fundamental level of physical reality .
If so , then what is time ?
And why is it so obviously and tyrannically omnipresent in our own experience ?
“ The meaning of time has become terribly problematic in contemporary physics , ” says Simon Saunders , a philosopher of physics at the University of Oxford .
“ The situation is so uncomfortable that by far the best thing to do is declare oneself an agnostic . ”
The trouble with time started a century ago , when Einstein ’s special and general theories of relativity demolished the idea of time as a universal constant .
One consequence is that the past , present , and future are not absolutes .
Einstein ’s theories also opened a rift in physics because the rules of general relativity ( which describe gravity and the large - scale structure of the cosmos ) seem incompatible with those of quantum physics ( which govern the realm of the tiny ) .
Some four decades ago , the renowned physicist John Wheeler , then at Princeton , and the late Bryce DeWitt , then at the University of North Carolina , developed an extraordinary equation that provides a possible framework for unifying relativity and quantum mechanics .
But the Wheeler - DeWitt equation has always been controversial , in part because it adds yet another , even more baffling twist to our understanding of time .
“ One finds that time just disappears from the Wheeler - DeWitt equation , ” says Carlo Rovelli , a physicist at the University of the Mediterranean in Marseille , France .
“ It is an issue that many theorists have puzzled about .
It may be that the best way to think about quantum reality is to give up the notion of time — that the fundamental description of the universe must be timeless . ”
No one has yet succeeded in using the Wheeler - DeWitt equation to integrate quantum theory with general relativity .
Nevertheless , a sizable minority of physicists , Rovelli included , believe that any successful merger of the two great masterpieces of 20th - century physics will inevitably describe a universe in which , ultimately , there is no time .
The possibility that time may not exist is known among physicists as the “ problem of time . ”
It may be the biggest , but it is far from the only temporal conundrum .
Vying for second place is this strange fact :
The laws of physics do n’t explain why time always points to the future .
All the laws — whether Newton ’s , Einstein ’s , or the quirky quantum rules — would work equally well if time ran backward .
As far as we can tell , though , time is a one - way process ; it never reverses , even though no laws restrict it .
“ It ’s quite mysterious why we have such an obvious arrow of time , ” says Seth Lloyd , a quantum mechanical engineer at MIT .
( When I ask him what time it is , he answers , “ Beats me .
Are we done ? ” )
“ The usual explanation of this is that in order to specify what happens to a system , you not only have to specify the physical laws , but you have to specify some initial or final condition . ”
The mother of all initial conditions , Lloyd says , was the Big Bang .
Physicists believe that the universe started as a very simple , extremely compact ball of energy .
Although the laws of physics themselves do n’t provide for an arrow of time , the ongoing expansion of the universe does .
As the universe expands , it becomes ever more complex and disorderly .
The growing disorder — physicists call it an increase in entropy — is driven by the expansion of the universe , which may be the origin of what we think of as the ceaseless forward march of time .
Time , in this view , is not something that exists apart from the universe .
There is no clock ticking outside the cosmos .
Most of us tend to think of time the way Newton did : “ Absolute , true and mathematical time , of itself , and from its own nature , flows equably , without regard to anything external . ”
But as Einstein proved , time is part of the fabric of the universe .
Contrary to what Newton believed , our ordinary clocks do n’t measure something that ’s independent of the universe .
In fact , says Lloyd , clocks do n’t really measure time at all .
“ I recently went to the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder , ” says Lloyd .
( NIST is the government lab that houses the atomic clock that standardizes time for the nation . )
“ I said something like , ‘ Your clocks measure time very accurately . ’
They told me , ‘ Our clocks do not measure time . ’
I thought , Wow , that ’s very humble of these guys .
But they said , ‘ No , time is defined to be what our clocks measure . ’
Which is true .
They define the time standards for the globe :
Time is defined by the number of clicks of their clocks . ”
Rovelli , the advocate of a timeless universe , says the NIST timekeepers have it right .
Moreover , their point of view is consistent with the Wheeler - DeWitt equation .
“ We never really see time , ” he says .
“ We see only clocks .
If you say this object moves , what you really mean is that this object is here when the hand of your clock is here , and so on .
We say we measure time with clocks , but we see only the hands of the clocks , not time itself .
And the hands of a clock are a physical variable like any other .
So in a sense we cheat because what we really observe are physical variables as a function of other physical variables , but we represent that as if everything is evolving in time .
“ What happens with the Wheeler - DeWitt equation is that we have to stop playing this game .
Instead of introducing this fictitious variable — time , which itself is not observable — we should just describe how the variables are related to one another .
The question is ,
Is time a fundamental property of reality or just the macroscopic appearance of things ?
I would say it ’s only a macroscopic effect .
It ’s something that emerges only for big things . ”
By “ big things , ” Rovelli means anything that exists much above the mysterious Planck scale .
As of now there is no physical theory that completely describes what the universe is like below the Planck scale .
One possibility is that if physicists ever manage to unify quantum theory and general relativity , space and time will be described by some modified version of quantum mechanics .
In such a theory , space and time would no longer be smooth and continuous .
Rather , they would consist of discrete fragments — quanta , in the argot of physics — just as light is composed of individual bundles of energy called photons .
These would be the building blocks of space and time .
It ’s not easy to imagine space and time being made of something else .
Where would the components of space and time exist , if not in space and time ?
The problem , in brief , is that time may not exist at the most fundamental level of physical reality .
As Rovelli explains it , in quantum mechanics all particles of matter and energy can also be described as waves .
And waves have an unusual property :
An infinite number of them can exist in the same location .
If time and space are one day shown to consist of quanta , the quanta could all exist piled together in a single dimensionless point .
“ Space and time in some sense melt in this picture , ” says Rovelli .
“ There is no space anymore .
There are just quanta kind of living on top of one another without being immersed in a space . ”
Rovelli has been working with one of the world ’s leading mathematicians , Alain Connes of the College of France in Paris , on this notion .
Together they have developed a framework to show how the thing we experience as time might emerge from a more fundamental , timeless reality .
As Rovelli describes it , “ Time may be an approximate concept that emerges at large scales — a bit like the concept of ‘ surface of the water , ’ which makes sense macroscopically but which loses a precise sense at the level of the atoms . ”
Realizing that his explanation may only be deepening the mystery of time , Rovelli says that much of the knowledge that we now take for granted was once considered equally perplexing .
“ I realize that the picture is not intuitive .
But this is what fundamental physics is about : finding new ways of thinking about the world and proposing them and seeing if they work .
I think that when Galileo said that the Earth was spinning crazily around , it was utterly incomprehensible in the same manner .
Space for Copernicus was not the same as space for Newton , and space for Newton was not the same as space for Einstein .
We always learn a little bit more . ”
Einstein , for one , found solace in his revolutionary sense of time .
In March 1955 , when his lifelong friend Michele Besso died , he wrote a letter consoling Besso ’s family : “ Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me .
That means nothing .
People like us , who believe in physics , know that the distinction between past , present , and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion . ”
Rovelli senses another temporal breakthrough just around the corner .
“ Einstein ’s 1905 paper came out and suddenly changed people ’s thinking about space - time .
We ’re again in the middle of something like that , ” he says .
When the dust settles , time — whatever it may be — could turn out to be even stranger and more illusory than even Einstein could imagine .
WATERBURY , Vt. — Green Mountain Coffee Roasters makes a lot of money selling individual servings of ground coffee in white cups that are churned out by the millions from a hissing , clanking production line here .
But it recently found a way to generate even greater profits from the operation that will require only a modest investment .
Spending $ 150 to $ 200 to install a more efficient blower to cool the laser that carves the date and batch number into each passing cup will cut Green Mountain ’s annual electricity bill for each laser by about $ 200 , says Paul Comey , its vice president for environmental affairs .
That might not seem like much , except that the company has 40 such lasers , which it plans to upgrade this week .
Green Mountain Coffee was persuaded to undertake such improvements in efficiency through an unusual effort by the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation , which is under contract with the state to find thousands of such energy savings .
Opportunities like this abound in the commercial and industrial sectors , requiring no new research or technology .
But few places are doing an effective job of finding them , experts say .

Second thoughts …
Sunday , December 31st , 2006
I am having second thoughts about the International Poster Design book as our first title .
Perhaps I am feeling the pressure , but I think our first book will be a statement about what people can expect from SERIF , and the poster design book ( as much as I am personally interested in poster design ) seems like a cop out .
I walked down to Waterstones and looked through the design section , and picked out Altitude , which is a stunning book with a really original binding .
The binding must have added $ 5 to the cover price of every book , but it was well worth it .
It reminded me of the importance of detail in our publications .
The design section in Waterstones was packed full of books showing examples of ‘ the best design ’ do we really want to add to this tired genre ?
I spoke with a fellow publisher this morning and was stunned to hear his story about a gigantic personal search problem he has in Google .
The EU has put into place privacy requirements forcing Google to remove results when certain conditions exist and this story is a good example why that is a good idea .
There 's a news item posted online about a former business partner indicted on embezzlement charges and the photo from 2 years ago includes my publisher friend & his former partner standing side by side .
And the item is # 3 in a Google search for his name .
He 's unable to get that result removed by making requests to Google and the paper because there 's not legal argument to force removal .
He told me he had found a solution to delete Google results in a service offered by imfy.us .
They are a search results removal service that uses search engine optimization to push down problem search results .
They do this by optimizing other sites to outrank the problem result , in effect pushing it down in a way that is both legal and ethical .
But just the fact that he has to deal with this crap makes me clamor for a better way !
Google has a huge problem that needs addressing now .

Peter Saville interview

“ Tschichold ’s classicism is reductive .
And precise in a way that 18th or 19th century typography would n’t be .
You can tell the difference between a piece of Tschichold ’s work in the 50s , even though it ’s using all the furniture of the 18th century you can tell that it ’s not the 18th century .
You can tell that it ’s after modernism .
You can see the difference .
And I loved it . ”

Beautiful lazer - cut gift envelopes
Sunday , December 31st , 2006
The Li Xi Gift Envelope combines Asian tradition , craft and symbolism with a twist of modern design .
Traditionally envelopes like these were given during the Chinese New Year , but in an effort to preserve this child - hood memory in a modern world .
Created by award winning designers Dominic D’Andrea and Tram Pham , a laser - cut version which allowed a much higher level of detail in comparison to the old - school traditional die-cutting methods .
The results , as you can see are delicate , beautiful and quite impressive .

Inspired by Tokyo
Wednesday , February 28th , 2007
I was approached by Grafik magazine to be one of 100 designers included in a book they are doing to celebrate their 150th issue , and had to write about something that inspires me , unfortunately , someone else got to Tokyo first , so I have to go back to the drawing board .
Here is my piece on Tokyo anyway :
Stepping out of your everyday environment and visiting somewhere new is always an inspiration , you look at everyday objects with a renewed childlike fascination , and for me nowhere is this as true as in Tokyo .
The iconic image of Tokyo is neon signs wrapped around buildings .
They could be advertising anything , but if like me you ca n’t read Japanese then the words are just huge graphic symbols in a moving digital canvas .
Shinjuku is one of the most graphic of these shrines to neon , and home to hundreds of arcades packed full of games you have never heard of , with Japanese punks , businessmen and school girls crowded around them .
While I love the gratuitous use of neon and the crowded arcades of Shinjuku , I think it is the little differences that inspire me the most .
The manhole covers with graphic symbols of cherry blossom , street and underground signs in a kind of Japanese Helvetica , television with confused American celebrities , window shopping in gadget superstores and spotting the world ’s most unique teenage fashion .
When I come home from Tokyo I always have thousands of pictures , bags full of leaflets , magazines , tickets and beermats , and lots of inspiration .

Yokoland
Wednesday , February 28th , 2007
Nice work from South America Yokoland ’s first exhibition in the UK .
Yokoland is a young Norwegian design collective .
Their brazen and homespun work is best appreciated as a multi-facetted and seemingly insatiable approach to cultural production .
Known for photography , painting , sculpture , and outdoor installations as well as designing T - shirts , theatre sets , books , album covers and websites , Yokoland ’s cross - disciplinary practice also extends to the Metronomicon Audio music label .
Critic Nick Currie has applauded Yokoland as , “ A breath of fresh art [ whose works are often typified by ] groovy organic shapes and colours , a sense of friendly approachability , an infectious appetite for scribbling , and plenty of fat cut - out letters wading across quirky found photos . ”
In 2006 Yokoland was the subject of an extensive monograph published by Die Gestalten Verlag .

They had paid to sponsor a section in the awards , but as with some categories this year , the judges did n’t award anything , so the sponsor did n’t get their 2 minutes on stage to get a nice press shot etc .
No one had told them of this before the awards , so they had a table , they were ready to go up on stage etc , the result , one very pissed off sponsor ( to go with all the pissed off design firms ) .

Cinnamon has long been a popular spice in baking and cooking .
Research has found that it is not only delicious but it ’s healthy , too .
Just make sure that you ’re buying true cinnamon and not cassia , which is often sold as cinnamon in stores .
Here are 10 Health Benefits of Cinnamon that may make you want to include it in your diet every day .
Lower Cholesterol
Studies have shown that just 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon per day can lower LDL cholesterol .
Blood Sugar Regulation
Several studies suggest that cinnamon may have a regulatory effect on blood sugar , making it especially beneficial for people with Type 2 diabetes .
Yeast Infection Help
In some studies , cinnamon has shown an amazing ability to stop medication - resistant yeast infections .
Cancer Prevention
In a study published by researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Maryland , cinnamon reduced the proliferation of leukemia and lymphoma cancer cells .
Anti-Clotting
It has an anti-clotting effect on the blood .
Arthritis Relief
In a study at Copenhagen University , patients given half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder combined with one tablespoon of honey every morning before breakfast had significant relief in arthritis pain after one week and could walk without pain within one month .
Anti-Bacterial
When added to food , it inhibits bacterial growth and food spoilage , making it a natural food preservative .
Brain Health
One study found that smelling cinnamon boosts cognitive function and memory .
E. Coli Fighter
Researchers at Kansas State University found that cinnamon fights the E. coli bacteria in unpasteurized juices .
High in Nutrients
It is a great source of manganese , fiber , iron , and calcium .
If you ’re ready to start taking cinnamon as a natural remedy , check out the 4 Best Cinnamon Powders to see what the best true cinnamon , or Ceylon cinnamon , is according to user reviews .
Most people who bother at all would probably admit that the English of the worldwide web - verbose , rambling and ill - tempered - is not really the kind they want to read in a book or a newspaper .
But it 's generally assumed that , because this is the web , we can not do a thing about it .
Our civilisation has been transformed by the internet in a way unprecedented since the time of Gutenberg and Caxton and the means of mass communication , so the argument runs , must adapt to the global language of 24/ 7 .
It follows that any struggle against the abuse and impoverishment of English in blogs and emails is a sentimental archaism .
Underneath this belief lies the recognition that language is a natural growth and not an instrument we can shape for or police for better self - expression .
Does any of this sound familiar ?
If you look up Orwell 's Politics and the English Language , you will find that I have simply adapted his opening paragraph - and his more general concerns about the language - for the internet .
It 's interesting to do this because among Orwell 's heirs , the writers and journalists of today , there 's anxiety about the quality of English prose in the lawless domains of cyberspace .
In 1946 , Orwell said English was ' in a bad way ' .
In 2007 , quite a lot of people would probably concede a dismay at the overall crassness of contemporary ' cyberprose ' .
But such is the general nervousness and incomprehension about the internet revolution that no one is willing to articulate this .
It 's also interesting to set Orwell 's celebrated call to arms next to the practices of the internet because , among the guardians of cyber culture , the author of Nineteen Eighty - Four remains a household god .
The same people who trumpet the ' democratic ' qualities of the internet would probably cite his famous essay approvingly in any discussion of English today .
On closer inspection , Orwell 's jeremiad turns out to have been misjudged .
He was right that Forties English was ' full of bad habits ' ( dying metaphors , pretentious diction , meaningless words ) , but wrong to think that ' the decadence of our language ' , a typically Orwellian formulation , was irreversible .
From many points of view , the story of Anglo - American English from 1950 , the year of his early death , to 1991 , the year Tim Berners - Lee launched the worldwide web , is of a language going from strength to strength in vitality and range .
Not coincidentally , it was during these Cold War years that the left - wing jargon that shaped the linguistic landscape of 1946 swiftly became derelict .
Who , in the online fever of the new millennium , talks about ' the class struggle ' or ' the dictatorship of the proletariat ?
Drab phrases like ' ring the changes ' and ' grist to the mill ' have no doubt become part of the weave of everyday English , but they are counterbalanced by the astonishing freshness of a rejuvenated English derived from cultural traditions unavailable to a postwar English literary man educated at Eton and obsessed with socialism .
If there was a threat to English , it came from technology , not ideology .
After Orwell , English did not suddenly recover the clarity and simplicity of the King James Bible .
Management - speak and sociological claptrap still flourished , but the infusion of vigorous Americanisms and vivid demotic usage from popular culture helped to confound Orwell 's direst predictions .
At the high end , the use of English by the young writers of the Fifties and Sixties such as Pinter , Naipaul , Roth , Spark , Updike and Burgess rescued the culture from the thing that Orwell most detested : ' Lies , evasions , petty hatred and schizophrenia . '
By the Eighties , and the arrival of the Rushdie - Ishiguro generation , English had become a medium of almost limitless surprise , matched by an equally stupendous breakthrough in the means of mass communications .
Global English now entered the phase , in Michael Lewis 's expression , of ' the new new thing ' .
When laptops and the internet first appeared , the inky paraphernalia of typewriters , carbons and flimsy paper familiar to Orwell 's contemporaries was tossed into the dustbin of literary history .
Briefly , perpetual technological innovation was exhilarating .
New ways of transmitting ideas , words and expressions came thick and fast .
The OED went online , quickening the pace of linguistic innovation .
The first time I used ' weblog ' , in a magazine story about Arnold Schwarzenegger in September 2003 , The Observer had to place the meaning of this exotic term in square brackets .
Six months later , ' blogging ' was common .
By 2005 , some 60 new blogs were being launched every minute .
Now just in its second decade , the blogosphere is at once wonderful and horrible .
For the global community , fumbling towards some common ground , the opportunity it affords for extraordinary cross-cultural interaction is liberating and unprecedented .
The Baghdad Blogger is just one example of the blogosphere at its finest .
For everyone to have a voice , in the most unpropitious circumstances , is the fulfilment of a dream .
Yet the democracy of the web is in danger of becoming a cacophonous nightmare .
For every carefully crafted , thoughtful expression of opinion , there are a score of half - baked rants : ignorant , bilious , semi-literate and depressing .
So where does this leave English prose ?
Journalists used to justify the ephemeral nature of their work by claiming , defensively , that newspapers provided ' the first draft of history ' .
Such justifications have been made meaningless by the web .
Now , if your version does n't have a presence in the rolling news of 24/7 , it simply does not exist .
However , the form in which is does exist should give us pause .
Spontaneity is a virtue , but so is mature reflection .
There 's another thing that Orwell the great freelance would have been quick to identify : in the blogosphere , no one gets properly paid ; its irresponsibility is proportionate to its remoteness from the cash nexus .
Worse , the blogosphere , to which all journalists are now professionally committed , not only challenges the old infrastructure of print , but it also sponsors a new prolixity .
From the Orwellian point of view , it is the violence the internet does to the English language as much as its challenge to the journalistic infrastructure that is the biggest anxiety .

In a previous post I argue that software development is inherently unpredictable .
I believe the best metaphor for software is a growing human relationship from first meeting to marriage .
Relationships like software grow along a predictable path–but at a random , unpredictable rate .
Thus they perfectly illustrate the nature of a software “ project ” with too many unknowns to allow for a predictable schedule .
Effectively creating software requires a process that can flex with this unpredictability and still produce useful results .
Fundamentally there are 3 levers that control software development .
1 ) Risk
2 ) Scope
3 ) Schedule
Risk
To have any hope of consistently delivering software developers must have control over risk .
This includes things like : leaving room in the budget for beefier hardware , developing and testing key architectural components before investing too heavily in the rest of the code , identifying scalability bottlenecks and testing them with code fragments that simulate full system activity , etc .
Unfortunately , risk is consistently underestimated and often costs are cut in this area with catastrophic results .
In particular the concept of risk can be hard to get across to non-technical users .
Many people outside of IT misinterpret open and honest discussions of risk as a lack of confidence .
Personally , I ’ve found the best way to approach risk with non-technical people is to ( over ) explain the reason for discussing risk in detail — namely that is how we avoid problems to produce “ SUCCESS ” !
We programmers ( and other IT people ) take it for granted that risk management is yellow brick road that leads to Oz , but non-technical users do not have knowledge hard wired in .
As the technical expert we programmers are often expected to double as teachers for those without the benefit of our technical training .
For those still in school — analyze your favorite teachers and take some notes of their methods .
Teaching skills can be a real asset to a programming career .
Scope
Control over scope is rare .
There is the infamous “ scope creep ” that runs havoc , but even more insidious is hidden scope .
I ca n’t count how many times I ’ve had a request that seemed fairly straight - forward .
Then somewhere between two days and two weeks later I learn some funky little quirk in the business process that totally trips up the design .
The requirements remain unchanged while the project balloons to 4 times its original size .
A few software houses have managed to control scope .
Intuit makers of popular financial software releases new products on a yearly cycle .
There are some hard - fast scope requirements — tax law for example — but most of their scope is flexible .
Features that are n’t stable in time for the 2008 version end up in the 2009 edition .
Starting with Windows 95 Microsoft seemed to be flirting with that model , but their markets ( or maybe the company itself ) seem to prefer well defined improvements in scope over precise release schedules so they never have been able to deliver consistently timed releases .
Since 2000 they seem to be steadily drifting away from dated releases .
( Ironically this excluding IT oriented products –SQL Server and Visual Studio — we developers like our naming schemes simple and mathematical .
Just the word “ Vista ” is enough to make me physically ill .
J )
Schedule
While scope is somewhat flexible it is typically not flexible enough to account for all the unexpected roadblocks .
The only other alterative is to vary the schedule enough to allow for the work to be completed .
Management ( particularly non-IT management ) finds this unsettling .
Many of the software horror stories circulating today have their origin in management that is unwilling to sacrifice either scope or schedule and end up sacrificing staff instead .
In order to work around the scope / schedule problem some have resorted to saying —
“ We can meet the schedule , but must cut quality . ”
Personally , I see this as a cop out .
Quality is an attribute of scope .
A buggy or hard to use solution is an unfinished solution .
Phrasing scope in terms of “ quality ” might be easier for non-technical people to understand .
However , it gives the idea that quality is optional .
The results are rarely pretty .
Personally , my approach to schedule management is to keep a close relationship with my user / customer community updating them regularly on the status and challenges of the current project .
Initially this approach often results in a burst of initial scope when people realize that someone in IT is finally listening !
However , it ’s not long before a balance emerges .
I ’ve found that ( most ) customers will voluntarily cut / modify scope in order to achieve their top priorities within a reasonable schedule .
However , a note of warning is due here .
A key part of a good relationship with a customer is to emphasize the infrastructural investments that must be made .
The customer must “ own ” not only their features , but the entire system that supports those features .
Otherwise they wo n’t value / appreciate the huge investment that must be made .
Software is a lot like an ice - berg .
That 20 % that is visible — the UI — is supported by 80 % that is under the water .
Summary
Far too often programmers are left without control of scope or schedule and are forced to absorb the randomness of software development by working extra hours .
If the software industry recognized the true nature of software we ’d abandon our project - centric approach and turn to a more dynamic model .
( I see signs of this in the current wave of web 2.0 companies )
One of evolving systems ( or sets of interacting systems ) developed over the long - term with an eye towards process and integration .
Additional Reading :
In this article Joel Spolsky comments that the construction phase of software can be estimated with decent accuracy , but the design and bug fixing phases of software are unpredictable .
An interesting idea with a number of practical applications .

In C. S. Lewis science fiction dystopia , That Hideous Strength , the secretive organization which controls the state has its agents writing in newspapers on all sides of the political spectrum , in order to disguise its power with the appearance of plurality .
In todays West , by contrast , even the appearance of plurality seems to have been discarded .
The murder on 7th October of the Russian journalist , Anna Politkovskaya , was greeted with the monolithic unanimity which has now become the hallmark of the so - called free press in the West .
The right - wing Daily Telegraph devoted a leader to her murder on 9th October , the first sentence of which was :
 People sometimes pay with their lives for saying out loud what they think ,  Anna Politkovskaya said last year of Vladimir Putins Russia .
The same day , the left - wing Guardian also published a leader about her murder .
Its first sentence read :
 People sometimes pay with their lives for saying out loud what they think ,  Anna Politkovskaya told a conference on press freedom last December .
The whole of the British , American and West European press extolled Politkovskaya as one of Russias bravest and most brilliant journalists  ( The Guardian ) , one of the few voices that dared contradict the party line  ( The Daily Telegraph ) , a firebrand for freedom ( The Independent ) ,  the most famous investigative journalist in Russia ( The Times ) , one of the bravest journalists [ in Russia ]  ( The New York Times ) ; a victim of rare courage  ( The Washington Post ) .
All these quotes are from the leader articles which each paper thought worth devoting to her death .
In reality , Politkovskaya was virtually unknown in Russia .
The reaction of a wealthy Russian businessman dining in Brussels on the night of her murder was typical :
 Politkovskaya ?
Never heard of her . 
Politkovskaya in this respect resembles another murdered Russian - speaking journalist with connections in the Caucasus , Georgiy Gongadze , the Ukrainian citizen with a Georgian surname whose murder in 2000 was instrumentalized by the United States in an attempt to implicate the then Ukrainian president , Leonid Kuchma .
Politkvskaya was not quite as obscure as Gongadze : he ran a mere web site ( although this meant that when he traveled to Washington DC he was received by the Secretary of State , Madeleine Albright ) while the newspaper where she worked , Novaya Gazeta , had a circulation of 250,000 .
Still , that is not much in a country of nearly 150 million inhabitants and certainly not enough to merit the exaggerated praise heaped posthumously upon her .
The media in Britain and America also competed with one another to lay the blame for the murder squarely at President Putins door .
The Financial Times announced that ,
 In a broad sense , Mr. Putin bears responsibility for creating , through the Kremlins long - standing assault on the independent media , an atmosphere in which such killings can happen . 
The Washington Post asserted pompously that ,
 It is quite possible , without performing any detective work , to say what is ultimately responsible for these deaths :
It is the climate of brutality that has flourished under Mr. Putin . 
All papers implied that Mrs. Politkovskaya had been killed by allies of the Russian President for reporting the truth about the war in Chechnya .
According to them , Russia is a quasi - dictatorship in which the government brooks no dissent , and they illustrated this by referring back  albeit in strangely vague terms  to the number of other journalists who have been victims of similar contract killings .
It is here that we can put our fingers firmly on the page and shout ,  Liars ! 
Some of these articles contained glancing references to the last journalist to have been killed in Moscow , the American editor of Forbes magazine , Paul Klebnikov , but none of them bothered to add the key rider that no one has ever suggested that the Russian government had Klebnikov murdered .
On the contrary :
whereas Politkovskaya was an anti-Putin militant , Klebnikov was an anti-oligarch militant .
He wrote a brilliant book about Boris Berezovsky  one of the most informative books about Russias transition in the 1990s , in which he accused Berezovsky of murder and of being hand in glove with Chechen drug lords and gangsters  and he published a series of interviews with one of the Chechen separatist leaders , which he undiplomatically entitled  Conversations with a barbarian .
He was rewarded for his efforts with a bullet in the head .
When he died , there were no paeans of praise for his bravery or courage in the Western press , even though he was an American , for Klebnikov had devoted his life to arguing that the Wests policy in Russia is based on an alliance with very serious criminals , and that the businessmen whom the West champions as freedom fighters 
Berezovsky has political asylum in Britain  are in fact a bunch of ruthless murderers .
In contrast to both Klebnikov and Politkovskaya , the one murdered Russian journalist whom all Russians had heard of when he died  and whose name is virtually unknown in the West  was Vlad Listyev .
When he fell under the assassins bullets on the night of 1st March 1995 , Listyev was Russias most popular talk show host and one of the most trusted people in the country  a genuine TV superstar .
He had just become director of Russias main TV channel , ORT ( now First Channel ) .
In spite of Listyevs immense fame , the Western media never cited his murder as an example of the lawlessness or intolerance of the then president , Boris Yeltsin , in the way that they now attack Putin .
This is doubtless because  to use the charming euphemisms of Wikipedia 
 When Listyev put the middlemen advertising agencies out of business , he deprived many corrupt businessmen of a source for enormous profits .
In plain English , this means that most Russians believe that Listyev was murdered either by Boris Berezovsky  who took control of ORT immediately after Listyevs murder , and in large measure because of it  or by Vladimir Guzinski , a rival TV magnate who , like Berezovsky , is a Yeltsin - era oligarch now in exile .
The only journalist from the West who did discuss openly whether the contract to kill Listyev had come from Berezovsky , Guzinsky or Berezovskys ally , the advertising mogul , Sergei Lisovsky , was , oddly enough , Paul Klebnikov .
Politkovskayas colleagues on Novaya Gazeta include notorious pro-American commentators like the independent Moscow - based defense analyst ,  Pavel Felgenhauer , whose also works as a columnist for the Jamestown Foundation : the Director of that body , Glen Howard , is Executive Director of the American Committee for Peace in Chechnya , a neo-con outfit which campaigns for a political settlement with the terrorists in that North Caucasus province of the Russian federation .
This may explain why you can find only one opinion about Politkovskaya in the Western media .
At the same time , by contrast , there is a huge variety of opinions about her murder in supposedly dictatorial Russia itself .
The theories now circulating in Moscow about Politkovskayas murder include ( apart from the claim that the Russian government or the Chechen authorities were responsible ) :
revenge by corrupt police who found themselves wanted or in prison as a result of her sensationalist journalism ;
a conspiracy by opponents of the Russian president and the Chechen Prime Minister , Ramzan Kadyrov , to discredit them ;
revenge by former Chechen militants ;
a murder carried out by Russian nationalist opponents of Putin ( her name was on the death - lists of various neo - Nazi groups ) ;
a political provocation designed to discredit the Chechen authorities or trigger some movement in that troublesome province ;
or a conspiracy by opponents of Russia from the former Soviet Republic of Georgia with which Moscow is currently engaged in a fierce diplomatic row .
Take your pick  but the sheer variety of points of view gives the lie to the claim that Politkovskaya was fighting a monolithic media machine controlled by the government .
Among the many points of view expressed , few were pithier than this one from a commentator for Lentacom.ru ,
Politkovskayas murder spells unambiguous benefits for the West .
The past month saw massive unofficial clampdown on Russia .
Take the attempts to pull Ukraine into NATO .
Take the alliances intensive dialogue with Georgia .
Take Saakashvilis behavior [ the President of Georgia ] , very humiliating for Russia , which has been certainly agreed with the West .
Theoretically , Politkovskayas murder diverts attention from Georgia and builds up western pressures on Russia , something todays Georgia can only benefit from .
Yet , I believe that those who had ordered the crime are more global .
There is no immediate evidence somebody in the West issued direct instructions .
It is beyond doubt , though , that the West is a direct beneficiary .
One does not have to believe this conspiracy theory , or any of the others .
But at least if one is Russian , the consumer of news has a large number of different points of view to consider , all of which are easily accessible to the ordinary Russian by buying the newspaper or looking at the Internet .
In the West , by contrast , even the most assiduous conspiracy theorist will have great difficulty finding anything other than the party line that Mr. Putin did it .
Now , what does that tell you about the state of political and media pluralism in the West ?

The Best of John Laughland
washington --
The Justice Department is putting the final touches on regulations that could give Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales important new sway over death penalty cases in California and other states , including the power to shorten the time that death row inmates have to appeal convictions to federal courts .
The rules implement a little - noticed provision in last year ’s reauthorization of the Patriot Act that gives the attorney general the power to decide whether individual states are providing adequate counsel for defendants in death penalty cases .
The authority has been held by federal judges .
Under the rules now being prepared , if a state requested it and Gonzales agreed , prosecutors could use “ fast track ” procedures that could shave years off the time that a death row inmate has to appeal to the federal courts after conviction in a state court .
The move to shorten the appeals process and effectively speed up executions comes at a time of growing national concern about the fairness of the death penalty , underscored by the use of DNA testing to establish the innocence of more than a dozen death row inmates in recent years .
Advertisement
Amid the public debate , the number of people executed in the U.S. has declined steadily since the mid-1990s .
California and several other states have moratoriums on lethal injections , stemming from legal challenges .
Opponents say the way the states administer a three - drug lethal cocktail unnecessarily risks excessive pain for the inmate and therefore violates the constitutional bar against cruel and unusual punishment .
A federal judge in San Jose , citing a lack of training and supervision of the execution team , ruled California ’s application of lethal injections unconstitutional .
State officials have proposed changing procedures to try to address the judge ’s concerns .
A hearing is in October .
Prosecutors say many death penalty cases take far too long to resolve even when the issue of guilt is clear .
Especially in the West , where the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco has blocked many executions , cases can take decades to wind through the courts .
In its most recent term , the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in three cases in which the 9th Circuit had reversed the sentence .
Advertisement
One of the cases involved a two - time Arizona murderer who told the sentencing judge : “ If you want to give me the death penalty , just bring it right on . ”
He was sentenced in 1990 .
Some Arizona officials say the new procedures are long overdue .
“ If you are going to have the death penalty at all , it should n’t take 20 to 25 years , ” said Kent Cattani , the chief capital litigation counsel in the Arizona attorney general ’s office .
“ Either get rid of it altogether , or try to have a good system in state courts and then accelerate it through the federal courts . ”
On the other side , advocates for death row inmates and some legal experts say the rules would make a bad system worse .
“ It is another means by which people are determined to shut the federal courts down to meaningful review of death penalty cases , ” said Elisabeth Semel , director of the Death Penalty Clinic at the UC Berkeley law school .
“ The inevitable result of speeding them up is to miss profound legal errors that are made .
Lawyers will not see them .
Courts will not address them . ”

“ This is the Bush administration throwing down the gauntlet and saying , ‘ We are going to speed up executions , ’ ” said Kathryn Kase , a Houston lawyer and co-chair of the death - penalty committee for the National Assn. of Criminal Defense Lawyers .
About 3,350 people are on death row in the U.S. , including more than 600 in California .
Most were sentenced in state courts , but death cases almost always end up being reviewed by federal judges too .
It is impossible to estimate how many inmates might be affected .
Some with appeals pending could see their cases shortened .
“ Cases in the system for 20 years in federal court , it will not affect those , ” said Cattani .
But “ it will prevent those from happening in the future . ”
Advertisement
The procedures would cut to six months , instead of a year , the time that death row inmates have to file federal appeals once their cases have been resolved in the state courts .
It would also impose strict guidelines on federal judges for deciding such inmates ’ petitions .
Federal district judges would have 450 days , appeals courts 120 days .
Proponents say that would prevent foot - dragging by liberal judges .
The costs associated with the death penalty have also been a growing concern to some states .
California , for example , spends $ 90,000 more a year on housing a death row inmate than an inmate in the general prison population -- adding up to $ 57.5 million annually -- according to a 2005 study by The Times .
The idea behind the new rules has been years in the making .
The federal Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996 set up a system in which states could take advantage of faster procedures so long as they could prove they had made sure defendants had had adequate counsel in state courts .
California and several other states applied to the program starting in the late 1990s .
But federal courts ruled that they were not doing enough to provide defendants with competent attorneys .
Advertisement
Frustrated with the pace of changes -- and believing that judges were part of the problem -- death penalty advocates Rep. Dan Lungren ( R - Gold River ) and Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) led a successful effort to include language in the Patriot
Act last year that let the attorney general , rather than judges , decide whether states were ensuring death row inmates had adequate legal representation .
Under the law , the attorney general ’s decision could be challenged before the federal appeals court in Washington .
Justice Department officials are seeking public comment on the rules until Sept. 23 , after which they will be finalized “ as quickly as circumstances allow , ” said department spokesman Erik Ablin .
Some critics question whether the rules would have the desired effect .
The rules would require that states establish a “ mechanism ” for supplying lawyers to death row inmates in order to qualify for the expedited procedures but would not ensure that the lawyers were competent or adequately funded , these critics say .
Advertisement
Arizona and California have state - supported programs that aid defense counsel in capital cases , but there are still not enough lawyers to go around .
And funding for legal bills and other expenses is far from adequate , lawyers for death row inmates say .
“ If you are going to impose the kind of incredibly stringent deadlines that this statute imposes . . . you need to ensure people get adequate representation throughout the state process , ” said Robert Litt , a former Justice Department official representing the American Bar Assn. in the rule - making dispute .
“ This is the opportunity that the Department of Justice has missed . ”
He said : “ Without a set of standards to guide the attorney general , there is a tremendous potential for arbitrariness here , and to put a thumb on the scales on the side of the states . ”
The Judicial Conference of the U.S. , the policy - making arm of the federal courts , also sees problems .

States might be able to qualify even if they had not provided lawyer services “ sufficient to enable federal court litigation to proceed fairly within the expedited time period , ” the group said in a letter to the Justice Department this month .
Critics also say there is a major conflict of interest for the nation ’s top law enforcement officer to judge the qualifications of lawyers defending people whom government officials are seeking to put to death .
Others have doubts about giving Gonzales in particular more power .
His judgment has been challenged over his handling of the firing of eight U.S. attorneys last year , among other matters .
Death penalty foes also say his record on the issue inspires no confidence that the rules will be administered fairly .
As legal advisor to then - Texas Gov. George Bush in the 1990s , he gave what many saw as cursory treatment of clemency petitions of capital defendants whom the state subsequently put to death .

“ It is almost a cruel joke for Congress to have said , ‘ What we would like to do is improve the way states handle these ’ . . . and then put it in the hands of , all people , the attorney general , ” said Lawrence Fox , a Philadelphia lawyer who teaches legal ethics at the University of Pennsylvania Law School .
“ It really is quite extraordinary .
He is the chief prosecutor of the United States .
He could n’t possibly be unbiased . ”
Fox said he would have problems with any attorney general wielding that power .
Under the proposed rules , each state , through its attorney general , would have to apply to the Justice Department to be included in the program .
Besides Arizona , where 114 prisoners are on death row , Texas , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania and other states have shown interest in the new procedures .

It ’s unclear whether California would apply .
Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown is an avowed opponent of the death penalty , but many staff attorneys support the rule , and Brown has said he will not allow his personal feelings to affect his judgment about enforcing the law .

The Weak U.S. Dollar And How The World Is Pwning Us
One of my best friends while growing up currently lives in London .
She ’s called me to say she was coming over to visit the U.S. with her family to check out the Northern California coast .
Then she proceeded to gloat over the fact that she was going to do some serious shopping over here .
That ’s because her money has longer to go here with the dollar being so weak against all forms of currency lately .
There are certainly more ominous consequences to a falling dollar , but from our vantage point as consumers , we ’re seeing the fallout affect us in our everyday lives as fittingly described by The New York Post in this manner : the depressed dollar is “ turning Fifth Avenue into a virtual flea market for global travelers . ”
In an older November 2006 article , we are shown the difference in price between some goods selling in the U.K. and in the U.S.
Note that I ’ve recalculated the prices here based on much more recent currency exchange rates :
For example , a pair of ladies ’ straight leg 7 For All Mankind jeans retails for £ 169 ( $ 327 , now it ’s $ 344 ) in British department store Selfridges .
In American department store Bloomingdales , the same pair of jeans sells for $ 143 ( £ 73.80 , now it ’s £ 70.20 ) .
An Apple 30 GB iPod retails for £ 189 ( $ 366 , $ 384 ) in the UK , and for $ 249 ( £ 128 , £ 122 ) in the U.S. Make - up is also much cheaper for European travelers .
Stila Tinted Moisturizer sells for £ 20 ( $ 39 , $ 40 ) in the UK , and $ 28 ( £ 14.50 , £ 13.70 ) in the U.S. But on Web site strawberrynet.com , it can be bought for as little as £ 8 ( $ 15.50 $ 16 . )
European travel companies report that bargain - hungry shoppers are taking advantage of the favorable exchange rate to stock up on cheap goods .
You can just imagine all the “ power shopping ” that ’s been going on since last winter , mostly by tourists .
A quick poll by CNN.com establishes this point :
Well I ’m absolutely downright envious .
My BFF is going to save a bunch of money while embarking on a vacation lined up with wallet - depleting shopping sprees : just how ironic is that ?
But I wish her luck hauling her booty back !
So what exactly IS happening to our once almighty dollar ?
Why am I getting shafted in the international front while my friend is gallivanting around the world buying up stuff on the cheap ?
It ’s mainly something to do with our ballooning trade and budget deficits and whether we like it or not , the world has got us by the you - know - what .
Here ’s a peek at the dollar ’s health , which you can measure through a variety of means including this convenient gauge :
The U.S. Dollar Index
The U.S. Dollar Index is calculated by averaging the exchange rates between the US Dollar and six major world currencies : Euro , Japanese Yen , British Pound , Canadian Dollar , Swedish Krona and Swiss France .
It gives an indication of how well our currency is doing against the rest of the world with the components illustrated as follows :
Currency Weight Euro EUR 0.576 Japanese Yen JPY 0.136 British Pound GBP 0.119 Canadian Dollar CAD 0.091 Swedish Krona SEK 0.042 Swiss France CHF 0.036
The USDX averages the exchange rates between the US Dollar and six major world currencies .
These world currencies are those of 17 countries ( 12 countries of the Euro zone plus the five other nations whose currencies are represented in the USDX ) which constitute the bulk of international trade with the United States , and have well - developed foreign exchange markets with rates freely determined by market participants .
In addition , many currencies not included in the USDX move in close correlation with those that are included .
The USDX is computed 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
This index started in 1973 with a base of 100 and is relative to this base .
This means that a value of 120 would suggest that the U.S. dollar experienced a 20 % increase in value over the time period .
The historical performance chart of this index depicts the depth of the slide , showing how the USDX is now touching 80 !
U.S. Dollar Index Chart ( 1972-2007 )
Looking at this graph , it ’s hard to believe the dollar can fall further now that it ’s scraped the bottom in the last 35 years — but it certainly can .
I ’m not too happy as this is making me stingy .
No matter , I ’ll still keep a stiff upper lip and play the good hostess to anyone who decides to visit us .
They ’ll need to repay the favor when the tides turn ….
which I hope wo n’t be too long from now .
In the meantime , here ’s where you can keep an eye on the dollar .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
Two decades after a nude photo scandal helped cost a Miss America her title , Americans may be adopting a more ho - hum attitude toward people who bare it all for the cameras .
Some experts say the Internet and more explicit TV are fostering a more relaxed response by Americans to public displays of bare flesh , even if many people profess to be more conservative .
Take , for example , the muted reaction to nude photos of 18 - year - old Vanessa Hudgens , the star of Walt Disney Co. ’s squeaky clean “ High School Musical ” franchise ,
One day after the photos surfaced on the Web last Thursday , Hudgens issued an apology and family friendly Walt Disney Co. said it would continue negotiating her appearance in the third installment of the hugely popular series , one of the most popular programs in U.S. cable TV history .
While some expressed outrage , many fans pledged support on her MySpace page at www.myspace.com/vanessahudgens.
Some lashed out at her critics .
" Quit moaning and if you have any kind of decent filtering on the computer , kids are n't going to see it , " wrote one poster on a media blog Web site at acemanonline.wordpress.com .
Vanessa Anne Hudgens arrives for a screening of " High School Musical " in Hollywood , May 13 , 2006 .
Two decades after a nude photo scandal helped cost a Miss America her title , Americans may be adopting a more ho - hum attitude toward people who bare it all for the cameras .

It ’s a far cry from the scandal in 1984 when Vanessa Williams , the first black woman named as Miss America , resigned after nude photos surfaced of her and another female model .
“ I do think that general attitudes about nudity are becoming more relaxed , but these changes take time , which is why there ’s still mixed responses , ” said Paul Levinson , communication and media professor at Fordham University .
“ We as a society are finally growing up and it ’s a healthy thing , ” he said .
Sex and nudity are also more prevalent on television , especially cable stations .
Last week ’s opening episode of the HBO drama “ Tell Me You Love Me , ” contained at least half - a - dozen sex acts .
DISCONNECT
Robert Thompson , professor of media and popular culture at Syracuse University , agreed attitudes about nudity had “ lightened up , ” but said there was still a huge disconnect between how people feel and what people say .
“ While filling in a survey , people will always check off with one hand that there ’s too much sex and violence in the media , while using the other hand to search for that kind of material , ” he said .
He cites the furor over Janet Jackson ’s breast being exposed for a fraction of second at the 2004 Super Bowl as an example of this hypocrisy .
“ Of all the things threatening America ’s youth , I would not have put the exposure of Jackson ’s breast for less than a second in the top 5,000 .
I do n’t think a single young person was damaged by the exposure of that , with the exception of people who may have been fired as a result of it , ” he said .
Millions of wired youths share private or embarrassing pictures or videos with each other daily on cell phones or social Web sites like Facebook and MySpace.com .
“ There ’s no doubt about it .
The Web for the last 10 years , has made more nudity available , ” Levinson said .
“ I predict in the next few years , the FCC will be put in its proper place and nudity will be the norm , ” he said .
Robert Butterworth , a trauma psychologist , says the shock threshold for young people is higher than for adults because baring one ’s soul and flesh is so common on those sites .
“ The line is being blurred .
The distinction between what ’s proper and what ’s not is constantly changing , ” he said .
But others say caution needs to be exercised .
“ Clearly , kids are involved in narcissism and putting photos on the Web , but parents are starting to tell them to be careful .
Once it ’s out there , it ’s no longer in your control , ” said Brandon Watson , CEO of IMSafer , which monitors young people ’s online activity .
“ I ’m not sure if people are becoming more casual , but in the case of Vanessa ( Hudgens ) , she comes with a lot of brand equity and this was her first strike .
If she was a constant train wreck , her fans may not be as forgiving , ” he said .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- U.S. soldiers arrested members of an Iranian government delegation Tuesday at a hotel in Baghdad and took them to an unidentified location , Iran 's official IRNA news agency reported .
Associated Press Television caught blindfolded men being escorted from a Baghdad hotel .
The Iranians , who work for Tehran 's power ministry , were in the capital at the invitation of Iraqi government officials to sign an electricity supply contract , the news agency said .
The U.S. military said it detained some " Iranian citizens with Iranian passports " and their Iraqi escorts , who carried Iraqi Department of Energy badges , at a checkpoint in the Abu Nuwas market in eastern Baghdad 's Rusafa district .
The Iranians and Iraqis were detained when " a group of individuals in several vehicles " stopped at the checkpoint , and " several occupants were observed to have weapons , " the military said .
Soldiers searched the vehicles and confiscated the weapons because the Iraqis did not have government - issued cards permitting them to carry weapons , the U.S. military statement said .
When asked about the discrepancy regarding the location of the incident , the military said it had no clarification .
The number of people arrested was not immediately clear , though Associated Press Television showed U.S. soldiers escorting 10 blindfolded people -- their hands bound in front of them -- from the hotel into military vehicles and driving off .
Watch the men being escorted from the hotel »
AP described the detainees as Iranians .
The U.S. military said it was investigating the report , but could not confirm it .
An Iranian Embassy spokesman in Baghdad said he could not comment .
In January , U.S. troops arrested six Iranians in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil .
The military said they were " suspected of being closely tied to activities targeting Iraqi and coalition forces . "
Iraq 's Kurdish regional government , which is based in Irbil , characterized the January incident as a raid on the Iranian consulate in Irbil and sharply denounced the operation .
President Bush has accused Iran of training Iraqis to carry out attacks on U.S. forces .
" The Iranian regime must halt these actions , " Bush said Tuesday .
" And until it does , I will take actions necessary to protect our troops .
" I have authorized our military commanders in Iraq to confront Tehran 's murderous activities . "
The Iranian government denies involvement in the violence in Iraq .
U.S. officials have also expressed displeasure over Iran 's arrest of four people with American - Iranian citizenship for allegedly working against the Islamic republic .
Two have been freed , but have not been allowed to leave the country .
The United States accuses Iran of working to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran says its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes .

UPDATE , NEW POST UP TOP AS OF 1:20 AM EDT , 8/21
We know that many of the models have Dean going into the Bay of Campeche .
But what does that mean for supply and production ?
Well , if the current forecast holds we could be talking about 2.5 million barrels per day of supply capacity being shut in for a while , and some of that for an extended amount of time .
Can that matter when the US consumes about 21 million barrels per day ( and the world consumes 85 mbpd ) ?
Yes .
Especially when there is n't " slack " supply to be brought to market .
That is what " peak oil " is about .
The markets are n't reacting yet .
Do they know something we do n't know ?
Maybe .
But what do we actually know about Mexico and its supply and infrastructure ?
Under the fold ( click " there 's more " below ) , I am going to try to bring together some of our information we have gleaned to this point .
I also encourage you to deliver news tips , forecasts , insights , and other links in the comment thread below .
UPDATE : PEMEX is shutting down ~ 140 rigs and moving 13,000 + workers on land .
Cantarell + Ku-Maloob - Zaap account for 66 % of the total oil production of PEMEX in June 2007 .
Cantarell alone is 47 % .
If it is really going to be divided , the question is how modular is it going to be ?
The core + the rest is not good enough .
But , if we will have something more granular like core + awt + swing + net + rmi + sql + logging + corba + ... , that would be something .
They can make it as modular as the runtime 's internal dependencies allow .
For example , it 's useless splitting the logging API into a separate download , if several other APIs invoke it , so as soon as an application tries to load a class from SWT , CORBA or whatever , the classloader will hit a reference to some logging class and trigger the downloading of that package .
This would botch the whole modularized JRE idea - some app developer carefully writes a JAWS program that depends only on core +AWT + Java2D , excepting a maximum JRE download of ( say ) 2.3 Mb , promises that to its clients , and when clients who do n't have the JRE try the app , it loads 5 Mb of JRE due to internal dependencies .
See for example IBM JDK , it 's already modularized in a way , its jre / lib directory splits the core into no less than 21 jar files ( v5.0 ) .
For example , there 's a xml.jar ( 6 Mb ) , a graphics . jar ( 6.4 Mb - with AWT , 2D , Swing , ImageIO , Sound etc ) , and a ton of ibm *. jar with CORBA and security APIs .
But the way they broke it seems tuned mostly toward WAS and also to separate Sun 's code from IBM 's code , e.g. the CORBA and security stuff is all cleanroom - made by IBM and there 's even a BD. jar of 40 Kb just for BigDecimal , which implementation was made by IBM ( but adopted by Sun years ago ) .
Having said that , proper modularization tuned for downloading should n't be that hard , at least for coarse - grained pieces like Swing .
Sun hackers should be all busy now , running JDepend on their code and refactoring bogus dependencies . ;-)
And it 's not only the rt.jar , the JRE contains a good chunk of native code : for 6.0u1 / Win32 , 54 DLLs with 6,6Mb + HotSpot Client 's 2,2Mb in a single DLL .
Most native code appears to be already very well modularized ( unless internal dependencies cause most DLLs to be loaded all the time ) .
But HotSpot is n't , and it 's pretty honking big , even for the Client VM .
It compresses down to 765Kb , still a huge part of a goal of 2 Mb for the full JRE .
But I bet the VM can be broken down into some additional pieces .
For example , HotSpot offers several options of Garbage Collectors , but most client - side do n't use fancy GC tuning anyway so all code supporting this , and any other non -default stuff of significant size , could be moved to a separate DLL (s ) that 's downloaded on demand .
There are also resources of significant size , like TTF fonts , i18n data ( charsets , timezones etc ) , CMM and audio soundbank .
I hope the new runtime can split these bits too .
Many apps never use these things , for example who needs Java 's fonts when the first rule of decent native LAF is using the " system " fonts bundled with each OS ?
Apps tuned for fast downloading in the componentized VM could also take care to not depend on such resources .
ENDING THE WAR …. Can Democrats force President Bush to begin a withdrawal of troops from Iraq ?
The short answer is that — constitutional questions aside — any resolution mandating specific troop deployments out of Iraq would require 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster and 67 votes to overcome a veto .
That ’s obviously not going to happen .
So Markos Moulitsas , echoing others , endorses Chris Dodd ’s approach :
What was clear to me before , and what should be abundantly clear to my colleagues after today , is that this President is not going to change course unless we force him to .
There is only one way to do that — we must set a clear , hard and fast deadline for redeployment and , in order to enforce it , that deadline must be tied to funding .
This sounds more plausible since budget reconciliations can pass with a simple majority and Bush ca n’t veto Pentagon funding forever .
Unfortunately , there ’s a problem : Democrats do n’t have a simple majority .
There are 49 Democrats in the Senate , and if you assume Bernie Sanders would join in , you ’re up to 50 .
That ’s not enough .
The only way to defund the war is for the Democratic leadership in the Senate to maintain absolute , 100 % iron control over its own caucus and get at least one Republican to join them .
But while there are a handful of Republicans who have been critical of the war , I ca n’t think of even a single one who ’d come within a country mile of voting to defund it .
Can you ?
So what ’s Plan B ?
UPDATE : In comments , there seems to be some widespread misunderstanding about how budget bills work .
Long story short , you ca n’t filibuster them , so 40 votes wo n’t stop anything .
And remember , we ’re not talking about an emergency supplemental here .
We ’re talking about the FY 2008 budget for the entire Pentagon .
Basically , Democrats have two choices : ( a ) muster the votes for a bill that funds the Pentagon but defunds the war and then dare Bush to veto it , or ( b ) refuse to pass anything , which effectively defunds the Pentagon completely without even forcing Bush to risk a veto .
Option A is what we did earlier this year , and its success depends on whether we can keep our own caucus together and find a Republican senator or two to side with us for several votes in a row .
Pretty unlikely .
Option B is electoral suicide .
I ’m all for trying Option A , but it makes Dems look weak and whiny to introduce bills and then have them fail , which is almost certainly what would happen .
Is that what we want ?
And what comes next after that ?
NEW POLICY NEW POLICY
Under the FBI 's revised drug policy , applicants are disqualified if they have used : •
Any illegal drug , other than marijuana , within the past 10 years or used marijuana for more than just " experimentation . "
• Marijuana within the past three years or for a substantial period of time .

 Aspiring FBI agents who once dabbled in marijuana use wo n't be barred from getting a job with the elite crime - fighting agency , which has loosened its drug policy amid a campaign to hire hundreds of agents .
The bureau 's pot-smoking standard , in place for at least 13 years , was revised after internal debate about whether the policy was eliminating prospects because of drug experimentation , said Jeff Berkin , deputy director of the FBI 's Security Division .
The policy disqualified candidates if they had used marijuana more than 15 times .
There was no public announcement of the change .
It took effect in January .
The decision comes as the FBI continues its hiring campaign and as law enforcement agencies across the USA grapple with high rates of disqualification based in part on applicants ' past drug use .
Berkin said the previous policy was based on a scoring system that had become " arbitrary . "
He also said it created problems for applicants who could n't remember how many times they had smoked pot when asked in polygraph examinations .
" It encourages honesty and allows us to look at the whole person , " Berkin said of the revised policy .
He said it was too early to tell whether the new standard has encouraged an increasing number of applicants as the FBI attempts to hire 221 agents and 121 intelligence analysts .
Experts said the policy reflects a changing view of prior marijuana use by law enforcement officials .
" Increasingly , the goal for the screening of security clearance applicants is whether you are a current drug user , rather than whether you used in the past , " said Tom Riley , a spokesman for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy .
" It 's not whether you have smoked pot four times or 16 times 20 years ago .
It 's about whether you smoked last week and lied about it . "
Elaine Deck , a senior program manager with the International Association of Chiefs of Police , said police departments report problems with an increasing number of applicants failing background investigations because of drug use and financial irregularities .
In Santa Fe , where recruiters are attempting to fill 15 vacancies this year , more than 60 % of applicants are routinely found to be unfit after background investigations , Police Chief Eric Johnson said .
Applicants are disqualified if they are found to have used drugs within the past three years , Johnson said , adding that the department does tolerate some past marijuana use .
In Las Vegas , where the department is attempting to hire 2,000 officers over the next five years , the background failure rate is about 70 % .
The department does not disclose details of its drug policy for applicants in part as a test of candidates ' candor .
Police Lt. Charles
Hank said past marijuana use is not an automatic disqualifier .
Johnson said a smaller pool of prospects is one factor that contributes to the high disqualification rate .
The prolonged Iraq war , he said , has snapped up thousands of candidates who might have been drawn to law enforcement .

Heavy rain did not dampen the enthusiasm of Ron Paul supporters yesterday at the Illinois State Fair .
Those supporters canvassed the fairgrounds introducing people to Ron Paul and asking them to vote in the straw poll held by the Illinois Republican Party .
Voting started at 11:00 am and ended at 4:00 pm .
Their work paid off !
Dr. Paul ( 18.87 % ) came in third behind Mitt Romney ( 40.35 % ) and Fred Thompson ( 19.96 % ) .
Giuliani ( 11.61 % ) , McCain ( 4.12 % ) , Huckabee ( 3.04 % ) , Brownback ( 1.08 % ) , Hunter ( .65 % ) , and Tancredo ( .33 % ) rounded out the field .
A big " thank you " to the Ron Paul supporters who braved the rain and made yesterday 's straw poll a success .

Well , that 's not exactly how they phrased it .
But that 's what happened .
After years of claiming that marijuana is 25 - 30 times stronger than it used to be , ONDCP admitted that marijuana potency has merely doubled :
( Washington , D.C. ) — Today , the Office of National Drug Control Policy ( ONDCP ) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) released the latest analysis from the University of Mississippi's Potency Monitoring Project which revealed that levels of THC — the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana — have reached the highest - ever levels since scientific analysis of the drug began in the late 1970's .
According to the latest data on marijuana samples analyzed to date , the average amount of THC in seized samples has reached 8.5 percent .
This compares to an average of just under 4 percent reported in 1983 and represents more than a doubling in the potency of the drug since that time .
Compare that to John Walters ' statement in The San Francisco Chronicle on September 1 , 2002 :
The THC of today 's sinsemilla averages 14 percent and ranges as high as 30 percent .
Even stronger stuff is on the way .
The point is that the potency of available marijuana has not merely " doubled , " but increased as much as 30 times .
Maybe he thought we would n't remember .
It 's curious that ONDCP and NIDA are so proud to announce that they 've been wildly exaggerating marijuana potency for many years .
Apparently , they see value in finally legitimizing their claims that pot is getting stronger , even if doing so raises the question of what the hell they 've been talking about all this time .
Yet a doubling of marijuana potency hardly compliments the ONDCP 's ongoing effort to eradicate the stuff from the planet .
Nor does it bear any relationship to the intoxication levels experienced by users , who titrate their doses to achieve the desired effect regardless of potency .
Besides , now that researchers at Harvard have informed us that THC shrinks tumors and likely prevents lung cancer , more of it can only be a good thing .
Court Rebukes Bush Administation on Global Warming
Groups Say Administration Suppressed Climate Change Findings
A federal court today issued a harsh rebuke of the Bush administration for its failure to issue long - delayed reports assessing the impacts and consequences of global warming in the United States .
The judge in the case set a spring deadline for administration officials to comply .
Plaintiffs in the case say the Bush administration has been suppressing two reports intended to serve as a unifying guide for Congress and federal agencies on global warming threats and scientific research priorities .
" The reports are supposed to be the premiere summary on the science of global warming in this country and used by all federal agencies , " said Kassie Siegel of the Center for Biological Diversity , a San Francisco - based conservation group and the main plaintiff in the case .
" It 's a very critical component of government decision making .
The Bush administration essentially deep - sixed these reports . "
Defendants in the case include Dr. William Brennan , acting director of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and John Marburger III , director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy .
Their offices are partially responsible for issuing two separate climate change assessment reports periodically required by the Global Change Research Act .
The law was passed by Congress and signed by President George H.W. Bush in November 1990 .
U.S. District Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong of U.S. District Court in Oakland , Calif. , said the current Bush administration had argued that the Global Change Research
Act granted wide discretion in the timing of the production and release of the reports .
" The defendants are wrong , " the judge wrote in her 38 - page ruling .
" Congress has conferred no discretion upon the defendants as to when they will issue [ the reports ] . "
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy spokesperson Kristin Scuderi said that officials were still reviewing the court order and could not comment on specifics .
The administration 's Climate Change Science Program has said it plans to issue 21 climate reports instead of a single comprehensive guide , as has been done in the past .
" The administration is complying with the law through the production of 21 Synthesis and Assessment documents and beginning to prepare a new research plan , " Scuderi told ABC News in an e-mail .
That plan , however , was called into question by the Government Accountability Office in April 2005 .
" Because the 21 individual reports are planned to address scientific uncertainties associated with climate change and other technical subjects and are to be issued over a period of three or more years , it may be difficult for the Congress and others to use this information effectively as the basis for making decisions on climate policy , " according to the GAO .
The first of the two reports in dispute is called the National Global Change Research Plan .
It is intended to set the goals and priorities for federal research dollars , " which most effectively advance scientific understanding of global change and provide usable information on which to base policy decisions related to global climate change . "
The last research plan was issued in July 2003 and the latest version is more than a year overdue , according to court documents .
A separate scientific assessment report -- required to analyze the effects of climate change in the United States -- is also more than two and a half years late .
Today 's ruling ordered the defendants to publish a draft of the research plan by March 1 , 2008 .
The judge also ordered the scientific assessment to be produced no later than May 31 , 2008 .
Other plaintiffs in the case include environmental advocacy groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth .
Sen. John Kerry , D - Mass. , and Rep. Jay Inslee , D - Wash . , filed briefs in support of the plaintiffs .
Siegel said today 's ruling could be appealed .

A private detective hid inside a body bag to catch the man who waged a three - year campaign of vandalism against a firm of funeral directors .
The bag was put in the back of a hearse , one of a number which had been repeatedly attacked over the years , and for days the detective lay in wait .
His perseverance paid off when he caught Richard Bullen stabbing the wheels of the vehicle .
Surveillance experts launched the £ 4,000 operation while investigating the hate campaign against the Co-operative Funeral Directors in Portsmouth .
The cost of the vandalism came to more than £ 100,000 and up to five vehicles a day owned by the firm and its staff were being damaged .
However , there were no clues to the identity of the perpetrator .
The funeral directors contacted the Portsmouth Business Crime Reduction Partnership which hired a team of private detectives .
They spent five days posing as members of the public and using cameras to stake out the firm .
But cars continued to be damaged under their noses so security firm Storewatch decided one of their team had to hide inside a body bag .
There the detective could watch a computer displaying live images from cameras inside and outside the vehicle .
Mark Ferns , Storewatch director said : " Our guy would do three or four hours in the bag and then would have to take what the Americans call a comfort break .
Scroll down for more ...
" It was all so covert that we did not even tell the funeral firm what we were doing . "
On the fifth day he saw Bullen stab the wheels of the vehicle with a carpentry tool and felt the hearse move .
Bullen , 40 , was followed and placed under citizens ' arrest until police arrived .
His motive is unknown , but police believe he was angered by staff occasionally parking in a public car park near his then home .
Bullen , of Portsmouth , appeared before the town 's magistrates and was fined £ 50 after admitting one charge of criminal damage for the act caught on camera .
At a separate hearing he was handed an anti-social behaviour order after magistrates heard he was believed to be the man behind all the vandalism .
He was banned from going near the funeral directors , from going near the homes of staff and from carrying a bradawl - the tool he used - anywhere in Hampshire .
The burden of proof required to secure an Asbo is less than that needed for a criminal conviction , meaning magistrates had only to believe on the balance of probability that Bullen committed the offences and was likely to cause trouble if the Asbo was n't in place .

一昨日の日記の件 について、出勤前の午前中にサイボウズのお客さま対応窓口から電話があった。 電話の要件は訂正があるとのことで、以下の3点を訂正するとのことだった。（以下は私による要約。）
ディレクトリトラバーサルの脆弱性については、ログインしていない者によっても攻撃され得る。告知文を訂正する。
ユーザの一覧を取得できてしまう問題について、脆弱性としなかったのは、重要度が低いと評価していたという誤った認識によるものだった。告知文を訂正する。
去年のクロスサイトスクリプティング脆弱性対応について、対策として追加された警告表示機能がデフォルトでオフとなっている理由は、既存バージョンとの互換性を考えたものであり、それはユーザが混乱するのではないかと考えたためで、そのような認識は誤りだった。今後、デフォルトでオンとするように検討する。
そしてさきほど告知ページを見に行ったところ、更新されていた。
あちらからの用件はそれだけだったのだが、「ご不明な点はございますか」とのことだったので、「重要度の認識の誤りとのことだが、先日の電話ではセキュリティポリシーによるものだと説明された」と確認したところ、「担当した者が確認をした範囲でそういう回答になったが経営者などの判断ではなかった」という。
担当者ねえ……。まあ、しかし、同社の同じような方針はずっと以前からおおやけにされていたわけで。たとえば、2002年6月にあった脆弱性の修正の件でも、
インシデント事後対応ベストの企業に秘訣を聞く ■第5回■ サイボウズ , Scan Incident Report , 2003 年3月4 日 ユーザへの告知は 、 「 Office 4.0（1.4）」が公開された5月27日にサイト内のバージョン更新履歴や「FAQ」に掲載した。すでに21日の段階で「サイボウズ
DB メーカー」の対応版が公開されているが、すべての製品において何らかの対応がなされた状態になるまでは、脆弱性の存在を告知することがかえって危険を増やす可能性があると判断したため告知を27日に行ったという。また、まったく公表しないことには問題があると考えつつ、一方でこの脆弱性の影響が極めて少ないユーザに対してまで無用な不安を与えることは避けるべきであると考え、「FAQ」での告知という措置になったという。
という話があった 。
9月1日付の 「 セキュリティに関するお知らせ( 2 ) サイボウズ青野の3日ボウズ日記」によると、
今後、より迅速で正確な対応ができるよう、セキュリティ対応ポリシーを改善し、お客様が安心して弊社製品を使い続けてくださるよう努力してまいります。
となっている 。
次の質問として、 「 ユーザ名の入力をメニューからではなく直接入力とする設定が用意されているのは、インターネットでの利用などでのセキュリティとプライバシーを想定してのものなのか、それとも、イントラネットでの利用においても入力の利便性として直接入力の方が楽な場合もあるためなのか、どちらなのか」と尋ねたところ、「基本的にはイントラネット用を想定している。後者だ。」という。
そこで意見として次のように述べた。「『基本的には』などと曖昧なことを言ってはいけない。インターネットでの利用を想定しているのか、いないのかだ。想定していないのなら、そのようにマニュアルに記述して、『インターネットでは使わないでください』と注意書きしない限り、責任はないと言うことはできないでしょう。」
しかし、今になって気づいたが、サイボウズOffice 6のマニュアルにズバリ、「インターネット上での使用を想定している場合」と書かれている（図1）ではないか。
続いて、実態としてインターネットで使っている人がGoogleで見つかる件について述べると、「検索で見つかること自体を問題ととらえており、今後robots.txtやmetaタグを生成するようにして対策していきたい」とのことだった。そこで、「それは解決ではない。悪意ある者が自力でロボットを走らせれば、当然そのような指定は無視して探し出すのだから」ということを述べた。もちろん、やらないよりやったほうがよいことには違いない。
ところで、告知文に書かれている
※上記対象製品をイントラネット内でのみ運用している場合に、外部（インターネット網）から攻撃を受けることはございません。
という（赤字で強調された）記述だが、これは本当だろうか？
（せっかく頂いた電話で尋ねるチャンスがあったのに言い忘れた。）
今回の脆弱性の詳細を知らないのでわからないが、SQLインジェクションについては、「データベース内のデータ操作」という脅威があるそうだが、GETにせよ、POSTにせよ、ログイン中のユーザが悪意ある外部サイトのページを開いただけのタイミングでも起きるように思えるのだが。「イントラネット内でのみ運用している場合」といっても、ブラウザがインターネット上のWebサイトを閲覧できないようにしてあるというわけではあるまい。
「 イントラネット のURLが攻撃者にはわからないから、影響は極めて少ない」などという主張がありがちだが、たとえば一昨日の日記の「本日のリンク元」を見れば、イントラのURLがバレることは普通にあるということがわかると思う。
Pete Townshend has been a driving force behind the evolution of rock music for decades — but his latest project is aimed at taking that expertise and using it to create a unique software program , dubbed Method , capable of " painting " a person 's musical portrait based on several types of input from each specific person .
In theory , any person will be able to create a musical theme based on a voice recording , an image , and a clapped rhythm .
If you 're wondering exactly how providing these elements equates to a musical theme , you 're not alone , but information on how the Lifehouse Method works is currently limited .
What we do know is that the rhythms and sounds selected or created by the user are not directly utilized to create music .
Instead , Method analyzes each input , and uses this analysis to create the musical selection .
Every hero needs a theme song ?
Forget that .
Every geek needs a theme song !
The project 's web site has additional information on how Method works , as well as some clarifications on pricing .
Apparently each person 's first three " portrait " sessions are free , as is access to the web site , until July 31 .
After that date , site access will require a subscription , though there 's no mention of how much this will cost .
There are some sample segments available for listening , as well .
The site recommends that you have a microphone as well as your own custom images , but stock sounds and photos will be available as well .
Townshend has said that he hopes the project encourages more people to experiment with musical composition , as well as to share the music they create .
Individual compositions will also be periodically evaluated by a team of composers , with the possibility that they may be chosen for professional expansion by said team .
As something of a musician myself , I 've been curious about the Lifehouse Method since I heard about the project and have since sat for two of my three available portraits .
For the first portrait , I gave the program a relatively staccato voice sample , a staccato rhythm , a photo with several areas of bright color , and the Windows XP startup theme .
For my second sitting , I went with a much smoother , more - connected voice sample , a slow half - note rhythm , one subdued photo of a cloudy sky , and an audio sample of a river running .
The goal was to create two varied sets of inputs that 'd hopefully allow some insight into how Method constructs its music .
If you 're curious about the musical output , the results of my first two portraits are available here and here .
I 'm not a composer or well - versed in musical composition theory — but I 'm not overly impressed with either piece .
While both have a definite melodic structure and a sustained theme that continues through the whole of the piece , I 'd classify both as sounding mechanical and automatically produced — which , of course , they are .
The second piece does sound more connected than the first and has a stronger underlying theme ( in my opinion ) , but based on my first two sessions , I can only make the most tenuous prediction about what a third session might sound like .
Based on what I 've seen thus far , it 's entirely possible that the piano sections of both melodies were actually performed by Nora , the amazing piano - playing cat .
If Pete Townshend is serious about using the Lifehouse Method to introduce more people to musical composition , he 'll need to open the process at some point to tweaking and adjustment .
Handing a program a few bits of input and then having some output handed back might be an interesting demonstration when you understand how the process works , but for those of us on the outside , it 's more puzzling than anything else .
Body art
is art made on , with , or consisting of , the human body .
The most common forms of body art are tattoos and body piercings , but other types include scarification , branding , scalpelling , shaping ( for example tight - lacing of corsets ) , full body tattoo and body painting .
I was actually surprised to see that the debate is apparently still ongoing as to whether adblocking is immoral or not .
Unsurprisinly , it 's mostly webmasters who tend to the " It is " view , and mostly average web surfers who tend to the " It is n't "
I 've touched on the subject before , but there were a couple of points that I did n't include in that one , and you know how it is when you start tugging on a thread .
. .
So I figured I 'd do another post on the subject .
Here it is !
So , obviously , there 's the first & most popular argument , " I run a website , it costs me money to do so , I need advertising revenue to pay for the website , adblocking robs me of this revenue . "
In other words , people should support bad business models because it 's more convenient for the businessmen .
On that principle , the entire Internet should be scrapped : News and entertainment industries in particular are struggling to adapt to the new distribution channels it has provided .
Convinced ?
Me neither .
It 's true that it costs money to run your own website - And I know this , of course , because I do so myself .
And certainly , it 's hard to argue when somebody points out that if you enjoy a website , you should be willing to help that website keep going , by enabling it to make money off ads .
But it 's not * that * hard .
There 's more than one way to make a few pennies from people who like your website .
The simplest , of course , is to simply stick in a " If you like this website , please support it by making a contribution " link .
Not reliable , but it does get you some income .
Rather more reliably , there 's the two - tier system as used by many websites :
Tier 1 is all the content , plus adverts .
Tier 2 is a paid - for membership that gives you all the content , minus adverts .
You might offer some small perks with Tier 2 as well , of course - Slashdot , for instance , lets Tier 2 people see stories that are just about to be published , a sneak preview that means we stand a better chance of reading the linked article before the Slashdot effect kicks in .
Or there 's merchandizing .
If you 've got a website that lots of people visit , they 'll probably like it enough to buy things with the logo on it .
Look at most webcomics :
The popular ones more than cover their costs by selling collections of their strips in book form .
They do n't regard the cost of their website as something that needs to be paid for by ads :
It 's a very cheap form of advertising that makes people aware enough of the strip that they 'll buy the books .
And plush toys .
And coasters , and bumper stickers and .
. .
Frankly , as far as I 'm concerned , if a webmaster runs a site that 's popular enough that the costs become at all significant , the onus is on him ( or her ) to find ways to cash in on that popularity to keep the site going .
The visitors have no duty at all , and they certainly are n't obliged to go out of their way to make money for somebody else .
That 's how business works :
It 's not enough to have good ideas .
Plenty of companies with good products have come along and promptly gone bust .
You do n't just come up with something good and sit back as the world fills your pockets :
You get busy and work out how to convince people to part with their hard - earned , or your pockets will stay resolutely empty .
The next point that tends to get dragged out is " Magazines have adverts in them , do you cut those out too ? "
There 's two points here .
Firstly , magazines have almost universally relevant adverts in them .
If you buy a computer magazine , you 'll see a lot of adverts for hardware & software .
If you 're enough of a computer enthusiast , you 're very likely to be looking for a new computer or at least an upgrade , and thus the advertised special offers are extremely likely to catch your eye .
The majority of internet advertising is less well - focussed .
I just clicked on the Dilbert website to look at today 's cartoon , and what do I get ?
Two banner ads and a pop-under advertising the " Tickle " intelligence test .
The relevance ?
I fail to see it .
That 's why I do n't visit Dilbert.com without an adblock running .
Secondly , the adverts in a magazine do not result in the mag being more expensive to buy .
Quite the opposite :
They more than pay for the extra costs they generate in extra paper and ink , and therefore as well as benefiting me by informing me about things I am likely to want to know , they make it cheaper for me to buy the magazine .
Everybody 's happy .
Contrast this with web advertising .
The more I download in a month , the more I pay my ISP at the end of that month .
Every advert I download is costing me money :
Far from viewing the website free , I am paying for the privelege .
Not only are adverts irrelevant , they 're expensive .
Okay , so they 're funding the website .
Big whoop .
I might not even like the website , after I get all the ads out of the way enough to actually see it .
At least I can flick through the pages of a magazine before I part with my cash .
What 's more , I 'm probably * not* funding the website .
Most adverts , these days , bone - headed though it is , are pay - per - click rather than pay - per-view .
This baffles me .
TV , radio , billboards , magazines . . .
I 've never heard of anywhere but the Web where the advertisers say " Here 's our advert , put it on show free , and if anybody buys a product and says it 's because they saw our ad , we 'll give you some money " and get away with it .
I mean , how many people have taken up smoking because they saw Benson & Hedges advertised on the F1 car ??
Enough to justify the millions in sponsorship ?
I think not ..
To say that the advertisers got carried away when the Internet made it possible to tell them how many people saw the adverts and how many people clicked on them , is an understatement .
They went completely off their rocker and have mostly not climbed back onto it yet .
Flashing banner ads and pop-unders make that very clear :
The goal is to entice your audience , not alienate them .
So if the website does n't benefit from me viewing an ad , and it costs me money to view an ad , what difference does adblocking make ?
At least if I block the ads , it 's free for me to look at the website , and the webmaster is no worse off than he would have been anyway .
It 's not at all uncommon to see people saying " I block all ads , except for Google 's " - I know I often click on Google ads .
There 's a very important lesson to be learned there , and it's not " Geeks love Google "
It 's " Google presents people with relevant adverts via small and unobtrusive text boxes , and people have no problem with that ; while most other advertisers think pop-unders are the best way to advertise . "
The simple truth is that adblockers are not in widespread use because most Web-users hate capitalism , advertisers , and / or webmasters .
They are in widespread use because there is widespread demand , and there is widespread demand because advertisers and webmasters got greedy and stupid .
When I hear an advertiser or a webmaster complain that adblockers cause them problems , then frankly , I 'm glad to hear it .
Not only will I not apologise for using several adblock measures , I hope they continue to have problems , and I hope they get worse as time goes by .
The more problems they have with adblockers , the sooner they 'll realize that annoying web adverts are on a par with advertising via spam , and they 'll stop using them and look at the numerous better alternatives .
“ If ever there was a project where sustainable accounting is needed , Alberta tar sands oil extraction is it . ” — Mindy S. Lubber
Mindy Lubber , president of Ceres , a leading coalition of investors and environmental groups working on sustainability issues notes in this article today that the current “ accounting system meant that companies were long able to “ externalize ” natural resource costs .
In other words , they could pollute for free without paying for environmental damage and cleanups .
Society and taxpayers shouldered these costs instead . ”
Reform of this not - grounded - in - reality accounting and economic system is essential to move towards sustainable societies .
Canada ’s oil or tar sands that supply the US with much of its oil is devastating huge swaths of pristine boreal forest , ruining wild rivers and polluting the air of the north Lubber says .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Apple Inc. Chief Executive Steve Jobs indicated on Wednesday he is unlikely to give in to calls from the music industry to add a subscription - based model to Apple ’s wildly popular iTunes online music store .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs is shown talking at the launch of the Windows version of the iTunes software in San Francisco , in this October 16 , 2003 file photo .
Jobs indicated on Wednesday he is unlikely to give in to calls from the music industry to add a subscription - based model to the wildly popular iTunes online music store .
REUTERS / Tim Wimborne
“ Never say never , but customers do n’t seem to be interested in it , ” Jobs told Reuters in an interview after Apple reported blow - out quarterly results .
“ The subscription model has failed so far . ”
His comments come as the company he co-founded gears up for contract renewal negotiations with the major record labels over the next month .
Since Apple launched iTunes in 2003 , it has sold more than 2.5 billion songs and now offers increasing numbers of television shows and movies .
Many in the music industry hope iTunes will ultimately start , in effect , renting music online , so record companies can make more money from recurring income .
But Jobs said he had seen little consumer demand for that .
“ People want to own their music , ” he said .
Industry executives and analysts told Reuters last week that they expect Apple to push for further concessions from record companies on selling music without copy - protection software known as digital rights management ( DRM ) .
In February , Jobs urged all four major record labels to drop DRM , a move that some observers at the time said was sparked by the pressure Apple faces from European regulators to open the iPod / iTunes family to other technology platforms .
Already Apple , owner of the market - leading iPod digital media player as well as iTunes , has cut an early deal with EMI Group Plc , the third largest - record company , to sell music without copy protection software .
“ There are a lot of people in the other music companies who are very intrigued by it , ” Jobs said of the move to sell songs without copy - protection software .
“ They ’re thinking very hard about it right now . ”
The Apple / EMI deal leaves Vivendi’s Universal Music Group , Sony BMG Music Entertainment -- a joint venture of Sony Corp. and Bertelsmann -- and Warner Music Group Corp. in a tough spot , analysts say .
“ We ’ve said by the end of this year , over half of the songs we offer on iTunes we believe will be in DRM - free versions , ” Jobs said .
“ I think we ’re going to achieve that . ”

From my collections
Story Line :
The above survey was done over 20 years ago , but the underlying key message about customer orientation holds true 20 years later .
Here are a few real life experiences from two industries :
1 . Just a month ago , there was a conference in a five star hotel , attended by people from many companies around the globe .
During the lunch break , I joined visitors from another company on their dining table .
Noticing that there was no napkin in my dining spot , I requested the waiter to bring me one .
The waiter replied , “ Sir , there is a napkin on another table ( pointing at that table ) .
Why do n’t you move there ? ”
Everyone on our table was stunned .
I even got a guilty feeling that it must be me until the visitors shared their similar encounter at the breakfast time .
2 . In 1985 , the company I was working for made a change in the process ( called marking ) that printed our company name and product identification on the top side of our plastic packages .
We had moved from white ink marking ( printing ) to laser marking ( etching ) process .
On one summer Saturday morning , some members of our Laser Mark team ( Engineering and Quality Managers . ) received phone calls from none other than the CEO of the company .
During his visit to a major customer on the previous day , he had witnessed first the legibility problem on the laser marked plastic packages supplied by our company .
After informing his managers about the problem , the CEO patiently listened to their explanation about the merits of the laser mark process and how it had resulted in substantial increase in the output ; in our quest to be " The World Class Manufacturer " .
The managers emphasized that the manufacturing group had bought magnifying glasses to read laser marks and the benefits of output increase had far outweighed the cost of magnifying glasses .
One of the managers even offered to call the customer and assist him in procuring magnifying glasses .
The CEO , in his normal soft voice , told his managers , " Effective solutions do not create problems for customers .
The previous process of Ink Mark created perfectly legible prints and it was OK with the customer .
Our process change had slowed the customer 's manufacturing line and he should not have to buy magnifying glasses to compensate for poor quality of our laser marking . "
The awakened team spent next few months to improve laser mark legibility .
Reflection :
So many times , people make decisions based on what is good for them and fail to understand the impact on the customer .
My collection book is full of many such real life experiences .
In most cases , customers had made a choice to stay with or choose a supplier that was easy to work with .
This was particularly important in industries which were pushing the envelope every day to create breakthroughs and innovation .
“ WH political reached out to Sen .
Sessions and requested that he ask helpful questions to make clear that Tim Griffin is qualified to serve , ” said a January 2007 e-mail message from Monica Goodling , a former senior aide to Mr. Gonzales , to other department officials .
“ Here are the talkers on Griffin , as well as a narrative that can be used by staff , and his résumé .
I think it would actually be helpful for all of the Rs to have it . ”
It was not clear whether the “ talkers , " shorthand for talking points , were sent to Mr. Sessions and other “ Rs , ” or Republicans .
But Mr. Sessions , in a later hearing on the matter , ran through all of the highlights , praising Mr. Griffin ’s résumé , just as the White House and Justice had apparently requested .
Other documents show that Ms. Goodling , the Justice Department ’s liaison to the White House , prepared a list of reasons in February to explain publicly why the prosecutors had been ousted .
Notes in handwriting identified by a Justice official as Ms. Goodling ’s run quickly through a list of alleged transgressions by the fired prosecutors , like “ incredibly fractured office , morale low , lost confidence of her subordinates and superiors , ” in describing Margaret Chiara , the former United States attorney from Western Michigan who disputes the claims .
In the case of David Iglesias , who was dismissed as the top federal prosecutor in New Mexico , Ms. Goodling writes of a complaint from Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico , a Republican : “ Domenici says he does n’t move cases . ”
The e-mail was among more than 2,000 pages of documents released by the Justice Department as part of a continuing outpouring of more than 6,000 pages of e-mail and other internal records produced in the last month in response to requests by House and Senate committees as the furor over the dismissals has grown .
Mr. Gonzales is scheduled to appear on Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The Justice Department said that Mr. Sampson ’s e-mail message did not contradict either his sworn testimony or the department ’s past statements .
Brian Roehrkasse , a spokesman for the department , said : “ We have consistently stated that , with the exception of Griffin , individuals were not pre-selected for any of the eight U.S. attorney positions prior to asking the U. S. attorneys to resign .
The list made public today had previously been shared privately with Congress , and it in no way contradicts the department ’s prior statement .
The list , drafted 10 months before the December resignations , reflects Kyle Sampson ’s initial thoughts , not pre-selected candidates by the administration . ”
Guys from Ukraine have their own view on the graffiti .
They decided to illustrate Ukrainian fairy - tales on the walls of the city .
Look what it looks like .
Secretary Peters Says Bikes “ Are Not Transportation ”
We ’d expect this kind of thing from some people , but not U.S. Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters .
On PBS ’ " NewsHour with Jim Lehrer " this week , Peters stated that instead of raising taxes on gasoline to renew the nation ’s sagging infrastructure , Congress should examine its spending priorities — including investments in bike paths and trails , which , Peters said , " are not transportation . "
Some excerpts :
You know , I think Americans would be shocked to learn that only about 60 percent of the gas tax money that they pay today actually goes into highway and bridge construction .
Much of it goes in many , many other areas .
There are museums that are being built with that money , bike paths , trails , repairing lighthouses .
Those are some of the kind of things that that money is being spent on , as opposed to our infrastructure .
Well , there ’s about probably some 10 percent to 20 percent of the current spending that is going to projects that really are not transportation , directly transportation - related .
Some of that money is being spent on things , as I said earlier , like bike paths or trails .
PBS has the full transcript , along with video of the interview .
ADDENDUM : A tipster sends along this link to a prescient STPP report from 2003 , debunking the myth that bridges are in ill repair because of spending in " other areas " :
Why has bridge safety declined in some states while it improves in others ?
Although the bridge program is designed to put federal dollars where they ’re most needed , many states fail to take full advantage of the funding available to them .
Overall , the states have spent only 73 % of the bridge funding allocated by Congress over the last decade …

John Edwards : Union man John Edwards believes a new labor movement is the answer to the country 's great divide .
Should corporate America be afraid of him ?
( Fortune Magazine ) --
No one was paying much attention to John Edwards in February 2006 , when a historic contest for control of Congress was getting underway and the 2008 presidential race was still a sliver of light on the horizon .
But Danny Glover was .
He had to .
For three days the Lethal Weapon star and the one - term Senator were glued to each other 's sides like a pair of mismatched LAPD cops as they traveled across the country to lend support to hotel workers and their unions on the eve of a threatened strike .
At the time , Glover was the veteran of poverty politics ; Edwards was still a rookie in training .
So Glover , who prides himself on his ability to sniff out poseurs and users , warily scrutinized the carefully coifed politician from North Carolina .
" There 's real humility and false humility , " Glover says .
Which was Edwards ?

FBI and SEC probe into Carl Icahn and golfer Phil Mickelson
Despite the Southern charm on display in public , John Edwards is no Bill Clinton heir .
Over a breakfast of scrambled eggs and sausage in a Washington restaurant , Edwards was on guard and contained but displayed a steely determination .
" I 'm competitive , " he told Fortune 's Nina Easton .
" I 'm in this to be successful . "
Here are some excerpts : Edwards on business
On the economy " There is a huge problem in America today , with the economic growth that is occurring being almost entirely limited to the top income bracket . "
On globalization " It 's not complicated .
If you have capital and you 're well educated , the odds are that a global economy will benefit you .
But the vast majority of Americans do n't fit in that category . "
On regulation " Clearly there 's been abusive corporate behavior .
There 's no doubt about that , and it has to be regulated and controlled .
But we do n't want to inhibit creativity and innovation . "
On free trade " We 've tipped the scale too far toward trade agreements that do n't have adequate labor and environmental protections .
We have to have trade agreements that are good for American workers , not just good for American corporations .
But I do n't believe we should use that as a ruse for shutting down trade . "
On taxes " Our tax system needs to be such that it honors and respects work as well as capital , because that 's the way most people earn their living . "
On whether business should be afraid of him " No , because as President of the United States , I 'm going to make sure that we all work together to make this country great , and that includes corporate America . "
In Boston , he watched Edwards listen to the plight of a single mother , an Italian immigrant who had managed on a hotel maid 's pay to raise four children and send each one to college .
In Chicago , Edwards took a lesson in the back - breaking work of lifting 113 - pound mattresses and changing luxury duvets weighed down by piles of pillows and shams .
In L.A. , the former Senator arrived overscheduled and tired , but impressed labor leaders when he readily agreed to squeeze in an extra meeting with a group of kitchen workers on their break .
The rich lawyer with the soft Southern accent bonded comfortably with this unseen servant class .
Like a juror on one of Edwards 's personal - injury cases , Glover found himself falling under the trial lawyer 's spell .
As the duo walked into a meeting of 60 African - American community leaders in downtown L.A. to make the case for greater black support of unions , the deal was sealed .
" He was able to talk with them , not up to them or down to them , " Glover recalls .
" Here was a man who sincerely had empathy . "
Populist attacks gain political traction
Here was a man , too , who was discovering the key to his second presidential bid .
That three - day campaign for the hearts of America 's hotel workers was at the center of a broader two - year process that transformed Edwards into the 2008 race 's chief proponent of a hotly contentious view - that America 's economic salvation lies in millions more Americans paying union dues .
Edwards brings to the contest a core belief that expanding organized labor - which now accounts for just 12 percent of the workforce , down from 20 percent in the early 1980s - is the way to reduce poverty , expand the middle class , narrow the nation 's income gap and make globalization less painful .
" The difference between union and non-union is literally the difference between poverty and middle class , " Edwards told Fortune .
" Hotel workers , restaurant workers , home health workers , hospital workers - at last count there are some 50 million people who work in the service economy .
Those jobs are n't going anywhere else .
They have to be done in the United States . "
Courting the labor vote is standard procedure for Democratic presidential candidates , but Edwards goes well beyond the usual union - friendly rhetoric ; he has aggressively lobbied on behalf of legal changes to make it easier for labor to organize .
The testimonials have already begun : " I 'm 61 , and in my lifetime I do n't recall any candidate for President who articulated a belief not just that unions are good , but that they are necessary for what ails society , " says John Wilhelm , president of the apparel , textile and hospitality workers ' union Unite Here .
Edwards has emerged as the counterpoint candidate to those who argue that union costs and inflexibility - witness Detroit - are killing American companies .
Which has prompted industry leaders , for their part , to wonder if Edwards , of all the candidates , is the one most hostile to their interests .
" We have nothing against unions , but he would like to take industry down on its knees , " says Joseph McInerney , CEO of the American Hotel Lodging Association , who supported the Kerry - Edwards ticket in 2004 but now thinks Edwards has gone too far .
Standing up to corporate America in an era of booming profits , however , may be a well - timed strategy for Edwards in the Democratic primary .
Much as he did as a trial lawyer making tens of millions representing the injured against corporate abuse , the shrewd Edwards has figured out how to do well by siding with the little guy .
While labor 's membership has declined , its determination to wield its political clout has mushroomed over the past decade .
In the two most recent elections , union money ranked at the top of independent expenditures , and union leaders tell Fortune they plan to exceed their record - breaking 2004 spending in the current election .
With that as the spark plug , Edwards hopes his other assets - the appeal of his anti-war stance , a formidable campaign organization , and his experience as a presidential candidate - will enable him to surprise all those pundits betting on a two - way race between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
The issues
On an icy white Iowa City day , Edwards is delivering his populist message to a crowd of more than 800 Democrats packed into a university auditorium for a candidate town - hall meeting .
Like scores of other events , this one demonstrates that Obama and Clinton are n't the only candidates who can gather and electrify a huge crowd of Democrats .
There are two numbers high on Edwards 's mind as this race gets underway : 29 and 21 .
Howard Dean was at 29 percent - first place - in New Hampshire polls in early January 2004 , before the Iowa caucuses .
But practically overnight his surprisingly weak third - place showing in Iowa pushed his New Hampshire number down to 21 percent , while Kerry shot past him .
Edwards may be trailing Clinton and Obama nationally , but he knows firsthand that Iowa can be a make - or - break stop for candidates .
And as recently as mid-April , Iowa polls were showing him in the lead .
Fortunately for Edwards , next year 's newly revised calendar slots the Nevada caucus next - an event to be heavily influenced by unionized hotel workers , who adore him .
Bottom line : Edwards hopes to sail into New Hampshire on the wings of top - place showings in Iowa and Nevada .
The new Newt thing " How about this gentleman with a tie on right here , " Edwards says , standing in the center of the Iowa auditorium , holding a mike in one hand , pointing a finger with the other .
" I always get nervous when I see a tie on . "
The twentysomething gentleman turns out to be neither a corporate shill nor a Republican spy , but the kind of questioner who enables Edwards to show off the " frankness niche " he has artfully carved out in the '08 race to distinguish himself from the more cautious front - runner , Clinton .
" You 've been talking about race and diversity , " says Wayne from Iowa City , " and I was wondering what you had planned to pursue rights for gays and lesbians . "
" The real question , which you did n't ask because you were being nice , " Edwards says , drawing out the pronunciation of " nice " as the Carolinian nahhs , " is my position on gay marriage .
This is , for me , a very difficult issue personally because of the place I come from , my own faith tradition , growing up in the rural South .
I feel internal conflict about this , just so you know .
I do n't feel any righteousness .
But where I am today is for civil unions and substantive rights . "
That would be a no for gay marriage , and yet the liberal audience offers robust applause .
Like Edwards 's oft - repeated apology for his 2002 Senate vote to authorize the Iraq war , this frankness resonates with Democrats who felt used in 2004 , throwing their support to a candidate who fitfully flopped rightward .
After watching John Kerry 's hairsplitting answers up close , Edwards is building a left - leaning version of John McCain 's 2000 " straight talk express , " looking voters in the eye and offering answers they do n't always want to hear .

Greece is finally done with its epic bailout binge
Europe is preparing another crackdown on Big Tech
We are nowhere near that situation .
This week Ian Pearson , the climate change minister , announced plans for retailers to use a labelling system so that customers know which products , through their whole life cycle , leave the largest carbon footprint .
Good idea .
But the code will be voluntary , will take at least 18 months to develop , and , when it comes out , will probably be no more transparent than the information about sugar and salt in foodstuffs .
Climate change is treated as a matter of private consumer choice , like eating lentils rather than doughnuts .
The truth is that , when it comes to cutting carbon emissions , our politics , our society and our economy are not fit for purpose .
The Treasury - commissioned review by Sir Nicholas Stern argued that action to mitigate climate change " must be viewed as an investment , a cost incurred now and in the coming few decades to avoid the risks of very severe consequences in the future " .
But long - term investment - which always carries an element of uncertainty - is precisely what we are bad at .
Like children , we prefer £ 1 today to £ 2 tomorrow ; and , even more , we prefer it to £ 5 we wo n't be around to collect a century hence .
Nearly every postwar British government has neglected investment for consumption .
New Labour has done better , but largely by using the private finance initiative which , in effect , piles the costs on to future generations .
Private consumers , in both Britain and America , have steadily accumulated debt , as well as leaving it to their children 's and grandchildren 's earnings to finance their pensions and care in old age .
Business is dominated by " shareholder value " : minimising costs and maximising returns so as to ramp up the share price without regard for a company 's long - term health .
In short , our entire way of life is chronically short - termist .
This explains why America , which you 'd expect to leap at the high profits that could eventually be made from developing green technology , has been so reluctant to support action .
As far as corporate America is concerned , the short - term costs are too high , the returns too far in the future .
Stern , by phrasing the argument in terms of conventional economics , has n't really helped .
If we do n't act now , he argues , climate change will cost us more in the future .
He applies what economists call a social discount rate of less than 1 % , which means , roughly speaking , that if we pour resources into cutting carbon emissions now it will seem money well spent in 50 or 100 years ' time .
Critics protest that the rate is too low because our grandchildren will be richer than we are and , therefore , better able to afford action against climate change .
This essentially technical argument misses the point about global warming , which is that , if we continue polluting , it will eventually be impossible for humanity to avoid disaster , no matter what the resources at its disposal .
Some people choose not to insure their houses , calculating that , in the event of fire , they have sufficient resources to pay the rebuilding costs .
But what if there are no bricks or cement left ?
That , if climate scientists are right , is analogous to the situation humanity could face by the end of the century .
Politicians have little difficulty with some solutions to global warming .
Prohibitions , raising taxes and bossing us around come naturally to them .
Unfortunately , they call for sacrifice at exactly the moment when public trust is at an all - time low .
Any proposal that might help cut carbon emissions - road - pricing , say , or waste recycling - meets strong opposition from vociferous lobbies .
Even phasing out high - energy lightbulbs is resisted on the grounds that the equivalent low - energy ones are a bit dim and old folk might fall down the stairs .
It 's all very well for Stern , a clever economist , to talk about social discount rates .
But how does he factor in grandma 's refusal to grope around in poor light for a few seconds rather than protect her great - grandchildren from the risk of drowning next century ?
In any case , grandma might object , using 80 watts less when she switches the light on wo n't by itself save the world , but it could easily kill or cripple her .
Is n't what she does insignificant against the rising emissions of a billion Chinese ?
Grandma has a point .
The same politicians who demand that we fly on fewer overseas holidays or turn down the heating continue to build roads and airports .
They do so because they fear Britain will otherwise become uncompetitive and then the Chinese will take all our jobs and money .
Behind our thinking about global warming lies an unspoken assumption : that , in the end , science and technology will rescue us .
Perhaps we shall launch giant reflectors into space to protect us from the sun 's rays .
Or discover new ways of growing food so it wo n't matter if half the world 's agricultural land turns into desert .
More plausibly , we may find a new source of low - cost , low - emission energy .
As Bush reiterated yesterday , America has most faith in technical fixes , and at least he is honest about it .
But it is the biggest illusion of all .
Science and technology have n't delivered on half the promises of the past 50 years .
We do n't have a cure for cancer .
We do n't have robots to do the cleaning .
We can't take holidays on the moon .
And we still have n't found a way to harness high - temperature superconductivity which , we were told 20 years ago , would cut energy waste by half .
I am no scientist , and the climate change sceptics could , for all I know , be right .
I would have more faith in them if they could decide exactly what they are being sceptical about .
Is global warming not happening at all ?
Or is it down to sunspots rather than human activity ?
Or can we rely on the market to come up with the answers ?
Sometimes , all three arguments are presented simultaneously .
No , I am not the sandal - wearing fanatic of sceptic legend , wishing my dismal lifestyle on everyone else .
I burn coal fires in winter , I 'm off to New Zealand this year , and I estimate my home has a hundred electric light bulbs , though they 're not all on at once .
That 's why I do n't hold out much hope .
Having been convinced that global warming is a genuine threat , I still think , deep down , that you only live once and my own carbon footprint wo n't make much of a difference .
Which is just what everyone else thinks .

We 're not sure what flavor you like your laxatives , PEZ and tortilla chips , but we 're guessing these are n't them .
The following are some of the biggest marketing missteps , all done in very bad taste .
PEZ that belong in a vase :
The truth is , everyone loves the containers .
But I , for one , am actually a huge fan of that chalky deliciousness of PEZ candy .
Whether it 's grape , lemon , strawberry or orange , one packet of the good stuff never seems to be enough .
That said , it 's only recently that I learned that PEZ had quite a few failures on the flavor front back in the 1960s ( including a cherry PEZ that tasted too much like cough medicine ) .
Specific recipes aside , however , their absolute worst idea has to be the psychedelic Flower flavored PEZ , introduced in 1968 .
I 'm not sure what sort of marketing survey determined that people wanted to step up to this all - you - can - eat bouquet , but where flower power was a huge success in the 60s , PEZ 's flower powder was n't .
Vegetable Jell -O : Of course PEZ was n't the only beloved kids treat to make a few missteps .
One of the biggest flavor offenders seems to be Jell - O , who tried and failed with Coffee , Chocolate and Cola flavors ( which latter went flat the soonest , almost immediately after it launched ) .
Their most behated flavor , however , has to be Celery , which was apparently created for use in salads .
And while Jell - O still sticks by their " There 's always room for Jell - O "  slogan , supermarkets did n't feel that way , and quickly booted it from their shelves .
( several more after the jump )
From the EX - LAX to the Next Lax : I 'd read about Fig - flavored Ex -Lax and the bomb that it was a few years ago while doing a mental_floss story , but it 's only recently that we found pictures of the tins .
I 'm not sure what inspired the unusual fruit flavoring , but I do like their effort .
Of course , the only thing stranger than the fig flavor to me is how the inventor came up with the name for his product .
Immigrant Max Kiss told everyone that Ex - Lax stood for excellent laxative , but the name actually came from the Hungarian newspaper , which used it as a slang term for parliamentary deadlock .
DORITOS inspired by LOL cats :
While it has n't bombed just yet , the super - secret Doritos X - 13D are cheeseburger flavored and only available in taste test labs as of now .
Apparently , the chips are brighter than the average Dorito ( which I 'm guessing means they glow ? ) , and taste like an All - American favorite with a hint of pickle .
I 'm not a gambling man , but I 'm guessing the Vegas odds on this one lasting a full year are pretty slim .
Unpopular POP - TARTS : Oddly enough , sometimes there are flavors that sound decently appetizing , but just do n't work in the market place .
Pop -Tarts forays into Chocolate Cherry Chip and Frosted Peanut butter and Jelly seem to be two flavors that neither kids nor mother approved .
Without much in the way of shelf - confidence , the two normal tastes were quickly relegated to land of forgotten flavors .
Similarly , Nestle Quik 's surprisingly unpopular Cookies N Cream simply could n't sway enough milk drinkers its way .
TOOTHPASTE and brushes of genius :
That said , occasionally marketers reach to capitalize on silver screen potential .
That seems to be the case with , well , REACH toothpaste , which decided what better flavor to brush your teeth with than banana flavored toothpaste .
Of course , the cute monkey business that is Curious George tooth gel has nothing on Breath Pallette's , which come in the strange Sweet Salt , Darjeeling Tea , and Indian Curry flavors to name a few .
DISGUSTING FLAVORS THAT WORK :
Of course , sometimes gross flavors are just part of the gimmick .
Bertie Bott 's Jelly Beans , straight out of Harry Potter for instance , feature yuck - inducing varieties like black pepper , earwax , earthworm and vomit .
Kids , however , do n't seem to be the only ones wiling to put their allowance on the line for a bit of disgusting .
Fans of Jones Soda regularly shell out their Thanksgiving cash to get a sip of their limited - edition turkey and gravy flavored pop .
----
So , did we miss any gross flavor missteps along the way ?
Post " ˜em in the comments already !
I 'm itching to hear more .

Released D.C. protesters say police used intimidation tactics Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday September 7 , 2007
Print This Email This
Two of the protesters arrested on Thursday during an outdoor press conference at Washington D.C. 's Lafayette Square say that the show of force from police at the scene -- which included a S.W.A.T. team and mounted officers , according to reports -- was excessive and designed to send a message .
Tina Richards , of the group Grassroots America , and Ian Thompson , a lawyer and organizer for the anti-war group ANSWER Los Angeles , spoke to RAW STORY shortly after they were released from jail and formally charged with misdemeanors in D.C. Superior Court .
A third individual , Adam Kokesh , a leader of Iraq Veterans Against the War , has also been released , Richards and Thompson said .
" They were completely there to intimidate , " said Tina Richards in a telephone interview with RAW STORY .
" We were there to say , ' no , ' you wo n't . "
After Richards confirmed the basics of earlier accounts of the arrests in the Washington Post and the AFP --" My attorney brought me the stories in jail , " she said -- the activist and mother of an Iraq war veteran reported that the police 's actions were uncalled for .
" We were in complete compliance with D.C. law , " said Richards of the group 's activities yesterday , which included pasting an advertisement for an anti-war march taking place in Washington next week on an electrical box .
She was charged today with defacing public property .
Richards also says she was injured in the scuffle that preceded the arrests .
" I 'm on my way to the hospital right now , " she said by telephone .
" One of the S.W.A.T. team [ members ] harassed my daughter ... and they slammed my head up against the side of a door . "
Ian Thompson , who was charged with interfering with a police officer , says the tough treatment from police extended to the group 's night in jail .
" We were shackled with leg irons from about six in the morning until two this afternoon , " he said .
" They completely overreacted - - I was picking up a bucket of paste , " referring to the adhesive the group was using to put up a sign .
" When [ the police ] are fishing for things , they really go for it , " he said , adding that the three of them had initially been charged with disorderly conduct .
" I mean , picking up a paste bucket ? "
Thompson says the timing of the upcoming Sept. 15 rally -- days after General David Petraeus is scheduled to give his progress report on Iraq to Congress -- is key .
" The heat that 's coming down on Congress about the Iraq war is really having an effect ... actions like this are going to have a big impact . "
" If they 're scared of three activists , " said Thompson , " just wait until there 's tens of thousands . ' "
WASHINGTON — It ’s way past bedtime for Gonzo .
At this point , every day Alberto Gonzales continues as attorney general means more dishonor for the office and the nation — and higher blood pressure for Senate Judiciary Committee members trying desperately to get a straight answer out of the man .
Gonzo has managed to do something no one else in Washington has managed in years : create a spirit of true bipartisanship .
After his pathetic act in front of the committee Tuesday , it ’s no surprise that Democrats are threatening to investigate him for perjury .
But it was Sen. Arlen Specter , a Republican , who looked Gonzo in the face and told him , “ I do not find your testimony credible , candidly . ”
Specter seems ready to pop a gasket .
“ The hearing two days ago was devastating ” for Gonzo , Specter said Thursday .
“ But so was the hearing before that , and so was the hearing before that . ”
Over time , one becomes almost numb to this administration ’s relentless lies and can - you - top - this transgressions .
A kind of “ outrage fatigue ” sets in , accompanied by the knowledge that whatever it is that they ’ve done this time , it could have been worse .
So when George W. Bush rewrote history the other day by saying that “ al - Qaida terrorists killed Americans on 9/11 [ and ] they ’re fighting us in Iraq , ” the tendency is to duly note that the president is not telling the truth — there is no evidence whatsoever that al - Qaida in Iraq , which did n’t exist at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks , takes orders from Osama bin Laden — and then move on .
Hey , at least it ’s just talk .
At least he did n’t invade Iran or Pakistan .
Yet .
For me , at least , Gonzo is the perfect antidote to midsummer apathy .
The guy is … I was going to say the guy ’s unbelievable , but I ’d just be repeating the bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill .
What set the senators a-sputtering was Gonzo ’s testimony about the night in 2004 when he showed up at the hospital bedside of his predecessor , John Ashcroft , to try to get him to overrule his deputy and reauthorize Bush ’s secret program of warrantless electronic eavesdropping .
The Justice Department had concluded , most inconveniently for the White House , that the program as then constituted was illegal .
James Comey , the former Ashcroft deputy who intercepted Gonzo in Ashcroft ’s hospital room , revealed that incident in gripping testimony earlier this year .
But Gonzo had previously told Congress that there was no “ serious disagreement ” within the administration over the surveillance program .
Kind of a conflict there .
Asked about the glaring discrepancy , Gonzo said Tuesday that the disagreement and the hospital visit were about “ other intelligence activities , ” and “ not about the terrorist surveillance program that the president announced to the American people . ”
Specter ’s response : “ Mr. Attorney General , do you expect us to believe that ? ”
No one believes it .
The most generous interpretation is that Gonzo , fearful of facing a perjury rap , is insisting on an artificially and dishonestly narrow definition of “ the terrorist surveillance program that the president announced ” — leaving out “ intelligence activities ” that any reasonable person , including Comey , would consider part of the program .
The nice word for that would be dissembling .
The not - so - nice word would be lying .
Hence the call Thursday by a group of Senate Democrats for a perjury investigation .
I hope they nail him .
Anyone tempted to feel sympathy for Gonzo should check out his weaselly explanations of why he would think it appropriate to buttonhole a sick man in his hospital room , regardless of the issue .
“ There are no rules governing whether or not General Ashcroft can decide ‘ I ’m feeling well enough to make this decision , ’ ” Gonzo said .
When Specter pointed out that Ashcroft had already turned his powers over to Comey , Gonzo replied , “ And he could always reclaim that .
There are no rules . … ”
“ While he ’s in the hospital under sedation ? ” Specter interrupted , before giving up on getting a straight answer .
Gonzo answered the question , all right — inadvertently , of course : “ There are no rules . ”
That ’s the guiding philosophy of this administration .
As far as these people are concerned , there are no rules of common decency .
There are no rules of customary practice .
There are no rules governing respect for the truth , or even respect for the privacy and health of an ailing colleague .
And we all know who sets that tone .
Sen .
Chuck Schumer tried valiantly to get Gonzo to say who sent him on that Mafia - movie errand to the hospital .
Gonzo ’s a loyal soldier ; he would n’t snitch .
All Schumer got out of him was that the visit was “ on behalf of the president of the United States . ”

More Harm Than Good By DANIEL W. DREZNER
March 16 , 2006 ; Page D8
Pledging money to Africa was the hip thing to do last year .
The United Nations Millennium Project rolled out its big plan to combat global poverty .
British Prime Minister Tony Blair talked about " a big , big push forward " to help Africa .
Jeffrey Sachs wrote an earnest tome on how to end poverty , made the cover of Time and wound up traveling across Africa with Angelina Jolie .
At Gleneagles , Scotland , the G - 8 pledged to double its aid flows to Africa ; Bob Geldof organized the Live 8 concert at the same time .
Time magazine capped off the year by naming Bono one of its persons of the year for his tireless campaigning for African debt relief .
A lot of foreign - aid money supports bad thinking , bad programs and bad governments .
The trouble with these charitable efforts is that they will probably do more harm than good .
At least , that is the conclusion one comes to after reading William Easterly 's " The White Man 's Burden . "
Mr. Easterly was a World Bank economist for more than 15 years , until he wrote a book -- 2001 's " The Elusive Quest for Growth " -- that was honest enough to note that the World Bank did not have a good grip on how to promote economic growth in the developing world .
In " The White Man's Burden , " Mr. Easterly -- now a New York University economist -- focuses his keen analytic prowess on the utility of foreign aid .
The foreign - aid community , according to Mr. Easterly , is mostly composed of Planners .
They think of development as a technical engineering problem and generate ambitious plans to eliminate the causes of poverty in a multi-pronged intervention .
But Planners are embedded in and beholden to rich donors -- large institutions in the West .
Thus they lack real - life , on - the - ground feedback , and they lack accountability , both of which would allow them to improve their policies over time .
Mr. Easterly prefers what he calls Searchers -- those who learn through trial and error in the field .
They can't achieve the ambitious goals set out by Planners , but they can deliver at least some results .
" The White Man 's Burden " is one long exercise in demonstrating why the Planners ' mentality is wrong and why a little humility is in order : " The West cannot transform the Rest .
It is a fantasy to think that the West can change complex societies with very different histories and cultures into some image of itself .
The main hope for the poor is for them to be their own Searchers , borrowing ideas and technology from the West when it suits them to do so . "
Mr. Easterly shows why many of the development fads of the past 50 years -- the big push , donor coordination , shock therapy -- failed to do much good .
He does a nifty job of disproving Jeffrey Sachs 's claim that the real problem with Africa is that it is stuck in a " poverty trap " -- i.e. , so poor that it cannot generate economic growth on its own .
The real problem is bad governance .
Aid institutions have not helped matters by doling out grants and loans to corrupt and thuggish regimes .

THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN
By William Easterly
( Penguin Press , 448 pages , $ 27.95 )
Even the recent push to make AIDS treatment more accessible in Africa withers under Mr. Easterly 's gaze .
The aid community , by focusing on treatment of those already suffering from HIV , has cut back on investments that would get a bigger bang for the buck -- like efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS or to encourage vaccination for other diseases .
Lest one think that Mr. Easterly is generalizing unfairly , it is worth noting that he has done something that very few people do :
He has actually read the reams of reports churned out by the development community year after year .
Déjà vu begins to set in after seeing Mr. Easterly quote from the failed projects of decades ago -- the problems and " solutions " repeat themselves miserably .
He has great fun , too , interpreting this turgid prose for the layman .
A war is relabeled as a " conflict - related reallocation of resources " ; corrupt leaders who raid public coffers create " governance issues . "
After reading Mr. Easterly 's assault on the hubris of Planners , one should not expect him to provide miracle cures .
And indeed , he makes it clear that " the only Big Answer is that there is no Big Answer . "
He suggests that development experts take the economic equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath and first pledge to do no harm .
After that , focus aid on observable outputs so that aid agencies can measure their effectiveness .
Fund ombudsmen or other outside observers to evaluate what has been done .
Aim for piecemeal , gradual progress rather than the big bang .
All this is quite persuasive .
Still , " The White Man 's Burden " merits a bit of negative feedback itself .
The Planners / Searchers dichotomy is a bit too glib -- even a technocrat like Mr. Sachs has argued for local knowledge and on - the - ground feedback .
And after thundering against Planners for most of the book , Mr. Easterly trumpets the governments of Singapore and Japan as the epitome of Searchers .
Arguably there is a great deal of top - down Planning going on in both places .
Since the theme of " The Elusive Quest for Growth " was that " people respond to incentives , " it 's odd that , in " The White Man 's Burden , " Mr. Easterly bashes the idea of conditioning foreign aid on results -- especially since , along the way , he praises a Mexican domestic program that uses incentives to good effect .
Mr. Easterly devotes too little space discussing the ways in which nongovernmental organizations -- so - called NGOs -- could provide a competitive market for aid provision .
And he says fairly little about the potential value of humanitarian relief -- a surprising omission given the role that aid played following the tsunami and earthquakes that devastated Asia in 2005 .
He does blast the folly of humanitarian interventions , they are Wilsonian or neoconservative in origin , but fails to discuss the ethics of doing nothing when tragedies like Darfur unfold .
Mr. Easterly 's response to Darfur might well be : " Do nothing -- action is worse than inaction . "
After reading " The White Man 's Burden , " I fear that he may be right .
Mr. Drezner is assistant professor of political science at the University of Chicago .

These galaxy clusters show that younger , more distant galaxy clusters contained far more active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) than older , nearby ones .
It was found that the clusters at 58 percent of the Universe ’s current age contained about 20 times more AGN than those at 82 percent of Universe 's age .
The galaxies in the earlier Universe contained much more gas that allowed for more star formation and black hole growth .
In the Chandra X - ray images , red , green , and blue represent low , medium , and high - energy X - rays .

Supermassive black holes have been discovered to grow more rapidly in young galaxy clusters , according to new results from NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory .
These " fast - track " supermassive black holes can have a big influence on the galaxies and clusters that they live in .
Using Chandra , scientists surveyed a sample of clusters and counted the fraction of galaxies with rapidly growing supermassive black holes , known as active galactic nuclei ( or AGN ) .
The data show , for the first time , that younger , more distant galaxy clusters contained far more AGN than older , nearby ones .
Galaxy clusters are some of the largest structures in the Universe , consisting of many individual galaxies , a few of which contain AGN .
Earlier in the history of the universe , these galaxies contained a lot more gas for star formation and black hole growth than galaxies in clusters do today .
This fuel allows the young cluster black holes to grow much more rapidly than their counterparts in nearby clusters .
" The black holes in these early clusters are like piranha in a very well - fed aquarium , " said Jason Eastman of Ohio State University ( OSU ) and first author of this study .
" It 's not that they beat out each other for food , rather there was so much that all of the piranha were able to really thrive and grow quickly . "
The team used Chandra to determine the fraction of AGN in four different galaxy clusters at large distances , when the Universe was about 58 % of its current age .
Then they compared this value to the fraction found in more nearby clusters , those about 82 % of the Universe 's current age .
The result was the more distant clusters contained about 20 times more AGN than the less distant sample .
AGN outside clusters are also more common when the Universe is younger , but only by factors of two or three over the same age span .
" It 's been predicted that there would be fast - track black holes in clusters , but we never had good evidence until now , " said co-author Paul Martini , also of OSU .
" This can help solve a couple of mysteries about galaxy clusters . "
One mystery is why there are so many blue , star - forming galaxies in young , distant clusters and fewer in nearby , older clusters .
AGN are believed to expel or destroy cool gas in their host galaxy through powerful eruptions from the black hole .
This may stifle star formation and the blue , massive stars will then gradually die off , leaving behind only the old , redder stars .
This process takes about a billion years or more to take place , so a dearth of star - forming galaxies is only noticeable for older clusters .
The process that sets the temperature of the hot gas in clusters when they form is also an open question .
These new results suggest that even more AGN may have been present when most clusters were forming about ten billion years ago .
Early heating of a cluster by large numbers of AGN can have a significant , long - lasting effect on the structure of a cluster by " puffing up " the gas .
" In a few nearby clusters we 've seen evidence for huge eruptions generated by supermassive black holes .
But this is sedate compared to what might be going on in younger clusters , " said Eastman .
These results appeared in the July 20th issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .

SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ( publ .
08/07/07 )
An article about GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul ’s visit to Google incorrectly stated the country from which Vijay Boyapati immigrated .
Boyapati , a Google employee , immigrated from Australia .
Ron Paul , the Texas GOP congressman and long - shot candidate for president , credits a rabid Internet following with spreading his staunch libertarian and anti-war message into the mainstream media .
So you might think the unlikely Web phenom , who got an enthusiastic reception when he spoke Friday to about 250 Google employees , plus 100 sent to an overflow room , would be the technology industry ’s best friend .
Not so .
Paul did call the Internet “ rather miraculous , ” as he pitched his free - market , small - government mantra to the employees , many of whom came in shorts and even one in bare feet .
“ Thank goodness there ’s the Internet or whatever it is , ” he said , referring to a fanatic Web - based network of supporters who are intent on boosting his campaign .
But he did not sanitize his talk for his Net- centric audience .
He said he does not support network neutrality , the concept that telecommunications companies should be restricted from controlling broadband access to the detriment of Web companies like Google , nor does he support tech - friendly immigration reforms in Congress recently .
And he does n’t believe in federal student government loans , which a huge majority of the audience , by a show of hands , had used to make it through college .
In fact , the blunt - talking , sometimes humorous Paul told the audience at Google , where former Vice President Al Gore serves as senior adviser , that he thinks fears of global warming are “ overblown . ”
And then he raised the question of why American business should be subject to more regulation if so much pollution is coming from China .
“ I do n’t agree with him on everything , especially immigration , ” said Google employee Vijay Boyapati , an Indian immigrant who gained citizenship last year .
But Boyapati , wearing a Ron Paul T - shirt , finds Paul so “ refreshing ” that he flew from Google ’s Seattle office just to hear him in person .
Paul , who turns 72 next month , has become a darling of the blogosphere .
Friday , as measured by Technorati , “ Ron Paul ” was the third - most - searched phrase appearing on blogs , ahead of “ iPhone ” and “ Harry Potter . ”
Through Internet - based fundraising , he has managed to raise more than $ 3 million since the beginning of the year , most of it in the most recent quarter , and he had more money in the bank at the end of the June than Republican U.S. Sen.
John McCain of Arizona .
The 10 - term congressman , who represents the Houston - area , ran for president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1988 , though he has served in Congress as a Republican .
His fan base only became more energized after an interview last weekend on ABC when George Stephanopolous , host of “ This Week , ” told Paul he would bet “ every cent ” that Paul would not become president .
At Google , Paul reiterated his controversial stance that ongoing American military presence in the Middle East over decades is responsible for the chaos in Iraq .
“ We are the motivation for the civil war over there , ” he said .
“ The American empire is going to fail .
It ’s in the process of failing . ”
An adamant opponent of gun control , Paul said , “ I think the Second Amendment might have prevented 9/11 . ”
If the hijackers knew the passengers or crew might be armed , they may have never planned such an attack , he said .
And while he values the work of immigrants coming to the United States , he thinks illegal immigrants should not be given a special pass to citizenship .
Speaking of illegal immigration , he said , “ I do n’t think you can solve that problem as long as you have a welfare state . ”
“ We have touched a nerve with a lot of young people , ” Paul told the audience .
When Google executive Elliot Schrage , who interviewed Paul on Friday , asked which Googlers had taken out a student loan to go to college , most raised their hand .
Paul then responded , “ Why should people who do n’t go to college support your education ? ”
And then he flashed his candidate side : Could he win their vote back with his pledge to free them from a Social Security system from which he says they will never benefit ?
Paul is scheduled to appear today at 10 a.m. at a public rally in Mountain View ’s Charleston Park .

In its annual report on human trafficking , the U.S. State Department added the four to its list of 16 countries subject to possible sanctions , including the loss of U.S. aid and U.S. support for World Bank and International Monetary Fund loans .
Algeria , Equatorial Guinea and Malaysia were also added to the bottom -- Tier 3 -- ranking of countries that failed to meet minimum U.S. standards on combating human trafficking or of making significant efforts to improve their record .
The others in this category were Cuba , Iran , Myanmar , North Korea , Saudi Arabia , Sudan , Syria , Uzbekistan and Venezuela .
Under U.S. law , these countries have 90 days to improve their records or face sanctions .
The Bush administration can choose not to impose sanctions if it wishes .
In presenting the report , U.S. Ambassador Mark Lagon told reporters it was “ especially disappointing ” that many of the countries that slid into the lowest ranking were rich Middle Eastern nations that have the money to combat the problem .
He noted that Saudi Arabia is on the bottom rung for the third year in a row .
The annual “ Trafficking in Persons Report , ” documents cases of girls sold into prostitution , boys compelled to become child soldiers , and adults and children forced to work on fishing boats that stay at sea for years , leaving them unable to escape and vulnerable to disease , starvation and physical abuse .
The United States estimates 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders each year , roughly 80 percent of them women and girls and as many as half of the total minors .
POLITICAL FACTORS ?
Rights groups say such U.S. blacklists sometimes appear politically motivated .
Friendly countries with major trafficking problems such as India were not placed in the worst category , where U.S. antagonists like Syria , North Korea , Cuba and Venezuela routinely appear .
The report includes three other categories : Tier 1 for nations that meet minimum U.S. standards ;
Tier 2 for those that are making significant efforts to do so , and Tier 2 “ Special Watch List ” for those that deserve special scrutiny .
Rep. Chris Smith , a New Jersey Republican who helped write the law mandating the report , said too many countries -- 32 of them this year -- are being placed on the “ Special Watch List ” rather than being put in the lowest category .
“ We believe it is being misused to park certain countries like India , which the record clearly indicates ought to be on Tier 3 , ” he said in an interview , saying he was considering amending the law to bar countries from being on the watchlist for more than three years .
Lagon denied any political motivation and noted Zimbabwe , which has a poor relationship with the United States , escaped the Tier 3 ranking .
He also noted improvements by Georgia , Hungary and Slovenia , which rose to “ Tier 1 ” this year .
Last year the report for the first time acknowledged that the United States had paid contractors in Iraq who were later found to have abused laborers hired from abroad .
The report criticized Iraq ’s government for failing to prosecute any trafficking cases , to protect victims or to take steps to prevent abuses “ despite reports of a growing labor trafficking problem among women and foreign nationals . ”
Iraq is not ranked in the report because of the turmoil its government faces in trying to quell the insurgency that erupted after the 2003 U.S. - led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein .
Well , that did n't take long -- the hacker crew of IRC channel # iPhone has managed to enable shell access to the iPhone just a week after its release .
There 's not a lot to the hack -- the iPhone 's 30 - pin dock connector features the same pinouts as the iPod , so creating a serial connection simply involved connecting up a resistor , ground , and RS - 232 level converter and running a few commands from iphoneinterface .
The resulting shell is pretty basic , but features a TFTP client -- meaning that we should see a flood of attempts to open the iPhone up in the coming weeks ( as if we would n't anyway ) .

( CNN ) --
In June 2004 , Trisha Torrey found a golf ball - size lump in her torso .
A surgeon removed it and gave her the grim news : cancer .
If you do n't get better after treatment , ask your doctor more questions .
And it was n't just any cancer but an extremely rare type of lymphoma .
" The oncologist told me that if I did n't begin chemo immediately , " says Torrey , " I would be dead by Christmas . "
The 52 - year - old marketing consultant says she was petrified .
But something in her gut told her the diagnosis was wrong .
Her doctor assured her it was right : two labs had confirmed the subcutaneous panniculitis - like T - cell lymphoma .
Against her doctor 's orders , Torrey delayed chemo and went to another oncologist , who sent a tissue sample to the National Institutes of Health .
The result : Torrey never had cancer .
The lump was a harmless fatty growth .
" On the one hand , I was overjoyed ; on the other hand , I was just furious , " Torrey says .
She could n't believe she had been on the verge of having chemotherapy for nothing .
What was it in Torrey 's gut that told her the diagnosis might be wrong ?
It 's a lesson worth learning because misdiagnoses are more common than you might think : A 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association says autopsy studies show doctors are wrong 10 percent to 15 percent of the time .
Here , from Torrey and from medical experts , are some red flags -- five reasons for suspecting your doctor might have made the wrong diagnosis .
1 . You do n't get better with treatment
Sometimes doctors stick to a diagnosis even when multiple treatments are n't working .
As vice president for loss prevention and patient safety at Harvard 's Risk Management Foundation , Bob Hanscom remembers one particular lawsuit against Harvard doctors .
A young woman complained of stomach and chest pain .
Her doctor prescribed a medicine for gastric reflux .
When it did n't work , a second doctor prescribed another drug for gastric reflux .
It also did n't work .
The woman ended up in the emergency room with acute pancreatitis , which eventually caused kidney failure .
She survived but will be on dialysis the rest of her life .
" In her deposition , she said nobody was listening to her , so she kind of gave up , " Hanscom says .
" When I read that , I thought , ' Oh God , I wish you had n't given up . ' "
2 . Your symptoms do n't match your diagnosis
This is where the Internet comes in .
You do n't have to be a medical professional to Google your diagnosis .
For example , let 's say a doctor diagnoses you with tendinitis .
Looking it up , you can find out it usually lasts about six to 12 weeks , according to Dr. Saul Weingart , an internist and vice president for patient safety at Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston , Massachusetts .
If you 're still in pain beyond that time , the doctor may have made the wrong diagnosis .
3 . Your diagnosis is based purely on a lab test
The reality is that labs make mistakes .
In Torrey 's case , she says two labs made mistakes .
When lab results are the sole criteria for a diagnosis , that can be a red flag , says Torrey , who works as a patient advocate .
Another red flag is when a diagnosis of a rare disease comes from a lab that does n't specialize in that disease , Weingart says .
4 . Your doctor attributes common complaints to an uncommon ailment
Torrey says her doctor said her night sweats and hot flashes were caused by the extremely rare lymphoma .
Actually , they were signs of menopause .
5 . Your diagnosis usually involves a test you never received
This is where the Internet comes in handy again .
If you find out a specific test can determine the diagnosis you 've been given , but you were never given that test , that 's a reason to head back to the doctor 's office armed with questions , says Torrey .
If you suspect you 've been misdiagnosed , you have two choices :
You can go back to the doctor who made the original diagnosis , or you can seek out a second opinion ( or do both ) .
In next week 's Empowered Patient , we 'll tell you how in either case you can help your doctor come up with the correct diagnosis .

I bet you ’re reading this at work -- and feeling guilty about it .
Rest easy .
You are not alone .
A recent survey found that the typical American worker wastes slightly more than two hours a day , not including lunch and scheduled breaks .
The insurance industry is particularly rife with time wasters ( can you blame them ? ) and Missouri , for reasons not entirely clear , is the state with the highest percentage of slackers .
The No. 1 time - wasting activity is surfing the Internet and sending personal e-mails ( a finding perhaps skewed by the fact that the survey , conducted by AOL and salary.com , was Web - based ) , followed by socializing with co-workers , conducting personal business and just plain “ spacing out . ”
All of this loafing is supposedly costing employers $ 759 billion a year in lost productivity .
The findings were greeted , predictably , with much hand - wringing about the declining American work ethic .
I find the survey disturbing too , but for a different reason .
American workers , it turns out , are wasting less time than they did just a couple of years ago -- 19 % less .
We must stop this dangerous trend .
The elevation of hard work to the status of noble pursuit is , in the sweep of human history , relatively recent .
The ancient Greeks and Romans viewed hard work as a curse .
Attitudes toward work differ not only across time but also place .
Corinne Maier ’s appropriately slim volume , “ Bonjour Laziness : Why Hard Work Does n’t Pay , ” advocated that workers resort to “ active disengagement ” at the office .
It was a bestseller in France but did n’t resonate on these shores .
When it comes to interspersing work and frivolity , nobody beats the Thais .
“ If a job is n’t sanuk -- fun -- it ’s hardly worth doing , ” Thai architect Sumet Jumsai told me over a Scotch at his Bangkok office recently .
Jumsai is no slouch , though .
He ’s designed some of Thailand ’s landmark buildings -- and , clearly , had fun doing it .
In this country , there is talk of trying to derail the office slackers by blocking access to Facebook and other time - wasting websites .
I think that effort is doomed , because this is an old story : Company heralds new technology as a novel “ productivity tool . ”
Company is shocked ( shocked ! ) to discover that same technology is also a novel time waster .
Despite all of this fretting , we are no slacker nation .
The U.N. 's International Labor Organization recently issued a report that found that the U.S. leads the world in worker productivity -- and by a wide margin .
So why do we feel like such slackers ?
For one thing , we are a nation ambivalent about work .
We both cherish it and resent it .
I suspect that some of this loafing is a subtle form of revenge .
With work now sloshing over into personal time ( think BlackBerry ) , it seems only natural that personal time should slosh back into work .
Technology is fast rendering distinctions between “ work ” and “ leisure ” meaningless .
This is a problem .
If the U.S. is to stay strong , we need to goof off more at work , not less .
Goofing off is not a waste of time -- well , not always .
Exhibit A : Albert Einstein .
He was a world - class loafer .
In 1905 , he was working as a clerk at a Swiss patent office , spending a lot of time spacing out .
A “ respectable federal ink pisser ” is how Einstein described himself .
Yet it was at work , daydreaming one day , watching a builder on a nearby rooftop , that he experienced “ the happiest thought of my life ” -- a thought that soon blossomed into his “ special theory of relativity . ”
Thus the recent Web survey gets to the heart of the paradox .
We are a nation of doers , hard workers , yet we are also a nation of ideas , big ideas .
These two aspects of the American personality constantly rub against each other ; great ideas require idleness , but idleness makes us uncomfortable .
In his essay , “ In Praise of Idleness , ” British philosopher Bertrand Russell proposed reducing the workday to four hours , convinced that “ the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work . ”
I agree .
So be creative , be happy and waste some more time .

Salon : Former CIA officers report Bush ' did n't give a fuck about intelligence ' Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday September 6 , 2007
Print This Email This Months before the Iraq invasion , President Bush apparently ignored a 2002 Oval Office briefing in which CIA director George Tenet provided the president with intelligence that Saddam Hussein did not possess weapons of mass destruction , according to former Clinton advisor and Salon columnist Sidney Blumenthal .
Reporting in Salon , Blumenthal writes that according to his sources , two former CIA officers , " Bush dismissed as worthless this information from the Iraqi foreign minister , a member of Saddam 's inner circle , although it turned out to be accurate in every detail .
Tenet never brought it up again . "
Blumenthal also adds that the intelligence from that day was left out of the National Intelligence Estimate of October 2002 , which definitively stated that Iraq had WMD .
" The president had no interest in the intelligence , " a CIA officer disclosed .
" Bush did n't give a fuck about the intelligence .
He had his mind made up . "
" No one in Congress was aware of the secret intelligence that Saddam had no WMD as the House of Representatives and the Senate voted , a week after the submission of the NIE , on the Authorization for Use of Military Force in Iraq , " Blumenthal writes .
" The information , moreover , was not circulated within the CIA among those agents involved in operations to prove whether Saddam had WMD . "
Blumenthal 's sources confirm a 2006 interview with the CIA 's chief of clandestine operations for Europe , Tyler Drumheller , who told CBS 's 60 Minutes that his agency had received intelligence from Saddam Hussein 's foreign minister , Naji Sabri , indicating Iraq possessed no WMD .
" [ The two former CIA officers ] have confirmed Drumheller 's account to me and provided the background to the story of how the information that might have stopped the invasion of Iraq was twisted in order to justify it , " Blumenthal reports .
" They described what Tenet said to Bush about the lack of WMD , and how Bush responded , and noted that Tenet never shared Sabri 's intelligence with then Secretary of State Colin Powell . "
Powell would later present US evidence justifying the preemptive invasion of Iraq to the United Nations -- without knowledge of the Sabri information .
The former officials instead say that the information was " distorted in a report written to fit the preconception that Saddam did have WMD programs . "
That information was in turn passed to British intelligence , who used it in briefing Prime Minister Tony Blair as to validation for going to war .
" Tenet told me he briefed the president personally , " one of the former CIA officers informed Blumenthal , referring to the Oval Office briefing session on Sept. 18 , 2002 .
Bush , reportedly , thought the information was ' the same old thing , ' insisting it was only what Hussein wished him to think .
Prior to Bush 's briefing , CIA deputy director John McLaughlin , although reportedly excited about Sabri 's report , was concerned that the information conflicted with a source code - named " Curveball , " who was to be revealed later as a former Iraqi taxi driver pretending to be a chemical engineer .
Continuing to believe that the Iraqi foreign minister 's information was significant , the officers were told by a Tenet deputy that " You have n't figured this out yet .
This is n't about intelligence .
It 's about regime change . "
" In the congressional debate over the Authorization for the Use of Military Force , " Blumenthal writes that " even those voting against it gave credence to the notion that Saddam possessed WMD ... Not a single senator contested otherwise ... none of them had an inkling of the Sabri intelligence . "
As war approached , the officers on Sabri 's case attempted to set up a defection for the foreign minister in order to help show that he stood behind his information .
" He dithered , " said one officer , and the war began before anything could come of the plan .
" The real tragedy is that they had a good source that they misused , " said one of the former CIA officers .
" The fact is there was nothing there , no threat .
But Bush wanted to hear what he wanted to hear . "

As the importance of recycling becomes more apparent , questions about it linger .
Is it worth the effort ?
How does it work ?
Is recycling waste just going into a landfill in China ?
Here are some answers
IT IS an awful lot of rubbish .
Since 1960 the amount of municipal waste being collected in America has nearly tripled , reaching 245 m tonnes in 2005 .
According to European Union statistics , the amount of municipal waste produced in western Europe increased by 23 % between 1995 and 2003 , to reach 577 kg per person .
( So much for the plan to reduce waste per person to 300 kg by 2000 . )
As the volume of waste has increased , so have recycling efforts .
In 1980 America recycled only 9.6 % of its municipal rubbish ; today the rate stands at 32 % .
A similar trend can be seen in Europe , where some countries , such as Austria and the Netherlands , now recycle 60 % or more of their municipal waste .
Britain 's recycling rate , at 27 % , is low , but it is improving fast , having nearly doubled in the past three years .
Even so , when a city introduces a kerbside recycling programme , the sight of all those recycling lorries trundling around can raise doubts about whether the collection and transportation of waste materials requires more energy than it saves .
“ We are constantly being asked : Is recycling worth doing on environmental grounds ? ” says Julian Parfitt , principal analyst at Waste & Resources Action Programme ( WRAP ) , a non-profit British company that encourages recycling and develops markets for recycled materials .
Studies that look at the entire life cycle of a particular material can shed light on this question in a particular case , but WRAP decided to take a broader look .
It asked the Technical University of Denmark and the Danish Topic Centre on Waste to conduct a review of 55 life - cycle analyses , all of which were selected because of their rigorous methodology .
The researchers then looked at more than 200 scenarios , comparing the impact of recycling with that of burying or burning particular types of waste material .
They found that in 83 % of all scenarios that included recycling , it was indeed better for the environment .
Based on this study , WRAP calculated that Britain 's recycling efforts reduce its carbon - dioxide emissions by 10 m - 15 m tonnes per year .
That is equivalent to a 10 % reduction in Britain 's annual carbon - dioxide emissions from transport , or roughly equivalent to taking 3.5 m cars off the roads .
Similarly , America 's Environmental Protection Agency estimates that recycling reduced the country 's carbon emissions by 49 m tonnes in 2005 .
Recycling has many other benefits , too .
It conserves natural resources .
It also reduces the amount of waste that is buried or burnt , hardly ideal ways to get rid of the stuff .
( Landfills take up valuable space and emit methane , a potent greenhouse gas ; and although incinerators are not as polluting as they once were , they still produce noxious emissions , so people dislike having them around . )
But perhaps the most valuable benefit of recycling is the saving in energy and the reduction in greenhouse gases and pollution that result when scrap materials are substituted for virgin feedstock .
“ If you can use recycled materials , you do n't have to mine ores , cut trees and drill for oil as much , ” says Jeffrey Morris of Sound Resource Management , a consulting firm based in Olympia , Washington .
Extracting metals from ore , in particular , is extremely energy - intensive .
Recycling aluminium , for example , can reduce energy consumption by as much as 95 % .
Savings for other materials are lower but still substantial : about 70 % for plastics , 60 % for steel , 40 % for paper and 30 % for glass .
Recycling also reduces emissions of pollutants that can cause smog , acid rain and the contamination of waterways .
A brief history of recycling
The virtue of recycling has been appreciated for centuries .
For thousands of years metal items have been recycled by melting and reforming them into new weapons or tools .
It is said that the broken pieces of the Colossus of Rhodes , a statue deemed one of the seven wonders of the ancient world , were recycled for scrap .
During the industrial revolution , recyclers began to form businesses and later trade associations , dealing in the collection , trade and processing of metals and paper .
America 's Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries ( ISRI ) , a trade association with more than 1,400 member companies , traces its roots back to one such organisation founded in 1913 .
In the 1930s many people survived the Great Depression by peddling scraps of metal , rags and other items .
In those days reuse and recycling were often economic necessities .
Recycling also played an important role during the second world war , when scrap metal was turned into weapons .
As industrial societies began to produce ever - growing quantities of garbage , recycling took on a new meaning .
Rather than recycling materials for purely economic reasons , communities began to think about how to reduce the waste flow to landfills and incinerators .
Around 1970 the environmental movement sparked the creation of America 's first kerbside collection schemes , though it was another 20 years before such programmes really took off .
In 1991 Germany made history when it passed an ordinance shifting responsibility for the entire life cycle of packaging to producers .
In response , the industry created Duales System Deutschland ( DSD ) , a company that organises a separate waste - management system that exists alongside public rubbish - collection .
By charging a licensing fee for its “ green dot ” trademark , DSD pays for the collection , sorting and recycling of packaging materials .
Although the system turned out to be expensive , it has been highly influential .
Many European countries later adopted their own recycling initiatives incorporating some degree of producer responsibility .
In 1987 a rubbish - laden barge cruised up and down America 's East Coast looking for a place to unload , sparking a public discussion about waste management and serving as a catalyst for the country 's growing recycling movement .
By the early 1990s so many American cities had established recycling programmes that the resulting glut of materials caused the market price for kerbside recyclables to fall from around $ 50 per ton to about $ 30 , says Dr Morris , who has been tracking prices for recyclables in the Pacific Northwest since the mid-1980s .
As with all commodities , costs for recyclables fluctuate .
But the average price for kerbside materials has since slowly increased to about $ 90 per ton .
Even so , most kerbside recycling programmes are not financially self - sustaining .
The cost of collecting , transporting and sorting materials generally exceeds the revenues generated by selling the recyclables , and is also greater than the disposal costs .
Exceptions do exist , says Dr Morris , largely near ports in dense urban areas that charge high fees for landfill disposal and enjoy good market conditions for the sale of recyclables .
Sorting things out
Originally kerbside programmes asked people to put paper , glass and cans into separate bins .
But now the trend is toward co-mingled or “ single stream ” collection .
About 700 of America 's 10,000 kerbside programmes now use this approach , says Kate Krebs , executive director of America 's National Recycling Coalition .
But the switch can make people suspicious : if there is no longer any need to separate different materials , people may conclude that the waste is simply being buried or burned .
In fact , the switch towards single - stream collection is being driven by new technologies that can identify and sort the various materials with little or no human intervention .
Single - stream collection makes it more convenient for householders to recycle , and means that more materials are diverted from the waste stream .
San Francisco , which changed from multi to single - stream collection a few years ago , now boasts a recycling rate of 69 % — one of the highest in America .
With the exception of garden and food waste , all the city 's kerbside recyclables are sorted in a 200,000 - square - foot facility that combines machines with the manpower of 155 employees .
The $ 38 m plant , next to the San Francisco Bay , opened in 2003 .
Operated by Norcal Waste Systems , it processes an average of 750 tons of paper , plastic , glass and metals a day .
The process begins when a truck arrives and dumps its load of recyclables at one end of the building .
The materials are then piled on to large conveyer belts that transport them to a manual sorting station .
There , workers sift through everything , taking out plastic bags , large pieces of cardboard and other items that could damage or obstruct the sorting machines .
Plastic bags are especially troublesome as they tend to get caught in the spinning - disk screens that send weightier materials , such as bottles and cans , down in one direction and the paper up in another .
Corrugated cardboard is separated from mixed paper , both of which are then baled and sold .
Plastic bottles and cartons are plucked out by hand .
The most common types , PET ( type 1 ) and HDPE ( type 2 ) , are collected separately ; the rest go into a mixed - plastics bin .
Next , a magnet pulls out any ferrous metals , typically tin-plated or steel cans , while the non-ferrous metals , mostly aluminium cans , are ejected by eddy current .
Eddy - current separators , in use since the early 1990s , consist of a rapidly revolving magnetic rotor inside a long , cylindrical drum that rotates at a slower speed .
As the aluminium cans are carried over this drum by a conveyer belt , the magnetic field from the rotor induces circulating electric currents , called eddy currents , within them .
This creates a secondary magnetic field around the cans that is repelled by the magnetic field of the rotor , literally ejecting the aluminium cans from the other waste materials .
Finally , the glass is separated by hand into clear , brown , amber and green glass .
For each load , the entire sorting process from start to finish takes about an hour , says Bob Besso , Norcal 's recycling - programme manager for San Francisco .
Although all recycling facilities still employ people , investment is increasing in optical sorting technologies that can separate different types of paper and plastic .
Development of the first near - infra - red - based waste - sorting systems began in the early 1990s .
At the time Elopak , a Norwegian producer of drink cartons made of plastic - laminated cardboard , worried that it would have to pay a considerable fee to meet its producer responsibilities in Germany and other European countries .
To reduce the overall life - cycle costs associated with its products , Elopak set out to find a way to automate the sorting of its cartons .
The company teamed up with SINTEF , a Norwegian research centre , and in 1996 sold its first unit in Germany .
The technology was later spun off into a company now called TiTech .
TiTech 's systems — more than 1,000 of which are now installed worldwide — rely on spectroscopy to identify different materials .
Paper and plastic items are spread out on a conveyor belt in a single layer .
When illuminated by a halogen lamp , each type of material reflects a unique combination of wavelengths in the infra-red spectrum that can be identified , much like a fingerprint .
By analysing data from a sensor that detects light in both the visible and the near - infra - red spectrum , a computer is able to determine the colour , type , shape and position of each item .
Air jets are then activated to push particular items from one conveyor belt to another , or into a bin .
Numerous types of paper , plastic or combinations thereof can thus be sorted with up to 98 % accuracy .
For many materials the process of turning them back into useful raw materials is straightforward : metals are shredded into pieces , paper is reduced to pulp and glass is crushed into cullet .
Metals and glass can be remelted almost indefinitely without any loss in quality , while paper can be recycled up to six times .
( As it goes through the process , its fibres get shorter and the quality deteriorates . )
Plastics , which are made from fossil fuels , are somewhat different .
Although they have many useful properties — they are flexible , lightweight and can be shaped into any form — there are many different types , most of which need to be processed separately .
In 2005 less than 6 % of the plastic from America 's municipal waste stream was recovered .
And of that small fraction , the only two types recycled in significant quantities were PET and HDPE .
For PET , food - grade bottle - to - bottle recycling exists .
But plastic is often “ down - cycled ” into other products such as plastic lumber ( used in place of wood ) , drain pipes and carpet fibres , which tend to end up in landfills or incinerators at the end of their useful lives .
Even so , plastics are being used more and more , not just for packaging , but also in consumer goods such as cars , televisions and personal computers .
Because such products are made of a variety of materials and can contain multiple types of plastic , metals ( some of them toxic ) , and glass , they are especially difficult and expensive to dismantle and recycle .
Europe and Japan have initiated “ take back ” laws that require electronics manufacturers to recycle their products .
But in America only a handful of states have passed such legislation .
That has caused problems for companies that specialise in recycling plastics from complex waste streams and depend on take - back laws for getting the necessary feedstock .
Michael Biddle , the boss of MBA Polymers , says the lack of such laws is one of the reasons why his company operates only a pilot plant in America and has its main facilities in China and Austria .
Much recyclable material can be processed locally , but ever more is being shipped to developing nations , especially China .
The country has a large appetite for raw materials and that includes scrap metals , waste paper and plastics , all of which can be cheaper than virgin materials .
In most cases , these waste materials are recycled into consumer goods or packaging and returned to Europe and America via container ships .
With its hunger for resources and the availability of cheap labour , China has become the largest importer of recyclable materials in the world .
The China question
But the practice of shipping recyclables to China is controversial .
Especially in Britain , politicians have voiced the concern that some of those exports may end up in landfills .
Many experts disagree .
According to Pieter van Beukering , an economist who has studied the trade of waste paper to India and waste plastics to China : “ as soon as somebody is paying for the material , you bet it will be recycled . ”
In fact , Dr van Beukering argues that by importing waste materials , recycling firms in developing countries are able to build larger factories and achieve economies of scale , recycling materials more efficiently and at lower environmental cost .
He has witnessed as much in India , he says , where dozens of inefficient , polluting paper mills near Mumbai were transformed into a smaller number of far more productive and environmentally friendly factories within a few years .
Still , compared with Western countries , factories in developing nations may be less tightly regulated , and the recycling industry is no exception .
China especially has been plagued by countless illegal - waste imports , many of which are processed by poor migrants in China 's coastal regions .
They dismantle and recycle anything from plastic to electronic waste without any protection for themselves or the environment .
The Chinese government has banned such practices , but migrant workers have spawned a mobile cottage industry that is difficult to wipe out , says Aya Yoshida , a researcher at Japan 's National Institute for Environmental Studies who has studied Chinese waste imports and recycling practices .
Because this type of industry operates largely under the radar , it is difficult to assess its overall impact .
But it is clear that processing plastic and electronic waste in a crude manner releases toxic chemicals , harming people and the environment — the opposite of what recycling is supposed to achieve .
Under pressure from environmental groups , such as the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition , some computer - makers have established rules to ensure that their products are recycled in a responsible way .
Hewlett - Packard has been a leader in this and even operates its own recycling factories in California and Tennessee .
Dell , which was once criticised for using prison labour to recycle its machines , now takes back its old computers for no charge .
And last month Steve Jobs detailed Apple 's plans to eliminate the use of toxic substances in its products .
Far less controversial is the recycling of glass — except , that is , in places where there is no market for it .
Britain , for example , is struggling with a mountain of green glass .
It is the largest importer of wine in the world , bringing in more than 1 billion litres every year , much of it in green glass bottles .
But with only a tiny wine industry of its own , there is little demand for the resulting glass .
Instead what is needed is clear glass , which is turned into bottles for spirits , and often exported to other countries .
As a result , says Andy Dawe , WRAP 's glass - technology manager , Britain is in the “ peculiar situation ” of having more green glass than it has production capacity for .
Britain's bottle - makers already use as much recycled green glass as they can in their furnaces to produce new bottles .
So some of the surplus glass is down - cycled into construction aggregates or sand for filtration systems .
But WRAP 's own analysis reveals that the energy savings for both appear to be “ marginal or even disadvantageous ” .
Working with industry , WRAP has started a new programme called GlassRite Wine , in an effort to right the imbalance .
Instead of being bottled at source , some wine is now imported in 24,000 - litre containers and then bottled in Britain .
This may dismay some wine connoisseurs , but it solves two problems , says Mr Dawe : it reduces the amount of green glass that is imported and puts what is imported to good use .
It can also cut shipping costs by up to 40 % .
The future of recycling
This is an unusual case , however .
More generally , one of the biggest barriers to more efficient recycling is that most products were not designed with recycling in mind .
Remedying this problem may require a complete rethinking of industrial processes , says William McDonough , an architect and the co-author of a book published in 2002 called “ Cradle to Cradle : Remaking the Way We Make Things ” .
Along with Michael Braungart , his fellow author and a chemist , he lays out a vision for establishing “ closed - loop ” cycles where there is no waste .
Recycling should be taken into account at the design stage , they argue , and all materials should either be able to return to the soil safely or be recycled indefinitely .
This may sound like wishful thinking , but Mr McDonough has a good pedigree .
Over the years he has worked with companies including Ford and Google .
An outgrowth of “ Cradle to Cradle ” is the Sustainable Packaging Coalition , a non-profit working group that has developed guidelines that look beyond the traditional benchmarks of packaging design to emphasise the use of renewable , recycled and non -toxic source materials , among other things .
Founded in 2003 with just nine members , the group now boasts nearly 100 members , including Target , Starbucks and Estée Lauder , some of which have already begun to change the design of their packaging .
Sustainable packaging not only benefits the environment but can also cut costs .
Last year Wal - Mart , the world 's biggest retailer , announced that it wanted to reduce the amount of packaging it uses by 5 % by 2013 , which could save the company as much as $ 3.4 billion and reduce carbon - dioxide emissions by 667,000 tonnes .
As well as trying to reduce the amount of packaging , Wal - Mart also wants to recycle more of it .
Two years ago the company began to use an unusual process , called the “ sandwich bale ” , to collect waste material at its stores and distribution centres for recycling .
It involves putting a layer of cardboard at the bottom of a rubbish compactor before filling it with waste material , and then putting another layer of cardboard on top .
The compactor then produces a “ sandwich ” which is easier to handle and transport , says Jeff Ashby of Rocky Mountain Recycling , who invented the process for Wal - Mart .
As well as avoiding disposal costs for materials it previously sent to landfill , the company now makes money by selling waste at market prices .
EPA
It does get recycled , honest
Evidently there is plenty of scope for further innovation in recycling .
New ideas and approaches will be needed , since many communities and organisations have set high targets for recycling .
Europe 's packaging directive requires member states to recycle 60 % of their glass and paper , 50 % of metals and 22.5 % of plastic packaging by the end of 2008 .
Earlier this year the European Parliament voted to increase recycling rates by 2020 to 50 % of municipal waste and 70 % of industrial waste .
Recycling rates can be boosted by charging households and businesses more if they produce more rubbish , and by reducing the frequency of rubbish collections while increasing that of recycling collections .
Meanwhile a number of cities and firms ( including Wal - Mart , Toyota and Nike ) have adopted zero - waste targets .
This may be unrealistic but Matt Hale , director of the office of solid waste at America 's Environmental Protection Agency , says it is a worthy goal and can help companies think about better ways to manage materials .
It forces people to look at the entire life - cycle of a product , says Dr Hale , and ask questions :
Can you reduce the amount of material to begin with ?
Can you design the product to make recycling easier ?
If done right , there is no doubt that recycling saves energy and raw materials , and reduces pollution .
But as well as trying to recycle more , it is also important to try to recycle better .
As technologies and materials evolve , there is room for improvement and cause for optimism .
In the end , says Ms Krebs , “ waste is really a design flaw . ”

Leapfrog has lost its hyphen
Having been around since at least the birth of printing , the hyphen is apparently enjoying a difficult time at the moment .
The sixth edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary has knocked the hyphens out of 16,000 words , many of them two - word compound nouns .
Fig - leaf is now fig leaf , pot -belly is now pot belly , pigeon - hole has finally achieved one word status as pigeonhole and leap - frog is feeling whole again as leapfrog .
BECOMING TWO WORDS Fig leaf Hobby horse Ice cream Pin money Pot belly Test tube
Green issues in dictionary
The blame , as is so often the case , has been put at least in part on electronic communication .
In our time - poor lifestyles , dominated by the dashed - off [ or should that be dashed off or dashedoff ] e-mail , we no longer have time to reach over to the hyphen key .
And English , being a language lacking any kind of governing body and instead relying on studies of usage , is changing to keep up .
Shorter OED editor Angus Stevenson does n't want anybody to get angry over the hyphen 's decline .
" We only reflect what people in general are reading .
We have been tracking this for some time and we 've been finding the hyphen is used less and less , " he says .
BECOMING ONE WORD Bumblebee Chickpea Crybaby Leapfrog Logjam
" It will probably upset a few people but the point I would make is that we are only reflecting widespread everyday use .
We are not saying it should be dropped completely . "
Geoffrey Leech , emeritus professor of linguistics and English language at Lancaster University , agrees that there has been some decline in its use .
Data drawn from a wide range of publications taken in 1961 and 1991 suggested a 5 % decline in hyphen usage over the three decades .
He thinks e-mails may be part of the answer .
" When you are sending e-mails , and you have to type pretty fast , on the whole it 's easier to type without hyphens .
Ordinary people are not very conscious of the fact of whether they are putting hyphens or not . "
The hyphen still has its uses
" I tell my writing classes the hyphen is there to help the reader and to show either that two words are linked in some significant way or to add understanding in words like go - between and de-icing , " she says .
" Language is always changing .
It has to move with the times .
There have to be conventions .
There has to be a negotiated common ground but within that there 's room for variation and a degree of creativity . "
One battleground is the word e-mail itself .
The likes of the BBC and the New York Times are fighting a valiant defence of the hyphen .
But to much of the rest of the world , it 's email .
With the hyphen , Mr Stevenson notes : " It 's starting to look a lot like something your grandmother might write . "
A selection of your comments appears below .

The use of a hyphen to yoke two nouns has declined because , quite simply , it usually is n't necessary .
One knows through common sense that a walking stick , which used to be walking - stick , is a stick for walking ( a verbal noun + a noun ) rather than a stick that walks ( a participial adj . + a noun ) .
Indeed , it is a mistake to make a fuss about punctuation unless clarity or actual meaning is at stake .
As the house - style guide of Oxford University Press used to say , " If you take hyphens seriously , you will surely go mad . "
Hugh Payne , York , England
The rot set in when people stopped writing to - day and to - morrow .

Not true .
The hyphen has been re-invented as a substitute for punctuation - the colon , semi-colon and even brackets have all but disappeared .
When reading off a screen , it is difficult to see these punctuation marks .
It is much more userfriendly to insert a hyphen - or as purists might say , a dash - to highlight the break - up of a sentence into clauses .
If one has a spellchecker in constant back - ground use , it will not recognise these portmanteau words , and will underline them as you go .

The whole point of writing is to convey meaning to others .
Writing that conveys the author 's meaning clearly , quickly and accurately is more effective than writing that does not .
English spelling and grammar are not rigid - they are simply guidelines for mutual understanding .
New compound phrases are always being created , first as separate words .
As the phrases becomes more widely - used , authors start to hyphenate them .
Then , when they have become common - place , the hyphens are dropped .
Perhaps nowadays authors often miss out the second step in this evolutionary process of word creation .

Excepting ' logjam ' , all your ' now one word ' examples have already been so for years in my dictionary .
( It 's a Collins and I 'm chief sub ed. at a leading magazine publisher . )
It 's nice that the OED is catching up with usage ( was anyone really writing ' chick - pea ' ? ) but note that in compounds , two - worders will still need a hyphen : pot -bellied pig , ice - cream cone , test - tube baby .
And let 's not forget London Transport 's lamentably unhyphenated promise to provide ' More late night buses ' !
Stu Maddison , Ealing , London , GB
The OED does only reflect the usage of the language .
If we are n't using hyphens then I guess the dictionary should reflect that .
How far does this go though ?
The shop at our local university is currently advertising a sale on its ' stationary ' !
Surely if that 's how the word is being used , the dictionary should say so !
Perhaps the OED should install themselves as bastions of good English , rather than changing the language because its users do n't know any better .

What about the use of hyphens in compound adjectives .

It seems even the BBC is failing to keep the hyphen in all cases and I quote , " The BBC may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .
Your comments may be published on any BBC media worldwide . "
Mik , Tokyo , Japan
Fair enough about the hyphen , but many people I know use ' should of ' etc instead of ' should 've ' .
Will this be deemed correct one day if enough people say it ?

Hamas has taken control of almost all the Gaza Strip
Fighters seized Fatah's Preventative Security building in Gaza City and the intelligence service headquarters , and overran the town of Rafah .
A least 20 Palestinians died as the latest battles raged throughout Gaza .
An aide to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said Mr Abbas plans to dismiss the government and call elections .
Nabil Abu Rudeineh said the Hamas offensive was " illegal " and a coup against the Palestinian Authority .
" This is part of the job of the president , he has full power according to the law to dismiss the government , " he told the BBC .
Gaza has been the focal point for a violent and bitter power struggle between Hamas and Fatah since Hamas won a surprise election victory in early 2006 .
What happened today in the Preventive Security headquarters was the second liberation of the Gaza Strip
Sami Abu Zuhri
Hamas spokesman
Gaza helpers speak out
Hamas , an Islamic organisation , rose to prominence in Gaza during two Palestinian uprisings , and refuses to recognise or negotiate with Israel .
Fatah , a secular political grouping headed by Mr Abbas , ran the Palestinian Authority until 2006 and officially recognises the Jewish state .
The two groups are nominally working together in a three - month - old government of national unity .
' Executions '
In Thursday 's fighting , Hamas targeted four key security and intelligence compounds in and around Gaza City .
There were scenes of looting and celebration from Hamas militants as they seized control of the Preventative Security and Gaza 's intelligence headquarters .
Several reports accused Hamas of shooting dead defeated Fatah fighters in front of the building .
" They are executing them one by one , " one witness told the Associated Press news agency .
A Hamas TV station showed pictures of militants tramping triumphantly through the ransacked HQ , reviled by Hamas as a symbol of Fatah 's violent offensives against the Islamic group during the 1990s .
Earlier , there were reports that the two sides were negotiating a truce , after Hamas issues a series of demands to Fatah .
The conditions included the appointment of an interior minister responsible for all Palestinian security forces , and shared control of Gaza 's boundaries and borders .
No agreement was reached , though , and more violence ensued .
A Hamas spokesman , Sami Abu Zuhri , said the capture of the security compound was " the second liberation of the Gaza Strip " , describing the first as the Israeli withdrawal of troops and settlers in 2005 .
" We are telling our people that the past era has ended and will not return , " another spokesman told AP .
" The era of justice and Islamic rule have arrived . "
World concern
Thursday 's fighting came despite calls from around the world for an end to the fighting .
The international community has called for a ceasefire , and Arab League head Amr Moussa said the fighting was destroying the Palestinian cause .
The EU and US have voiced international concern .
with the EU suspending aid operations in Gaza in response to " suicidal " violence .
Meanwhile , there were also reports that at least four young Palestinians were killed by an explosion in Rafah .
However , Israel denied its forces had fired in the area .
Are you in Gaza ?
Have you been caught up in the violence ?

Researchers at New Jersey Institute of Technology ( NJIT ) have developed an inexpensive solar cell that can be painted or printed on flexible plastic sheets .
" The process is simple , " said lead researcher and author Somenath Mitra , PhD , professor and acting chair of NJIT 's Department of Chemistry and Environmental Sciences .
" Someday homeowners will even be able to print sheets of these solar cells with inexpensive home - based inkjet printers .
Consumers can then slap the finished product on a wall , roof or billboard to create their own power stations . "
Harvesting energy directly from abundant solar radiation using solar cells is increasingly emerging as a major component of future global energy strategy , said Mitra .
Yet , when it comes to harnessing renewable energy , challenges remain .
Expensive , large - scale infrastructures such as wind mills or dams are necessary to drive renewable energy sources , such as wind or hydroelectric power plants .
Purified silicon , also used for making computer chips , is a core material for fabricating conventional solar cells .
However , the processing of a material such as purified silicon is beyond the reach of most consumers .
" Developing organic solar cells from polymers , however , is a cheap and potentially simpler alternative , " said Mitra .
" We foresee a great deal of interest in our work because solar cells can be inexpensively printed or simply painted on exterior building walls and / or roof tops .
Imagine some day driving in your hybrid car with a solar panel painted on the roof , which is producing electricity to drive the engine .
The opportunities are endless . "
The science goes something like this .
When sunlight falls on an organic solar cell , the energy generates positive and negative charges .
If the charges can be separated and sent to different electrodes , then a current flows .
If not , the energy is wasted .
Link cells electronically and the cells form what is called a panel , like the ones currently seen on most rooftops .
The size of both the cell and panels vary .
Cells can range from 1 millimeter to several feet ; panels have no size limits .
The solar cell developed at NJIT uses a carbon nanotubes complex , which by the way , is a molecular configuration of carbon in a cylindrical shape .
The name is derived from the tube 's miniscule size .
Scientists estimate nanotubes to be 50,000 times smaller than a human hair .
Nevertheless , just one nanotube can conduct current better than any conventional electrical wire .
" Actually , nanotubes are significantly better conductors than copper , " Mitra added .
Mitra and his research team took the carbon nanotubes and combined them with tiny carbon Buckyballs ( known as fullerenes ) to form snake - like structures .
Buckyballs trap electrons , although they can't make electrons flow .
Add sunlight to excite the polymers , and the buckyballs will grab the electrons .
Nanotubes , behaving like copper wires , will then be able to make the electrons or current flow .
" Using this unique combination in an organic solar cell recipe can enhance the efficiency of future painted - on solar cells , " said Mitra .
" Someday , I hope to see this process become an inexpensive energy alternative for households around the world . "
" Fullerene single wall carbon nanotube complex for polymer bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells , " published June 21 , 2007 in the Journal of Materials Chemistry by the Royal Society of Chemistry , details the process .
Tisdall , Gruadnia :
An elite team of officers advising the US commander , General David Petraeus , in Baghdad has concluded that they have six months to win the war in Iraq – or face a Vietnam - style collapse in political and public support that could force the military into a hasty retreat …
The main obstacles confronting Gen Petraeus ’s team are :
Insufficient troops on the ground
A “ disintegrating ” international coalition
An anticipated increase in violence in the south as the British leave
Morale problems as casualties rise
A failure of political will in Washington and / or Baghdad .
The team is an unusual mix of combat experience and academic achievement .
It includes Colonel Peter Mansoor , a former armoured division commander with a PhD in the history of infantry ; Colonel HR McMaster , author of a well - known critique of Vietnam and a seasoned counter - insurgency operations chief ; Lt - Col David Kilcullen , a seconded Australian officer and expert on Islamism ; and Colonel Michael Meese , son of the former US attorney - general Edwin Meese , who was a member of the ill - fated Iraq Study Group …
“ Additional troops are essential if we are to win , ” said Lt - Col John Nagel , co-author of the [ counterinsurgency ] manual , in an address at the US Naval Institute in San Diego last month .
One soldier for every 50 civilians in the most intense conflict areas [ corresponding to about 300,000 - 500,000 combat troops ] was key to successful counter - insurgency work .
Not to worry .
No matter that Iraq has gone on longer than WW II without a single discernible victory , no matter that the rest of the world long ago walked away from the mess , the Publicans will blame us , same as for everything else .

Claim : Urban legends TV show falls for joke about Blackbeard ’s using a nursery rhyme to recruit fellow pirates .
Status : True .
Origins :
The last few years have seen several television programs dedicated to the examination and “ debunking ” of urban legends and similar types of stories .
One entry in this genre was a show entitled Mostly True Stories : Urban Legends Revealed , which aired on cable station
The Learning Channel ( TLC ) in the U.S .
One of the features of this program was its use of quizzes as bridges across commercial breaks — just before each commercial break it presented the audience with an urban legend - related tidbit and challenged viewers to guess whether it was true or not ; after the commercial break the ( supposedly ) correct answer was revealed .
We noted with some amusement that most of these quizzes dealt with fairly obscure items covered on our web site ; we were even more amused when the 18 March 2003 episode posed the question of whether the nursery rhyme “ Sing a Song of Sixpence ” was used as a coded message for recruiting pirates .
Of course , that was nothing compared to the hilarity which ensued in our house when “ Mostly True Stories ” revealed this item to be TRUE : “ The notorious pirate Blackbeard used this code to recruit hands , whom he paid sixpence a day , ” they disclosed .
What ’s so funny ?
The notion that the nursery rhyme “ Sing a Song of Sixpence ” was used as a recuiting song for pirates was invented by us as an example of a story so incredibly silly that no one could possibly believe it to be true .
We created the
Lost Legends section of our web site as a humorous repository for completely absurd “ true ” stories based on premises too ridiculous to be believable as our way of demonstrating the potential pitfalls of taking any one source ’s unvarnished word for anything , and for one of the entries in this section we came up with a wild tale about the nursery rhyme “ Sing a Song of Sixpence ” having originated as a coded message used to recruit crew members for pirate ships , complete with a line - by - line explication of how it was sung in taverns by confederates of the notorious pirate Blackbeard to assemble crews for his prize - hunting expeditions .
The whole idea was supposed to be far too outrageous to be taken seriously ( picture in your mind ’s eye grim - faced pirates intent upon supplementing their crews roaming from pub to pub , belting out a children ’s rhyme ) , and in case any readers somehow missed the obvious humor , the page ( like all entries in the Lost Legends section ) included a link to supplemental page explaining that it was all just a gag perpetrated for the purpose of teaching folks not to ignore their common sense even in the face of a presumed authority .
That a television program devoted to testing the veracity of urban legends could take this bit of nonsense at face value is an irony we never contemplated .
We have to agree with the conclusion of the Courier Mail journalist who noted ( albeit for the wrong reason ) that :
In the modern world , people are confronted with a barrage of information .
Trying to come to grips with such a sensory assault can be a problem .
Information is one thing , but processing info until it is useful can be quite another .
Hence the common distinction between information and trivia .
Trivia can be interesting but is generally not particularly useful .
Knowing that the rhyme ‘ Sing a Song of Sixpence ’ was originally used to recruit pirates for Blackbeard ’s ship is not often going to help anyone perform their job better , write a better assignment or make a breakthrough contribution to society .
Subsequent airings of the TLC episode featured a revised version of this “ fact ” :

Women with advanced breast cancer live longer by taking the drug Herceptin even after a relapse , a study reveals .
Those who continue with treatment when the disease has progressed are three times more likely to be alive two years later compared to those who do not .
Overall , three out of four women on continuous Herceptin treatment were still alive after two years , compared to just 24 per cent who came off the drug at an earlier stage .
British experts say the study could have important implications for women starting treatment for breast cancer , as well as for those in whom it has spread .
After a series of high - profile battles by women trying to win NHS funding for Herceptin , which costs around £ 20,000 for a year 's supply , the Government 's ' rationing ' body NICE extended its use in certain patients from late - stage to early stage cancer last year .
Around a quarter of the 44,000 British women diagnosed with breast cancer each year have the HER2 positive form , which is more aggressive .
The study of those with this aggressive form of cancer released yesterday at the European Cancer Congress in Barcelona is further evidence of Herceptin 's remarkable effects .
Specialists believe the drug is the most important development in breast cancer treatment for 25 years .
The data comes from the Hermine trial , an observational study involving 340 women with advanced HER2 - positive breast cancer .
The average survival rate for those who continued to take the drug after the disease progressed was 27.8 months , compared to 16.8 months for patients who gave it up .
Dr Murray Brunt , clinical oncologist at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire NHS Trust , said : " This data is very welcome and provides evidence supporting the continuation of Herceptin therapy beyond disease progression for women with this particularly aggressive form of breast cancer .
" It appears that maintaining Herceptin therapy alongside chemotherapy to provide continuous suppression of HER2 may enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy , and help keep the cancer under control for longer . "
Consultant breast surgeon Hugh Bishop , president of the Association of Breast Surgery , said it was vital for all women to be tested for HER2 status when cancer was diagnosed .
" At present , Herceptin is reserved by Government decree for those who have a poorer prognosis of breast cancer , for example where there is local spread to the armpit , along with chemotherapy .
" That message has been accepted by NICE , but what about women who have a better prognosis and do n't need chemotherapy ?
" Would these women not benefit from Herceptin ?
" We need trials , but in the mean time this new data raises the issue of how long should women should be taking it for and the costs involved .
" It seems women could keep taking Herceptin , if they do n't experience any heart side effects , throughout progression because it stops the disease accelerating .
We 've never had drugs like this before . "
Herceptin works by binding to the part of the tumour essential for growth , preventing cell division .
This causes the tumour to stop growing or even shrink .
The FMEL :
In the crew frame , the floor mirror keeps the photon from falling out the back of the rocket as it bounces between the two parallel mirrors .
In the Earth frame , the photon appears to be pushed along with the rocket , following a curve which appears to make the clock slower .
Credit : Joseph West .
Joseph West , a physicist at Indiana State University , has recently proposed a method for intuitively visualizing and calculating the time dilation effects in special relativity — one of the stranger concepts in modern physics .
In a recent issue of the European Journal of Physics , West has introduced a modified type of light clock based on the classic “ Einstein - Langevin light clock ” ( ELC ) gedanken experiment .
West ’s version , which he calls a “ floor - mirrored Einstein - Langevin light clock ” ( FMEL ) , enables the light clock to work under acceleration by introducing a secondary mirror .
“ The classic ELC is so intuitive , and pretty much every instructor uses it to introduce time dilation to students , ” West told PhysOrg.com .
“ I wanted to be able to visualize a light clock that had the same macroscopic feel to it .
I feel that the FMEL has a significant advantage over the classic ELC in that it can be used by accelerating observers .
I looked at the case of constant acceleration in the paper , but it could be used in the case of changing acceleration as well , as long as the direction of the acceleration stays the same . ”
In special relativity , light clocks are used to explain such ideas as high - speed trains and the twin paradox .
In the latter , one twin travels in a rocket at speeds close to c , while the second twin stays at home .
When the first twin returns , she has aged less compared with her twin brother due to the fact of relativity theory that time slows down as a rocket travels at near - light speeds compared with time in an inertial reference frame .
The classic ELC — which describes a high - speed train passing an observer — consists of a photon bouncing between two mirrors , where the photon moves perpendicular to the direction of the train ’s motion .
The ELC can also be applied , with some limitations , to the twin paradox .
For the twin on the rocket , the photon ’s motion is straightforward .
For the Earth twin , however , the photon moves with the rocket diagonally away from Earth as the rocket moves away from Earth .
This path makes the photon appear to be covering a longer distance , and so taking more time to bounce , making the clocks on the rocket appear to be ticking slower .
By knowing the distance between the two mirrors and counting the number of times the photon bounces back and forth , the twins can calculate the elapsed time on the rocket — as long as the rocket travels at a constant velocity .
However , when accelerating the rocket , this light clock runs into a problem : as soon as the rocket picks up speed , the photon falls out the back end .
Realizing that angled mirrors do n’t provide a consistent time ( when the distance between mirrors differs ) ,
West decided to try keeping the photons in by adding a second mirror to the floor of the rocket .
The floor mirror “ pushes ” photons along with the accelerating crew in the two - dimensional rocket floor .
Further , no matter the distance between mirrors , the light clock gives the same results , and will stay synchronized with any other such clocks in that plane .
“ I wanted to think about an accelerating ‘ frame , ’ with mirrors that were separated enough for students to imagine them being used on a train , or a rocket ship , ” West explained .
For the accelerated rocket twin , the elapsed time measurement is again straightforward .
But for the Earth twin , the photon does not appear to follow a straight line path of least time , but instead makes a curve in order to stay within the plane of the mirrors of the FMEL .
As in the ELC , this greater distance makes the light clock appear to slow down in the Earth twin ’s observation .
“ The path of the light in the FMEL is not a least - time path between the mirrors , but it is the least - time path for motion of objects restricted to motion in that plane , ” West explained in the paper .
Nevertheless , using the FMEL and standard meter sticks , the crew will measure the value c for the speed of the photons stuck in their clock .
“ Photons that are allowed to move in a straight line , as viewed by the Earth , can get back and forth between the mirrors in less time , apparently traveling from mirror to mirror at a speed greater than c , according to the crew , ” West explained .
“ This would apparently allow superluminal communication among the crew members .
In order to do so , however , the photons do have to leave the plane of the crew and the clock .
The crew could even observe the slice of a solid object that intersects the plane of the crew appear to travel with speeds greater than c . ”
However ,
West explained that causality is not violated in such a situation .
The crew cannot establish the Lorentz transformations that would convert the different measurements of an Earth observer and the rocket itself , which are required to imply causality violations .

SANTA MONICA , California ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp. MSFT.O said on Tuesday it will hold firm on pricing for its Xbox 360 game console , defying widespread expectations that it would respond to a price cut by rival Sony Corp. 6758.T for the PlayStation 3 .

Instead , Microsoft voiced confidence that a slate of upcoming titles targeting both hardcore and casual gamers would be strong enough to give it the lion ’s share of consumer dollars in the coming months .
“ We have no desire , no need , to react to anything the competition has done , ” Shane Kim , head of Microsoft Games Studios , said in an interview .
“ We feel really great about the Xbox 360 momentum right now .
Customers are voting with their wallets , it ’s not just about console units .
We feel great about how we ’re doing . ”
On Monday , Sony cut the price of the PlayStation 3 , which competes against the Xbox 360 , by $ 100 , or 17 percent , in the United States in an effort to boost flagging sales .
That means the machine , which has a 60 - gigabyte hard drive and Blu-ray high - definition DVD player , costs $ 500 , or $ 20 more than the high - end Xbox 360 Elite that has a 120 - gigabyte hard drive but no built - in high - definition DVD player .
Microsoft also has a “ premium ” Xbox 360 with a 20 - gigabyte hard drive that sells for $ 400 , and a “ core ” version with no hard drive that costs $ 300 .
Sony ’s cut also came days after Microsoft said the number of broken Xbox 360s was “ unacceptable ” and that it would book a charge of up to $ 1.15 billion for repairs and warranty extensions .
Microsoft also said it had shipped 11.6 million consoles worldwide by the end of June , missing its target of 12 million .
In the United States , Microsoft has sold about 5.8 million consoles , compared to 2.8 million for Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974 .OS
Wii and 1.4 million for the PS3 , according to data from NPD .
Kim said the decision not to cut prices was unrelated to Microsoft ’s goal of making the Xbox business profitable in its 2008 fiscal year , which just started .
Since launching the original Xbox in late 2001 , Microsoft has spent billions of dollars fighting Sony ’s dominance in the industry yet has shown little , if any , profit .
“ It ’s really not about meeting the profitability goals .
We feel very confident that we ’ll meet the profit goals with our strategy that is already in place , ” Kim said .
Kim pointed to a line - up of games coming out later this year , including Microsoft 's highly anticipated " Halo 3 , " " Grand Theft Auto IV " from Take - Two Interactive Software Inc. TTWO.O and " Madden 08 " football from Electronic Arts Inc. ERTS.O .
“ This year , that perfect storm arrives again , ” Kim said .
“ And the Xbox 360 is the only platform you ’ll be able to play all three of those titles on . ”
Microsoft also hopes to attract more casual gamers with two new casual games for later this year .
One is a multiplayer “ party game ” based on its “ Viva Pinata ” franchise , and the other is based on the movie trivia board game “ Scene It ? ”
Nintendo ’s
Wii has outsold the Xbox 360 and PS3 this year due to a design and price aimed at drawing in casual gamers .
Kim also said the Xbox Live online service , which allows players to compete online and download movies and games , had 7 million users and would expand to 10 million in one year .
He said The Walt Disney Co. DIS.N would start making some of its movies available on the service .
“ Xbox Live continues to just be a huge boulder rolling downhill that is gathering momentum , ” Kim said .
A few days ago I wondered whether Christopher Hitchens had accurately described Karl Rove as " not a believer . "
The answer seems to be yes .
Christopher Schipper sends along this transcript of Wayne Slater on Fresh Air last September , talking about The Architect , his book about Rove :
GROSS : Are you confident that Karl Rove would still consider himself an agnostic ?
SLATER : I know that he felt that way two years ago .
I do n't know of any reason to think that he has changed that view .
He certainly has n't told me that he has .
It 's certainly possible .
I think the evidence and the history is that he remains something of an agnostic , though he sees the Christians , and not just Christians but also orthodox Jews , to some extent , as a valuable voter source .
With Rove , it 's about winning .
With Karl Rove , it 's how can you put together a team and a constituency or a cluster of constituencies that delivers you 50 percent plus one of the vote ?
And that 's what it 's all about .
The consumer advocates against the credit card industry is really David vs. Goliath .
We 're David , with our little bag of rocks , and Goliath is crushing and influence peddling .
They 're massively powerful compared to the few consumer advocates .
And not only the credit card companies , we 've [ also ] got to look at the banks who are ripping people off by charging them bounced - check fees ; we 've got to look at the rent - to - own stores , the mortgage scams and everything else .
So the credit card companies are only one of the industries that a very small number of consumer groups try to fend off on a daily basis .
And again , none of the consumer groups make any political influence peddling through political contributions , so we 've got one hand tied behind our backs to start with .
Credit card companies have power over the entire Congress .
Absolutely .
The banking committees are usually dominated by members from the states where the credit card companies and the other banks do business .
...
And this is all throughout Congress ?
It 's not like the Democrats or the Republicans are in favor with the credit card industry ?
So essentially the Congress and the courts took away the right of the states to do anything about the credit card industry years ago .
We 've got the credit card companies saying Congress should n't do anything , and they inoculate themselves against that with a massive lobbying push .
When we have a hearing on any issue in Congress , the credit card companies fill the room .
The consumer advocates -- less than five of us usually at any hearing . …
Congress has been afraid to deal with any kind of bad credit card company practices for years .
Three years ago , they held a hearing on credit card practices , but they did nothing .
Since then , Congress has n't done anything about credit card companies ' unfair practices because the credit card companies have enormous power and sway with the Congress .
There are lobbyists for each of the big credit card companies .
Then there are lobbyists for the bank associations .
And the bank associations and the credit card companies have political action committees .
They made soft money donations when they were legal , and they also have a large lobbying budget .
The credit cards companies [ and ] the banking industry have a very powerful presence in Washington .
Can you tell me what kind of influence they have ?
The consumer program director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group ( U.S. PIRG ) , Mierzwinski has authored many reports on credit cards and credit reporting .
Here , he talks about the 10 banks that dominate the credit card industry , the power of its lobby in Washington , why the industry does n't want the states to have any regulatory power , and the different bills the industry has helped kill over the years that would have protected consumers from unfair practices .
He also discusses how the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency -- the agency charged with overseeing some of the biggest credit card banks -- has failed to protect consumers .
" I do n't see any advertising by the OCC to consumers , " he says .
" I do n't see any aggressive attempt by the OCC to do outreach to consumers .
When have they last been on television saying , ' We want to hear from you if your bank has misled you or deceived you ? ' "
This interview was conducted on Oct. 17 , 2004 .
Leading opponents of whaling dismissed yesterday 's offer , which came on the opening day of the International Whaling Commission 's ( IWC ) meeting in Anchorage , Alaska .
" Japan may have underestimated the extent to which the hunting of humpbacks will be seen as a deeply provocative action by the people of New Zealand , " Chris Carter , the country 's conservation minister , said .
Australia , which depends on humpbacks as the main attraction of its whale - watching industry , also condemned the proposal .
" It is calculated to undermine dramatically the standing ... between the Australian and the Japanese people , " said Australia 's environment minister , Malcolm Turnbull .
" It is a needless act of provocation . "
Despite the response from its opponents , Japan said it had not given up hope of securing agreement to allow it to hunt a small number of minke whales with the meat used exclusively for local consumption .
" We are open - minded for dialogue , and we might come up with a big package that will satisfy all members , " said Joji Morishita , Japan 's deputy whaling commissioner .

An undertaker smuggled a dead pensioner 's life savings out of his home in the bag carrying his body .
Maurice Bartlett , 58 , wedged £ 2,000 in £ 20 notes under the corpse after spotting the cash on a bedside cabinet .
He also helped himself to 120 cigarettes , then zipped up the bodybag and wheeled the remains of 75 - year - old Hubert Golledge from his sheltered accommodation flat .
Scroll down for more ...
Bartlett later gave the cigarettes to his colleague David Dicks , 54 , who had been chatting to care workers outside the flat .
Yesterday , Judge Julian Lambert at Bristol Crown Court described the pair 's actions as " vile and despicable " after Bartlett pleaded guilty to theft of the money and cigarettes .
Dicks , who knew nothing about the money , admitted stealing the cigarettes .
Mr Golledge , a retired painter and decorator , died of leukaemia in June .
The undertaking firm MK Smith was called in and Bartlett and Dicks arrived at the warden - controlled accommodation in Redfield , Bristol , to take the body to a mortuary .
The thieves were caught when care staff - who had seen the cash while looking for details of Mr Golledge 's next of kin - noticed it was missing .
Judge Lambert told the undertakers : " This was a low and despicable crime .
Your conduct was quite disgraceful .
Your actions were a vile affront to the deceased and all standards of decency . "
Both men have been sacked by MK Smith .
After hearing of Bartlett 's previously unblemished career and that Dicks was the carer for his stroke - victim wife , the judge said such " exceptionable circumstances " meant he would impose community orders .
But he added : " You will hang your head in shame . "
Bartlett , of Kingswood , Bristol , was sentenced to six months in jail , suspended for two years .
He was fined £ 2,000 , plus £ 100 costs and ordered to do 200 hours ' unpaid work .
Dicks , of Upper Easton , Bristol , was ordered to do 200 hours ' unpaid work .
The stolen £ 2,000 had been recovered , the court heard .
James Byrne , defending Dicks , said : " The theft was a one - off moment of madness . "
Adam Vaitlingham , for Bartlett , said : " He has lost his career , his reputation and his self - esteem . "
Mr Golledge 's sister condemned Bartlett 's sentence as a " shameful let - off " .
Margaret Roberts , 74 , said : " My brother was such a kind and gentle man , he knew he was ill and had even been making preparations for his own funeral .
" The man who took the money should have been locked up .
" If this was in a foreign country he would have had his hands cut off , and rightly so . "

A Policy of Genocide
“ The enjoyment of power inevitably corrupts the judgment of reason , and perverts its liberty ” .
- Immanuel Kant
They thought Iraq would be a cakewalk .
After all , for years , its army was being depleted of fresh recruits in preparedness for an attack .
Half a million Iraqi children were killed [ i ] during the 13 years of sanctions leading to the 2003 invasion - “ Mission Accomplished ” .
The sanctions imposed on Iraq following the First Gulf War , under the watchful eyes of the Pentagon , monitored the degradation of Iraq 's water supply .
Reports itemized the likely outbreaks of " acute diarrhea " brought on by bacteria such as E. coli , shigella , and salmonella , or by protozoa such as giardia , which would affect " particularly children , " or by rotavirus , which would also affect " particularly children , " a phrase it put in parentheses .
Also cited were possibilities of typhoid and cholera outbreaks . ”
“ Gastroenteritis was killing children .
. . .
In the south , 80 percent of the deaths were children ( with the exception of Al Amarah , where 60 percent of deaths were children ) . " [ ii ]
In the words of one of the few decent and courageous congressional members , Cynthia McKinney , Democrat of Georgia , referred to the document " Iraq Water Treatment Vulnerabilities " and said : " Attacking the Iraqi public drinking water supply flagrantly targets civilians and is a violation of the Geneva Convention and of the fundamental laws of civilized nations . "
We were ‘ told ’ that we , the civilized world , are fighting the ‘ uncivilized ’ terrorists ’ .
So it is that Dick Cheney whispers into Mr. Bush ’s ear to attack Iraq , confident that with her children buried , the parents too weak from mourning and disease , she will surrender – quickly .
He made sure America stayed on track ; track of deception .
Prior to the invasion , Cheney was confronted with a report from the IAEA which threw doubts on the administration ’s allegations about Iraq ’s WMD , and he responded : “ We know he has been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons .
And we believe he has , in fact , reconstituted nuclear weapons .
I think Mr. ElBaradei frankly is wrong " ( Meet the Press , March 16 , 2003 ) .
The demon of greed never seems to get enough .
Over 1 million dead Iraqis – with Dick Cheney ’s old company KBR / Halliburton being the prime benefactor of theft , Mr. Cheney now has his eyes on Iran .
More bodies , dead ones , are needed for the task .
Once again , his old company , KBR / Halliburton , not only comes to the rescue , but benefits from the deal .
In November 2006 , the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction
auditor reported that in 2004 , KBR , a subsidiary of Dick Cheney ’s old company , Halliburton , ‘ had lost ’ more than 14,000 weapons destined for the Iraqi government .
Pentagon had lost track of them .
However , the Pentagon immediately ‘ found ’ an old , obscure clause and shuts down the audit [ iii ] .
On August 6 , 2007 , Washington
Post reported that there were in fact 190,000 weapons missing – while they referred to the previously reported 14,000 , they made no mention of Dick Cheney ’s old KBR / Halliburton . [ iv ]
According to Rachel Stohl , a senior analyst at the Center for Defense Information , " They really have no idea where they are , " .." It likely means that the United States is unintentionally providing weapons to bad actors . " [ v ]
And Dick Cheney ’s [ old ] company gets paid in spite of the corruption , theft , and mismanagement [ vi ] .
Americans and Iraqis get killed – and Iran is held accountable for arming the Shiite militias ; A win-win situation for Dick Cheney who is itching to go to war , and his old company .
Dismissing claims from al - Maliki that Iran is a positive force in Iraq , listening to Dick Cheney ’s whispers – much like the false allegations about Afghanistan that even though Dan McNeill , the NATO commander in Afghanistan , said : " What we 've found so far has n't been militarily significant on the battlefield . "
McNeill also said that more likely sources for the arms are drug traffickers , black market dealers , or al - Qaida groups ” ( Inter Press Service , June 20 , 2007 ) , is being blamed on Iran -- Mr. Bush bows to Dick Cheney and repeats that Iran is arming the insurgents who are killing American soldiers .
Dick Cheney is arguing for military action [ vii ] .
I wonder of Dick Cheney is the God that Mr. Bush talks to , the higher authority that told him to go to war in Iraq ?
But surely America does not have the soldiers for another illegal and immoral war ?
The Army is already only meeting its goals by offering larger monetary incentives to enlistees , and by allowing those who " normally " would not qualify for military service to enlist : those without a high - school diploma , those with criminal records and those previously rejected for being physically unfit [ viii ] .
Perhaps its time to look for a partner – a gay partner .
Army Lt. Gen. Douglas , Mr. Bush ’s war adviser says “ the draft is worth a look ” [ ix ] .
In fact , much like everything else , such as curbing our freedoms , the draft will be upon us and 18 - year olds will be dying for Halliburton and other Crusades .
This is not the first time the draft has been seriously considered ; in December 2006 , the Pentagon announced that it was planning on testing the military - draft machinery , but to alleviate fears of parents of 18 - year olds , it announced it would not be doing this until 2009 [ x ] .
Dick Cheney will not wait until 2009 .
Today , with Dick Cheney ’s [ old ] company Halliburton safely in Dubai dodging taxes and criminal charges , he is eager to push for a military strike on Iran .
The profits would make Iraq look like child ’s play – as would the death toll .
Several years ago , sipping a hot cup of coffee in my kitchen in Needham , Massachusetts , with my Polish neighbor , I was shocked to hear her guilt - ridden confession .
She admitted that at times , when she looked at my husband , given his German heritage , she could not help but wonder with unease if his family had been involved in the killing of her ( Jewish ) relatives .
Having overcome my shock at her bitter narrow - mindedness towards all people German , I told her that my husband was third generation American and his family could not have been involved in what went on during Hitler ’s time .
Restoring Human Rights and Dignity to the Field of Mental Health
What should you know about psychiatry ’s “ cures ” in the name of mental health ?
How valid are psychiatrists ’ diagnoses — and how safe are their drugs ?
The answers are contained in this information kit , which is provided free to legislators , government officials , medical and legal professionals , and human rights and advocacy organizations .
Many publishers consider the Internet , and Google in particular , a greater threat to their livelihoods than Osama bin Laden .
Among those who have taken particular offense at Google are some current and aspiring newspaper publishers , including Sam Zell ( who ’s in the process of buying Tribune Co. , owner of the Los Angeles Times ) , who once famously asked , “ If all of the newspapers in America did not allow Google to steal their content , how profitable would Google be ? ”
Up to now , Google ’s news site has n’t been a moneymaker for the company , at least not directly .
There are no ads on Google News , just links to stories on websites run by newspapers , magazines and other news outlets .
Those links prompt people to spend more time on the news media ’s sites , potentially increasing their ad sales .
But Google now is doing yet another thing that ’s bound to get under journalists ’ skin .
This month , it announced plans to let people and organizations comment on the stories written about them .
For example , if The Times ran another exposé on conflicts of interest within the Food and Drug Administration ’s drug - approval process , Google News would provide a forum for the FDA and any researchers or drug manufacturers implicated in the story to respond , unedited .
The feature implies that the stories aggregated by Google News are incomplete -- possibly because of limited space , but also possibly because of bias , neglect or ignorance .
News organizations have their flaws , and the added comments on Google may demonstrate that .
But Google ’s effort may have a happier side effect :
It may illustrate why journalism is more than just aggregating information -- and why Google News is n’t really its competition after all .

The essence of good journalism is asking the right questions .
Google , however , wo n’t ask anything of those who submit comments .
According to the company ’s announcement , its only interest is that the submissions are authentic , not that they ’re relevant or even truthful .
As a result , the comments section is likely to be larded with spin , hype and obfuscation .
A seemingly heartfelt comment may carry the CEO ’s name , but the words will probably have been typed by corporate flacks .
There will be some valuable responses too , plugging holes in stories or correcting mistaken impressions .
Google , however , wo n’t help readers separate the factual wheat from the public - relations chaff -- a reminder that Google may strive to be the world ’s index , but it ’s not journalism .
As mentioned , all Presidential events must be ticketed or accessed by a name list .
This is the best method for preventing demonstrators
People who are obviously going to try to disrupt the event can be denied entrance at least to the VIP area between the stage and the main camera platform ....
It is also not the responsibility of the Secret Service to check the tickets of the people entering ...
It is important to have your volunteers at a checkpoint before the Magnetometers in order to stop a demonstrator from getting into the event .
Look for signs that they may be carrying , and if need be , have volunteers check for folded cloth signs that demonstrators may be bringing to the event .
Next , we see how the counter demonstrations were not all ad hock or ad libbed .
They were planned and paid for out of your tax dollars and planned by a government against its own constituencies .
Preparing for Demonstrators
There are several ways the advance person can prepare a site to minimize demonstrators .
First , as always , work with the Secret Service and have them ask the local police department to designate a protest area where demonstrators can be placed , preferable not on view of the event site or motorcade route .
The formation of " rally squads " is a common way to prepare for demonstrators by countering their message .
This tactic involves utilizing small groups of volunteers to spread favorable messages using large hand held signs , placards , or perhaps a long sheet banner , and placing them in strategic areas around the site .
These squads should be instructed always to look for demonstrators .
The rally squad 's task is to use their signs and banners as shields between the demonstrators and the main press platform .
If the demonstrators are yelling , rally squads can begin and lead supportive chants to drown out the protestors ( USA !, USA !,USA ! ) .
As a last resort , security should remove the demonstrators form the event site .
The rally squads can include , but are not limited to , college / young republican organizations , local athletic teams , and fraternities / sororities .
For larger rallies , the squads should be broken up into groups of approximately 15 - 25 people .
A squad should be placed immediately in front of the stage , immediately in forgot of the main camera platform , close to the cut platform , immediately behind the stage area ( if people are being used as the backdrop ) , and at least one squad should be ' roaming ' throughout the perimeter of the event to look for potential problems .
Being aware of Demonstrators
It is important for the Advance Team and all volunteers to be on the lookout for potential demonstrators .
Volunteers should be instructed to contact the Advance person on site ( whether it is the Lead , Press or Site Advance ) when they see demonstrators .
Always check with local police to inquire of any demonstration permits issued prior to a visit .
Handling Demonstrators
Once a group of demonstrators has been identified , the Advance person must decide what action to take .
If it is determined that the media will not see or hear them and that the pose no potential disruption to the event , they can be ignored .
On the other hand , if the group is carrying signs , trying to shout down the President , or has potential to cause some greater disruption to the event , action needs to be taken immediately to minimize the demonstrator 's effect .
Before reacting to demonstrators , the Advance person should inform the rest of the Advance Team , the Tour Director , and the Press Advance Director of the situation .
Be prepared to give the number of demonstrators , location (s ) , a description , and their issue / organization .
It the demonstrators appear to be a security threat , notify the Secret Service immediately .
If demonstrators appear likely to cause only a political disruption , it is the Advance person 's responsibility to take appropriate action .
Rally squads should be dispatched to surround and drown out demonstrators immediately .
“ Nobody does goblins like the Brits , ” said one Warner executive .
“ I am not sure it ’s healthy .
But the world sure love those wizards and ghoulies .
It ’s your biggest export since the Beatles . "
A few weeks ago I read an article in The Times that ended with a quote that seemed astonishingly unlikely ... What an odd quote , I thought .
It does n't sound like anyone I 've ever run into in any Studio ever .
It sounds more like someone 's idea of a quote from a studio exec .
And why would it come from an unnammed studio exec ?
Studio execs may talk off the record if they 're slagging someone off , but they 're all about getting their names in the papers if it 's something that might resound to their advantage .
Even if it 's a quote that sounds made up .
And then I thought no more about it , until today .
BRITONS INVADE THE LA FILM SET we discover , in a long non-story , where I learned about ...
Neil Gaiman , the novelist whose books Stardust and Coraline are being filmed with Robert De Niro , Sienna Miller and Teri Hatcher .
“ Three years ago I could walk down the street .
Now I am uncomfortable with the attention I am getting , ” said the 46 - year - old writer , who lives in the distinctly unHollywood state of Minnesota .
This is before he sells his 10 - part supernatural saga , Sandman , to Hollywood in what could be a record - breaking cash deal .
which ( apart from the fact the quote itself is either invented or out of context enough to be invented , or is , most likely , an awkward rephrasing of what I said in Time magazine last week -- “ Five years ago , I was absolutely as famous as I wanted to be .
I ’m now more famous than I ’m comfortable with . ” ) is a remarkably misleading thing on so many levels , not least because it implies some kind of interview or that the person writing it knows what he 's talking about .
( Er , for starters , Warners bought the Sandman rights from DC over a decade ago ... ) .
Ah well .
At least it 's a positive mention and they spell my name right and namecheck Stardust .
I 'm probably too sensitive right now .
Yesterday I read this Michael Holroyd Guardian article twice before concluding that he genuinely had n't realised the dedication to Anansi Boys was not written for , as Holroyd suggests , some " great love or friend " that I had not met yet , but was simply a dedication to the person reading the book and was also meant to be funny ( something that I get the impression that everyone else reading the book seems to have understood without difficulty ) , and then I got grumpy on Roger Avary 's behalf when I read thatand could n't figure out what having an Oscar for best writer had to do with how many films you 've directed since getting it .
Right .
I shall stop being grumpy .
Possibly I shall also stop reading newspapers until Stardust is safely out .
I just cooked a wonderful meal , and pretty much everything was from the garden .
Here are some Russian Stardust posters .
Stephin Merritt is sending me some demos from his Coraline stage musical [ which is not the movie ] .
We have honey and bees and blueberries .
The world is a pretty good place to live in ...

Programming in Ruby makes me happy .
It 's a lovable language , with a pleasantly quirky syntax and lots of expressive power .
Programming in JavaScript , on the other hand , frustrates me to no end .
JavaScript could be a reasonable language , but it has all sorts of ugly corner cases , and it forces me to roll everything from scratch .
I 've been trying to make JavaScript a bit more like Ruby .
In particular , I want to support Ruby - style metaprogramming in JavaScript .
This would make it possible to port over many advanced Ruby libraries .
You can check out the interactive specification , or look at some examples below .
If the specification gives you any errors , please post them in the comment thread , and let me know what browser you 're running !
Taking inspiration from Ruby
Ruby libraries often seem a little bit magical .
Rails is an excellent example .
Assuming we have a database with two tables , employees and projects , we can write :
class Employee < ActiveRecord ::
Base has_many : tasks end class Task < ActiveRecord :: Base belongs_to : employee end employee = Employee .
find_by_name ( " Joe Smith " ) ; employee .
tasks .
each { | task | print task .
name }
This is a complete interface to our database !
We only need to declare the relationship between employees and tasks , and Ruby automatically declares find_by_name , tasks , and dozens of other methods for us .
There are two tricks here :
has_many and belongs_to modify our classes at runtime , adding methods as needed .
ActiveRecord looks at our database tables , and notices that we have fields like name .
It uses this information to automatically add findbyname and other methods to our class .
This style of programming is powerful , flexible , and concise .
It also has some limitations .
There 's no way to type - check this kind of code , so we need to write lots of test cases .
Can we do stuff like this in JavaScript ?
Yup !
You can grab the necessary code from my Subversion repository :
svn co http://www.randomhacks.net/svn/planetary/trunk/
planetary
The jsr subdirectory of this project contains everything you need to build Ruby - style libraries in JavaScript .
Let 's begin with a Ruby - style class declaration :
var Greeter = JSR .
Class . extend ( ) ; with ( Greeter .
prototype ) { def ( " initialize " , function ( message ) { this .
message = message || " Hello ! " ; } ) ; def ( " hello " , function ( ) { return this .
message ; } ) ; }
Here , Greeter is a class with two methods , initialize and hello .
The def function adds a new member function to Greeter at run time , just like the def statement in Ruby .
We can use our new class as follows :
var greeter = new Greeter ( " Hello , world ! " ) ; println ( greeter . hello ( ) ) ;
We can also subclass Greeter and override our hello method .
Note that we can call the original version of hello using applySuper :
var ChattyGreeter = Greeter . extend ( ) ; with ( Chatty Greeter .
prototype ) { def ( " hello " , function ( ) { var before = arguments .
callee .
applySuper ( this , arguments ) ; return before + " How are you today ? " ; } ) ; }
Getting JavaScript to support applySuper was fairly tricky ; I owe many thanks to Joshua Gertzen for explaining how to do it .
Now , we need to write some test cases !
Behavior - driven development
Test - driven development ( TDD ) is a technique for designing and building software incrementally .
First , you begin by writing a test case .
Then , you write just enough code to make that test case work .
Finally , you repeat the whole process from the beginning .
But many programmers find TDD fairly counter - intuitive .
It 's hard to know which tests to write when , and how big each test should be .
When Dan North encountered this problem , he argued that programmers found TDD confusing because of bad terminology .
He proposed Behavior - driven development ( BDD ) , which basically just replaces " test cases " with " specifications , " and changes the other terminology to match .
But this small change has a powerful psychological effect , making it easier to write good test cases .
One popular BDD library is RSpec , which has been catching on in the Ruby community .
It provides a concise language for writing specifications :
describe " Array " do it " should have a last ( ) method returning the last element " do [ 1 , 2 ]. last .
should == 2 lambda { [ ]. last }. should raise_error ( IndexError ) end end
We can do the same thing in JavaScript .
Unfortunately , we have to put up with quite a bit of syntactic noise :
spec ( " An array " , JSSpec .
Spec , function ( ) { with ( this ) { it ( " should have a last ( ) method returning the last element " , function ( ) { [ 1 , 2 ]. last ( ) . should Equal ( 2 ) ; ( function ( ) { [ ] . last ( ) ; } ) . should Throw ( ) ; } ) ; }} ) ;
The it function works much like def in the previous section .
To see this library in action , check out the interactive specification .
What 's next ?
There are several projects which improve JavaScript in various ways .
Prototype adds a wealth of standard Ruby features , including each and many other iterator functions .
TrimPath includes a partial implementation of ActiveRecord in JavaScript , but it has n't been updated in the past two years .
Or if you 'd prefer a less dynamic approach , haXe offers static type declarations , a full - fledged type inferencer , and a server - side VM .
The biggest problem with the approach described in this article is the syntactic noise .
Perhaps a haXe - style syntactic preprocessor would help ?

Strong evidence of wet past on Mars
PASADENA , California ( AP ) —
The Mars rover Spirit has uncovered the strongest evidence yet that the planet used to be wetter than previously thought , scientists reported Monday .
The robot analyzed a patch of soil in Gusev Crater and found it unusually rich in silica .
The presence of water would have been necessary to produce such a large silica deposit , scientists said .
“ This is a remarkable discovery , ” principal investigator Steve Squyres of Cornell University said in a statement .
“ It makes you wonder what else is still out there . ”
Spirit previously found clues of ancient water in the crater through the presence of sulfur - rich soil , water - altered minerals and explosive volcanism .
But the latest find is compelling because of the high silica content , researchers said , raising the possibility that conditions may have been favorable for the emergence of primitive life .
It ’s unclear how the silica deposit formed .
One possibility is that the soil mixed with acid vapors in the presence of water .
Others believe the deposit was created from water in a hot spring surrounding .
The durable Spirit and its twin , Opportunity , have been working on overtime since completing their primary , three - month mission in 2004 .
For eight months , Opportunity has explored the rim of Victoria Crater on the opposite side of the planet .
Scientists are looking for a safe opening to send the rover in .
The mission is managed at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena .

The planets are all long gone .
The inkblot finally closes overhead and the last star winks out .
The gibbous Moon remains shining balefully down on the world for a tense and hopeful minute , but then , in an eyeblink , is swallowed up by one final event horizon , and spirited away .
Left in utter darkness , the former astronomer tries and fails to deal rationally with his loss , and his isolation from the human race who , as the voice rightly tried to tell him , has really lost nothing .

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has announced a plan to outfit municipal buildings with solar panels and to begin buying heating oil containing biofuels .
He made this announcement shortly after turning on the switch for the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy ( RITE ) project , a installation that will provide more than 1000kw hours per day of renewable electricity
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Lieutenant Governor David A. Paterson today announced that Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy project has now generated and delivered the world ’s first kinetic hydro - power to local businesses .
Kinetic hydro - power is an emerging form of renewable energy derived from the natural flow of water , without the use of dams .
RITE is using the first free - flow tidal turbines in the world , providing more than 1000 kW hours per day of clean , emission - free electricity to Roosevelt Island .
The turbines are operated by Verdant Power , Inc. , a global integrator of kinetic or “ free - flow ” hydro - power systems and a leading marine renewable energy developer of dam - less hydro - power sites .
“ Supporting innovative projects like Verdant ’s is an important part of PlaNYC and will help us meet our goal of reducing New York City ’s greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % by the year 2030 , ” said Mayor Bloomberg .
“ In addition , today I ’m announcing that the City is issuing an RFP for emissions free electricity from solar power generated on City owned buildings .
This should send a message to the solar power industry : ‘ We want your business . ’
Because we expect our population to grow by nearly a million people between now and 2030 , it ’s important that we do everything we can to limit our impact on climate change , including supporting the development of more renewable energy sources .
We hope that water turbines , solar panels , and other sources of renewable energy will will be the norm in the coming decades , but that will only happen if we support these technologies and industries today . ”
The Mayor called for 2 mega watts of solar capacity for a pilot program aimed at creating long - term fixed price power for the City , and offsetting approximately 230 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions over the life of the contract .
The city does n’t want to buy solar systems instead they wish to have developers install them on city buildings and the city will then enter into a long term energy contract with the panel owners .
This is very similar to what other big cities have done .
The developer will install , own , finance , and maintain each solar power system , the city just buys the power .
The Verdant Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy ( RITE ) Project was initiated in 2002 .
After several years of research and development , it is now producing more than 1,000 kilowatt hours per day of clean , sustainable , emission - free electricity for Gristede ’s Supermarket and the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation ( RIOC ) “ Motorgate ” parking garage in New York City ’s Roosevelt Island .
The RITE Project ’s second of three phases comprises 6 turbines - 5 with 35 kW name plate generators and one equipped with a dynamometer for monitoring project operations .
The RITE Project also has incorporated over $ 2 million in fish monitoring equipment .
To date , there have been no detectable impacts on fish or the marine environment .
At the site ’s full capacity it could produce 10 MW , enough for 8,000 homes .
The Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy ( RITE ) project has already set a number of world precedents for energy delivery including :
* First kinetic hydro - power technology to deliver electricity to end - user customers
* First multi-turbine kinetic hydro - power field installed and operated
* First grid - connected multi-turbine kinetic hydro - power field installed and operated
* First fully bidirectional tidal operation
* Most hours of continual operation of any kinetic hydro - power technology
( 40 days x 24hrs. / day = 960 hours )
Bloomberg also announced a plan to use more biofuel in government buildings , saying that by next summer , 30 percent of the cityâ€™s heating oil purchases would be required to contain 5 percent biofuel .
That percentage is to grow to 10 percent by 2010 and 20 percent by 2012 .
City Councilman David Yassky has plans to introduce legislation next week that would accelerate that timetable , with a 20 percent biofuel mix by 2011 .
For private buildings , including homes and offices , the legislation would mandate a 5 percent mix in 2009 , increasing to a 20 percent mix by 2013 .
A brief history of the art of Typography
Typography , just what exactly do we mean ?
Typography is the name given to the creation of letters used in everyday printing such as signs , newspapers , books and magazines to name but a few .
Many people often confuse typography with fonts or typefaces and believe all three to be the same thing and largely interchangeable , which is untrue .
Fonts are a pack of letters and symbols , they come as a complete set and are the nuts and bolts used to get your message across in print to your audience .
However , a typeface is the design of the font , the specific look and feel of it , how it looks on the page .
The creation and evolution of typeface has been , largely down to advances in technology , going from the practical fonts used on the original printing presses through to typewriters , word - processors and the internet .
Johannes Gutenburg
In 1456 a man by the name of Johannes Gutenburg released for public use , a forty two line Bible ( the name referring to the amount of lines per column ) which experts are agreed was so technically efficient in its construction that it was clearly printed as opposed to handwritten which , up until this point , all written works had been by necessity .
This was to change the way print was consumed forever as previously , books and works of print were very time consuming and costly to produce with scribes being paid for each page they were able to write out per day .
The printing press was to change all that .
The Bible was printed in a medieval typeface entitled simply ‘ blackletter ’ and was widely adopted as the standard for it was practical and dark in appearance , although sometimes rather difficult to read , especially when Gutenburg used the same to produce his second work , the Catholicon which condensed the font more than the Bible , giving the typeface a blurred appearance as though each letter were bleeding into its neighbor .
Roman
It did not take long for printers to decide that another typeface was needed , one that was to be more legible than the standard blackletter .
Nicolas Jenson felt inspired upon seeing inscriptions engraved upon ancient buildings of the Roman era and stepped up to the challenge and created a new typeface .
Roman
Type quickly became the favored method , replacing the largely illegible blackletter .
Saving money
In the early 1500s , a man named Aldus Manutius hit upon a way to fit more words onto the paper without compromising the ability to read the letters clearly .
This saved the print - houses money by saving paper and wages by giving them the ability to print far more onto each page .
Manutius was running his own print - house in the beginning part of the 16th century and had working for him as a cutter and designer a man named Francessco Griffo who made Manutius ’ company a leading name in print with his new typeface .
Thus Italics were born .
This highly decorative , slightly sloped typeface is used today for emphasis on certain words or to add creative flair to greeting cards and decorative works , however its creation was , again , the product of the evolution of the printed word .
For over 200 years , little advancement was made in the creation of new typefaces as both Roman Type and Italics were used to great effect and as such , no new solutions were needed .
That is until the mid 1700s .
The 18th and 19th Century
In 1734 , William Caslon saw the need for a straighter variant of both the Italic and Roman Type typeface structures thus giving a better contrast between bold and thinner strokes .
This collection of straight serifs quickly became popular and evolved into what we would recognize today as Old Style typeface .
This new and innovative typeface was cut and set in blocks that was easy on the eye and made reading the text a lot easier than the highly elegant , but at times inappropriately decadent italic typeface .
Indeed , it was so well received that Benjamin Franklin introduced Old Style typeface to the Americas where a Baltimore printers produced and released official copies of the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America using the Old Style typeface .
Seeing that new typefaces and the need for variations was a popular move , this led to many advancements in typefaces including John Baskerville ’s Transitional Type .
Based around the Roman style but borrows from the Old Style with a collection of contrasting thick and thin lines .
This style was far more angular though with sharp serifs giving the impression that Baskerville , a professor in the art of calligraphy , wished to bring a far more aesthetically pleasing aspect to the design over the functional and practical typeface designs of the recent past .
As a book designer , John Baskerville tended to put far more emphasis on the typographer than the illustrator within his works , wishing that the words themselves became a celebrated piece of art in their own right and achieved a heightened level of contrast through the use of special papers to produce his most famous printed work , the Cambridge Bible in 1763 .
Giambattist Bodoni and Firmin Didot took the contrast far further with their more modern Roman typefaces , giving the font a much fresher look overall .
Paving the way for Vincent Figgins in 1815 who pioneered the Egyptian typeface , sometimes known as the Slab Serif which were far more boxlike in appearance .
The early foundations of today ’s Sans Serif typefaces were first showcased by William Caslon IV in 1816 when he unveiled his serif - less typeface .
It was at this time that many typefaces were created , too many to keep track of individual creators , and was largely to meet the demands of the rapid growth in the advertising industry .
A rising tide of newspapers and magazine productions , specifically in the field of entertainment for women , along with the creation of small comic books and short stories such as the Penny Dreadful series meant that printers needed more and more varieties of typeface to keep their readers interests .
From plain , easy to read fonts imparting the news , to the more emotional and fanciful text for woman ’s romance , health and housekeeping magazines , all added to the constant evolution of the art of typography .
The 20th Century and Present Day
The 20th century saw the rise of far more aesthetically pleasing works as the creation of typefaces became far more about the essence and style of the actual words on the page rather than the information that they were being used to convey .
This was hugely apparent in the rising arts and crafts movement of the early 20th century with the famed William Morris adding his creative endeavors to the world of modern book production with his works having a huge influence on typeface designers at this time .
Artists began experimenting with different uses of typeface , and one such typographer , Bruce Rogers , a trained artist , produced what is now considered to be one of the most beautifully published Bibles ever produced in English ; the Oxford Lectern Bible , completed in 1935 and incorporated the use of his highly decorative , ornamental typeface Centaur throughout the majority of the book .
Although deemed far too complicated and elegant for everyday use , this typeface added an aesthetic to the book , this making the publication a work of art in its own right .
By the 1920s , it was clear that typeface design had well and truly taken hold and Frederic Goudy was named as the first ever type designer , creating many innovative and unique typefaces on a full time basis .
These included Goudy Old Style , Copperplate Gothic and Kennerly , to name but a few .
Goudy also penned a number of written works on the subject of typography , in particular , two journals entitled Ars Typographica and Typographica where he attempts to explain his views of the use of lettering in art and design and went on the produce more works based on his theories of typography including The Alphabet and Elements of Lettering .
As with many publishing and creative endeavors , typography was halted during the horrors of both world wars as print became far more functional and published works were to convey news of the war effort and were no longer a place for masters of the craft to showcase their abilities .
However , once the wars had ended , the art thrived once more as many typographers took up the craft thus allowing for further evolution .
In 1957 a designer from Switzerland named Max Miedinger developed arguably one of the most used and recognized typefaces of all time .
He called it Helvetica and was a throwback to the simpler , more minimalistic forms of typeface .
He is often given credit for the creation of Futura typeface also , as this was also produced around the same time as Helvetica , however there is no concrete evidence that Miedinger was responsible for both typefaces .
Thanks to the technological advancements of word - processors , computers , specialized arts packages such as Indesign and Photoshop , and the rise of blogging sites like The Blog Starter , we now have hundreds of varieties of typefaces to choose from .
As programs and hacks are commonplace it has opened up the world of typography to everyone who wishes to indulge in the art and as such has given us far more scope in our levels of design that simply would not have been possible a mere few hundred years ago .
Without extraordinary measures , it will be hard to maintain current troop levels past next summer .

An Iraqi whom I will call Ahmed lives in Saidiya , an area in south Baghdad where , in the nineteen - eighties , the regime of Saddam Hussein built large houses for well - connected Army officers , most of them Sunnis .
After the American invasion , in 2003 , Saidiya became a base of Sunni resistance , but since last year vicious sectarian fighting has divided its streets between Sunni and Shia , with front lines crisscrossing the district ; the highway separating Saidiya from the Shiite area of Bayya , to the northwest , now marks an impassable boundary .
“ It ’s just like the Great Wall of China , ” Ahmed said , during a recent phone conversation .
A graduate of Baghdad University , with a degree in English literature , he worked before the war as a news translator for Iraqi state television .
Saidiya has one of the highest rates of sectarian killings in the city .
Eighty - four unidentified corpses were found there between mid-June and mid-July , according to Zeyad Kasim , a researcher at IraqSlogger.com , a news - gathering Web site .
Ahmed said that the number actually represents an improvement — earlier this year , he saw bodies lying in the streets even more frequently .
The U.S. military “ surge ” launched this spring , in which thirty thousand additional American forces arrived in Baghdad , has helped to stabilize Saidiya ’s sectarian borders .
The Americans do n’t often patrol Ahmed ’s neighborhood , but , when Iraqi Army forces call in air support , Apache attack helicopters can reach Saidiya within minutes .
Ahmed has little faith in the Iraqi Army itself .
He said that the soldiers behave unprofessionally , do n’t respect the chain of command , and seem more concerned with their salaries than with their responsibilities .
“ Ninety per cent of my neighborhood think the Iraqi Army is hopeless , ” he said .
There is no functioning government in Saidiya .
The power supply has dropped to less than two hours a day , and for a month Ahmed — a thirty - seven - year - old father of two who suffers from diabetes and a heart condition — could obtain water only from a hole that he dug in his back yard .
His neighborhood is under the control of a Shiite militia claiming allegiance to Moqtada al - Sadr , the radical scion of a powerful clerical family , who has emerged as perhaps the most important political figure in Iraq .
The militia employs the crippled and the poor to collect protection money , controls a black market for fuel , and forcibly recruits young men into its ranks as lookouts against the Americans .
Its local “ security ” force consists of teen - agers brandishing AK - 47s .
Ahmed , who has a Shiite father and a Sunni mother , considers himself a secular Shiite , and , in his view , the religious militias want to force people like him out of Baghdad .
“ Americans are the safe house for the whole situation in Iraq , ” he said .
“ Once they say they are going to withdraw , the whole country will become a hell . ”
He went on , “ I imagine that no Sunnis will be in Baghdad at all .
Baghdad will be only for the Shiite man with the long beard and black imama — the turban .
The Americans are representing the taboos , just like ‘ Lord of the Flies . ’
I imagine the Shiites will be just like that if the Americans have to withdraw .
Who can fight will fight , who must leave will leave . ”
He added , “ Those who are weak , who are trying to avoid the savagery , those who are at the edge of being eaten by the Shiite specifically — that will be the end point , that will be their doomsday .
The plan , as we hear it , is to make Baghdad empty of Sunnis . ”
This week , Ryan Crocker , the U.S. Ambassador in Baghdad , and General David Petraeus , the commander of the multinational forces in Iraq , will give their assessment of the surge to Congress — an event that , in Washington , has taken on the aura of a make - or - break moment for the Administration ’s policy .
But their testimony is likely to be unremarkable .
Administration officials , military officers , and members of Congress described their expectations of it in strikingly similar terms , and a few said that they could write it in advance : military progress , a political stalemate among Iraqis , more time needed .
The Petraeus - Crocker testimony is the kind of short - lived event on which the Administration has relied to shore up support for the war : the “ Mission Accomplished ” declaration , the deaths of Uday and Qusay Hussein , Saddam ’s capture , the transfer of sovereignty , the three rounds of voting , the Plan for Victory , the death of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
Every new milestone , however illusory , allows the Administration to avoid thinking ahead , to the years when the mistakes of Iraq will continue to haunt the U.S .
The media have largely followed the Administration ’s myopic approach to the war , and there is likely to be intense coverage of the congressional testimony .
But the inadequacy of the surge is already clear , if one honestly assesses the daily lives of Iraqis .
Though the streets of Baghdad are marginally less lethal than they were during 2006 , sixty thousand Iraqis a month continue to leave their homes , according to the International Organization for Migration , joining the two million who have become refugees and the two million others displaced inside Iraq .
The militias , which have become less conspicuous as they wait out the surge , are nevertheless growing in strength , as they extend their control over neighborhoods like Ahmed ’s .
In the backstreets , the local markets , the university classrooms , and other realms beyond the reach of American observers or American troops , there is no rule of law , only the rule of the gun .
The lives of most Iraqis are dominated by a complex array of militias and criminal gangs that are ruthlessly competing with one another , and whose motives for killing are more often economic or personal than religious or ideological .
A recent report by the International Crisis Group urged the American and British governments to acknowledge that their “ so - called Iraqi partners , far from building a new state , are tirelessly working to tear it down . ”
After the string of bad decisions made by American leaders in the early years of the occupation , officials in Baghdad have made various technical corrections : training the new Iraqi Army in a more professional way , funding reconstruction projects that show faster results , and applying the methods of counter - insurgency to the war .
But these improved approaches came much too late , and did n’t quell the profound sectarian hatreds that emerged after Saddam ’s removal .
A former Baghdad Embassy official told me , “ If Iraqi leaders , in their own heart of hearts , do n’t share a vision , there ’s just not much you can do about it .
I do n’t think accommodation is going to happen . ”
This political failure ca n’t be attributed to the Iraqis alone .
Iraq ’s leadership was originally installed , along sectarian lines , by the American - led Coalition Provisional Authority , and the chaos that followed the invasion drove Iraqis to seek safety in armed groups based on identity .
The inability of Iraq ’s communities to reconcile does n’t absolve the United States of responsibility .
Instead , it raises a new set of moral and strategic questions that are , in their way , more painful than at any other phase of the war .
Facing these questions requires American leaders to do what they have not yet done — to look beyond the next three or six months , to the next two or three years .
When America prepares , inevitably , to leave , what can we do to limit the damage that will follow our departure , not just for Iraq ’s sake but for our own ?
I am lying on hot slab of rock on the coast of Maine .
Fifty feet down to my right , the Atlantic Ocean crashes against a cliff face .
I watch as the water spews upward and across a pile of boulders , leaving tide pools in its wake .
I am completely mesmerized .
The waves come and they go and I stare and stare , my mind totally blank .
But then I realize it's not so much blank as content , mentally at rest , and that it 's been a while since I 've felt this good .
The water has apparently washed away any thoughts of stuff I need to do for work , or personal troubles that days before were weighing me down .
I 'm on vacation , I say to myself , and that 's why happiness has taken over my brain .
But then I realize it 's human nature to seek out bodies of water .
In fact , maps of the world 's population show that the bulk of humanity today lives near water .
We live along coastlines , around the rims of bays , up the course of rivers and streams , and on islands .
We also vacation at the beach and find solace fishing on a lake .
Nothing makes small children happier than the chance to splash through puddles .
More surprising , this human penchant for water makes evolutionary sense .
Sure , we need drinking water to live , but we have also benefited from what 's swimming under the waves .
Neuroscientist Michael Crawford of the University of North London has proposed that our ancient ancestors were devotees of the sea , and that their devotion paid off by allowing the human species to develop large and complex brains .
Crawford claims that when humans separated from apes and emerged from the forests of Africa , they stuck close to rivers and beaches and started feasting on fish , clams and crabs .
That marine diet was packed with omega - 3 fatty acids , essential fatty acids that promote brain cell growth .
It 's no coincidence , Crawford claims , that human brain growth began to increase exponentially once we left the woods and headed for the beach .
Scientists have also discovered that people who eat fish regularly , like I 've been doing since we crossed the Maine state line , are less like to suffer from depression than those who eschew seafood .
Psychiatrist and lipid biochemist Joseph Hibbelin of the National Institutes of Health has shown that across cultures there is a direct correlation between ounces of fish eaten each week and rates of depression .
More interesting , Hibbelin and researcher Laura Reis have found that fish is commonly used as a symbol of happiness and good health in various religions and cultures .
We know that fish and the sea are good for us , and so we seek them out , and when we move inland , or go home from vacation , we sadly lose touch with our maritime roots .

A masked officer leads a terror suspect ( in blue ) to a helicopter
Federal prosecutor Monika Harms said the three had trained at camps in Pakistan and procured some 700 kg ( 1,500lbs ) of chemicals for explosives .
She said the accused had sought to target facilities visited by Americans , such as nightclubs , pubs or airports .
Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung said the men had posed " an imminent threat " .
Media reports said the men were planning attacks against a US military base in Ramstein and Frankfurt airport .
The US praised the actions of the German government and said the incident showed everyone needed to be vigilant in finding " terrorists " .
German government sources have told the BBC they believe at least seven members of the cell are still at large .
Surveillance effort
Ms Harms said the men planned to use vehicles loaded with the explosives to kill or injure large numbers of people .
They obviously planned these attacks on the orders of an international network ,
Wolfgang Schaeuble
German Interior Minister
German fears over plotters
The arrests had prevented " massive bomb attacks " , she said .
The suspects , aged 22 , 28 and 29 , were alleged to be members of the German cell of a group she named as Islamic Jihad Union .
Two of the men were German nationals who had converted to Islam , while the third was a Turkish man .
Ms Harms said the al - Qaeda - linked group had set up the cell last year .
Joerg Ziercke , the head of Germany 's federal crime office , said the men had a " profound hatred of US citizens " .
They had been under surveillance since December , but the authorities decided to act when it became clear the men were planning to move their huge stores of hydrogen peroxide .
They were arrested on Tuesday afternoon in a raid on an apartment in North Rhine - Westphalia .
Another 40 raids were been carried out on properties across the country .
Mr Ziercke told Agence France - Presse news agency one of the three arrested had been detained for allegedly spying on a US base at Hanau in December , but was freed shortly afterwards .
Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble called the men " very dangerous terrorists " .
" They obviously planned these attacks on the orders of an international network , " he said .
Mr Schaeuble said one man was linked to a mosque in the southern city of Neu - Ulm that authorities had suspected for years was an extremist base .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the arrests were a " reminder that we need to be vigilant in all of our efforts to find terrorists , deny them resources and hiding places , and prevent attacks " .
Growing concerns
Frankfurt airport is continental Europe 's busiest , and the base at Ramstein in western Germany is a major transport hub for US military operations .
Germany , which has soldiers in Afghanistan but did not send troops to Iraq , has been largely spared terrorist attacks .
However , there have been growing concerns that Islamist militants are operating in the country .
Six years ago , the northern city of Hamburg was thrust into the spotlight after it emerged a cell had used it as a base for planning the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US .
Last summer , two identical suitcase bombs were planted on two commuter trains in the German cities of Dortmund and Koblenz but they failed to explode .
On Monday , two people with suspected links to al - Qaeda were arrested in Denmark on suspicion of planning a bomb attack .

A new book entitled The Pearl Harbor Myth : Rethinking the Unthinkable by George Victor and published by Potomac Books Inc. of Washington , D.C. is well researched and gives a very clear picture of how and why the Pearl Harbor myth was created .
This “ patriotic political myth ” states that the attack by the Japanese was unprovoked and was a surprise to the Roosevelt administration , as well as , the key military personnel in Washington ; but the commanders of Pearl Harbor were at fault for not being ready .
Based on a good summary of the up - to - date research the author , who is an approving admirer of Roosevelt , concludes that Roosevelt deliberately provoked the attack and that he and his key military and administrative advisers clearly knew , well in advance , that the Japanese were going to attack both Pearl Harbor and the Philippines .
Roosevelt wanted to get into the European War but he had been unsuccessful in provoking Germany ; therefore , he considered the sacrifice of Pearl Harbor and the Philippines as the best way to get into the European War through the back door of Japan .
The cover -up of this strategy started immediately after the attack and continues to this day .
The author concludes that this information of the coming attack was intentionally withheld from the military commanders because it was known that the Japanese were depending upon the element of surprise and if warnings had been sent to the commanders of Pearl Harbor and the Philippines , their preparation for the attack would have caused the Japanese to cancel their plans .
The losses and damages at Pearl Harbor are described by Victor as follows :
“ In the Pearl Harbor attack , the United States lost twenty - four hundred troops along with a quarter of her fleet .
Many military leaders and Knox , Hull , and Roosevelt had underestimated the harm Japan could do , even by a surprise attack .
And U.S. losses were much increased by two unlikely events .
A Japanese bomb penetrated the battleship Arizona ’s armor at an odd angle , reaching her magazine and causing her to explode .
And the torpedoed battleship Oklahoma capsized .
The explosion of the Arizona and the capsizing of the Oklahoma resulted in the drowning of sixteen hundred sailors . ”
The tremendous losses in the Philippines have been virtually hidden from the American public but they were mostly the native soldiers and civilians .
Victor states :
“ The Philippines suffered widespread destruction and was captured .
Twenty - four hundred troops and seventy civilians were lost in Hawaii .
In the Philippines , one hundred forty thousand troops were lost and civilian deaths – still unreported – are estimated to have been as high as three million .
Nonetheless , the defeat at Pearl Harbor became a wrenching tragedy , and the administration sacrificed the commanders there to restore public confidence , while the defeat in the Philippines became a noble defense .
Despite devastation and loss of the Philippines , a public relations operation turned MacArthur into a hero and he was promoted .
The public reaction is not strange , however , when seen in the light of government control of information – a usual wartime practice . ”
The author states that the most recent Pearl Harbor investigation by Congress in October , 2000 resulted in a resolution by Congress “ calling on President William Clinton to restore the reputations of Short and Kimmel .
It provoked the flurry of accusations that Congress was usurping the job of historians , revising history , and reviving a long - discredited conspiracy theory .
Clinton took no action on the resolution . ”
The author , Victor , includes a chapter from the viewpoint of the Japanese .
They were being pressured strongly by Germany to enter the war by attacking the Soviet Union , thereby creating a two - front war for the Communist nation .
This strategy came within the actual interests of Japan since they , like Germany , saw Communism as a great evil and a threat to their respective nations .
Furthermore , Japan had substantial claims to parts of Manchuria as a result of defeating Russia in the war of 1905 .
Both Germany and Japan wanted to avoid a war with America at almost any cost .
Roosevelt was well aware of this pressure on Japan by Germany but he felt that it was necessary to protect the Soviet Union as being the best weapon against the Germans , and therefore , he wanted to prevent Japan from attacking Russia .
Roosevelt began extensive provocations to cause Japan to abandon its attack on Russia and instead attack America which also served the purpose of giving Roosevelt the reason to enter the war .
Roosevelt launched an eight - point provocation plan primarily through the cutting off of oil supplies to Japan so that by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor Japan was virtually out of oil and on the verge of industrial and military collapse .
The attack on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines also would provide Japan with the ability to attack the Dutch interests in the Pacific , thereby giving them a new supply of oil .
Victor sees Roosevelt ’s decisions as being based upon the assumption of the truth of the following statement : “ Hitler ’s plan to conquer and enslave most of the world was hardly a secret . ”
The author cites no authority for this plan of Hitler to conquer the world and you will not find this in the two books that Hitler wrote nor in any of his speeches .
His intentions were well known before and during the war .
He stated from the beginning , before he took power , as well as thereafter , that he was against the harsh and unfair Versailles Treaty which virtually disarmed Germany and it included the inequities created for Germany in Poland and Czechoslovakia , which he intended to correct either through negotiation or , if necessary , by force .
He stated and wrote that the only war he wanted was to fight Communism and to regain some of the living space that Germany had acquired in their treaty with Russia during World War I , which was abrogated by the Versailles Treaty .
Nevertheless , the defeat of Hitler , not Germany , appears to be the premise upon which the author states that Roosevelt acted so that the end justified the means .
Hitler , the man , must be defeated at all costs and these costs included the sacrifice of Pearl Harbor and the Philippines in order to get into the European War via Japan .
I need to depart from a review of Victor ’s book momentarily in order to take issue with his basic assumption that Roosevelt ’s main interest was the defeat of Hitler .
If his primary end was simply the death of Hitler , Roosevelt had an excellent opportunity of letting the key military officers in the regular German army carry out a plan of assassination .
Allen Dulles was stationed in Switzerland with the OSS ( which preceded the CIA ) and was assigned the primary duty of seeing if there was a resistance movement in Germany which might overthrow Hitler .
Dulles learned of a very substantial plot to kill Hitler early in the war in 1942 after Germany ’s defeat at Stalingrad .
While Stalin had murdered 35,000 to 50,000 of his senior military officers prior to the war in order to put in his loyal officers , Hitler had resisted this strategy and did not purge the regular German army of its senior officers .
Early in the war a large number of these senior officers , including his Chief of Staff , General Ludwig Beck , built up a strong resistance movement with the purpose of assassinating Hitler and then surrendering to the American and British forces .
They intended then to continue the war against Communism and the Soviet Union .
A new government was to be created with Beck at the head and Dr. Carl Goerdeler , former mayor of Leipzig , to be the two top people .
There was originally a large group who helped draw up the plan which included numerous civilians who would serve in the new democratic government , so it was not just to be a military coup .
Dulles stated that even after the resistance movement had been discouraged by Roosevelt ’s unconditional surrender policy , nevertheless , a small group of officers who remained committed to the assassination of Hitler made an unsuccessful attempt on Hitler ’s life on July 20 , 1944 .
Hitler rounded up all of the people who were even suspected of being a part of this plot and this amounted to over 200,000 Germans who were put in concentration camps and many were killed .
The two principal high - ranking German officers who took part in the plot met their fate on the next day after the attempt , with one being shot by a firing squad and General Beck was allowed to commit suicide in the presence of the Nazi officers .
When Roosevelt first learned of this significant resistance movement and the plan of the Germans to surrender immediately to America and the British , he unilaterally announced the unconditional surrender policy which caused much of the resistance movement to dissolve and their plans to be abandoned .
Roosevelt ’s unconditional surrender policy was not well received by either Churchill or Stalin .
Dulles , as well as , many key military advisers , were unsuccessful in getting Roosevelt to abandon or substantially revise this policy .
They pointed out to Roosevelt that it would discourage the assassination of Hitler .
It would make the Germans fight harder , cause the war to last longer and be more costly than necessary .
Roosevelt ’s policy required unconditional surrender to the British , the Soviets and America simultaneously .
No surrender would be accepted unless it was made to all three at the same time .
Many of the German officers decided that they would rather fight against all three rather than surrender to the Soviet Union .
( See Germany ’s Underground : The Anti-Nazi Resistance by Allen Dulles and Unconditional Surrender by Anne Armstrong . )
One of the best writers on World War II was Hanson Baldwin , who covered the war for The New York Times .
After the war he wrote a book entitled Great Mistakes of the War , which was published in 1949 .
Baldwin says the greatest mistake made was the unconditional surrender policy of Roosevelt .
He states that the policy “ probably discouraged the opposition to Hitler ” and adds that it “ probably lengthened the war , cost us lives and helped to lead to the present abortive peace . ”
Baldwin then points out that it also had a detrimental effect in the war against Japan .
The Japanese had indicated they were willing to surrender if the unconditional surrender policy was changed so as to allow them to keep their Emperor but President Roosevelt ignored the offer in January of 1945 .
After Roosevelt ’s death , President Truman stated he was going to continue the unconditional surrender policy and rejected the offer in July , 1945 .
The war continued and Truman ordered the atomic bombs to be dropped in August of 1945 and the surrender followed in September .
The Japanese were allowed to keep their Emperor after the war , and so in the end , the unconditional surrender policy was dropped as to Japan , but only after they were bombed with two atomic bombs .
( See The Decision to Drop the Atomic Bomb by Dennis D. Wainstock and The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb by Gar Alperovitz . )
My argument is that Roosevelt ’s unconditional surrender policy was designed to stop the resistance movement because Roosevelt did not want an early end to the war .
He wanted a new chance to create a world organization , which he may have actually believed would end all war for the future .
President Wilson had made this promise with the creation of the League of Nations .
Roosevelt ’s plan was to bring all nations under the cover of the United Nations with America and the Soviet Union as the remaining two super powers who would be virtually in control of this new world organization .
Roosevelt had been part of the Woodrow Wilson administration and personally witnessed the worldwide adulation of President Wilson immediately after World War I when he came to Europe .
Roosevelt saw the admiring mobs of people who lined the streets in France and Italy to cheer Wilson and the newspaper reports stated that thousands of people lined the railroad tracks at night just to watch Wilson ’s train go by .
Wilson was considered by millions of people as the greatest man in the world at that time because it was perceived that he brought peace to the world and had saved Europe .
His vision for the League of Nations was considered by many as the hope of the future throughout the world to stop all war forever .
( See Paris 1919 : Six Months that Changed the World by Margaret MacMillan . )
Roosevelt made 800 speeches in his vice presidential campaign in 1920 praising the League of Nations .
Roosevelt felt that America ’s entry into World War II would give him a chance to succeed where his mentor and idol , Woodrow Wilson , had failed when the American Senate failed to approve the Versailles Treaty which contained the provision creating the League of Nations .
In August of 1941 , Roosevelt met with Churchill prior to Pearl Harbor and brought up the United Nations idea to which Churchill objected .
Nevertheless , Churchill went along with it because he needed America in the war .
Stalin also objected to the United Nations idea and both he and Churchill felt that the postwar settlement should have separate spheres of influence for each victor rather than a world organization to which the countries might lose their sovereignty and also lose control of their special goals .
The best account of Roosevelt and the United Nations is thoroughly covered in the book entitled FDR and the Creation of the U.N. by Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley published by the Yale University Press in 1997 .
Both authors are admirers of Roosevelt and of his accomplishment in creating the United Nations .
A brief summary of the main points and several excerpts will tell that story .
“ On November 10 , 1939 , Pope Pius XII proclaimed the need to establish ‘ a stable international organization ’ after the war .
In a private response of December 23 , President Roosevelt voiced his belief that , while no spiritual or civic leader could now define a specific structure for the future , ‘ the time for that will surely come ’ ; meanwhile , the United States would ‘ encourage a closer association between those in every part of the world – those in religion and those in government – who have a common purpose . ’ “
The authors then point out that extensive planning began to take place by others in regard to the postwar settlement :
“ Into this planning vacuum stepped the private Council on Foreign Relations with an offer to study postwar issues secretly and make its deliberations available to the State Department .
The council was a Northeastern seaboard phenomenon , an elitist mix of prominent New York bankers and lawyers with European interests and prominent academics and intellectuals , many of whom had served as advisers to Woodrow Wilson at the Paris peace conference .
The businessmen provided the money , while the scholars furnished most of the intellectual leadership .
The council operated mainly through off - the - record conferences , study groups , and small dinners confined to members , who were addressed by foreign or American statesmen .
It published Foreign Affairs , a scholarly quarterly that had become the leading American journal of its kind .
In an age when fewer than one thousand Americans could claim a journeyman ’s competence , or even a sustained interest , in foreign affairs , the Council on Foreign Relations was a rare island of influence and expertise in the body politic . ”
In less than one month after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 and followed immediately by the declaration of war by Congress , Roosevelt began forming the United Nations into a specific entity :
“ On January 1 , 1942 , the Soviet and Chinese ambassadors in Washington joined with Roosevelt and Churchill ( who had arrived at the White House in late December ) in signing the Declaration by United Nations .
The following day , representatives of twenty - two other nations at war with the Axis powers added their signatures to the document , which created a wartime alliance of states who promised to wage war with all of their resources and not sign a separate peace .
The president apparently thought up the name ‘ United Nations ’ and secured the Prime Minister ’s approval by bursting into his bedroom at the White House while the doughty Britain was taking a bath . ”
Roosevelt felt that Wilson had been partly to blame for the failure of the Senate to authorize the signing of the Versailles Treaty , thereby causing America not to join the League of Nations .
Roosevelt felt that he could be more flexible if he only had a war which would give him an opportunity to succeed where Wilson had failed .
Hoopes and Brinkley give a quick historical review as follows :
“ The Senate ’s rejection of the League of Nations treaty on March 19 , 1920 , was a result of many factors , of which perhaps the most basic was the enduring fear and contempt for Europe ’s continual intrigues and wars .
As most Americans saw it , they had sent their young men to France in 1917 to fight and die for a worthy cause – to make the world safe for democracy . ”
But they had recoiled in disgust and disbelief at the spectacle of greed displayed by the European victors and embodied in the vengeful Treaty of Versailles .
More direct and immediate reasons for the Senate ’s rejection of the League were the personal bitterness between President Wilson and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge ( R- Massachusetts ) , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , and the misplaced loyalty of the Democratic Senators to their party leader in the White House .
The primary cause of failure , however , was the absolute rigidity rooted in moral and intellectual arrogance , of Woodrow Wilson . ”
The authors point out that Roosevelt was much more flexible and willing to compromise in order to create the United Nations .
After America entered the war there was a great deal of activity in trying to help Roosevelt create the United Nations .
Hoopes and Brinkley state the following :
“ John Foster Dulles apparently felt that the Shotwell group was too secular , for he formed the Commission to Study the Bases of a Just and Durable Peace , under the auspices of the Federal Council of Churches .
In one of many speeches , he declared , ‘ the sovereignty system is no longer consonant with either peace or justice , ’ and said that he was ‘ rather appalled ’ at the lack of any agreed peace aims ‘ to educate and crystalize public opinion . ’
Yet he too offered no specific remedies .
In a long editorial in Life magazine entitled ‘ The American Century , ’ publisher Henry Luce noted the ‘ golden opportunity ’ for world leadership that the United States had passed up in 1919 , and called on the American people to help Roosevelt succeed where Wilson had failed .
It was now the time , Luce wrote , to accept ‘ our duty and our opportunity as the most powerful and vital nation in the world . ’ “
Hoopes and Brinkley go on to describe Roosevelt ’s immediate public endorsement of the United Nations in his State of the Union address as follows :
“ The President ’s State of the Union address on January 6 , 1942 – just one month after the attack on Pearl Harbor – was praised by George Orwell on BBC radio as a ‘ complete and uncompromising break . . . with isolationism .’
Roosevelt said , ‘ the mood of quiet grim resolution which here prevails bodes ill for those who conspired and collaborated to murder world peace .
The mood is stronger than any mere desire for revenge .
It expresses the will of the American people to make very certain that the world will never so suffer again .
He referred to the signing of the Declaration by the United Nations just six days before , and defined the primary objective of that act to be ‘ the consolidation of the United Nations ’ total war effort against our common enemies . ’
His focus was entirely on the war effort .
But if the Administration had decided that the public disclosure of postwar plans were dangerously premature , such inhibitions did not apply to the press and private sector .
Throughout 1942 , there was a steady procession of proposals for shaping the new world and educating the American people .
The Commission to Study the Organization of Peace , whose president , Columbia professor James T. Shotwell , was an occasional adviser to the State Department planning effort , accepted the need for an ‘ Anglo – American directorate ’ to run the world in the immediate postwar period . . .
On March 5 , 1942 , the Commission to Study the Bases of a Just and Durable Peace , headed by John Foster Dulles , proposed a far more radical solution .
It called specifically for a world government complete with a parliament , an international court , and appropriate agencies .
The world government would have the power to regulate international trade , settle disputes between member nations , and control all military forces , except those needed to maintain domestic order … ”
“ A more convincing , more sophisticated argument for realpolitik was Walter Lippmann ’s 1943 best - seller , U.S. Foreign Policy : Shield of the Republic , a brilliant essay designed to counter the idealistic one - world internationalism of which Wendell Willkie was the leading purveyor .
It sold nearly one half million copies .
Lippmann , a crusading editor who had helped Woodrow Wilson prepare his peace program , had been disillusioned by the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations , but retained the conviction that American leadership in world affairs was an absolute prerequisite of stability and peace .
He thought Willkie ’s thesis was founded on sand and that its corollary – that the United States must undertake to police the world – was a dangerous doctrine .
Lippmann argued that all nations must balance their commitments with their resources and should avoid being overextended .
Lippmann ’s formula for peace was no new League of Nations but a basic alliance of the United States , Britain and Russia .
No other nations were serious factors in the world power equation .
China and France were not great powers .
Only Britain and Russia were strong enough to threaten U.S. security , but given America ’s close ties to Britain , there was no risk from that quarter .
The only real danger was a falling out with Russia , but peace and stability required that this be avoided at all costs , for an Anglo - American alliance against Russia would set the stage ‘ inexorably ’ for a third world war . ”
Hoopes and Brinkley summarize the negotiations between Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin , pointing out that Roosevelt suggested the Big Four World Policeman would be America , Great Britain , Russia and China and then there would be seven representatives of regional organizations .
However , Roosevelt privately stated to his key advisers that Soviet Russia and America would be the two remaining super powers and would be actually in charge of the organization .
The authors then state :
“ Also , he did not believe that Stalin would join an all – embracing international organization without the protection of an absolute veto power .
. .
While America ’s postwar planners were thinking in terms of some synthesis of regional and global organization to replace the League of Nations , the British Prime Minister was thinking of authoritative regional arrangements without a global nexus , and his focus was on Europe .
He was dismissive of China , and uneasy at the idea of sharing responsibility for the future of Western Europe with the Soviet Union .
In a note to Eden of October 12 , 1942 , Churchill wrote , ‘ I must admit that my thoughts rest primarily in Europe – the revival of the glory of Europe , the parent continent of the modern nations and of civilization . ’
It would be a ‘ measureless disaster if Russian barbarism overlaid the culture and independence ’ of these ancient states .
‘ We certainly do not want to be shut up with the Russians and the Chinese ’ in Europe .
Moreover ‘ I cannot regard the Chungking Government as representing a great world power . ’ “
The authors describe Roosevelt ’s opinion regarding the necessity of having Stalin ’s cooperation for creating and operating the United Nations as follows :
“ Much depended on Stalin , for the Soviet Union would be the only first - rate military power on the continents of Europe and Asia after the war .
If the dictator chose cooperation , the foundations of a peaceful society would be laid with confidence ; if he chose another course , the Western allies would be ‘ driven back on a balance of power system . ’ “
The authors also cover the importance of the Yalta Conference in regard to the creation of the United Nations :
“ Calling the Yalta Conference a turning point – ‘ I hope in our history and therefore in the history of the world ’ – FDR said that whether it could bring forth lasting results ‘ lies to a great extent in your hands . ’
The Senate and the American people would soon face ‘ a great decision that will determine the fate of the United States – and of the world – for generations to come . ’
Everyone should understand there was no middle ground .
‘ We shall have to take responsibility for world collaboration , or we should have to bear the responsibility for another world conflict . ’
The Yalta agreements ‘ ought ’ to spell the end of unilateral actions , exclusive alliances , spheres of influence , and balances of power that ‘ have been tried for centuries – and have always failed . ’
It was time to substitute ‘ a universal organization , ’ and the President was confident that Congress and the American people would accept the Yalta agreements as laying the foundations of ‘ a permanent structure of peace . . .’ ” The agreement on Poland was entirely dependant on Stalin ’s word , for there was no practical way to confront Russian power in Eastern Europe .
In part , this stance was dictated by the basic need for Russian military cooperation to finish the war against Germany and then join the war against Japan ; in larger part it reflected FDR ’s judgment that establishing the United Nations organization was the overarching strategic goal , the absolute first priority .
He faced , as he viewed it , a delicate problem of balance .
To prevent a U.S. reversion to isolationism after the war , U.S. participation in the new world organization was the sine qua non , but the United Nations could not be brought into being without genuine Russian cooperation , and that depended on Western accommodation to unpalatable manifestations of the Soviet Communist system in Eastern Europe . ”

The authors then point out that on April 6 , 1945 the president authorized Archibald MacLeish to prepare the speech he intended to make at the opening session of the San Francisco conference .
There had been some speculation that he might even resign his position as president in order to be leader of the United Nations .
However , on April 12 , he died and the authors state :
“ To internationalists , the fallen leader promptly became a martyr and symbol of their cause .
Intoned the New Republic , ‘ Franklin Roosevelt at rest at Hyde Park is a more powerful force for America ’s participation in the world organization than was President Roosevelt in the White House . ”
If Roosevelt ’s primary aim in World War II was to create the United Nations and thereby bring world peace forever ( in his own mind ) , and that he considered the cooperation of Stalin and the Soviet Union as the essential piece to that puzzle , this helps explain why Roosevelt was so compromising with Stalin throughout the war .
It also helps explain why he let Harry Hopkins live in the White House and be his closest adviser .
The author , George Victor , in his preface , addresses the fact that Hopkins was probably a Communist agent and then he states “ there are speculations that Hopkins influenced U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union in 1941 , but no evidence of it . ”
He then defends Hopkins by saying that Hopkins never did anything without the express direction of Roosevelt , which may defend Hopkins , but it certainly does not defend Roosevelt .
Roosevelt surely must have been aware of the intercepted cables which show that Hopkins was an agent of the Soviets .
The cables called “ The Venona Cables ” were those communications between Soviet spies in America that were intercepted by American intelligence forces which were available to Roosevelt .
These “ Venona Cables ” were released to the public in 1995 and in a sensational book entitled The Venona Secrets : Exposing Soviet Espionage and America ’s Traitors by Herbert Romerstein and Eric Breindel they show the fact that Harry Hopkins was a Soviet agent , being number 19 .
They point out that the cables revealed that the Soviets were ordering tons of uranium in March of 1943 and that Major George R. Jordan objected to sending the uranium since he and General Groves , head of the Manhattan project , were concerned about Soviet espionage .
Major Jordan testified that he objected to sending the uranium but that “ Harry Hopkins had told him on the phone to expedite the shipments . ”
Major Jordan later wrote a book claiming that Hopkins had helped the Soviets against the interests of the United States .
In conclusion of my argument , I take issue that the end justified the means , and therefore disagree with Victor on this point .
Roosevelt ’s personal ambitions for greatness , obtaining worldwide adulation , and his desire to create the United Nations could hardly be considered ends that justified the means he employed .
Getting back to Victor ’s book , he states in his last chapter entitled “ History and the Unthinkable ” that the disaster in Pearl Harbor “ needs to be remembered , not for anything about Japanese treachery or U.S. blunders .
Its main lessons are about sacrifice , deception and political considerations as common features of military planning . ”
He points out that other presidents have caused similar sacrifices of the lives of soldiers and sailors , as well as civilians , with similar acts of deception for political considerations .
He states :
“ Polk , Lincoln and McKinley confronted dilemmas between what they considered important U.S. interests and popular opposition to war .
Lincoln ’s problem was extreme ; for years , conflict over slavery had been tearing the nation apart .
As Lincoln saw it , the secession and the likelihood of further splitting threatened the nation ’s existence .
‘ However , there was one way out , ’ according to historian Richard Hofstadter , ‘ the Confederates themselves might bring matters to a head by attacking Sumter . . . .
It was precisely such an attack that Lincoln ’s strategy brought about . ’
Hofstadter added that ‘ the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor did for [ Roosevelt ] what the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter had done for Lincoln . ’ ”
Victor carefully analyses the situation with Abraham Lincoln as being comparable to Roosevelt in starting their respective wars :
“ On becoming president in 1861 , Abraham Lincoln ’s highest priority was preserving the Union .
To end the secession , he was willing to guarantee federal noninterference with slavery .
He therefore pushed a constitutional amendment for noninterference through Congress , and three states quickly ratified it , but the secession continued .
Lincoln was also willing – if necessary for preserving the Union – to fight a war .
But he found his nation – and his own cabinet – against such a war .
Even radical abolitionists opposed it .
The Confederacy had taken over most federal installations in its states – installations surrendered on request by their administrators .
Of those remaining in federal hands , Fort Sumter in South Carolina was exposed to attack and running out of supplies .
Lincoln asked his cabinet ’s advice on whether to supply the fort .
With one exception , they opposed it because doing it risked war .
Lincoln then sent the supplies , prompting an attack on the fort which became the incident he used to start the Civil War .
If known at the time , Lincoln ’s deliberate exposure of the fort might have caused serious political repercussions .
Later historical accounts that imputed to him the intention of fostering an incident for war in order to preserve the Union have created little stir .
His towering place in history is undamaged by them and he , too , is viewed as a president with a clear idea of his mission , effective in carrying it out . ”
The author , Victor , also goes into some detail in regard to President Polk starting the Mexican War :
“ On becoming president in 1845 , James Polk told his cabinet that California would be annexed .
( His predecessors had offered to buy California , but Mexico had refused to sell . )
To his consul in California , Polk suggested fomenting a revolution and promised U.S. support for residents who rose against Mexico .
A tiny uprising under Capt .
John Fremont had no effect on California ’s status .
Polk then sent an army to the Rio Grande .
History books describe that area as U.S. territory , Texas territory , or land in dispute between the United States and Mexico .
The area was , however , recognized by a U.S. treaty as within Mexico ’s borders .
As Polk expected , Mexico attacked the army , slaughtering a troop .
On sending the army , Polk wrote , in advance , a request to Congress for a declaration of war based on the incident he expected .
After it happened , he submitted his request , claiming that Mexican troops ‘ had passed the boundary of the United States . . . invaded our territory and shed American blood upon American soil . . . .
War exists notwithstanding all our efforts to avoid it . ’
But Polk , not Mexico , had sought the war .
Congress then declared war on Mexico and by an easy victory , Polk acquired the southwest for his nation . ”
Victor points out that President McKinley sent the battleship Maine into the harbor of Havana , which was Spanish territory , as a provocation to the Spanish and when the ship exploded from within it killed 260 U.S. sailors .
The false propaganda was that the Spanish caused it , thus giving McKinley an excuse to go to war and to acquire from Spain America ’s first empire .
McKinley was strongly supported in his efforts to get into the war by none other than the “ Megaphone of Mars , ” Teddy Roosevelt , who was serving as the Assistant Navy Secretary .
Roosevelt declared “ The Maine was sunk by an act of dirty treachery on the part of the Spaniards . ”
The new battle cry for the war was now “ Remember the Maine . ”
The author expresses no moral judgment against these presidents for starting their respective wars and states that :
“ Deception is as old as the history of war .
According to the classic work The Art of War by Sun - tzu ‘ All warfare is based on deception . ’
It is , of course , practiced on enemies , but deception is also used on subordinates .
A common example is a suicide attack .
In order to have troops carry it out officers may hide the attack ’s hopelessness from them .
They may even mislead troops to believe that it will succeed . ”
Victor recites the views expressed by General George C. Marshall at the Pearl Harbor hearings before Congress in 1945 –6 , as follows :
“ In my view , General Marshall was indeed an outstanding chief of staff , upright , honorable , and incorruptible – as much so as his position permitted .
Testifying to various tribunals investigating the Pearl Harbor disaster , other military officers vigorously denied that they had withheld vital information from field commanders .
The denials were false .
Marshall was the exception ; he testified to a congressional committee that withholding vital information from commanders was routine practice .
World War II documents show not only withholding of information from field commanders , but also distortion of it to mislead them . ”
The author concludes this extremely disturbing book with the following two paragraphs :
“ Despite the history of war , the idea that Roosevelt withheld warnings from Kimmel and Short for the purpose of getting the United States openly into the European war is still unthinkable to many people , but to fewer and fewer as the years pass .
As has happened over time with other unthinkable acts , the repugnance aroused by the idea of using the Pacific Fleet as a lure will probably continue to fade .
Polk ’s exposure of an army , Lincoln ’s exposure of a fort , and McKinely ’s exposure of a battleship are more or less accepted .
In the Philippines , Midway , Wake , Guam , Samoa , and in other outlying islands , U.S. forces were exposed to Japanese attack , and that is also more or less accepted .
The Pearl Harbor disaster was different from losses of the Philippines and other Pacific islands because it shattered America ’s confidence , arousing massive fear , a crisis of trust in the nation ’s leaders , and an outcry for scapegoats .
The nation seized on the administration ’s explanation of betrayal by Japan and by Kimmel and Short , and the disaster unified the nation to fight World War II with the slogan ‘ Remember Pearl Harbor ! ’
The explanation became a major national myth , which has substantially withstood the unearthing of secret alliances , war strategies , and warnings received in Washington . ”
In the preface the author states : “ I am not the first admirer of Roosevelt to present him in Machiavellian terms . ”
Victor goes on to quote an admiring biographer of Roosevelt , James MacGregor Burns , who stated : “ It was not strange that [ Roosevelt ] should follow Machiavelli ’s advice . . . for this had long been the first lesson for politicians . ”
Victor ’s final assessment is that :
“ History has recorded many , many rulers ’ manipulations of their people into war without their subordinates blowing the whistle .
Presidents James Polk , Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson did it before Roosevelt ; and others have done it after him . . . .
Presidents who succeeded Roosevelt also ordered sacrifices , but toward smaller and sometime meaner ends .
Here Roosevelt ’s manipulations and the sacrifices he ordered are compared to those of Polk , Lincoln , McKinley and Wilson , all of whom were implementing ends considered noble in the light of traditional values . ”

The author , George Victor , mentions the deceit of President Wilson in getting us into World War I but provides no details .
However , you can find this in Charles Tansil ’s excellent book entitled America Goes to War.
Justice Brandeis , who was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by Wilson , rendered his opinion to President Wilson that the alleged sinking of the French cross - channel passenger ship , the S.S. Sussex , by a German submarine in the English Channel with the loss of lives of the U.S. citizens justified a declaration of war against Germany by the United States .
The ship was painted all black and the usual insignia to show it was not a military ship were missing .
The German commander of the submarine wrote that he took the ship to be a military ship rather than a passenger ship .
Wilson relied on this legal opinion of Justice Brandeis , who was Wilson ’s most influential adviser along with Col .
House , and the president addressed both houses of Congress on April 2 , 1917 using the sinking of Sussex and the loss of American lives as a reason to declare war on April 7 , 1917 .
It was only after America was committed to the war that the truth came out , which apparently was not considered material by the news media , so the public never was fully informed .
TheSussex was not sunk and no American lives were lost .
The ship was torpedoed by the Germans but made it safely to the harbor at Boulogne where it was hidden for some period of time .
Victor mentions that subsequent presidents to Roosevelt have also deceitfully taken America into wars but provides no names .
He could have cited President Lyndon Johnson and his lies about the Gulf of Tonkin incident to get Congress to authorize him to retaliate to get America into the Viet Nam War .
He could also have mentioned our current president and the lies about weapons of mass destruction to get us into the war with Iraq .
In both cases Congress accepted the lies of the president and unconstitutionally delegated the war making power to the president rather than declaring war itself , as the Constitution requires .
I agree that Victor has accurately described the deceitful conduct of the presidents he cites ( see the chapters “ Lincoln and the First Shot ” and “ Roosevelt and the First Shot ” in my book A Century of War ) but I strongly disagree with his conclusion that the American people have knowingly condoned the deceitful activity of the presidents
Victor mentions because our history books do not contain this information , it is not taught in the schools and universities and it is not recited by the news media .
You have to have independent researchers like Victor to find and disclose most of this information .
I wonder if Victor ’s book will be taught or read at West Point , Annapolis or the Air Force Academy .
After finishing it , the famous lines from Tennyson ’s poem The Charge of the Light Brigade came to mind :
“ Theirs not to make reply , Theirs not to reason why , Theirs but to do and die .
Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred . ”

Yesterday the California Secretary of State released the reports of three source code study teams that analyzed the source code of e-voting systems from Diebold , Hart InterCivic , and Sequoia .
All three reports found many serious vulnerabilities .
It seems likely that computer viruses could be constructed that could infect any of the three systems , spread between voting machines , and steal votes on the infected machines .
All three systems use central tabulators ( machines at election headquarters that accumulate ballots and report election results ) that can be penetrated without great effort .
It ’s hard to convey the magnitude of the problems in a short blog post .
You really have read through the reports – the shortest one is 78 pages – to appreciate the sheer volume and diversity of severe vulnerabilities .
It is interesting ( at least to me as a computer security guy ) to see how often the three companies made similar mistakes .
They misuse cryptography in the same ways : using fixed unchangeable keys , using ciphers in ECB mode , using a cyclic redundancy code for data integrity , and so on .
Their central tabulators use poorly protected database software .
Their code suffers from buffer overflows , integer overflow errors , and format string vulnerabilities .
They store votes in a way that compromises the secret ballot .
Some of these are problems that the vendors claimed to have fixed years ago .
For example , Diebold claimed ( p. 11 ) in 2003 that its use of hard - coded passwords was “ resolved in subsequent versions of the software ” .
Yet the current version still uses at least two hard - coded passwords – one is “ diebold ” ( report , p. 46 ) and another is the eight - byte sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 ( report , p. 45 ) .
Similarly , Diebold in 2003 ridiculed ( p. 6 ) the idea that their software could suffer from buffer overflows : “ Unlike a Web server or other Internet enabled applications , the code is not vulnerable to most ‘ buffer overflow attacks ’ to which the authors [ Kohno et al. ] refer .
This form of attack is almost entirely inapplicable to our application .
In the limited number of cases in which it would apply , we have taken the steps necessary to ensure correctness . ”
Yet the California source code study found several buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Diebold ’s systems ( e.g. , issues 5.1.6 , 5.2.3 ( “ multiple buffer overflows ” ) , and 5.2.18 in the report ) .
As far as I can tell , major news outlets have n’t taken much notice of these reports .
That in itself may be the most eloquent commentary on the state of e-voting : reports of huge security holes in e-voting systems are barely even newsworthy any more .
Behold the spineless Democratic Party .
On Iraq , no deadlines .
On trade , no enforceable worker protections .
Now , on oil industry price gouging , collapse .
In the face of withering pressure from the oil industry , the Democrats in the House , led by Congressman Bart Stupak ( D - Michigan ) , have reportedly castrated their own legislation .
Stupak 's original bill -- HR 1252 - - would make it unlawful to sell crude oil , gasoline , natural gas , or petroleum distillates at a price that " is unconscionably excessive " or " indicates the seller is taking unfair advantage unusual market conditions ( whether real or perceived ) or the circumstances of an emergency to increase prices unreasonably . "
The law would be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) .
But according to a report by Darren Goode in Congress Daily AM , late last night , Stupak " added a trigger to his bill allowing the FTC to go after price gougers only during presidentially - declared energy emergencies . "
In other words -- almost never .
Tyson Slocum of Public Citizen 's Congress Watch called the move " pretty unfortunate . "
Slocum said that Stupak 's original bill would have given the FTC long needed powers to go after oil companies in situations like the one the country is facing today - - skyrocketing gasoline prices .
" There is no question that the record high gasoline prices we are seeing today amount to just a transfer of wealth , " Slocum said .
" Up until this point , the FTC has not moved , because the antitrust laws on the books are so weak .
There is no price gouging law currently on the books . "
Stupak and more than 100 House members said they wanted to put that law on the books .
But now , it looks like the Democrats have once again caved to the dominant corporate powers that be .
The House will vote on the bill later today .
Slocum said that Public Citizen was strongly in favor of the original Stupak bill .
But if the bill is going to be similar to a bill introduced by Senator Maria Cantwell ( D - Washington ) - - only enforceable in times of energy emergencies -- Public Citizen would not fight for it .
" This shows the oil industry still holds sway over the Democratic Party , " Slocum said .
" Things are definitely different , but not that much different .
Are you going to see the Democrats taking big swings at Big Oil ?
No . "
Stupak 's office did not return calls seeking comment .
Slocum said that some environmental groups want to see higher gasoline prices so that Americans drive less -- like in Europe .
" But in Europe , the gasoline prices are higher because of taxes , " Slocum said .
" And the taxes are used to fund mass transit .
Here , the money goes straight to the oil companies .
It 's just a transfer of wealth . "

In the coming days , Bernard B. Kerik will begin work as a groundskeeper , or maybe a housing orderly , at a starting salary of 12 cents an hour .
His blog , where he defended his blemished record and discussed finding strength in Rocky movies , will go dark .
His exercise regimen , which helped shape his fireplug physique , will be limited to the hours between dinner and bedtime .
Mr. Kerik , the former police commissioner of New York , surrendered at Cumberland Federal Correctional Institutional in Cumberland , Md. , at 1:45 p.m. on Monday , said Felicia Ponce , a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons .
Now officially registered as Inmate 84888-054 , Mr. Kerik will serve his four - year prison term in the facility ’s minimum - security wing , which houses more than 450 other inmates , Ms. Ponce said .
He pleaded guilty last year to eight felony charges , including tax fraud and lying to White House officials .
Mr. Kerik ’s days will most likely look much like those of most federal inmates , she said .
He will rise around 6 a.m. and eat breakfast at 6:30 .
After a medical and psychological evaluation , he will begin work at a job prison officials will assign him — salaries start at 12 cents an hour and rise to 40 cents .
The money will be deposited in his commissary account to be spent on snacks , stamps or personal hygiene items .

When it comes to bringing things for college , a lot of people make the mistake of packing stuff they do n’t need , or forgetting to pack stuff they will need .
Everyone knows that you need to take clothes , sheets , a micro-fridge , and a computer .
However , I recently came across an article about 8 overlooked items college students should bring .
I ’ve come up with my own , expanded list of less - common , often forgotten , items that you should take to college .
They will certainly prove to be quite useful .
1. Ear plugs
I think I would have been lost had I not gotten ear plugs my freshman year .
My roommate said in the summer that he “ snored occasionally ” but that it “ was n’t a big deal . ”
He should have told me that his snoring could wake the dead .
For the first few weeks I could n’t sleep hardly at all without being woken up by my roommate ’s obnoxious snoring .
Luckily , my father sent me some industrial strength earplugs .
Once I started using those , I slept like a baby .
It ’s also good to have earplugs , because sometimes students can be quite rambunctious in the hallways .
You may have the unfortunate luck of having to live below someone who ’s obsessed with using his or her subwoofer at all hours of the night .
2 . Flip flops or any type of shower shoe
When you go to college , you may be unfortunate enough to have to share a bathroom with many more people than you ever thought you would .
While some students live in dorms with private bathrooms , a vast majority of students either have hall bathrooms , or otherwise share a bathroom with several other rooms .
The result of this is that it can be pretty disgusting to have to take a shower ( especially in male bathrooms ) .
Having shower shoes , flip - flops , or any sort of covering for your feet is a must .
You do n’t want to have to walk barefoot down to the bathroom … and you do n’t want to stand in that shower that oh - so - many people have used before you .
3. Carrying case for toiletries
This goes along with the preparation for college showers .
Some students may be relatively far from the bathroom ( at the other end of the hall , for example ) .
In this unfortunate circumstance , having a tote to bring your shampoo , soap , conditioner , toothpaste , etc with you can be quite helpful .
Also , it ensures that you do n’t have to leave your belongings in the bathroom and risk the chance of someone else using them .
4 . Plugs , power strips , and adaptors oh my
It never hurts to bring a lot of plugs and adaptors to college .
When I first arrived , I had my power strip for my computer all nice and ready .
However , much to my chagrin , there were no three - pronged outlets to be found .
Once again , I had to have my father send me an adaptor , and I had to go almost a week without a computer ( in college , a week without a computer or iPod can feel like an eternity ) .
Also , luckily my roommates brought power strips because we needed to have our TV , Playstation 2 , and Xbox hooked up .
We undoubtedly violated several fire codes with our entertainment center , but at least we had enough plugs .
So , remember , bring power strips , plugs , extension cords , adaptors , and any other type of electricity outlet thing you may need .
You ’ll be happy you did .
5. Cleaning supplies
True , one could go to the store and simply buy cleaning supplies .
However , why not take them from home , or have your parents buy them for you instead ?
Cleaning supplies are too often forgotten in college .
Getting the basics to clean windows , tables , desks , and chairs is a must .
If you have your own bathroom that is n’t cleaned for you on a weekly basis , then you should definitely get bathroom - cleaning supplies .
Women are generally much better about keeping their dorm rooms clean than men are .
However , a bit of personal advice for the young college men out there : if you have a nice clean room , I guarantee she ’ll be 100 times more likely to actually enter it .
Too many women have horror stories of the cleanliness atrocities they ’ve observed in male dorm rooms , do n’t add another story .
6. Duct Tape
Duct Tape is a fantastic all - purpose solution to many of the problems college students encounter in dorm rooms .
It can help keep unwanted cords out of the way , and can fix many things that may become broken .
It can help keep posters up on the wall ( although it will often stick to the poster itself , so watch out for potential rips ) .
In college , one encounters a variety of problems ; duct tape can be a viable solution to many .
7. Hammer
Most universities will not allow their students to put holes in the dorm room walls .
This does little to stop students from actually doing it though .
The fact remains that the best way to put pictures with frames , huge posters , and many other items on the wall involves using nails .
This requires the possession of a hammer .
Hammers can also be used for a variety of other handy needs .
Having a hammer in college can be extremely helpful .
College students like to build things , fix things ( it saves money ) , and generally just mess with stuff .
Having a screwdriver set is essential in college .
Not only if you are planning to loft your bed , or take it apart , build some sort of cabinet system , or a TV entertainment center .
Screwdrivers can also come in handy in a variety of other situations .
One example is when my roommates and I had the most unfortunate disaster of our PS2 going on the fritz .
We determined ( though extensive internet research ) that the lens was dirty .
Long story short , we ended up having to go throughout the entire building to find a screwdriver to use to open up the CD tray and subsequently clean the lens .
We could have saved quite a bit of time if one of us had thought of bringing a screwdriver with us to college .
9. Stapler
There will be countless times that you will find yourself needing a stapler .
If you think you are going to go through college without ever writing a paper that is more than one page long , then you may be in for a rude awakening .
The amount of college students who do n’t have staplers is staggering .
Many students are forced to walk around , wasting precious hours that could be spent playing an exciting video game , partying , or just hanging with friends , trying to find a stapler to use for their long research paper .
I made the unfortunate mistake of going my freshman year without a stapler .
Not only did I procrastinate with papers , but I was also forced to run around frantically half an hour before the paper was due trying to find someone with a stapler .
Take a page out of Milton ’s book , and bring that stapler .
10 .
Door hangers / Hooks with adhesive backing / Something to hang stuff on
In college , there never seems to be enough places to hang things .
Wet towels often end up on the floor ( disgusting ) , coats end up strewn over beds , belts end up hanging from the most odd places , and more .
Having extra hangers is definitely an advantage .
The best types of hangers to use are the ones that you put on the top of your door .
They are metal and can be obtained at any department / superstore .
Hangers with adhesive backing are also fantastic because you can put them on walls .
It ’s surprising how much cleaner a college dorm room can be when students have places to hang everything .
There are many other hangers that you could use .
The point is , bring something extra to hang stuff on , you wo n’t regret it .
11 . Storage containers / Crates
There never seems to be enough room for all your stuff in college .
Dorm rooms are always too small , and students always seem to have too many possessions .
Bringing storage containers or crates can create an elegant solution to two prevalent college dorm room issues ; space and organization .
Storage containers that either are stacked , or can be placed under beds or in closets can create space where there was none previously .
Having specific containers for things is also a great way to organize .
When you are able to actually see the floor in your dorm room , you ’ll be happy you brought some extra storage containers .
12 . Bottle opener
Countless college students are stranded trying to find beers with twist off tops .
Most people agree beer tastes better in bottles than it does in cans .
So , having a bottle opener in college can be a great asset .
It may even make you popular on the floor .
Who does n’t want to be known as “ the guy ( or girl ) with the bottle opener ” ?
Get one of the nice key chain bottle openers if you can .
Trust me , the alternative usually involves banging the bottle on desks and hurting your hand trying to twist the cap off .
13 . USB Flash Drive
I ca n’t even begin to truly explain how useful flash drives are in college .
Chances are that during your college experience , you may have to run a paper to the library or somewhere else to print it .
You may also have to do a PowerPoint presentation .
Friends may want some pictures from your digital camera .
Or you may just want to share some great music with one of the people in your room or on your floor .
Flash drives are much faster than trying to e-mail huge files .
They are also much quicker than trying to burn countless CDs full of important data .
My freshman year , I was constantly borrowing people ’s flash drives to transfer pictures , papers , and loads of other files .
14 . Pliers
When the hammer wo n’t work .
If screwdrivers are proving to be useless , then you may just want some pliers .
Pliers , like many other items on this list , have many , many uses .
You never know when you may need to bend something metal , clamp something together , or remove something from something else .
It is important to note that you can use pliers in lieu of a bottle opener ( although it is a bit more difficult ) .
15 . Extra sheets
Too many college students bring themselves only one set of sheets .
When in college , you may think that you ’ll be responsible , and do all your washing .
Unfortunately , college students rarely make time to do their laundry immediately , so having a change of sheets can be immensely beneficial .
Also , you never know when sheets may need to be changed in an emergency .
Who knows if you could end up with the roommate who shows you how much partying he or she has been doing by projectile vomiting all over your nice clean sheets .
True , it ’s a graphic description , but a very real problem .
You ’ll be quite pleased you have a solution to it , although I bet you ’ll still be annoyed with your roommate .
16 . Vitamins
College students do n’t eat very well at all .
Unfortunately , a diet consisting of pizza and beer does not contain all the vitamins that humans need .
Neither do Ramen noodles .
The best solution to this nutritional problem is having a great multiple vitamin to take every day .
Women should also consider taking calcium and iron tablets .
You may find that you ’ll be much more energized for class .
Also , when the unfortunate time of the year arrives when everyone in the dorms seems to get sick , you may be able to avoid it .
I ’m no doctor , but I ’ve noticed that when I ’m taking vitamins regularly , my roommates get sick and I remain healthy as can be .
17 . Air fresheners
It does n’t matter if it is a spray , or one of those plug in air fresheners , but you should bring many with you to college .
This is especially important if you have your own bathroom .
I ’ll save the grim details , but needless to say , you may find yourself surprised at some of the smells your roommates can produce .
Not to mention , you may have the unfortunate luck of being stuck across the hall from the “ smelly room . ”
Being prepared can help your smell defense .
You may also get stuck with the smelly roommate .
If that is the case , then you may want to write to your family for re-enforcements .
Maybe if that roommate sees you opening a care package full of Febreze bottles they ’ll get the message .
All joking aside , you want to do whatever you can to avoid being known as the stinky room .
Once again , women are generally much better about this than men .
Trust me guys , girls will enjoy themselves much more if your room does n’t smell like a New Jersey garbage dump .
18 . Microwave
Bringing a micro- fridge is common sense .
Bringing a microwave is often overlooked .
The advantages of having a microwave at your disposal are nearly endless .
With a microwave , the amount of food you are able to cook for yourself increases astronomically .
Not to mention , you can save extra money by staying in and heating up cheap things like soup , Ramen , and any leftovers from the cafeteria ( although college cafeteria food is even worse if it ’s leftovers , so I would n’t suggest eating it too often ) .
Some college students are lucky enough to have microwaves provided for them by the university .
However , if your college does n’t provide you with one , you should definitely bring one .
These items may be less common , but they will be so useful in college you ’d be insane to not take them .
Rather than wasting valuable time trying to find someone else who has the thing you need , you can simply look to your own room .
The only thing you ’ll have to deal with is the casual annoyance of everyone coming to use your stuff .
However , that ’s much better than the alternative .

A true story .
A tragic one .
Why You Should Get Your Own Domain .
My name is Mun .
This post is not exactly my first post .
I started a blog with Blogger ( also known as Blogspot ) in August 2005 .
Everything has been running great there for about 2 years until last week .
On 24 July 2007 , my fitness site suddenly disappeared .
A new owner has claimed the domain name .
Thought that fellow has hijacked my account .
Later , was told that Blogger may have classified my blog as spam blog accidentally .
Once a blog fell into that category , it will be deleted .
So , Blogger has deleted my blog .
It has also released the domain name to others .
Gone were my 520 posts and 1680 comments .
2 years worth of effort went down to the drain within a day .
The feeling is like hitting my head with a 50 - pound dumbbell and the pain goes straight into the flesh and deep into my heart .
I wish that person could see the blood in my tears .
Thinking since Google owns
Blogger , I would be able to escalate this issue to the support team .
Not really .
Blogger has only some standard Web support forms .
I gave it a try anyway .
Later , found Google Blogger support group .
So , I posted a message there , hoping for a solution .
What surprised me the most was that I was not the only victim .
Others were screaming for help too and none of Blogger employees dropped by at the message board to give any explanation .
On the second day , I posted another message at that message board .
Still , no response .
No news .
E-mails from my loyal blog readers started to flow in .
On the third day , many were directed to adult sites when they tried to reach my previous blog address .
My heart sank to the hell .
Received more e-mails showing much concern .
At this juncture , I lost hope on Blogger which I had a strong faith on .
Decided leave my comfort zone .
Asked around about Web hosting service and Word Press .
After doing research for a day , proceed to sign up 1 - year prepaid Web hosting package with Media Temple ( which is well - known to survive in Digg traffic ) and bought a domain name .
Spent about 16 hours consecutively over the weekend learning many things from scratch .
On the fifth day , Google Blogger support teams finally responded .
Not a word of sorry from them , but a thank you e-mail for telling them about their mistake .
They restored my blog .
I got all my published and draft posts .
But , I still lost the Web address since someone else already took it days ago .
I did not want to pursue the matter further .
Damage has been done .
It is more important to move forward .
What else you can expect from Blogger , a free service provider ?
They can be nice to you today , but they can take whatever they give to you the next day .
May be I should be glad that this incident happened earlier .
If it would have happened after five years ( instead of two years ) ever since I started , I probably would have given up for good .
It has been a crazy week for me .
The learning curve of using Word Press is steep .
Fortunately , few friends have been supportive .
Thanks ,
Weng Yee , Iry and Lilian as well as to those who sent e-mails to me .
Not forgetting the loyal readers too .
You all are great .
My passion for fitness stays .
Life goes on .
I will pick up all the shattered pieces and put them into one .
Piece by piece .
Do come back here .
Mun will continue to write .
Help me spread the news .
Tell them about my painful experience and let ’s learn a lesson from this incident .
It is another beginning .
A new one .
A better one .
Be Strong .
Be Fit .
Last updated : Just like the remake of King Kong or Star Wars , you will see the remake of Mun Fitness Blog .
I have hand - picked some of the best posts and update them accordingly to kick - start this new home .
However , I shall continue to come out with new posts to keep the site afresh with new contents .
Someone just pointed to me that Google has actually deleted its own blog in year 2006 .

Yokohama from the Landmark Tower
Yokohama is the third largest town in Japan , only 30 minutes by car or train from Tokyo .
More than 3.27 million people live in Yokohama
Yokohama dates back to the 11th century but it was first when the port was opened in 1859 that the town started to grow .
The port is today the most important in the Tokyo Bay .
The Landmark Tower from which Takashi Sugiura made the panorama is the tallest building in Japan , 296 m / 972 ft .
It is situated in the large shopping area Minato Mirai 21 which also has one of the world 's largest convention centers ,
It includes the roundly shaped Yokohama Grand Intercontinental Hotel , which , you can see when you look down to the left of the Green Ferris wheel
The large Ferris wheel is one of the largest in the world , with a capacity of 480 passengers and a height of 112.5 meters .
On September 1st , 1923 The Great Kanto Earthquake totally destroyed Yokohama .
20,000 dead and and 60,000 houses were destroyed
Still Yokohama had almost completely been rebuilt by 1929 .
Again in 1945 the city was burnt to the ground by the US bombings .
In one air raid on May 29 , 42 percent of the city area was burnt to ashes .
14,157 died , were injured or missing , 79,017 houses were destroyed .

All of this , of course , assumes that the systems are working correctly .
When I first installed Vista on my PC , I configured it to go to sleep after 30 minutes , but it has been unreliable .
Sometimes it fails to go to sleep , and at other times it fails to wake up .
Sometimes I experience the worst of both worlds : the drives and fan are spinning , but the monitor is blank , and I can not get the machine to come back to life without powering it down and turning it back on .

I spent numerous hours trying to fix the problem , including updating the BIOS , installing up - to - date versions of all my device drivers , checking to make sure there were no unnecessary applications running in the background and , of course , scanning for spyware and viruses .
The results were encouraging .
After all that fiddling , the machine went to sleep most nights and woke up most — but not all — mornings .
I then installed Co2 Saver ( co2saver.snap.com ) , a free program for Windows XP and Vista that seems to have solved the problem .
It gives you a simple control panel to specify when to turn off monitors and disk drives and put the machine to sleep .
It also adjusts some hard - to - configure settings .
One option forces the machine to “ Initiate sleep mode if system does n’t sleep automatically . ”
This feature , according to its developer , Lee Hasiuk , defeats Windows attempts to keep a machine awake if it thinks ( correctly or otherwise ) that it is detecting a background task other than mouse or keyboard activity .
Now my machine sleeps and wakes properly almost all the time .
Whatever machine you ’re using , consider having it go into sleep , standby or hibernate after about a half - hour of inactivity .
The shorter the period , the more energy you save .
Graphic - intense screen savers can actually waste power .
Unplug unused external power supplies because they can draw energy even when they ’re not connected to a device .
If you ’re shopping for a new PC , be sure that it meets Energy Star requirements , ideally the ones that go into effect July 20 .
The new standards require that 80 percent of the power consumed is actually used by the PC .
Use an L.C.D. screen instead of an old - fashioned cathode ray tube monitor .
L.C.D.’s are as much as 66 percent more efficient than C.R.T. ’s , according to the Energy Department .

As I sailed into Shadow , a white bird of my desire came and sat upon my right shoulder , and I wrote a note and tied it to its leg and sent it on its way .
The note said , " I am coming , " and it was signed by me .
...
The sun hung low on my left and the winds bellied the sails and propelled me onward .
I cursed once and then laughed .
I was free and I was running , but I had made it this far .
I now had the chance I 'd wanted all along .
A black bird of my desire came and sat on my left shoulder , and I wrote a note and tied it to its leg and sent it off into the west .
It said , " Eric - - I 'll be back , " and it was signed : " Corwin , Lord of Amber . "
A demon wind propelled me east of the sun .

Evan was n't wild about leaving his friends over the summer , but we told him it would be a good experience that he would remember for the rest of his life .
He still looked sulky when he stepped into the beam and disappeared .
Our transfer student was n't due to come across until that afternoon , owing to fluctuations in the Minkowski current , so we had our coffee and lunch in the depot food court .
We watched travellers going through security , being scanned for contraband .
It 's amazing how picky they 've gotten lately ; Evan could n't take his SensePod through and was really upset .
Around two o'clock Philip came through .
He was a very skinny black teenager , wearing a clean white shirt and denim pants .
He had enormous frightened eyes and stared at everything he saw , clutching his small bag with both hands .
My heart went out to him right away .
" You must be Philip , " I said .
" We 're the Myersons .
Welcome to 7A . "
We shook hands .
When Philip smiled the whole room lit up .
" It does n't look any different ! " he proclaimed , sweeping his arms in an all - encompassing circle , and I smiled .
He had clearly never X'ed before .
I had gathered that Philip and his family had limited means back in 17H .
" Things will mostly be the same , " Rita said , " but the little things will jump out at you from time to time . "
I took Philip 's bag .
" Do n't worry , son , " I said , guiding him back towards the parking lot .
" 17H and 7A are pretty compatible .
I think you 're going to like it here . "
" You called me ' son ' , " Philip said softly .
" I did , " I admitted .
Philip smiled brilliantly again .
" I might like it here just fine , " he agreed .
As we loaded the car it hit me : in 17H , the South won the Civil War .
- * -
We put Philip up in Julia 's room .
Julia had chosen to join the Temporal Rangers out of high school , and she was serving her 2nd tour in 45 G .
The expeditionary forces of the United Dimensions were having a harder time than expected .
With the might of seventy - five mostly compatible dimensions arrayed against a single rogue timestream , it had been thought that this would have been a simple operation .
However , the war machine birthed by the alliance between Hitler and Stalin proved unusually resilient , and the war was dragging into its sixth year .
We hung a ribbon on our front door , and a day did n't go by where I did n't pray for her safe return .
We enjoyed learning about each others ' histories .
Philip told us that Martin Luther King had been the first Premier of the Negro League of America , a kind of nation - within - a- nation with limited governing powers .
Strangely , Barry
White had been a senator of that body .
Most things were similar between our dimensions , though , especially the fact that Graham and Folley had collaborated to break the X Barrier , and Wen Zhou in each compatible dimension had turned on the Temporal Beacon simultaneously , allowing X'ing to be possible .
In 17H America was still very much segregated .
Philip talked about how he was trying to apply to the Carver Institute of Technology for Men of Color , but there were only so many positions available so he was n't certain where he would be studying in the fall .
I wished he could stay on with us ; Philip was a great kid with a curiosity about the world that could only lead to great things .
I was sure he could get into a technical academy if he stayed in 7A , but the terms of the X - Swap were very clear -- no defections .
We spent those two weeks going to plays and movies , taking trips to the beach and museums , and having dinner with friends .
Altogether I think Philip had a great time , but there was one event that shook me .
We took the ferry across to New York City and got on the gravlev to see a Yankees game .
Philip instinctively grabbed a handstrap even though there were plenty of spaces available .
" Philip , " Rita said gently , " you can sit down here .
These seats are for you . "
Philip clung to his strap and shook his head , his eyes pressed shut .
" I can 't , " he whispered .
Rita and I exchanged a glance .
Then we stood up and took straps alongside Philip .
We rode the gravlev all the way to Yankee Stadium that way , standing up in a car full of empty seats .
- * -
We sent Philip home again at the appointed time .
He promised to X - post , and I told him I would be sending him some Barry White albums as soon as we could figure out a compatible file format .
Philip had been deeply taken with the notion of an integrated society .
He had browsed my library extensively while staying with us , and he had read all the way through the writings of Malcolm X before he left .
Waving goodbye to Philip at the X - depot , I felt we had lit a fire inside that one .
Perhaps this one exchange might change 17 H forever , and for the better too .
But would Evan return changed as well ?
and might that change alter 7A ?
I worried about it for a bit , but when I saw Evan 's grinning face as he stepped out of the beam , a bit thinner and very sunburned but otherwise every inch my son , I knew I had nothing to worry about .
The three of us took the ferry across to the city for our reunion dinner .
In the gravlev I chose to stand and hold the handstrap that day .
To my surprise Evan chose to join me , and we lurched and bumped all the way to Manhattan .
There is no one true time , I thought to myself -- but I like this one .
Klaudt had to exit the state legislature in 2006 due to term limits , after having a lost a battle for state senate in that same year -- but he sure had a doozie of a time while he was there .
I learned of this particular piece of distasteful debauchery from Howie Klein 's fantastic post on the subject at his blog Down With Tyranny .
As Klein says :
Like so many tightly wound repressed and mentally ill Republicans , Klaudt was preaching the moral superiority of the far right while he was abusing molesting children -- his own foster daughters and 2 state legislative pages !
He " faces a long list of charges : eight counts of rape , two counts of sexual exploitation of a minor , two counts of witness tampering , sexual contact with a person under 16 , and stalking . " emphasis added
Yeah , that 's right : eight counts of rape , two counts of sexual exploitation of a minor , two ocunts of witness tampering , sexual contact with a person under 16 , and stalking .
And just what was this guy doing to rack up all these charges ?
Well , according to KeloLand in Sioux Falls , he apparently " played doctor " with kids at a foster home he himself was running :
In the most disturbing accusation , the girls say Klaudt had them convinced they could earn up to $ 20,000 by donating their eggs to a fertility clinic .
And even though he has no medical training , the girls say Klaudt did all the supposed " exams " and " procedures " himself ....
The victims say Klaudt touched them while they were foster children at his home here in Walker .
But the girls say the molestation also happened in Pierre during legislative sessions while some of them also served as pages .
Five different girls now say Klaudt did things ranging from manual " breast exams " to the painful procedure of actually going inside of them with a speculum and collecting body fluids .
The girls say when they cried , Klaudt gave them a beer and told them to toughen up .
Yeah -- this guy raped teenage foster children and pages in his care with a speculum , and then gave them beer to make them stop crying .
And what wonderful bills did this upstanding man of moral character sponsor during his time in the legislature ?
A bill to establish a task force to study abortion and to provide for its composition , scope , and administration .
Two bills ( here and here ) to " prohibit the performance of abortions , except to save the life of the mother , and to provide a penalty therefor and to provide for a delayed effective date . "
A bill to " support free religious expression in public schools " : i.e. , teach creationism .
A bill to deny gay marriage through an amendment to the state constitution .
A bill to revise certain provisions regarding the performance of abortions on unemancipated minors and those found to be incompetent .
Most ironically , we have this : a bill " Honoring Valerie Melmer for her outstanding commitment and dedication to the state legislative page program . "
Presumably for her ready provision of speculum - ready victims to Teddy himself .
Sounds like a guy with an unhealthy obsession with vaginas and underage girls to me .
But I could be wrong .
----------------------------
Perhaps all these Biblical literalists should read their own texts : the GOP is filled to the brim with lecherous men who punish our modern - day Susannas while taking advantage of them .
There is something deeply disgusting about a man who attempts to restrict abortions for minors while pretending to harvest the eggs of 15 - year - old girls with a speculum , and gives them beer afterwards .
But there are no Daniels within the Republican Party to call out the hypocrisy , end the treachery , and punish the moralistic hypocrites .
It will take a flood of Democrats to wash away the stain of sexually repressive ugliness brought on the Republican culture of hypocrisy and corruption .

NASA administrator Mike Griffin speaks at a meeting of the MIT Enterprise Forum of Baltimore - Washington on September 17 .

Space economies and economics
One of the biggest debates in the first half - century of spaceflight has been regarding the economic rationale for sending spacecraft — robotic or human — into the cosmos .
Opponents of spaceflight , particularly human missions , see such efforts as extravagances that waste money that could be better spent “ on Earth ” , that is , in different areas like the environment , education , and social programs , among others .
( Money devoted to space programs is , of course , spent on Earth , although an article in the satirical newspaper The Onion last year touched on this by describing a NASA mission to launch $ 700 million into deep space . )
Proponents of spaceflight describe the benefits created by such programs , be it in direct forms like contracts and jobs , or , indirectly , in technological “ spinoffs ” that impact the economy and society far beyond the aerospace sector .
As the Space Age turns 50 , the economic debate shows no sign of abating .
While NASA has carved out a modest but relatively stable wedge in the overall federal budget , some wonder whether that wedge is big enough for the agency to do all it has been tasked to do , from kickstarting an ambitious human exploration program to maintaining its portfolio of science and aeronautics research .
Meanwhile , long - term budget pressures , particularly from entitlement programs as the Baby Boomer generation approaches retirement , could make it difficult for NASA to retain even its current share of the budget over the long haul .
That requires NASA to both better justify the importance of a government space program while also seek means to work with the private sector to do more for less — approaches that NASA administrator Michael Griffin described in two very different speeches last Monday .
Defining “ The Space Economy ” In June , NASA released a new strategic communications plan to better communicate the agency ’s mission to a public that was skeptical or simply unaware of the relevance the agency has in their lives ( See “ NASA ’s new outreach plan ” , The Space Review , July 2 , 2007 ) .
Part of that plan was a concept called “ The Space Economy ” that is intended to demonstrate the full effect of space exploration on the economy : “ the full range of activities and use of resources that create and provide value and benefits to human beings in the course of exploring , understanding and utilizing space . ”
“ Fundamentally , NASA opens new frontiers and creates new opportunities , ” Griffin said .
“ And because of that , we are a critical driver of innovation , but not in a way that just creates jobs .
We create new markets , and new possibilities for economic growth , that did n’t previously exist . ”
Griffin discussed The Space Economy concept during a luncheon speech before an invited audience of over 100 people from the space industry at a downtown Washington hotel on Monday , September 17 .
The speech was the first in a new lecture series established by NASA to help celebrate its 50th anniversary next October ( a concept also included in the aforementioned strategic communications plan . )
In his remarks , he made it clear that his Space Economy idea went beyond simply embracing spinoffs .
“ I do think there is a very strong link , the strongest possible link , between doing the hardest thing people do , which is flying in space , and how it benefits the rest of our economy , and indeed our whole way of life , ” he said .
“ Fundamentally , NASA opens new frontiers and creates new opportunities , ” he continued .
“ And because of that , we are a critical driver of innovation , but not in a way that just creates jobs .
We create new markets , and new possibilities for economic growth , that did n’t previously exist .
We ’ve taken at NASA to calling this ‘ The Space Economy ’ .
It is an emerging economy , but it a robust one even so . ”
Griffin noted that the higher standards of performance companies are held to when working on space projects have an as - yet unmeasured effect on the overall economy .
“ I often wonder if it might be possible to quantify the value to society of upgrading the standards of precision to which the entire industrial base of that society operates , ” he said .
“ How do we value that asset ?
I do n’t know , but I am absolutely convinced that it is real and , without the space industry , we would n’t have it . ”
He also discussed competition among nations , not in space per se , but in innovation and economic development .
“ Economic growth is driven by technological innovation .
Societies that foster it lead the pack , and others lag behind .
But if technological innovation drives competitiveness and growth , what drives innovation ?
There are many factors , but the exploration and exploitation of space is one of those . ”
Another factor in innovation and economic competitiveness that Griffin said is often overlooked is the image that various nations project to the world .
“ The nation that appears to be at the top of the technical pyramid has taken a very large step towards being there in fact , ” he said .
“ Developing countries like China recognize the value of space activities as a driver of innovation , a source of national pride , and membership in the most exclusive of clubs , that of spacefaring societies . ”
“ NASA is uniquely positioned to drive the space economy with both substance and style , because our mission requires us to push the technological envelope every single day and to do it in the most publicly visible manner of any human enterprise . ”
In comments during a Q&A session that received more immediate attention than his formal remarks , Griffin extended that theme to include human exploration of the Moon .
“ I personally believe that China will be back on the Moon before we are , ” he said .
“ I think when that happens , Americans will not like it , but they will just have to not like it .
I think we will see , as we have seen with China ’s introductory manned space flights so far , we will see again that nations look up to other nations that appear to be at the top of the technical pyramid , and they want to do deals with those nations .
It ’s one of the things that made us the world ’s greatest economic power .
So I think we ’ll be reinstructed in that lesson in the coming years and I hope that Americans will take that instruction positively and react to it by investing in those things that are the leading edge of what ’s possible . ”
And Griffin believes that NASA is well positioned to be at that leading edge .
“ NASA is uniquely positioned to drive the space economy with both substance and style , because our mission requires us to push the technological envelope every single day and to do it in the most publicly visible manner of any human enterprise . ”
The economies of space Near the end of his luncheon , Griffin talked about the role of government in helping enable new markets in space , specifically citing the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services ( COTS ) efforts currently underway .
“ To me , this is exactly analogous to the way that government policy — enlightened public policy — spurred the aviation industry of the 20th century , ” he said , noting the huge strides aviation made in its first century thanks to such policy .
“ It ’s a stunning achievement , and we want to do it in space . ”
Griffin made similar comments about COTS and the role of the public and private sectors about six hours later , during a speech at a meeting of the MIT Enterprise Forum in Arlington , Virginia on “ Emerging Space - Dependent Companies ” .
However , speaking to a group of businesspeople , many of whom not involved in space ventures at all ( and thus with virtually no overlap with his luncheon audience ) , Griffin focused not on the “ Space Economy ” concept but instead on the emerging markets and technologies in space and the role government should play to enable them .
Some markets , like communications , are already mature and lucrative : “ A license to a communications satellite slot is a license to print money , ” he said .
Commercial remote sensing has emerged more recently ; he said he was “ optimistic ” about the prospects there despite some concerns about the long - term commercial viability of some of the companies in the market who depend on government funding .
Griffin was more skeptical about other space markets .
He described navigation as a utility that has become critical to so many applications on the Earth .
However , because of the importance placed on satellite navigation , he doubts that it will be a commercially provided service in the foreseeable future .
“ Their absence would be so catastrophic that I think no reasonable government will risk that absence ” by depending on a commercial service .
Regarding small satellites , or microsats , Griffin acknowledged their potential , but noted that these spacecraft are still looking for a “ killer app ” needed to really revolutionize the market .
“ Too many people , in my estimation , look upon small satellites almost as a religion , ” he said .
“ I personally think that there is at least some likelihood that efficient orbital transportation will derive from a successful suborbital transportation provider , rather than the other way around , ” Griffin said .
One market that Griffin was remarkably bullish about is suborbital spaceflight .
“ Is there a market for suborbital transportation ? ” he asked .
“ I think there is . ”
Space tourism is the market most often associated with suborbital vehicles , and Griffin said such a market most likely exists , even if it is not necessarily a large one .
Another customer , though , might be the government , who could purchase such flights for astronaut training or , later , point - to - point package delivery .
The government , Griffin said , might well be a major , even lead , customer for such services .
“ It might well be that the commercial space tourism market follows on the heels of the government ’s desire to hire suborbital transportation for the purposes of , say , training astronauts , ” he said .
“ If I was still at the helm of NASA when such a service became available , I would guarantee you that we would use it to begin entry - level training of astronauts . ”
Another aspect of suborbital spaceflight that Griffin emphasized is its potential role in helping develop low - cost orbital spaceflight .
“ I personally think that there is at least some likelihood that efficient orbital transportation will derive from a successful suborbital transportation provider , rather than the other way around , ” he said .
“ The efficiencies learned by operating such a fleet [ of suborbital vehicles ] in the commercial marketplace would in fact carry over to the orbital marketplace . ”
That emphasis on space transportation goes back to COTS , and the proper roles of the public and private sectors .
Griffin said there was a need for a “ public policy shift ” in order to embrace a model of government support for space transportation and the overall space industry similar to how the government supported the fledgling aviation industry in the 1920s .
The White House and Congress , he said , “ need to decide that their grandparents got it right and set aside significant amounts of money to fulfill requirements so that this capability can be advanced . ”
“ From a public policy perspective , government investment in stimulating new capabilities by industry never fails to pay off , ” he said .
“ We do n’t live in a time when a significant majority of the Congress believes this to be the case .
You do n’t see legislation being introduced with this as a goal . ”
He did warn , though , about going too far in the direction of incentives like prizes .
“ The people who suggest that we should put up a $ 100 - billion prize for the first company to take us to Mars are idiots , ” he said .
“ We need an appropriate balance between government sector activity and private sector activity .
My point is that , for fifty years in the space business , we have not had that appropriate balance .
We need to move more towards the middle . ”
Right now , COTS is the pathfinder for that aviation - like model of support for the space industry , and the pressure is on .
“ I have threaded a very narrow path through the procurement regulations available to NASA to bankroll certain entrepreneurs , and may do so with others , ” he said .
“ Now , I need one or two of them to be successful .
Otherwise , I look like an idiot .
If it ’s successful I look like a genius .
There ’s a real thin line between those two . ”

Mr Jeffs was a fugitive for nearly two years before his arrest in Las Vegas
A court in Utah found Warren Jeffs , a self - proclaimed prophet , guilty of two counts of encouraging the young girl to have sex against her will .
The head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) could face life in prison .
The sect split from the Mormon Church after the latter renounced polygamy .
Mr Jeffs has been in custody since August 2006 , when he was arrested in Nevada after nearly two years on the run .
At the time , he was on the FBI 's Ten Most Wanted list .
He went into hiding after being charged in Arizona with being an accomplice to incest and sexual misconduct for allegedly arranging marriages between minors and older men .
' Despair '
After deliberating for 16 hours , the jury in St George found Mr Jeffs had orchestrated the marriage of the girl to her 19 - year - old cousin and encouraged her to have sex by telling her she would go to hell if she did not .
The only thing I wanted to do was die
Testimony by victim
Uncertain future for sect
Earlier , the victim testified that she had cried in despair when she was told to marry Allen Steed in 2001 and encouraged to kiss him .
The victim , now aged 21 , said the couple were married for at least a month before they had sex .
Afterwards , she swallowed two bottles of pain relieving medicine and curled up on the floor , she said .
" The only thing I wanted to do was die , " she told the court .
Mr Steed , who has not been charged with any offence , testified that his wife had initiated their first sexual encounter .
Under Utah law a 14 - year - old can consent to sex , but not if they are enticed by someone at least three years older .
Lawyers for Mr Jeffs argued that he could not have known any rape would be committed and that the victim had been too vague when she told the sect leader about her relationship problems .
Church under pressure
Mr Jeffs , who is reputed to have 70 wives , took over the leadership of the FLDS church after his father , Rulon , died in 2002 .
An estimated 40,000 people in the US still believe in polygamy
The 10,000 - strong sect dominates the towns of Colorado City , in Arizona , and Hildale , Utah , less than a mile away .
A compound in Eldorado , Texas , is also home to a growing community .
Members believe a man must marry at least three wives in order to ascend to heaven .
Women are taught that their path to heaven depends on being subservient to their husband .
Polygamy is illegal in the US , but the authorities have reportedly been reluctant to confront the FLDS for fear of sparking a tragedy similar to the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian sect in Waco , Texas , which led to the deaths of about 80 members .
However , observers say the church is coming under increasing pressure from authorities in Utah and Arizona .
God Does Not Want 16 Kids / Arkansas mom gives birth to a whole freakin ' baseball team .
How deeply should you cringe ?
W ho are you to judge ?
Who are you to say that the more than slightly creepy 39 - year - old woman from Arkansas who just gave birth to her 16th child yes that 's right 16 kids and try not to cringe in phantom vaginal pain when you say it , who are you to say Michelle Duggar is not more than a little unhinged and sad and lost ?
And furthermore , who are you to suggest that her equally troubling husband -- whose name is , of course , Jim Bob and he 's hankerin ' to be a Republican senator and try not to wince in sociopolitical pain when you say that -- is n't more than a little numb to the real world , and that bringing 16 hungry mewling attention - deprived kids ( and she wants more !
Yay ! ) into this exhausted world zips right by " touching " and races right past " disturbing " and lurches its way , heaving and gasping and sweating from the karmic armpits , straight into " Oh my God , what the hell is wrong with you people ? "
But that would be , you know , mean .
Mean and callous to suggest that this might be the most disquieting photo you see all year , this bizarre Duggar family of 18 spotless white hyperreligious interchangeable people with alarmingly bad hair , the kids ranging in ages from 1 to 17 , worse than those nuked Smurfs in that UNICEF commercial and worse than all the horrific rubble in Pakistan and worse than the cluster - bomb nightmare that is Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise having a child as they suck the skin from each other 's Scientological faces and even worse than that huge 13 - foot python which ate that six - foot alligator and then exploded .
It 's wrong to be this judgmental .
Wrong to suggest that it is exactly this kind of weird pathological protofamily breeding - happy gluttony that 's making the world groan and cry and recoil , contributing to vicious overpopulation rates and unrepentant economic strain and a bitter moral warpage resulting from a massive viral outbreak of homophobic neo-Christians across our troubled and Bush - ravaged land .
Or is it ?
Is it wrong to notice how all the Duggar kids ' names start with the letter J ( Jeremiah and Josiah and Jedediah and Jesus , someone please stop them ) , and that if you study the above photo ( or the even more disturbing family Web site ) too closely you will become rashy and depressed and you will crave large quantities of alcohol and loud aggressive music to deflect the creeping feeling that this planet is devolving faster than you can suck the contents from a large bong ?
But I 'm not judging .
I have a friend who used to co-babysit ( yes , it required two sitters ) for a family of 10 kids , and she reports that they were , almost without fail , manic and hyper and bewildered and attention deprived in the worst way , half of them addicted to prescription meds to calm their neglected nerves and the other half bound for years of therapy due to complete loss of having the slightest clue as to who they actually were , lost in the family crowd , just another blank , needy face at the table .
Is this the guaranteed affliction for every child of very large families ?
Of course not .
But I 'm guessing it 's more common than you imagine .
What 's more , after the 10th kid popped out , the family doctor essentially prohibited the baby - addicted mother from having any more offspring , considering the pummeling endured by her various matronly systems , and it 's actually painful to imagine the logistics , the toll on Michelle Duggar 's body , the ravages it has endured to give birth to roughly one child per year for nearly two decades , and you cannot help but wonder about her body and its various biological and sexual ... no , no , it is not for this space to visualize frighteningly capacious vaginal dimensions .
It is not for this space to imagine this couple 's soggy sexual mutations .
We do not have enough wine on hand for that .
Perhaps the point is this :
Why does this sort of bizarre hyperbreeding only seem to afflict antiseptic megareligious families from the Midwest ?
In other words -- assuming Michelle and Jim Bob and their massive brood of cookie - cutter Christian kidbots will all be , as the charming photo suggests , never allowed near a decent pair of designer jeans or a tolerable haircut from a recent decade , and assuming that they will all be tragically encoded with the values of the homophobic asexual Christian right -- where are the forces that shall help neutralize their effect on the culture ?
Where is the counterbalance , to offset the damage ?
Where is , in other words , the funky tattooed intellectual poetess who , along with her genius anarchist husband , is popping out 16 funky progressive intellectually curious fashion - forward pagan offspring to answer the Duggar 's squad of über - white future Wal - Mart shoppers ?
Where is the liberal , spiritualized , pro-sex flip side ?
Verily I say unto thee , it ai n't lookin ' good .
Perhaps this the scariest aspect of our squishy birthin ' tale :
Maybe the scales are tipping to the neoconservative , homogenous right in our culture simply because they tend not to give much of a damn for the ramifications of wanton breeding and environmental destruction and pious sanctimony , whereas those on the left actually seem to give a whit for the health of the planet and the dire effects of overpopulation .
Is that an oversimplification ?
Why does this sort of thoughtfulness seem so far from the norm ?
Why is having a stadiumful of offspring still seen as some sort of happy joyous thing ?
You already know why .
It is the Biggest Reason of All .
Children are , after all , God 's little gifts .
Kids are little blessings from the Lord , the Almighty 's own screaming spitballs of joy .
Hell , Jim Bob said so himself , when asked if the couple would soon be going for a 17th rug rat : " We both just love children and we consider each a blessing from the Lord .
I have asked Michelle if she wants more and she said yes , if the Lord wants to give us some she will accept them . "
This is what he actually said .
And God did not strike him dead on the spot .
Let us be clear : I do n't care what sort of God you believe in , it 's a safe bet that hysterical breeding does not top her list of desirables .
God does not want more children per acre than there are ants or mice or garter snakes or repressed pedophilic priests .
We already have three billion humans on the planet who subsist on less than two dollars a day .
Every other child in the world ( one billion of them ) lives in abject poverty .
We are burning through the planet 's resources faster than a Republican can eat an endangered caribou stew .
Note to Michelle Duggar : If God wanted you to have a massive pile of children , she'd have given your uterus a hydraulic pump and a revolving door .
Stop it now .
Ah , but this is America , yes ?
People should be allowed to do whatever the hell they want with their families if they can afford it and if it's within the law and so long as they are n't gay or deviant or happily flouting Good Christian Values , right ?
Should n't they ?
Hell , gay couples still can't openly adopt a baby in most states ( they either lie , or one adopts and the other must apply as " co-parent " ) , but Michelle Duggar can pop out 16 kids and no one says , oh my freaking God , stop it , stop it now , you thoughtless , selfish , baby - drunk people .
No , no one says that .
That would be mean .

Shining the light for vote integrity in elections nationwide
On the webinar , Vice Presidents from both the San Diego Unified School Board and San Ysidro School Board shed light on how the digital divide continues to affect students during this all - virtual school year .
So Mr. Dobbs was flat - out wrong .
And when I spoke to him yesterday , he admitted as much , sort of .
I read him Ms. Romans ’s comment — the one with the word “ suddenly ” in it — and he replied , “ I think that is wrong . ”
He then went on to say that as far as he was concerned , he had corrected the mistake by later broadcasting another report , on the same night as his on - air confrontation with the Southern Poverty Law Center officials .
This report mentioned that leprosy had peaked in 1983 .
Of course , he has never acknowledged on the air that his program presented false information twice .
Instead , he lambasted the officials from the law center for saying he had .
Even yesterday , he spent much of our conversation emphasizing that there really were 7,000 cases in the leprosy registry , the government ’s 30 - year database .
Mr. Dobbs is trying to have it both ways .
I have been somewhat taken aback about how shameless he has been during the whole dispute , so I spent some time reading transcripts from old episodes of “ Lou Dobbs Tonight . ”
The way he handled leprosy , it turns out , is not all that unusual .
For one thing , Mr. Dobbs has a somewhat flexible relationship with reality .
He has said , for example , that one - third of the inmates in the federal prison system are illegal immigrants .
That ’s wrong , too .
According to the Justice Department , 6 percent of prisoners in this country are noncitizens ( compared with 7 percent of the population ) .
For a variety of reasons , the crime rate is actually lower among immigrants than natives .
Second , Mr. Dobbs really does give airtime to white supremacy sympathizers .
Ms. Cosman , who is now deceased , was a lawyer and Renaissance studies scholar , never a medical doctor or a leprosy expert .
She gave speeches in which she said that Mexican immigrants had a habit of molesting children .
Back in their home villages , she would explain , rape was not as serious a crime as cow stealing .
The Southern Poverty Law Center keeps a list of other such guests from “ Lou Dobbs Tonight . ”
Finally , Mr. Dobbs is fond of darkly hinting that this country is under attack .
He suggested last week that the new immigration bill in Congress could be the first step toward a new nation — a “ North American union ” — that combines the United States , Canada and Mexico .
On other occasions , his program has described a supposed Mexican plot to reclaim the Southwest .
In one such report , one of his correspondents referred to a Utah visit by Vicente Fox , then Mexico ’s president , as a “ Mexican military incursion . ”
When I asked Mr. Dobbs about this yesterday , he said , “ You ’ve raised this to a level that frankly I find offensive . ”

第 6 回 メタプログラミン グ
今回は 「プログラミングをプログラムする」メタプログラミングについて学びます。メタプログラミングを利用すると，動的にメソッドを追加するなど，実際のアプリケーション作成に役立つ処理が簡単に実現できます。メタプログラミングと小言語の関係についても解説を加えました。
第 7 回 コレクションを使いこなす
配列やハッシュなどのオブジェクトをコレクションと呼びます。今回は，コレクション自体の操作方法を押さえた後，他のクラスからコレクションの機能を利用する方法までを紹介します。
第 8 回 デザイン・パターン（1 ）
今回はソフトウエア設計に登場するパターンをまとめたものである「デザイン・パターン」について学びましょう。ソフトウエア設計において適切なデザイン・パターンをカタログから選び出すことで，複雑なプログラムでも効率良く設計できるようになります。
第 9 回 デザイン・パターン （2 ）
ソフトウエア設計に登場するパターンをまとめた「デザイン・パターン」について学びましょう。デザイン・パターンを使いこなせれば，複雑なプログラムを効率よく設計できます。今回は，既にあるものを使いまわすPrototype，抽象的にアルゴリズムを記述できるTemplate Method，強い依存性を断ち切るObserverの各パターンを紹介します。
第 10 回 デザイン・パターン（3 ）
これまで2回続けてデザイン・パターンについて学んできました。今回は，重要なソフトウエア開発原理として知られるオープン・クローズ原則（OCP）の観点からデザイン・パターンを眺めてみましょう。単なる流用可能なソフトウエア・パターン以上の価値がデザイン・パターンに隠れていることが発見できるでしょう。
第 11 回 コード・ジェネレーショ ン
コード・ジェネレーションとは，ユーザー・インタフェース作成やDBアクセスといった似たようなコードが何度も登場する場合に役立つ手法です。開発したコードを読み込ませることで，定型部分を自動生成できるからです。今回はコード・ジェネレーションに向いたRubyを例に，その考え方や導入方法を紹介します。
第 12 回 多重継承再 び
今回は継承，特に誤解されがちな多重継承について改めて解説します。「オブジェクトは現実世界のモノの反映であり，継承はそのモノの分類を反映したものである」，「多重継承は良くないものだ」という意見が正しいかどうか，判断する基準を紹介します。
第 13 回 プログラムを高速化す る
プログラムの高速化はプログラマにとって永遠の課題です。しかし，そこには知られざる暗黒面が隠れています。そもそも高速化に意味があるのかを調べなければなりません。次に，どの部分をどの程度高速化するのかが重要です。アルゴリズムの効率にも目配りが必要です。
第 14 回 意外に深い整数の世 界
整数はコンピュータにとって最も基本となるデータの一つでしょう。今月はその基本的なデータの背後にあるコンピュータの秘密について考えてみます。最後に，応用問題として公開鍵暗号方式についても触れます。
第 15 回 浮動小数点数の謎に満ちた世 界
前回はコンピュータにおける整数の扱いについて学びました。今回はさらに奥に入り，小数について調べてみましょう。コンピュータ上の小数は整数以上に複雑な謎に満ちているのです。
第 16 回 ネットワーク・プログラミング（ソケット編）
LinuxのようなUNIX系OSでは，ファイルに対する操作と同様にネットワーク通信を行うために，「ソケット」と呼ばれる仕組みを使います。今回はソケットについて学びましょう。
第 17 回 ネットワーク・プログラミング（プロトコル編）
ネットワーク通信では， 「どのような形式でやり取りするのか」について参加者間で合意しておく必要があります。この合意を「プロトコル」と呼びます。今回はネットワーク通信のプロトコル，特にアプリケーション層について，実例を交えて解説します。
第 18 回 プログラムを高速化する（その2 ）
プログラムの高速化については本連載の第13回（2006年5月号）で紹介しています。プログラム中のどの部分を高速化すべきなのか，どのように効果を測定するのか，そもそも高速化が必要なのかを考察しました。今回は実際に高速化を試みます。
第 19 回 HTTPとCGI
Webアプリケーションが流行しています。Webブラウザ上で何でも実行させる昨今の風潮はいかがなものかと思いますが，これも時流なのかもしれません。Webプログラミングに習熟する前段階として，今回は基礎となるHTTPとCGIについて学びます。
第 20 回 MVC とRuby on Rails
Ruby on Railsをはじめとする最近 のWebアプリケーション・フレームワークの多くは，MVCと呼ばれるデザイン・パターンを採用しています。今回は，このMVCパターンの「正体」について考えます。
第 21 回 オープンクラス とRuby on Rails
Rubyには 「オープンクラス」という機能があり，使い方次第で強力な道具になります。今回はこのオープンクラスを解説します。オープンクラスを活用している「Ruby on Rails」のライブラリActiveSupportについても紹介します。
The claims , reminiscent of the intelligence fiasco surrounding the Iraq war , coincided with a sharp increase in international tension as the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) reported that Iran was defying a UN security council ultimatum to freeze its nuclear programme .
That report , delivered to the security council by the IAEA director general , Mohammed ElBaradei , sets the stage for a fierce international debate on the imposition of stricter sanctions on Iran and raises the possibility that the US could resort to military action against Iranian nuclear sites .
At the heart of the debate are accusations - spearheaded by the US - that Iran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
However , most of the tip - offs about supposed secret weapons sites provided by the CIA and other US intelligence agencies have led to dead ends when investigated by IAEA inspectors , according to informed sources in Vienna .
" Most of it has turned out to be incorrect , " a diplomat at the IAEA with detailed knowledge of the agency 's investigations said .
" They gave us a paper with a list of sites .
[ The inspectors ] did some follow - up , they went to some military sites , but there was no sign of [ banned nuclear ] activities .
" Now [ the inspectors ] do n't go in blindly .
Only if it passes a credibility test . "
One particularly contentious issue was records of plans to build a nuclear warhead , which the CIA said it found on a stolen laptop computer supplied by an informant inside Iran .
In July 2005 , US intelligence officials showed printed versions of the material to IAEA officials , who judged it to be sufficiently specific to confront Iran .
Tehran rejected the material as forged , and there are still reservations within the IAEA about its authenticity , according to officials with knowledge of the internal debate in the agency .
" First of all , if you have a clandestine programme , you do n't put it on laptops which can walk away , " one official said .
" The data is all in English which may be reasonable for some of the technical matters , but at some point you 'd have thought there would be at least some notes in Farsi .
So there is some doubt over the provenance of the computer . "
IAEA officials do not comment on intelligence passed to the watchdog agency by foreign governments , saying all such assistance is confidential .
A western counter - proliferation official accepted that intelligence on Iran had sometimes been patchy , but argued that the essential point was Tehran 's failure to live up to its obligations under the non-proliferation treaty .
" I take on board on what they 're saying , but the bottom line is that for nearly 20 years [ the Iranians ] were violating safeguards agreements , " the official said .
" There is a confidence deficit here about the regime 's true intentions . "
That deficit will be deepened by yesterday 's IAEA report , which concluded bluntly that " Iran has not suspended its enrichment related activities " , in defiance of a December UN ultimatum to stop .
The report noted that Iran had continued with the operation of a pilot enrichment plant .
Furthermore , the report said Iran had informed the agency of its plan to install 18 arrays , or cascades , of 164 centrifuges in an underground plant by May - a total of nearly 3,000 .
At the moment , Iran 's centrifuges are being used to make low enriched uranium , but if they were switched to making highly enriched , weapons grade uranium they could produce enough for a bomb in less than a year .
Mr ElBaradei's report said that Iran had so far not agreed to the IAEA installing remote monitoring devices in the enrichment plant to keep constant tabs on what the Iranians were doing with them .
Furthermore , the IAEA still has a string of questions about the Iranian programme that remain unanswered .
Until they are , the agency will not give Iran a clear bill of health .
One of the " outstanding issues " listed in yesterday 's report involves a 15 - page document that appears to have been handed to IAEA inspectors by mistake with a batch of unrelated paperwork in October 2005 .
That document roughly describes how to make hemispheres of enriched uranium , for which the only known use is in nuclear warheads .
Iran has yet to present a satisfactory explanation of how and why it has the document .
" The issue here is the Iranians have not addressed outstanding issues , and we are still uncertain about the scope and intent of the programme , " a senior UN official said last night .
" We cannot ensure the correctness and completeness of their declaration . "
New and exciting discovery opportunities will open up for most people , probably including you , when these three emotionally - attached strongholds of common knowledge are exposed for the falsehoods they are .
Myth # 1 : Genealogy is all about your last name .
In any other field , anything that represents less than 1 % of the whole is considered to be next to nothing .
Yet in genealogy , where your last name represents less than 1 % of your ancestry most people seem to think genealogy is all about their own surname .
The truth is , no matter whether your surname is very unusual or quite common , less than 1 % of your own ancestors had your last name , and more than 99 % of your own ancestors had different last names .
So if almost all of your own ancestors had different last names , this means almost all of your own cousins have different last names , and you may share some of the same ancestors with famous Hollywood actors and actresses , like maybe Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie .
( see Myth # 3 below )
Myth # 2 : All of your ancestors came from ……
Many people have grown up believing that all of their ancestors came from Ireland , or Italy , or Norway , or Greece , etc .
This is simply not true , even if all four of your grandparents came from the same place .
The Big Picture of Genealogy shows that over the centuries your grandparents ’ ancestors came from many places .
No one has ever had ancestors from only one place , everyone has ancestors from many places , and no matter how geographically identified your surname is , this absolutely includes you .
Myth # 3 : You are not related to anyone famous .
You are absolutely related to some famous people , and some of your ancestors were very remarkable people .
Some of them were there at key turning points in history , and some of your cousins can be seen on TV .
Discover some of them and become inspired !
Turkana 's top rated diary on today 's WaPo report has us all up to speed on what 's emerging as Dick Cheney 's central role in pushing the NSA 's unauthorized , unlawful and unconstitutional program of warrantless domestic surveillance , and his role in the Midnight Raid on John Ashcroft 's hospital room .
As the Post has it :
Vice President Cheney told Justice Department officials that he disagreed with their objections to a secret surveillance program during a high - level White House meeting in March 2004 , a former senior Justice official told senators yesterday .
The meeting came one day before White House officials tried to get approval for the same program from then - Attorney General John D. Ashcroft , who lay recovering from surgery in a hospital , according to former deputy attorney general James B. Comey .
Comey 's disclosures , made in response to written questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee , indicate that Cheney and his aides were more closely involved than previously known in a fierce internal battle over the legality of the warrantless surveillance program .
The program allowed the National Security Agency to monitor phone calls and e-mails between the United States and overseas .
So Cheney " tells " DoJ he " disagrees . "
Then Gonzo and Card are sent to kick in Ashcroft 's door .
Ultimately , it takes the FBI Director 's orders to his agents on the scene to ensure that Comey not be removed from the room by Gonzo and Card under any circumstances to safeguard what little integrity the rule of law had left at that point , given that the program continued -- unauthorized and outside of the law -- for some time even after this confrontation .
Well , that and the threatened resignations of nearly the entire upper echelon of the Justice Department .
Yeah , by the way , about that ...
Comey said that Cheney 's office later blocked the promotion of a senior Justice Department lawyer , Patrick Philbin , because of his role in raising concerns about the surveillance .
Interesting , that .
I wonder if that sort of bureaucratic backstabbing has anything to do with why the Cheney Gonzales " Justice " Department has been hesitant to act with dispatch on this :
The [ Office of the Vice President ] has been out of compliance with executive orders on the classification of sensitive national security information for several years .
During that time , they 've been inventing their own classification system ( and spending taxpayer money for official - looking stamps bearing this fake classification ) .
And now the Vice President 's former top aide is on trial in federal court , offering as a defense for his role in the burning of a critical nuclear nonproliferation asset the excuse that the Vice President personally authorized the declassification of sensitive information .
All the while , not reporting it , or complying with any of the presidential mandate covering the secure handling of sensitive national security information .
Since that time , of course , that former aide -- Scooter Libby -- has been convicted and sentenced to 30 months in federal prison for his crimes .
And all the while , the Vice President 's office has been playing fast and loose with the laws and executive orders concerning the classification and declassification of national security information , with no accountability to anyone save ... the Department of " Justice . "
But of course , the Attorney General knows that if you get in this Vice President 's way , you get the shiv .
The Vice President 's office is in blatant defiance of executive orders , putting some unknown and untold volume of national security information at risk , and the person whose job it is to crack down on this recklessness and ensure our safety is in his pocket and taking his orders .
[ The President 's ] all - purpose incantation of national security as an inherent and absolute Presidential right , whatever the surrounding circumstances , a right to be exercised in secret at Presidential pleasure without accountability to Congress and the people , surely represents an extraordinary violation of public trust .
Some of his own people have begun to understand this now , even though [ the President ] himself thus far has shown not the slightest evidence of comprehension , repentance , or even passing regret .
" The key , " [ a penitent aide ] recently said , " is the effect that the term ' national security ' had on my judgment .
The very words served to block critical analysis .
It seemed at least presumptuous if not unpatriotic to inquire into just what the significance of ' national security ' was . "
If [ the President ] is not impeached , it will be a message from Congress to future Presidents that they can define national security as they wish , share their definition with no one , and do whatever they claim national security requires .
It will be difficult for future Congresses to object when future Presidents act upon the powerful precedent [ the President ] will thus have established .

A " legitimate debate . "
Sure - just like there 's a " legitimate debate " about the theory of evolution .
The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility , citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam . . .
" Here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility , but the terrorists see things differently , " Bush will say .
Ahh , yes - " stabbed in the back " by the Dirty F**king Hippies , once again .
Wow - guess those guys who wrote that op - ed piece in The New York Times the other day were misinformed , ' cause the Preznit sez our guys in Iraq are worried :
As they take the initiative from the enemy , they have a question :
Will their elected leaders in Washington pull the rug out from under them just as they are gaining momentum and changing the dynamic on the ground in Iraq ?
To no one 's surprise , the Right Wing Noise Machine has already jumped on the Dolchstosslegende bandwagon with admirable Teutonic gusto .
The neocon mouthpiece New York Sun had this to say :
President Bush , opening a new theme in support of sticking with the battle of Iraq , will today bluntly warn the Democrats against committing the errors of Vietnam — where America 's withdrawal precipitated a communist - led bloodbath .
Cue the Hörst Wessel Song , Marlene .
( Oooh , I love that : " The Battle of Iraq " - sorta like , " The Battle of Algiers , " only without the stinking Frogs . )
After quoting one anti-war senator at the time who asked what difference it would make which side won the war for Vietnam , the president will conclude : " One unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ‘ boat people , ' ‘ re - education camps , ' and ‘ killing fields . ' "
Say , are you going to the book burning Friday night ?
Bring a brick - I hear we 're going to do some window shopping .
( Y'know , all those people in Cambodia would n't 've died if we had , like , y'know , really invaded Cambodia , like we should 've . )
" Today the violent Islamic extremists who fight us in Iraq are as certain of their cause as the Nazis , Imperial Japanese , and Soviet Communists were of theirs "
I 'm so excited to go the big rally next weekend in Nuremberg Crawford - me and my Young Defenders of the Homeland troop are going to be on a rally squad !
( Never mind that we did n't actually fight the " Soviet Communists , " but who 's counting , right ? )
A " legitimate debate . "
The only " legitimate debate " about the President trying to compare Iraq favorably to Vietnam involves finding an answer to the question ,
Just exactly how stupid does he think we are ?
Same shit , different day .

I have completely rebuilt the whole website from a backup image that was ( completely by fluke ) only one day old at the time of sudden loss .
In subsequent days , the website suffered repeated corruption after initial attempts at rebuilding and also intermittent access problems .
At the time of writing this , the webspace provided by Virgin Media is behaving normally and all visitors ' bookmarked URLs will remain the same for now .
After I made a formal approach , I have just had confirmation from the UK Government 's D - Notice Committee ( www.dnotice.org.uk) that NO requests for censorship were behind the incident and the agencies consulted by the Committee ( MoD , MI5 , MI6 , GCHQ ) continue to have no problems with my website 's contents .

Apparently , the little scandal he ’s involved in is leading some to think that the World Bank may be irreparably harmed :
The leadership crisis engulfing the World Bank began with talk of favoritism for a girlfriend and ill feeling about the Iraq war .
But as the bank ’s board this week considers the fate of President Paul D. Wolfowitz , the ethics controversy has swelled into a test of who controls the institution and its future relevance in battling global poverty .
The outcome could determine whether governments from Berlin to Buenos Aires would be willing to contribute new funds in support of the bank ’s mission .
“ There ’s a real danger because of this Wolfowitz stuff that donors are going to find a reason not to give , ” said Elizabeth Stuart , senior policy adviser for Oxfam International , an anti-poverty group in Washington .

Conventional medical wisdom about cholesterol and the role of statins is now being challenged by a small , but growing number of health professionals .
Among them is Dr Malcolm Kendrick .
A GP for 25 years , he has also worked with the European Society of Cardiology , and writes for leading medical magazines :
When it comes to heart disease , we have been sold a pup .
A rather large pup .
Actually , it 's more of a full - grown blue whale .
We 've all been conned .
If you 've got a raised risk of heart disease , the standard medical advice is to take a
cholesterol - lowering statin drug to cut your chances of having a heart attack because , as we all know , cholesterol is a killer .
Indeed , many of you already believe that you
should take statins for the rest of your natural lifespan .
Nearly everybody is in agreement about the need to lower your cholesterol level .
The NHS spends nearly £ 1 billion a year on prescriptions for statins and possibly the same amount
administering the cholesterol tests , surgery visits and the rest .
But is it all worth it ?
According to an article being published in the medical journal The Lancet
this week , the answer is probably no .
A leading researcher at Harvard Medical School has found that women do n't benefit from taking statins at all , nor do men over 69 who have n't already had a heart attack .
There is a very faint benefit if you are a younger man who also has n't had a heart attack - out of 50 men who take the drug for five years , one will benefit .
Nor is this the first study to suggest that fighting cholesterol with statins is bunk .
Indeed , there are hundreds of doctors and researchers who agree that the cholesterol
hypothesis itself is nonsense .
What their work shows , and what your doctor should be saying , is the following :
• A high diet , saturated or otherwise , does not affect blood cholesterol levels .
• High cholesterol levels do n't cause heart disease .
• Statins do not protect against heart disease by lowering cholesterol - when they do
work , they do so in another way .
• The protection provided by statins is so small as to be not worth bothering about for most
people ( and all women ) .
The reality is that the benefits have been hyped beyond belief .
• Statins have many more unpleasant side effects than has been admitted , while experts in
this area should be treated with healthy scepticism because they are almost universally paid large sums by statin manufacturers to sing loudly from their hymn sheet .
So how can I say saturated fat does n't matter when everyone knows it is a killer ?
Could all
those millions who have been putting skinless chicken and one per cent fat yoghurts into
their trolleys really have been wasting their time ?
The experts are so busy urging you to consume less fat and more statins that you are never warned about the contradictions and lack of evidence behind the cholesterol con .
In fact , what many major studies show is that as far as protecting your heart goes , cutting back on saturated fats makes no difference and , in
fact , is more likely to do harm .
So how did fat and cholesterol get such a bad name ?
It all began about 100 years ago , when a
researcher found feeding rabbits ( vegetarians ) a high cholesterol carnivore diet blocked their
arteries with plaque .
But it took off in the Fifties with the Seven Countries study by Ancel Keys , which showed
that the higher the saturated fat intake in a country , the higher the cholesterol levels
and the higher the rate of heart
disease .
The countries he chose included Italy , Greece , the USA and the Netherlands .
But why these particular ones ?
Recently I did my own 14 countries study using figures from the World Health Organisation , and found the opposite .
Countries with the highest
saturated fat consumption ?
Austria , France , Finland and Belgium ? had the lowest rate of
deaths from heart disease , while those with the lowest consumption ?
Georgia , Ukraine and Croatia ? had the highest mortality rate from heart disease .
Added to this , the biggest ever trial on dietary modification put 50 million people on a low
saturated fat diet for 14 years .
Sausages , eggs , cheese , bacon and milk were restricted .
Fruit and fish , however , were freely available .
I ?m talking about rationing in Britain during and after World War Two .
In that time , deaths from heart disease more than doubled .
Even more damning is what happened in 1988 .
The Surgeon General 's office in the US decided to gather all evidence linking saturated fat to heart disease , silencing any nay - sayers for ever .
Eleven years later , however , the project was killed .
The letter announcing this stated that the office " did not anticipate fully the magnitude of the additional expertise and staff resources that would be needed " .
After eleven years , they needed additional expertise and staff resources ?
What had they
been doing ?
If they 'd found a scrap of evidence , you would never have heard the last of it .
Major trials since have been no more successful .
One involved nearly 30,000 middle - aged men
and women in Sweden , followed for six years .
The conclusion ?
" Saturated fat showed no
relationship with cardiovascular disease in men .
Among the women , cardiovascular mortality
showed a downward trend with increasing saturated fat intake . "
( In other words , the more
saturated fat , the less chance of dying from heart disease ) .
Even stronger evidence of the benefits of increased fat and cholesterol in the diet comes
from Japan .
Between 1958 and 1999 , the Japanese doubled their protein intake , ate 400 per cent
more fat and their cholesterol levels went up by 20 per cent .
Did they drop like flies ?
No .
Their stroke rate , which had been the highest in the world , was seven times lower , while deaths from heart attacks , already low , fell by 50 per cent .
It 's a bit of a paradox , is n?t it ?
That 's one of the features of the dietary hypothesis - it involves a lot of paradoxes .
The most famous is the French Paradox .
They eat more saturated fat than we do in Britain ; they
smoke more , take less exercise , have the same cholesterol / LDL levels , they also have the same
average blood pressure and the same rate of obesity .
And you know what ?
They have one quarter the rate of heart disease we do .
The official explanation is that the French are protected from heart disease by drinking red
wine , eating lightly cooked vegetables
and eating garlic .
But there is no evidence that any of these three factors are actually protective .
None .
By evidence , I mean a randomised , controlled
clinical study .
Every time a population is found that does n't fit the saturated fat / cholestrol hypothesis - the Masai living on blood and milk with no heart
disease , the Inuit living on blubber with low heart disease - something is always found to explain it .
One research paper published more than 20 years ago found 246 factors that could protect against heart disease or promote it .
By now there must be more than a thousand .
The closer you look the more you find that the cholestrol hypothesis is an amazing beast .
It is in a process of constant adaptation in order to encompass all contradictory data without keeling over and expiring .
But you do n't need to look at foreign countries to find paradoxes - the biggest one is right here at home .
Women are about 300 per cent less likely to suffer heart disease than men , even
though on average they have higher cholesterol levels .
For years there was an ad hoc hypothesis to explain this apparent contradiction - women were protected by female sex hormones .
In fact , there has never been a study showing that these hormones protect against heart disease in humans .
But by the Nineties , millions of women were being prescribed HRT to stave off heart disease .
Then came the HERS trial to test the notion .
It found HRT increased the risk of heart disease .
So what to do ?
Put them on statins ; bring their
cholesterol level down ?
below 5.0 mmol is the official advice .
But , as The Lancet article emphasises , women do not benefit from statins .
The phrase " Statins do not save lives in women " should be hung in every
doctor 's surgery .
But it 's not just hugely wasteful handing out statins to women and men who are never going to
benefit ; it also exposes them to the risk of totally unnecessary side effects .
These include muscle weakness ( myopathy ) and mental and neurological problems such as severe
irritability and memory loss .
How common are they ?
Very rare , say experts , but one trial found that 90 per cent of those on statins complained of side effects , half of them serious .
Only last week , a study reported a link between low LDL cholesterol and developing Parkinson's
disease .
Statins are designed to lower LDL .
In the face of anticholesterol propaganda , it is easy to forget cholesterol is vital for our bodies to function .
Why do you think an egg yolk is full of cholesterol ?
Because it takes a lot of cholesterol to build a healthy chicken .
It also takes a hell of a lot to build and maintain a healthy human being .
In fact , cholesterol is so vital that almost all cells can manufacture cholesterol ; one of the
key functions of the liver is to
synthesise cholesterol .
It 's vital for the proper functioning of the
brain and it's the building bock for most sex hormones .
So it should not be such a surprise to learn that lowering cholesterol can increase death
rates .
Woman with a cholesterol level of five or even six have a lower risk of dying than those with a level below four .
The Lancet reported that statins did n't benefit anyone over 69 , not even men ; in fact , there 's good evidence that they may hasten your death .
The Framingham study in the US found that people whose cholesterol levels fell were at a 14 per cent increased risk of death from heart disease for every 1 mg / dl .
Set up in 1948 , the study screened the whole population of Framingham near Boston for factors that might be involved in heart disease and then followed them to see what happened to them .
It is still going today , making it the longest running and most often quoted study in
heart - disease research .
A massive long - term study that looked specifically at cholesterol levels and mortality
in older people in Honolulu , published in The
Lancet , found that having low cholesterol concentration for a long time increases the risk
of death .
This may be because cholesterol is needed to fight off infections or there may be other reasons ?
but many other studies have found
exactly the same thing .
Low cholesterol levels greatly increase your risk of dying younger .
So the cholesterol hypothesis looks something like this :
There is no evidence that saturated fat is bad - and there are lots of ' paradoxes ' where countries with a high cholesterol intake do n't have a higher death rate from heart disease .
But there is an even more fundamental problem .
The theory claims fat and cholesterol do things in the body that just do n't make sense .
To begin with , saturated fat and cholesterol are talked of as if they are strongly connected .
A low - fat diet lowers cholesterol ; a high - fat diet raises it .
What is never explained is how this works .
This is n't surprising because saturated fat does n't raise cholesterol .
There is no biochemical connection between the two substances , which may explain all those negative findings .
It 's true that foods containing cholesterol also tend to contain saturated fats because both usually come from animals .
It 's also true that neither dissolve in water , so in order to travel along the bloodstream they have to be transported in a type of molecule known as a lipoprotein - such as LDLs ( low - density lipoproteins ) and HDLs ( high - density
lipoproteins ) .
But being travelling companions is as close as fats and cholesterol get .
Once in the body , most fat from our diet is transported to the fat cells in a lipoprotein called a chylomicron .
Meanwhile , cholesterol is produced in the liver by way of an incredibly complicated 13 - step process ; the one that statins interfere with .
No biochemist has been able to explain to me why eating saturated fat should have any impact on this cholesterol production line in the liver .
On the other hand , the liver does make fat - lots of it .
All the excess carbohydrate that we eat is turned first into glucose and then into fat in the liver .
And what sort of fat does the liver make ?
Saturated fat ; obviously the body does n't regard it as harmful at all .
Recently , attention has been shifting from the dangers of saturated fat and LDL " bad " cholesterol to the benefits of HDL " good " cholesterol , and new drugs that are going to
boost it .
But the idea that more HDLs are going to fight
off heart disease is built on equally shaky foundations .
These lipoproteins seem to be cholesterol " scavengers " , sucking up the cholesterol that is released when a cell dies and then passing it on to other lipoproteins , which return it to the liver .
Interestingly , the " bad " LDL lipoproteins are involved in the relay .
The idea seems to be that
HDLs can also get the cholesterol out of the plaques that are blocking arteries .
However , there is a huge difference between
absorbing free - floating cholesterol and sucking it out of an atherosclerotic plaque which is covered by an impermeable cap .

But pity the poor housewife who 's been sent out to find a carton of eggs .
As the wife of a recently expatriated oilman , I can count on " the company " to provide my family with a luxury apartment far beyond our regular means , a car with a driver and a 24 - hour emergency hotline , but eggs ?
Not even the might of Big Oil can get me a dozen eggs .
It 's a weird state of affairs in oil - and cash - rich Venezuela .
Supported by this decade 's unprecedented rise in oil prices and the populist government 's largesse , Venezuelans have gone on a spending spree , taxing this cosmopolitan city 's limited infrastructure with their consumption .
City streets and highways are at a permanent standstill , not large enough to accommodate the multitude of shiny new SUVs , sensible sedans and jalopies fighting for the right of way .
The shopping malls are always uncomfortably packed .
And construction cranes are popping up all over town , flanked by giant billboards promising yet more malls .
Direct TV satellites jut out from both expensive high - rise balconies and the rooftops of cinder - block homes that cling to the tropical hills surrounding this city in a valley .
And an abundance of pirated DVDs , Xbox games and prepaid phone cards ensure that not just the moneyed set enjoy the latest in electronics .
But eggs -- neither I nor anyone else can find eggs .
At least not on the first try , and very typically not on the second or third try , either .
Keeping a household stocked with basic food items has become the latest competitive sport where the rules are these :
Keep your eyes and ears open for new shipments , think strategically , and stock up whenever you can .
Hugo 's revolution hits a snag
Tapping into his oil windfall , President Hugo Chavez has in many ways lived up to his promise of distributing the nation 's wealth back to its citizens , improving the lives of many through handouts , subsidies and social programs .
Symbols of new wealth are everywhere , and , while the city 's edges are frayed , the grinding poverty so apparent in many Central American and Andean nations ' capitals is not immediately visible here .
Not surprisingly , with so much money floating around the country , demand for just about everything has surged , leading to the highest rate of inflation in Latin America .
But rather than put the brakes on an overheating economy , Chavez has instead chosen to fight inflation , which is expected to rise to 20 % this year from 17 % in 2006 , by slapping price controls on over 400 food items .
Producers , meanwhile , have said they can't bring goods to market at the government - mandated prices , leading to shortages and yet again skewing the market against those who can least afford it .
" Demand is higher than supply , " said Juan Pablo Fuentes , an economist with Moody 's Economy.com .
" The market 's way to operate is for prices to go up to bring equilibrium to the market , but with price controls the market does n't work this way , and the producers do n't want to sell below cost .
It 's supply and demand . "
In a healthy economy , higher demand would temporarily raise prices but would also spur production , bringing the market back into synch .
But price controls and the added complication of potential expropriation by the state have caused disarray in the supply chain .
" Producers do n't want to invest , " said Fuentes in a telephone interview .
" They do n't want to double output if the government might come and take their assets . "
As a result , eggs , beef , milk , corn oil , black beans -- in short , the basic building blocks of the local diet -- are the new luxury items , most easily gotten by those who can afford to pay prices that are often three times higher than what the government has mandated .
But Smucker 's jam , not considered a crucial food item and therefore free of price controls , abounds at about $ 8 a jar .
Where 's the beef ?
I strutted confidently into the plus - sized supermarket located near our apartment shortly after my family relocated to Caracas in early April .
Fluent in Spanish and having lived in South America before , I was extremely annoyed that the company - assigned driver insisted on coming along with me , chafing at the suggestion that I needed any sort of assistance .
The store was nearly identical to the flagship Kroger where I shopped near my home in Houston , in both size and layout , and at first glance seemed just as well - stocked .
The store greeted its customers with the same too - bright fluorescent lights .
Display tables at the head of each spacious row were stacked with bags of chips and the latest designer energy drink .
Already feeling patronized by my unwanted chaperone , I was downright angry when upon entering he instructed : " First , we 're going for meat . "
Within minutes , however , we were nearly separated as I got tangled among dozens of people and shopping carts parked in front of the meat counter .
I clearly had no idea what was going on .
By the end of the shopping trip , I would be reduced to exploiting a tenuous personal connection and bribing my way to beef .
I took a number at the ticket counter , drawing something in the 250s -- I was behind about 60 or 70 people .
So , Lesson No. 1 : Always check first to see if there 's beef or poultry , and , if there is , get a number before continuing along the rest of the hunt .
With a number in my pocket and assured that it would n't be called for at least another hour , I set out for the rest of the store .
Just as in the States , I had to squint in the canned - goods aisle to pick out the cheapest , generic brands of tomato sauce from among hundreds of Del Monte and Hunt cans .
Pasta , ditto .
Pancake mix , check .
Peanut butter , jam , syrup , wheat bread , Kraft singles , check .
All imported , all familiar names .
And then I hit another unexpected roadblock , this time in the coffee , tea and sweeteners aisle .
The shelves were stacked -- no visible gaps anywhere -- but I could n't find any sugar .
Real sugar , that is .
There were all kinds of artificial sweeteners , and there were plenty of bags of coarse brown sugar , but no plain sugar .
I only found the white stuff because a stranger came over and leaned in to whisper -- yes , she really did whisper -- " The sugar is over there , " pointing to a dark corner stacked with broken - up cardboard boxes .
She must have taken pity on me , an obvious foreigner unhappily scanning the shelves asking anyone within earshot , " Is n't there real sugar ? "
I hurried over and elbowed my way through a huddle of people crowded around a single shopping cart that had been haphazardly piled with bags of sugar .
I grabbed two , just in case .
After 45 minutes of shopping , we returned to the meat counter and found I was still behind 30 people who all looked like they were gearing up to buy three months ' worth of meat .
Just as I was about to call it quits , the driver dropped the name of someone he knew in the meat department to a nearby butcher and told me that I could jump the line as long as my order was n't too large .
With that , and a surreptitious tip of about $ 3 , I was discreetly handed 2 kilograms of ground beef and 1 kilogram of beef chunks for stew .
It 's only gotten slightly easier to buy beef since that first , chaotic encounter with the meat line , but mostly because I 've become savvier about finding it and am able to pay prices that have almost doubled over the past year .
After cooking through my first batch of meat , I learned to ask when beef would arrive each time I made a quick run to the store and buy much more expensive and less fresh items such as pork instead .
Many times the answer to my queries is a weary shrug ; no one knows when the missing goods will arrive .
The truck comes when it comes .
It 's the same for eggs , the same for sugar , and the same for milk .
Sometimes the shelves are lined with hundreds of long - life milk and powdered - milk cartons , and sometimes they 're completely empty .
The last time I successfully bought beef at my regular grocery store , I happened to ask in the morning whether meat would be arriving , and they actually said , " Yes , today at 3 p.m . "
I was there promptly at the given time and drew a number about 20 slots behind what was currently being served .
I finally got my beef two hours later .
As for eggs , I eventually found out through sheer happenstance that I 'm lucky enough to live at a building where every Wednesday a man delivers fresh poultry and eggs , as long as you call in your order in advance and reserve a carton .
He sells a carton of 30 eggs for twice the price mandated on the government 's Official Gazette .
And sugar ?
From now on , family and friends visiting from the States wo n't be able to step off the tarmac without two bags of sugar .

Good Air , Good Health Scottish Smoking Ban Leads to Huge Drop in Heart Attacks
A new study provides surprising evidence of the effects of smoking bans :
Heart attacks have dropped by 17 percent in Scotland since smoking was banned in public last year .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday subpoenaed Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to testify about a central and later refuted administration justification for the 2003 U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .

But the administration said it might fight the subpoena , citing a legal doctrine that can shield a president and his aides from having to answer questions from Congress .
“ Those matters are covered by executive privilege , ” said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack , moving toward a possible legal showdown with the Democratic - led Congress .
On a party - line vote of 21 - 10 , the House of Representatives ’ Oversight and Government Reform Committee approved a subpoena for Rice , which was quickly issued .
It directs her to answer questions from the panel next month about the administration ’s claim -- later proven false -- that Iraq had sought uranium from Niger for nuclear arms .
“ There was one person in the White House who had primary responsibility to get the intelligence about Iraq right -- and that was Secretary Rice who was then President George W. Bush ’s national security adviser , ” said committee Chairman Henry Waxman , a California Democrat .
“ The American public was misled about the threat posed by Iraq , and this committee is going to do its part to find out why , ” Waxman said .
The claim about Niger was a major factor in the administration ’s case for war , and critics later accused the White House of having twisted intelligence to build support .
The administration denies it .
Rep .
Tom Davis of Virginia , ranking Republican on Waxman ’s committee , accused Democrats of going on a “ fishing expedition . ”
Davis noted that a number of previous investigations had concluded that the claim about Niger “ reflected the broadly supported state of knowledge at that time . ”
WHITE HOUSE SCRUTINY
Waxman said there had been investigations about mistakes within the intelligence community , but he wanted to determine “ what went wrong inside the White House . ”
The subpoena for Rice was part of a flurry of action on Wednesday in the stepped - up congressional oversight of how the Bush administration operates .
Since Democrats took control of Congress from Bush ’s Republicans in January , there have been more than 400 oversight hearings .
“ There is a difference between oversight and over - reaching , ” said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino .
The House Judiciary Committee voted to authorize a subpoena of Monica Goodling , a former Justice Department official , and seek a court order of immunity for her in its probe of the firing last year of eight of the 93 U.S. attorneys .
“ Taking this step will compel her to testify , under penalty of contempt , ” said Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , a Michigan Democrat seeking to determine if the dismissals were politically motivated .
Goodling had earlier invoked her right against self - incrimination in refusing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The Senate Judiciary Committee , which grilled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales last week about the ousted prosecutors , authorized a subpoena for Sara Taylor of the White House office of political affairs .
Bush has vowed to oppose any attempt to compel sworn congressional testimony from White House aides in the investigation of the ousted prosecutors .
Gonzales contends that the firings were justified , but mishandled .

March says that university will be " just like going to school "
He is the youngest ever student to enrol in a university in Hong Kong .
March Tian Boedihardjo told reporters he struggled to communicate academically with his own age group .
March , an Indonesian - Chinese boy resident in Hong Kong , will start his specially designed five - year course at the university in September .
He told reporters that in his spare time he liked " to read books , but on the weekends I like to go out to play with friends " .
" We can play games together but academically , we can't communicate , " he added .
He said they played chess , Monopoly and cards .
Asked why he was not going to study in the United Kingdom - where his older brother is at Oxford University - he replied in English : " Because my father does not have sufficient money . "
March 's father said the university had given him confidence it could cope with the demands of teaching a nine - year - old .
" I will advise parents in Hong Kong there 's no need to know the IQ of your children .
Just try to do your best to nurture them and give them space to develop , " Tony Boedihardjo said .
Franklin Luk , president of HKBU , said the decision to admit the boy was based on his excellent examination results and a " commitment to nurturing gifted students " .
Dr Tong Chong - sze , Associate Professor of Mathematics at HKBU has arranged several professors to be March 's mentors .
" The very first concern of course is - academically can he handle the mathematics at university .
So that was the purpose of the first interview and he did very well .
He handled himself very well , one against four professors , " said Dr Tong .
Sexual fantasies : we all have them , even when we say we do n’t !
Fantasies can help us in stimulating arousal , making intercourse more interesting when it actually comes …
In counseling , fantasies can be used to block out unwanted cravings or thoughts , and in psychosexual therapy they are great tools to refocus on sensual pleasure .
In short , there ’s every reason to enjoy our sexual fantasies , and no reason to feel guilty about them !
Usually our most secret fantasy is best kept in the imaginary world : acting out a fantasy might lessen the excitement value of it , and in the real world sex is different from how we fantasize about it ...
Kelly is turned on by the thought of being forced to have sex against her will , but she would never want to be raped .
Emily enjoys imaging what it would be like to make love to her next - door - neighbor , but she has no real desire to be unfaithful to her husband .
So if our secret fantasies are not mental rehearsals for something that we actually plan to do , what on earth are they , and what are they saying about ourselves ?
‘ And then he came on a white horse , saving me when all hope was lost .
His lips were made for kissing , and his bosy … ’
Romantic fantasies are all about escape : out from a dreary routing , in with something exciting .
Trouble is that the fantasy itself does not create any additional opportunity for something special to happen .
Do you want to change your life ?
What can you do differently today ?
Maybe one of the participants in the imagined scene is your partner , maybe it is n’t .
Usually someone in the group is more adventurous than your real partner is and this could mask a fear to ask for what really please you .
What do you want ?
You have every right to ask .
If you have thought about making love to another women you are in good company , very many women have !
A Lesbian fantasy clearly does not mean that you do n’t like men , but it might indicate that there is a part of you that still need to be explored .
‘Forced to have sex =
Not responsible for it ’
Your unconscious might be attracted to the idea of coercive sex because if you have no choice in the matter , you ca n’t feel guilty about it .
You have the right to enjoy sex .
There are very many sexual fantasies out there and no one - size - fit - all explanation .
What is your secret fantasy ?
Please tell us without using your real name .
What does your fantasy might be telling you ?
An Australian farmer held captive in west Africa after being tricked in an internet bride scam has returned home , warning other lovelorn bachelors to be more careful than he was .
Des Gregor said he was lucky to be alive after a 12 - day ordeal in Mali in which he was kidnapped , beaten , had his cash and credit cards stolen and was told that his limbs would be hacked off with a machete if his family did not pay a ransom .
The 56 - year - old wheat farmer from South Australia was freed after a joint operation by the Australian and Malian police .
Mr Gregor travelled to the impoverished west African country last month to meet his supposed bride , known as Natacha , whom he had been communicating with for several months .
He was met at the airport by a well - dressed man , who claimed to be a relative of his future wife , and who took him to a scruffy apartment in the capital city of Bamako .
Once inside the man and an accomplice beat him , made him strip and demanded he have money wired from Australia .
During his captivity he was allowed to call home , seeking cash .
His brother , who received the calls pleading for help and money , contacted the police .
Mr Gregor was freed after being taken by his kidnappers to the Canadian embassy in Bamako on the pretext of obtaining cash .
Once inside , he was met by police officers .
His kidnappers got away .
The police do not believe Natacha , or a reputed 100,000 Australian dollar ( £ 42,000 ) dowry , ever existed .
They said Mr Gregor was lucky to have got out alive .
Mr Gregor , who tried to find a Russian bride online three years ago , said he would not be pursuing love on the internet again .
al Marri -- Big News From the Fourth Circuit Marty Lederman The U.S. Court of Appeals today held that the military detention of U.S. resident alien Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri is unlawful : " We conclude that we must grant al - Marri habeas relief .
Even assuming the truth of the Government ’s allegations , the President lacks power to order the military to seize and indefinitely detain al - Marri .
If the Government accurately describes al - Marri ’s conduct , he has committed grave crimes .
But we have found no
authority for holding that the evidence offered by the Government affords a basis for treating al - Marri as an enemy combatant , or as anything other than a civilian . "
Note that the decision depends on the fact that al - Marri was a resident of the U.S. , and therefore protected by the Due Process Clause .
The decision therefore would not necessarily resolve similar questions with respect to aliens not protected by the Due Process Clause -- and renders even more important the question whether aliens captured and held abroad , or at Guantanamo , have constitutional rights .
But I have n't finished reading yet , so that 's only a very tentative caution .
[ UPDATE : A Post identifying the two " holdings " of the case -- including the one that is less prominent but probably more important ( hint : it involves absuive interrogation ) -- here . ]
More to follow , but in the meantime , here 's the lede :
For over two centuries of growth and struggle , peace and war , the Constitution has secured our freedom through the guarantee that , in the United States , no one will be deprived of liberty without due process of law .
Yet more than four years ago military authorities seized an alien lawfully residing here .
He has been held by the military ever since -- without criminal charge or process .
He has been so held despite the fact that he was initially taken from his home in Peoria , Illinois by civilian authorities , and indicted for purported domestic crimes .
He has been so held although the Government has never alleged that he is a member of any nation ’s military , has fought alongside any nation ’s armed forces , or has borne arms against the United States anywhere in the world .
And he has been so held , without acknowledgment of the protection afforded by the Constitution , solely because the Executive believes that his military detention is proper .
While criminal proceedings were underway against Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , the President ordered the military to seize and detain him indefinitely as an enemy combatant .
Since that order , issued in June of 2003 , al - Marri has been imprisoned without charge in a military jail in South Carolina .
Al - Marri petitions for a writ of habeas corpus to secure his release from military imprisonment .
The Government defends this detention , asserting that al - Marri associated with al Qaeda and “ prepar[ed ] for acts of international terrorism . ”
It maintains that the President has both statutory and inherent constitutional authority to subject al - Marri to indefinite military detention and , in any event , that a new statute -- enacted years after al - Marri ’s seizure -- strips federal courts of jurisdiction even to consider this habeas petition .
We hold that the new statute does not apply to al - Marri , and so we retain jurisdiction to consider his petition .
Furthermore , we conclude that we must grant al - Marri habeas relief .
Even assuming the truth of the Government ’s allegations , the President lacks power to order the military to seize and indefinitely detain al - Marri .
If the Government accurately describes al - Marri ’s conduct , he has committed grave crimes .
But we have found no authority for holding that the evidence offered by the Government affords a basis for treating al - Marri as an enemy combatant , or as anything other than a civilian .
This does not mean that al - Marri must be set free .
Like others accused of terrorist activity in this country , from the Oklahoma City bombers to the surviving conspirator of the September 11th attacks , al - Marri can be returned to civilian prosecutors ,
tried on criminal charges , and , if convicted , punished severely .
But the Government cannot subject al - Marri to indefinite military detention .
For in the United States , the military cannot seize and imprison civilians -- let alone imprison them indefinitely .

It may be possible to reverse this
It was thought hair follicles , once damaged , could never be replaced .
But a University of Pennsylvania , US , team , writing in the journal Nature , says hair growth can actually be encouraged using a single gene .
A UK expert said the study could prove more important in aiding development of better wound - healing techniques .
This paper provides convincing evidence that the skin has remarkable powers of regeneration , not just repair as previously known
Professor Des Tobin , University of Bradford
The human head comes equipped with 100,000 tiny hair follicles , from each of which grow a single hair .
These follicles are produced by the embryo in the first stages of pregnancy , and it was thought that no further replacement follicles could be produced during life .
The Pennsylvania team found that a particular gene important in wound healing , called wnt , appeared to play a role in the production of new hair follicles .
In its experiment , small sections of the outer skin layer , or epidermis , were removed from mice .
Just this act appeared to awaken stem cell activity in the area , the scientists said , which included the production of a number of hair follicles .
If the action of the wnt gene was blocked , no hair follicles were produced ; but if it was boosted , then many more hair follicles were produced , with the skin layer eventually being indistinguishable from surrounding areas .
' Remarkable powers '
The researchers said that their findings " opened a window " for new treatments not only for baldness , but for other aspects of wound healing and regeneration .
British expert Professor Des Tobin , from the University of Bradford , said : " This paper provides convincing evidence that the skin has remarkable powers of regeneration , not just repair as previously known .
" It was long thought that hair follicle development , under physiological conditions , was limited to early developmental process in the embryo .
" Now this shows convincingly that under the conditions peculiar to the wound - healing environment , the highly complex hair follicle can be created anew from apparently unremarkable cells of the healing epidermis and its underlying dermis . "
He added : " The implications of this observation are many fold , but principally perhaps for what it tells us about the reprogramming power of adult stem cells , and it applications in regenerative medicine and wound healing . "
Scientists studying one of nature 's simplest organisms have helped to unravel the structure of a key molecule that controls pain in humans .
The findings -- published in the journal Nature -- could rapidly advance research into the next generation of painkillers for relief of chronic conditions such as migraine and backache .
Chronic pain , unlike the acute pain associated with trauma , has no apparent physiological benefit , often being referred to as the ' disease of pain ' .
Complete and lasting relief of chronic pain is rare and often the clinical goal is pain management through one or more medications .
But now researchers at The University of Manchester have examined microscopic amoeboid organisms commonly called slime moulds in a bid to gain greater insight into these pain molecules , known as ' P2X receptors ' .
" In humans , P2X receptors look identical to one another and so scientists have had difficulty understanding how they function , " said Dr Chris Thompson , who carried out the research with Professor Alan North and Dr Sam Fountain in the Faculty of Life Sciences .

" By looking at slime mould we were effectively able to turn the evolutionary clock back a billion years to see how a more primitive P2X molecule functions . "
The team discovered that there was only a 10 % similarity between human P2X and the slime mould equivalent .
They were therefore able to deduce from evolutionary theory that it was these similar parts of the molecule that probably regulate pain in humans .
" It 's a big step forward in understanding how the molecule works and should make it possible to develop drugs that block the receptors ' actions , " said Dr Thompson .
" Inhibiting P2X as a potential pain - relief therapy would be the Holy Grail of rational drug design and could revolutionise the way we manage chronic pain conditions like back pain and migraine . "
The research , published in Nature Thursday , July 12 , was funded by the Wellcome Trust , the Medical Research Council and the Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine .
About slime mould
In nature , the slime mould Dictyostelium exists as single - cell amoebae feeding off bacteria in the soil .
When their food supply runs out they aggregate to form a ' fruiting body ' of some 100,000 cells .
Some cells become spores , while others form a stalk beneath the soil surface .
These stalk cells die ; they sacrifice themselves so the spores can be dispersed to new feeding grounds .
The following is a possible new chapter to be added to Refactoring HTML in the accessibility section .
I ’m throwing this in fairly late in the editing process , so I ’d appreciate any thoughts , comments , or criticisms you might have about this .
In particular , I ’d appreciate any cases you can think of where autocomplete is not appropriate .
For what it ’s worth , I ’ve pretty well convinced myself that usernames and passwords are not such a case .
That is , autocompleting usernames and passwords definitely increases accessibility and usually increases security .
I do n’t intend to explain why it improves security in this chapter , but if anyone wants to disagree with that , I ’ll explain why in the comments .
Remove autocomplete= ” off ” attributes where appropriate .
< form action= " / login " method= " post " autocomplete= " off " >
< p >< label > E-Mail Address : < input type =" text " name = " e1 " autocomplete= " off " />
</ label ></p> < p >< label > Password : < input type=" password " name = " p1 " /> </ label ></p> < input type =" submit " title= " Login " autocomplete= " off " / > </ form >
< form action= " / login " method= " post " autocomplete= " off " >
< p >< label > E-Mail Address : < input type =" text " name = " e1 " /> </ label ></p> < p >< label > Password : < input type=" password " name = " p1 " /> </ label ></p> < input type =" submit " title= " Register " /> </ form >
Motivation
Autocompletion helps users avoid wasting time retyping repetitive content .
However , it ’s especially helpful to physically impaired users ( including the very young and very old ) who have much greater difficulty typing than average .
Autocompletion also improves security in login forms by avoiding the need for users to write down passwords , or reuse the same password from site to site .
Login forms that prevent users from using autocomplete are far more likely to be compromised by out - of - band mechanisms such a shoulder surfing .
Potential Trade - offs
Many webmasters believe that autocompleting logins is a security risk .
It may indeed be so on a shared computer , such as one in a public library .
However only the end user can determine whether or not their computer is shared .
Users are always free not to remember a username or password , or to tell the browser to forget stored information , if they use a shared computer .
That said , I do recommend that lab managers configure their computers to forget all stored information ( not just forms but cookies , bookmarks , history , and other potentially private data ) between browser restarts .
Mechanics
Search your HTML pages for autocomplete= ” off ” .
This can appear on the form element or on individual input elements .
When you find it , consider whether this is really appropriate .
Some forms really do expect different input each time .
For instance , the main query field in a search engine likely doesnâ€™t see a lot of repeated content from the same user , or at least not enough to make autocomplete helpful .
Most users search for something different every time they visit .
These forms may legitimately use autocomplete= ” off ” .
Therefore you should not perform a blanket search and replace that removes all autocomplete = ” off ” attributes .
However , in the vast majority of cases , autocomplete = " off " merely inconveniences users for little or no good reason .
if you ’re in doubt , remove it .
The user never has to use autocomplete , but they should not be prevented from doing so by the server ’s whim .
Orange County sheriff ’s deputies on Tuesday defended their decision to use a stun gun on a 15 - year - old autistic boy who ran away from his parents and later dashed into traffic .
Using the Taser in this case “ was the right thing to do , ” said Jim Amormino , a sheriff ’s spokesman .
“ If that were your son , would you want him Tased or hit by a car ?
The deputy made the right decision .
. . .
It could have saved [ the boy ’s ] life . ”
But Doris Karras , mother of Taylor Karras , said deputies did not need to use the Taser gun , particularly because she had called various police agencies to alert them that her son was missing .
She said her son would have followed deputies ’ directions if he had n’t felt threatened .
“ This was a very aggressive response , ” she said .
She said her son “ did n’t have any weapon on him .
He did n’t even have a pencil . ”

Taylor fled during a visit to the Regional Center of Orange County in Westminster about 11:30 a.m. Monday .
The family had gone there for counseling , which the boy did not want .
About nine hours later , his mother saw him about one block from their home -- 16 miles from the center -- on the ground and handcuffed by deputies .
Amormino said Tustin police called the Sheriff ’s Department after a pedestrian reported a suspicious person .
Taylor was pushing a shopping cart down Newport Avenue near La Loma Drive , near his home in North Tustin .
With no money , he apparently had walked home .
Doris Karras said her son , who is 5 feet 10 and has a beard , looks older than 15 .

Amormino said Taylor yelled something when approached by a deputy , then ran across Newport Avenue , causing two cars to swerve .
It was then that a deputy shot him with a Taser gun .
The deputy handcuffed the youth to keep him out of traffic , Amormino said .
Taser guns use compressed nitrogen to propel two darts that attach to the body .
The darts are connected to the gun by a wire and deliver a 50,000 - volt shock at five - second intervals to incapacitate a suspect .

Slackjaw That Whole Puppy - Burning Thing by Jim Knipfel
Not long after I moved to Minneapolis , I found myself in possession of an incredibly , almost criminally bad batch of crystal meth .
Always of a mind to share the wealth , though , I wrapped one tiny glassine envelope up tight , and taped it inside a cassette box , which I included in a large package of other various what - nots which I mailed down to Grinch , who was in the middle of his last semester at Madison .
A few days later , when he called to thank me for the what - not , I asked him if hed found the speed .
" What speed ? "
My guts froze up for a second .
Grinch and I were always mailing drugs back and forth to each other , and wed never had any trouble .
Had somebody finally sniffed it out along the way ?
If so , I had nothing to worry about we never put return addresses ( or at least not correct ones ) on these packages , and we usually just addressed them to " Resident . "
Problem here was that Grinch was the only resident at this particular address , and had been for some time .
And when you re looking at a hand - addressed package to " Resident , " something might seem awfully fishy .
" Shit did you look at the tape ? "
" I havent listened to it yet , no . "
" No , I listening to it doesnt matter do you have it around ? "
" Yeah , sure hold on . "
He set the phone down and I heard him rustling through the piles of papers and books and beer cans which littered his apartment .
A minute later he was back .
" Yeah , here it is . "
" Okay , open it up . " " Yeah ? "
" Take the tape out . "
This was taking much too much effort .
" Yeah ? "
" Now take the label out . " " Yeah ? " " Now Christunfold ...the...label . "
" Oh there it is .
Thanks . "
I sighed in relief .
" You re welcome .
Now put it to good use .
Get what you can out of it . "
Seconds after we got off the phone , apparently , Grinch inhaled the speed , and put it to something that was , I guess , at least akin to good use .
He called me back the next night to let me know what hed done .
" That crank you sent was horrible it burned the hell out of my nose but I guess it did the trick . "
" How so ? " " Well , right after it hit I was sorta bored I sat down to my typewriter and wrote a letter to the editor . "
" That s certainly productive . "
" Then I wrote it four more times , and sent them off to all the local papers the State Journal , the Cardinal , Isthmus , everybody . "
" What , you re upset about Cuba ? " " No , see thereve been all these Young Republicans and ROTC types holding these protests lately .
These pro-war things . "
" So ? " I wasnt aware that we were in a war at the time , and besides , Grinch was the type I was too who always celebrated a good little war .
A war always livened things up .
" It just really rankled meall these soft , white , corn - fed jocks whove never experienced anything even close to a war they have no fucking idea what its like . "
" Yeah ? "
Grinch had done a stint in the Army but had never seen any combat .
Still , though , he had a point .
" So I wrote these letters , and said that the American people have no fucking clue as to what the horrors of war are all about .
And in order to make them aware of what the horrors of war are all about , I said that the Nihilist Workers 
Party that s you and mewere going to take a six month - old puppy to the steps of the State Capitol at noon on October 13th , douse it in gasoline , and set it on fire . "
I was silent for a moment while I let this sink in .
" You dont actually have a puppy , do you ? " " Nope . "
" You realize what s going to happen if they print those letters in a town like Madison ? "
" All hell , " he said , then hung up and sat back , waiting for it to hit .
It hit the next morning , and it hit hard .
His phone started ringing about 6 a.m. , and the first television crew was at his door at 11 .
I figured if I was part of this I was the only other member of the Nihilist Workers  Party that I should probably zip down to Madison to watch his back as best I could .
Hopefully hed watch mine , too , though I knew I couldnt count on that .
When I got there the next day , things hadnt quieted down at all .
Quite the opposite , in fact it was snowballing out of control .
The AP wire picked up the story , so suddenly we were appearing in the Chicago Tribune and the New York Times .
Dan Rather even said a few words about us on the television .
That much was all delightful .
Wed pulled media pranks together before , and theyd always worked like a charm .
Nothing quite this big , though , and it was getting out of hand fast .
We couldnt walk the streets because Grinchs picture had been splashed all over the newspapers and a lot of people were out to hurt him .
The people in Madison have no sense of humor whatsoever .
We couldnt stay at his apartment , because newspapers and t.v. stations had set up camp in front of the place .
So we were hiding out at Nottingham co-op , an old hippie house where Grinch used to live , and were shuttled around town hunkered down in the back seats of friends  cars .
One newspaper ran an editorial cartoon of Grinch tied to a stake , with a bunch of dogs setting him on fire .
The radio talk shows were awash in theories that we were government agents , out to discredit the Left .
Some folks proclaimed us fascists .
Other folks called in , claiming they knew who we were , and that we were extremely dangerous and insane people .
We found this very odd I mean yes , it was just a prank , but it was the most liberal prank wed ever pulled .
The original idea was that on the day of the threatened " puppy burning , " Grinch was going to hold a news conference on the capitol steps , to point out the hypocrisy of the gathered mobi.e.
" thousands of people real human beings are tortured and killed all over the world every day , and here you are wasting your valuable anger on a little puppy . "
We never got a chance to do that .
Not the way we planned to , anyway .
Daily " Anti-Puppy Burning " protests started popping up around the city .
The letters and phone calls were pouring in to Madisons philosophy department from all over the country ( the AP story made a point of stating that we were philosophy students ) : " Please dont burn the puppy ! " on 25 little sheets of paper , each signed by a student in Mrs. Wentworths 3rd grade class somewhere in Oklahoma .
" If one hair on that puppy is injured , two ( 2 ) members of your organization will be killed by contract , " read a Western Union telegram .
" Well , that would pretty much wipe us out , wouldnt it ? " I said .
Then one day the cops showed up at Nottingham , looking for Grinch .
We werent sleeping much that week we were living on speed and adrenaline , trying to keep an eye out for that random brick to the head , or that stinky hippie posse waiting in the next alley .
So by the time the cops showed up , we werent thinking too clearly .
All the hubbub , it seems , gave someone the idea to go back and check out our criminal recordsand , lo and behold , Grinch had an outstanding warrant .
Nothing major .
An old speeding ticket or something like that .
But it was enough , the cops figured , to get Grinch out of the picture and quiet this whole mess down for awhile .
Unfortunately when they showed up with the warrant they frisked him , and also discovered that he was carrying a four - inch blade , half an inch longer than the law allows .
So they took him in .
Alone now , glad that nobody recognized me , I started thinking that there was one big flaw in Grinchs original speed - addled plan .
Okay , you say you re going to burn a puppy in public .
The shit hits the fan .
Then you show up , puppyless , and tell the folks with the torches and the pitchforks that there never was a puppy , that this was all a practical joke , and that they re all hypocrites .
That s all fine and good except for one little thing .
If all hell does indeed break loose according to plan , if your life is threatened several times over , and you show up on the appointed day without the puppy , it doesnt matter what you say , how scathing your commentary , how carefully reasoned your logic the mob will be convinced that they were the reason no puppy was harmed .
The mob , in their collective , singular mind , will be convinced that they won ; that they convinced you of the error of your ways ; that because of them , you finally saw the light .
It simply doesnt matter that they proved your original theory to be truetruer , even , than you could have imagined .
When Grinch was finally able to hold his final press conference , a couple weeks after I had returned to Minneapolis , that s exactly what happened .
Once again , the mob won , and won handily .
Grinch was quietly given his degree and kindly asked to leave town .

Yesterday I added my name to Rep. Inslee ’s resolution ( H.RES.589 ) to investigate whether Attorney General Gonzales should be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors .
I am a member of the House Judiciary Committee , which is the Committee that prepares articles of impeachment .
I realize many of you have been following the ongoing developments concerning the potential impeachment of AG Gonzales .
As my staff and I research the specific grounds on which to impeach him , I welcome your input .
And while I ’ll see you on Saturday at Yearly Kos for a panel discussion entitled " Countering Corruption in Congress and the Bush Administration , " I still have work to do here in the U.S. House .
Before we recess , we must continue working hard toward the reauthorization and expansion of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) , while passing two more appropriations bills .
See you in Chicago ,

The Wikimedia Foundation and Linterweb announces the release of Wikipedia Version 0.5 , a compact disc collection of around 2,000 articles from the English Wikipedia .
The project paves the way for many such collections , with larger releases planned in a variety of languages .
Articles were chosen based on criteria for quality and importance set by the Wikipedia community .
Topics covered include , among others , geography , arts , literature , science , history , and natural sciences .
Users can browse articles using a built - in search engine or by surfing navigational pages .
Martin A. Walker , a chemistry professor at the State University of New York at Potsdam , played a central role in the production of Wikipedia Version 0.5 , and in setting criteria for article selection .
“ Although this is only a test release , we really tried to produce something the Wikipedia community could feel proud of .
We wanted to cover the major topics , while also including a selection of articles considered to be the very best of Wikipedia .
These ‘ featured articles ’ aim to be well written and comprehensive , and also free from errors , bias , vandalism and marketing ” , states Walker .
The community members are welcome to take part in this innovating project , either by helping for the selection process , or by helping at the development of the open - source project Kiwix , which is the software part of the CD .
“ We hope that everyone is able to participate at the future development of the Encyclopedia , and be proud of its reach . ” , Pascal Martin emphasizes .
Wikimedia France was at the forefront of bringing the CD collection to fruition , and securing the deal with Linterweb , a French technology company .
In the future , Wikimedia France also aims to produce a French language CD through Linterweb .
The French / English collaboration has proved very successful , and the two groups continue to share ideas and resources .
The Wikipedia Version 0.5 CD is compatible with Windows ( back to 98 ) , Macintosh ( Intel ) OS X and Linux x86 .
It can be purchased at the price of $ 13.99 .
It warmed my heart .
There I was walking along the produce aisle at the new Porter Square Star when all of a sudden I heard ``Please stand back .
The mist is about to begin . ''
They must have read my GSB message and taken action .
No more Gene Kelly Singing in the Rain .
Only a dry , boring , but functional and polite warning message left in its place .
I continued shopping and smiling about my achievement and did n't notice the man who was following me until the eggplant that he carried with him came crashing into my skull .
It was a rotten eggplant .
I stumbled around trying to wipe the seeds out of my eyes and that 's the last thing I remember until I woke up .
At first I was a little disoriented , but after a while I got used to the lighting and my head cleared a bit and I realized that I was in the employee back area at the Porter Square Star .
I had been there before , searching for a bathroom .
Then there was the time I went posing as a USDA inspector running around with a Grade D Meat stamp .
But that 's another story .
So I shook my head clear and it was then that I noticed him sitting on a bench across from me , plugging in a portable stereo .
`` What happened , '' I asked .
`` You started having a sneezing fit after being covered by eggplant bits .
Apparently you 're allergic to raw , rotten eggplant .
Anyway , you hit your head on a steel display case while sneezing . ''
``Wait , why am I tied to this appliance dolly ?
And who the heck are you ?
And what the heck are you doing ? , '' I asked , not disguising my irritation .
`` Shut up !
That 's enough out of you .
I 'm the guy who was responsible for adding a little music to the produce counter and I 'm the guy who lost his job because of you .
I 'm also the guy who 's now going to exact some revenge .
So you do n't like my music , huh ?
You punk . '' ` ` Wwwwwhat are you gggoing to do to me ? , '' I asked .
``I 'm going to leave you there , tied up and listening to one of those stations that plays YOUR kind of music . ''
And with that he left and I started laughing .
Here I thought that I was going to be bludgeoned with produce and instead I was being sentenced to listen to WFNX until someone finds me .
Some revenge !
So I listed to the music for a while .
I knew all the songs and soon started singing along ... ` `I wo n't pay I wo n't pay .
NO waaay !
Nah nah why do n't you get a job ? ''
Cool .
I like The Offspring .
``Every morning there 's a halo hanging from the corner of my girlfriend 's four post bed ...''
Cool ...
I know this one , too .
But after several hours , it got worse .
Deborah Harry chimed in : ``Maria , you 've got to see her !
Go insane and out of your mind . ''
Uh , o.k. , whatever .
`` You make me feel like I want to be a dumb blonde in the center for the girl next door . ''
Paula Cole , what were you thinking ?
``Wanna put my tender , heart in a blender , watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion . ''
Tender heart in a blender ?
The mental image is more appealing than the lyrics .
This was starting to make me ill .
And it went on this way for several hours .
The last thing I remember was sheer disgust as Natalie Imbruglia crooned : ``think of all the bubbles of love we 've made ' '
I woke up Friday night in the alley behind Star with a note pinned to my chest :
Now what do you think of Gene Kelly ?
Thanks to Christian for filling in for me while I was , er , tied up last week .
Come help me recover at this week 's G I R L S C O U T B E N E F I T 5:35 , 7ai , see you there .

It is not quite as sophisticated as C - 3PO from Star Wars or Data from Star Trek , but earth engineers have managed to create a young android .
Watch the baby bot in action ...
Covered in a grey putty - like silicone skin the baby bot can roll around and ' speak ' .
It can even take a few steps if encouraged enough .
Built by Japanese scientists Minoru Asada and Hiroshi Ishiguro ( who famously created an android twins of himself ) , the robot called CB2 weighs 33kg and stands 130 cm tall .
It has 197 tactile sensors embedded in its outer layer and 51 compressed air - powered actuators , which allow it to react to touch .
When CB2's shoulders are tapped , it blinks as if surprised , stops moving , and turns its gaze toward the person who touched it .
It will also try and grab a toy dangled in front of it .
Future research at the Japanese Science and Technology Agency in Osaka will attempt to improve the body functions of CB2 - whose full name is ' Child - robot with Biomimetic Body . '
They also want to write software allowing it to walk and talk like a three - year - old .
Formatting may be lacking as a result .

Posted on September 13 , 2007 , Andrew Texas GameStop Manager Only Sells to Good Students
If you want to buy games from a certain GameStop in Texas , you ’d better make sure your grades are in check , first .
A GameStop manager in southern Dallas , Texas is requiring children who come to the store to purchase games to have their parents confirm that they are getting good grades .
And not only that , but the kids have to mind their manners , too .
“ They know when they come in here , they do not curse , they do not use the N - word , pull your clothes up , ” Brandon Scott , the GameStop manager , said in a recent article by WFAA - TV .
“ I ’m probably going to get in trouble for this , but to me it ’s worth it , because the kids understand that somebody cares . ”
Some students might think this is a bit harsh , but he ’s all about the giving , too .
“ If you give me straight As with your teachers signature , endorsing it and your parent up here , I ’ll buy you a brand new game , ” Scott said in the article .
It will be interesting to see if anyone higher up in the GameStop chain of command will take any action .
Retailers do have the right to refuse service to anyone , but I ’m not sure if any retailers have come up with anything like this before .
The GameStop in question is located along the I - 20 in Texas , though no specific information was given in the article .

Anxious customers jammed the phone lines and website of Countrywide Bank and crowded its branch offices to pull out their savings because of concerns about the financial problems of the mortgage lender that owns the bank .
Countrywide Financial Corp. , the biggest home - loan company in the nation , sought Thursday to assure depositors and the financial industry that both it and its bank were fiscally stable .
And federal regulators said they were n’t alarmed by the volume of withdrawals from the bank .
The mortgage lender said it would further tighten its loan standards and make fewer large mortgages .
Those moves could make it harder to get a home loan and further depress the housing market in California and other states .
The rush to withdraw money -- by depositors that included a former Los Angeles Kings star hockey player and an executive of a rival home - loan company -- came a day after fears arose that Countrywide Financial could file for bankruptcy protection because of a worsening credit crunch stemming from the sub - prime mortgage meltdown .
The parent firm borrowed $ 11.5 billion Thursday by using up an existing line of credit from 40 banks , saying the money would help the lender meet its funding needs and continue to grow .
But stock investors , apparently alarmed that the company felt compelled to use the credit line , sent Countrywide ’s already battered stock down an additional 11 % .
At Countrywide Bank offices , in a scene rare since the U.S. savings - and - loan crisis ended in the early ‘ 90s , so many people showed up to take out some or all of their money that in some cases they had to leave their names .
In West Los Angeles , a Countrywide supervisor brought in from another office served coffee to more than 25 people waiting calmly for their turn with the one clerk who could help them .
Bill Ashmore drove his Porsche Cayenne to Countrywide ’s Laguna Niguel office and waited half an hour to cash out $ 500,000 , which he then wired to an account at Bank of America .
“ It ’s because of the fear of the bankruptcy , ” said Ashmore , president of Irvine ’s Impac Mortgage Holdings , which escaped bankruptcy itself recently by shutting down virtually all its lending and laying off hundreds of employees .
“ It ’s got my wife totally freaked out , ” he said .
“ I just do n’t want to deal with it .
I do n’t care about losing 90 days ’ interest , I do n’t care if it ’s FDIC - insured -- I just want it out . ”
Customers , most of whom said they were acting just in case , said they went to the lightly staffed branches because they could n’t get through to the bank via its toll - free number or its slow - moving website .
“ I doubt it will go under , but I want to protect myself , ” said Rogie Vachon , who was the Kings ’ most valuable player for several years in the ‘ 70s .
Vachon said he went to the West L.A. branch to withdraw some money because his account balance exceeded the limit on insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
In a statement , the bank said : “ It is very important to remember that Countrywide Bank is well capitalized , with FDIC - insured deposits , and is one of the largest banks in the United States , with assets over $ 107 billion . ”
The bank added that it had significant access to outside capital and was still highly rated by debt - rating firms .
As for parent firm Countrywide Financial , the mortgage giant said draining its credit line would allow it to continue operations while refocusing its business on the “ plain vanilla ” mortgage loans that can be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government - sponsored mortgage finance companies .
Countrywide said it planned to fund more mortgages through Countrywide Bank and have the bank invest in certain loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac wo n’t buy , such as “ jumbo ” mortgages , which in California are defined as those over $ 417,000 .
Countrywide recently was funding about $ 40 billion a month in mortgages .
Of those , about half qualified to be sold to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae , and half were “ nonconforming ” loans the agencies do n’t buy , including sub - prime mortgages to higher - risk borrowers as well as jumbo loans , which account for 43 % of all mortgages issued in Southern California .
Company executives declined to discuss how the heavy withdrawals at Countrywide Bank branches Thursday might interfere with that strategy .
Mortgage industry executives , however , said that although Countrywide Bank was the nation ’s third - largest savings and loan , after Washington Mutual and Wachovia Bank ’s World Savings unit , it was far too small to absorb the entire $ 20 billion a month in nonconforming loans Countrywide Financial produced .
As a result , the company is likely to make fewer loans while applying more stringent criteria in deciding who gets them -- a transition that could further pinch the strained housing market .
In recent months , sales of high - end houses have been stronger than those for cheaper homes .
Now , with a pullback in larger loans by Countrywide and other major lenders , the weakness at the low end is likely to spread upward , said Esmael Adibi , director of Chapman University ’s Anderson Center for Economic Research .
“ The implication will be declining home prices , higher foreclosures , a significant slowdown in spending by consumers , ” he said .
As home sales fall further , “ ultimately job growth will slowly deteriorate . ”
Those long - term concerns were n’t the first thing on the minds of depositors withdrawing money Thursday .
At a branch near Countrywide ’s corporate headquarters in Calabasas on Thursday , a flood of spooked customers seeking to withdraw their certificates of deposit and money - market accounts overwhelmed the small staff .
The Countrywide employees were forced to resort to taking down names and asking people to wait it out or come back later .
“ I ’m at the age where I ca n’t afford to take the risk , ” a 69 - year - old retiree who asked not to be identified said after transferring money out of his money market account .
“ I ’ll gladly put it back as soon as I know the storm is over . ”
After reading news reports of Countrywide ’s troubles , Elsie Ahrens of Calabasas decided to close two of her CD accounts at Countrywide .
“ It ’s not worth it , ” said Ahrens , 42 .
“ I do n’t think it ’s going to go under , but you never know . ”
Ahrens , who runs a voice and data business , took her money and opened a new account at Bank of America , which she said felt more secure and offered a comparable interest rate .
In Laguna Niguel , Ashmore , the Impac Mortgage president , remarked on how the credit problems stemming from sub - prime loans had filtered down to a local bank branch .
“ It started out with this global credit crunch we ’ve been reading about , ” he said as another Countrywide depositor left the bank ’s office .
“ It ’s now gotten down to affecting people like him and me who are closing our accounts . ”
The other depositor shook his head as he climbed into his car .
“ It ’s all over , ” he said , and drove away .

In 1905 , a team of construction workers in the small village of Shoreham , New York labored to erect a truly extraordinary structure .
Over a period of several years the men had managed to assemble the framework and wiring for the 187 - foot - tall Wardenclyffe Tower , in spite of severe budget shortfalls and a few engineering snags .
The project was overseen by its designer , the eccentric - yet - ingenious inventor Nikola Tesla ( 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943 ) .
Atop his tower was perched a fifty - five ton dome of conductive metals , and beneath it stretched an iron root system that penetrated more than 300 feet into the Earth ’s crust .
“ In this system that I have invented , it is necessary for the machine to get a grip of the earth , ” he explained , “ otherwise it can not shake the earth .
It has to have a grip … so that the whole of this globe can quiver . ”
Though it was far from completion , it was rumored to have been tested on several occasions , with spectacular , crowd - pleasing results .
The ultimate purpose of this unique structure was to change the world forever .
Tesla ’s inventions had already changed the world on several occasions , most notably when he developed modern alternating current technology .
He had also won fame for his victory over Thomas Edison in the well - publicized “ battle of currents , ” where he proved that his alternating current was far more practical and safe than Edison - brand direct current .
Soon his technology dominated the world ’s developing electrical infrastructure , and by 1900 he was widely regarded as America ’s greatest electrical engineer .
This reputation was reinforced by his other major innovations , including the Tesla coil , the radio transmitter , and fluorescent lamps .
In 1891 , Nikola Tesla gave a lecture for the members of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City , where he made a striking demonstration .
In each hand he held a gas discharge tube , an early version of the modern fluorescent bulb .
The tubes were not connected to any wires , but nonetheless they glowed brightly during his demonstration .
Tesla explained to the awestruck attendees that the electricity was being transmitted through the air by the pair of metal sheets which sandwiched the stage .
He went on to speculate how one might increase the scale of this effect to transmit wireless power and information over a broad area , perhaps even the entire Earth .
As was often the case , Tesla ’s audience was engrossed but bewildered .

Back at his makeshift laboratory at Pike ’s Peak in Colorado Springs , the eccentric scientist continued to wring the secrets out of electromagnetism to further explore this possibility .
He rigged his equipment with the intent to produce the first lightning - scale electrical discharges ever accomplished by mankind , a feat which would allow him to test many of his theories about the conductivity of the Earth and the sky .
For this purpose he erected a 142 - foot mast on his laboratory roof , with a copper sphere on the tip .
The tower ’s substantial wiring was then routed through an exceptionally large high - voltage Tesla coil in the laboratory below .
On the night of his experiment , following a one - second test charge which momentarily set the night alight with an eerie blue hum , Tesla ordered his assistant to fully electrify the tower .
Though his notes do not specifically say so , one can only surmise that Tesla stood at Pike ’s Peak and cackled diabolically as the night sky over Colorado was cracked by the man -made lightning machine .
Colossal bolts of electricity arced hundreds of feet from the tower ’s top to lick the landscape .
A curious blue corona soon enveloped the crackling equipment .
Millions of volts charged the atmosphere for several moments , but the awesome display ended abruptly when the power suddenly failed .
All of the windows throughout Colorado Springs went dark as the local power station ’s industrial - sized generator collapsed under the strain .
But amidst such dramatic discharges , Tesla confirmed that the Earth itself could be used as an electrical conductor , and verified some of his suspicions regarding the conductivity of the ionosphere .
In later tests , he recorded success in an attempt to illuminate light bulbs from afar , though the exact conditions of these experiments have been lost to obscurity .
In any case , Tesla became convinced that his dream of world - wide wireless electricity was feasible .
In 1900 , famed financier J.P. Morgan learned of Tesla ’s convictions after reading an article in Century Magazine , wherein the scientist described a global network of high - voltage towers which could one day control the weather , relay text and images wirelessly , and provide ubiquitous electricity via the atmosphere .
Morgan , hoping to capitalize on the future of wireless telegraphy , immediately invested $ 150,000 to relocate Tesla ’s lab to Long Island to construct a pilot plant for this “ World Wireless System . ”
Construction of Wardenclyffe Tower and its dedicated power generating facility began the following year .
Tesla 's lab at pike 's peak
In December 1901 , a scant few months after construction began , a competing scientist named Guglielmo Marconi executed the world ’s first trans -Atlantic wireless telegraph signal .
Tesla ’s investors were deeply troubled by the development despite the fact that Marconi borrowed from seventeen Tesla patents to accomplish his feat .
Though Marconi ’s plans were considerably less ambitious in scale , his apparatus was also considerably less expensive .
Work at Wardenclyffe continued , but Tesla realized that this his competitor ’s success with simple wireless telegraphy had greatly diminished the likelihood of further investments in his own , much grander project .
In 1908 , Tesla described his sensational aspirations in an article for Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony magazine :
“ As soon as completed , it will be possible for a business man in New York to dictate instructions , and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London or elsewhere .
He will be able to call up , from his desk , and talk to any telephone subscriber on the globe , without any change whatever in the existing equipment .
An inexpensive instrument , not bigger than a watch , will enable its bearer to hear anywhere , on sea or land , music or song , the speech of a political leader , the address of an eminent man of science , or the sermon of an eloquent clergyman , delivered in some other place , however distant .
In the same manner any picture , character , drawing , or print can be transferred from one to another place .
Millions of such instruments can be operated from but one plant of this kind .
More important than all of this , however , will be the transmission of power , without wires , which will be shown on a scale large enough to carry conviction . ”
In essence , Tesla ’s global power grid was designed to “ pump ” the planet with electricity which would intermingle with the natural telluric currents that move throughout the Earth ’s crust and oceans .
At the same time , towers like the one at Wardenclyffe would fling columns of raw energy skyward into the electricity - friendly ionosphere fifty miles up .
To tap into this energy conduit , customers ’ homes would be equipped with a buried ground connection and a relatively small spherical antenna on the roof , thereby creating a low - resistance path to close the giant Earth - ionosphere circuit .
Oceangoing ships could use a similar antenna to draw power from the network while at sea .
In addition to electricity , these currents could carry information over great distances by bundling radio - frequency energy along with the power , much like the modern technology to send high - speed Internet data over power lines .
Nikola Tesla
Given his supporting experimental data and previous engineering accomplishments , there was little reason to doubt the veracity of Tesla ’s claims .
But building the power station , the huge wooden tower , and the fifty - five ton conductive dome depleted the original investment money relatively quickly , leading to chronic funding shortages .
The complications were further compounded by a stock market crash in 1901 which doubled the cost of building materials and sent investors scurrying for financial cover .
The Wardenclyffe team tested their tower a handful of times during construction , and the results were very encouraging ; but the project soon devoured Tesla ’s personal savings , and it became increasingly clear that no new investments were forthcoming .
In 1905 , having exhausted all practical financial options , the construction efforts were abandoned .
Regarding the project ’s demise , Tesla stated :
“ It is not a dream , it is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering , only expensive ⁠— blind , faint - hearted , doubting world ! [… ]
Humanity is not yet sufficiently advanced to be willingly led by the discoverer ’s keen searching sense .
But who knows ?
Perhaps it is better in this present world of ours that a revolutionary idea or invention instead of being helped and patted , be hampered and ill - treated in its adolescence ⁠— by want of means , by selfish interest , pedantry , stupidity and ignorance ; that it be attacked and stifled ; that it pass through bitter trials and tribulations , through the strife of commercial existence .
So do we get our light .
So all that was great in the past was ridiculed , condemned , combatted , suppressed ⁠— only to emerge all the more powerfully , all the more triumphantly from the struggle . ”
If Tesla ’s plans had come to fruition , the pilot plant would have been merely the first of many .
Such “ magnifying transmitter ” towers would have peppered the globe , saturating the planet with free electricity and wireless communication as early as the 1920s .
Instead , the futuristic facility ’s potential went untapped for over a decade , until the tower was finally demolished for salvage in 1917 .
The fall of Wardenclyffe thrust the brilliant inventor into a deep depression and financial distress , and in the years that followed his colleagues began to seriously doubt his mental well - being .
His eccentricities became increasingly exaggerated , underscored by his tendency to bring home and care for the injured pigeons he encountered during his daily visits to the park .
He also developed an unnatural fear of germs , washing his hands compulsively and refusing to eat any food which had not been disinfected through boiling .
But his mind remained pregnant with groundbreaking ideas , as he demonstrated when he described radar technology in 1917 , almost twenty years before it became a reality .
In 1928 , aged seventy - two years , he filed one of his last patents ; it described an ingenious lightweight flying machine that was an early precursor to today ’s tilt - rotor Vertical Short Takeoff and Landing ( VSTOL ) planes such as the V - 22 Osprey .
One of our Damn Interesting original propaganda - style science posters
Nikola Tesla shuffled off this mortal coil in 1943 , suffering a heart attack alone in his hotel room .
Though he kept copious diaries of his experiments and ideas throughout his life , they were notoriously vague and lacking in technical details .
He preferred to rely on his photographic memory for such nuances , therefore much of his knowledge went with him to the grave .
Some modern investigations and calculations , however , do support Tesla ’s contention that wireless electricity is not only feasible , but it may have even been a superior alternative to the extensive and costly grid of power lines which crisscross our globe today .
Had Wardenclyffe been completed without interruption , Tesla may have once again managed to alter the course of history .
Instant access to power , information , pirated phonograph cylinders , and lewd photos of bare - ankled floozies on the TeslaNet may have ushered in the Information Age almost a century ahead of schedule , making today ’s world a very different place indeed .
Perhaps one day we will enjoy the future that Tesla envisioned , albeit a bit behind schedule .
Story Highlights • Jose Luis de Jesus Miranda , a minister , says he is God
• De Jesus preaches that there is no devil and no sin
• His church claims thousands of members in more than 30 countries
Adjust font size :
MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) --
The minister has the number 666 tattooed on his arm .
But Jose Luis de Jesus Miranda is not your typical minister .
De Jesus , or " Daddy " as his thousands of followers call him , does not merely pray to God :
He says he is God .
" The spirit that is in me is the same spirit that was in Jesus of Nazareth , " de Jesus says .
De Jesus ' claims of divinity have angered Christian leaders , who say he is a fake .
Religious experts say he may be something much more dangerous , a cult leader who really believes he is God .
( Watch followers get 666 tattoos for their leader )
" He 's in their heads , he 's inside the heads of those people , " says Prof.
Daniel Alvarez , a religion expert at Florida International University who has debated some of de Jesus ' followers .
" De Jesus speaks with a kind of conviction that makes me consider him more like David Koresh or Jim Jones . "
Is de Jesus really a cult leader like David Koresh , who died with more than 70 of his Branch Davidian followers in a fiery end to a standoff with federal authorities , or Jim Jones , the founder of the Peoples Temple who committed mass suicide with 900 followers in 1978 ?
Prophets ' spoke to me '
De Jesus and his believers say their church -- " Creciendo en Gracia , " Spanish for " Growing in grace " -- is misunderstood .
Followers of the movement say they have proof that their minister is divine and that their church will one day soon be a major faith in the world .
But even de Jesus concedes that he is an unlikely leader of a church that claims thousands of members in more than 30 countries .
De Jesus , 61 , grew up poor in Puerto Rico .
He says he served stints in prison there for petty theft and says he was a heroin addict .
De Jesus says he learned he was Jesus reincarnate when he was visited in a dream by angels .
" The prophets , they spoke about me .
It took me time to learn that , but I am what they were expecting , what they have been expecting for 2,000 years , " de Jesus says .
The church that he began building 20 years ago in Miami resembles no other :
Followers have protested Christian churches in Miami and Latin America , disrupting services and smashing crosses and statues of Jesus .
De Jesus preaches there is no devil and no sin .
His followers , he says , literally can do no wrong in God 's eyes .
The church calls itself the " Government of God on Earth " and uses a seal similar to the United States .
Doing God 's work with a Lexus and Rolex
If Creciendo en Gracia is an atypical religious group , de Jesus also does not fit the mold of the average church leader .
De Jesus flouts traditional vows of poverty .
He says he has a church - paid salary of $ 136,000 but lives more lavishly than that .
During an interview , he showed off a diamond - encrusted Rolex to a CNN crew and said he has three just like them .
He travels in armored Lexuses and BMWs , he says , for his safety .
All are gifts from his devoted followers .
And what about the tattoo of 666 on his arm ?
Although it 's a number usually associated with Satan , not the son of God , de Jesus says that 666 and the Antichrist are , like him , misunderstood .
The Antichrist is not the devil , de Jesus tells his congregation ; he 's the being who replaces Jesus on Earth .
" Antichrist is the best person in the world , " he says .
" Antichrist means do n't put your eyes on Jesus because Jesus of Nazareth was n't a Christian .
Antichrist means do not put your eyes on Jesus Christ of Nazareth .
Put it on Jesus after the cross . "
And de Jesus says that means him .
So far , de Jesus says that his flock has n't been scared off by his claims of being the Antichrist .
In a show of the sway he holds over the group , 30 members of his congregation Tuesday went to a tattoo parlor to have 666 also permanently etched onto their skin .
He may wield influence over them , but his followers say do n't expect them to go the way of people who believed in David Koresh and Jim Jones .
Just by finding de Jesus , they say , they have achieved their purpose .
" If somebody tells us drink some Kool - Aid and we 'll go to heaven , that 's not true .
We are already in heavenly places , " follower Martita Roca told CNN after having 666 tattooed onto her ankle .
“ Pascal is for building pyramids –imposing , breathtaking , static structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place .
Lisp is for building organisms–imposing , breathtaking , dynamic structures built by squads fitting fluctuating myriads of simpler organisms into place . ”

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
In this post I ’m going to talk mostly about a keynote speech Alan Kay gave at the 1997 OOPSLA conference , called “ The Computer Revolution Has n’t Happened Yet , ” how he relates computing to biological systems , and his argument that software systems , particularly OOP , should emulate biological systems .
In part 1 I talked a bit about Peter Denning ’s declaration that “ Computing is a Natural Science ” .
Please note :
There is a bit of mature language in this speech .
It ’s one sentence .
If you are easily offended , errm…plug your ears , avert your eyes , whatever .
It ’s where he ’s talking about Dr. Dijkstra .
This speech reminds me that when I started hearing about gene therapies being used to treat disease , I got the idea that this was a form of programming –reprogramming cells to operate differently , using the “ machine code ” of the cell : DNA .
While scientists are discovering that there ’s computation going on around us in places we did not suspect , Kay was , and still is , trying to get us developers to make our software “ alive , ” capable of handling change and growth–to scale –without being disturbed to a significant degree .
That ’s what his conception of OOP was based on to begin with .
A key part of this is a late - bound system which allows changes to be made dynamically .
Kay makes the point as well that the internet is like this , though he only had a tiny hand in it .
One of the most striking things to me he ’s touched on in this speech , which he ’s given several times , though it ’s a bit different each time , is that computing introduces a new kind of math , a finite mathematics that he says is more practical and more closely resembles things that are real , as opposed to the non-bounded quality of classical mathematics , which often does not .
Maybe I ’m wrong , but it seems to me from what he says , he sees this finite math as better than classical math at describing the world around us .
As noted in my previous post , Peter Denning says in his article “ Computing is a Natural Science ” :
Stephen Wolfram proclaimed [ in his book A New Kind of Science ] that nature is written in the language of computation , challenging Galileo ’s claim that it is written in mathematics .
So what ’s going on here ?
It definitely sounds like CS and the other sciences are merging some .
I learned certain finite math disciplines in high school and college , which related to my study of computer science .
I never expected them to be substitutes for classical math in the sciences .
If someone can fill me in on this I ’d be interested to hear more .
I do n’t know , but this memory just flashed through my head ; that scene in “ Xanadu ” where a band from the 40s , and a band from the 80s merge together into one performance .
They ’re singing different songs , but they mesh .
Crazy what one ’s mind can come up with , huh .
🙂 I know , I know .
“ Xanadu ” was a cheesy movie , but this scene was one of the better ones in it , if you can tolerate the fashions .
I think this speech has caused me to look at OOP in a new way .
When I was first training myself in OOP years ago , I went through the same lesson plan I ’m sure a lot of you did , which was “ Let ’s make a class called ‘ Mammal ’ .
Okay , now let ’s create a derived class off of that called ‘ Canine ’ , and derive ‘ Dog ’ and ‘ Wolf ’ off of that , ” or , “ Let ’s create a ‘ Shape ’ class .
Now derive ‘ Triangle ’ and ‘ Ellipse ’ off of that , and then derive ‘ Circle ’ from ‘ Ellipse ’ . ”
What these exercises were really doing was teaching the structure and techniques of OOP , and showing some of their practical advantages , but none of it taught you why you were doing it .
Kay ’s presentation gave me the “ why ” , and he makes a pretty good case that OOP is not merely a neat new way to program , but is in fact essential for developing complex systems , or at least the best model discovered so far for doing it .
He also points out that the way OOP is implemented today is missing one critical element–dynamism , due to the early - bound languages / systems we ’re using , and that a lot of us have misunderstood what he intended OOP to be about .
Alan Kay relates the metaphor of biological systems to software systems , from his speech at the 1997 OOPSLA conference
If you do n’t want to listen to the whole speech , I ’ve printed some excerpts from it below , only including the parts that fit the biological metaphor he was getting across .
I ’ve included my own annotations in [ ] ’s , and commentary in between excerpts .
I ’ve also included some links .
Dr. Kay gets into this discussion , using a spat he and Dr. Dijkstra got into some years before over who were the better computer scientists , the Europeans or the Americans , as a launching point .
Dijkstra made the point that European computer scientists had more of a math background than Americans did , and they got their positions by working harder at it than Americans , etc .
Kay responded with , “ Huh , so why do we write most of the software , then ? ” ( I ’m paraphrasing ) .
He continues :
Computers form a new kind of math .
They do n’t really fit well into classical math .
And people who try to do that are basically indulging in a form of masturbation … maybe even realizing it .
It was a kind of a practical math .
The balance was between making structures that were supposed to be consistent of a much larger kind than classical math had ever come close to dreaming of attempting , and having to deal with [ the ] exact same problems that classical math of any size has to deal with , which is being able to be convincing about having covered all of the cases .
There ’s a mathematician by the name of Euler [ pronouned “ Oiler ” ] whose speculations about what might be true formed 20 large books , and most of them were true .
Most of them were right .
Almost all of his proofs were wrong .
And many PhDs in mathematics in the last and this century have been formed by mathematicians going to Euler ’s books , finding one of his proofs , showing it was a bad proof , and then guessing that his insight was probably correct and finding a much more convincing proof .
And so debugging actually goes on in mathematics as well .
And I think the main thing about doing OOP work , or any kind of programming work , is that there has to be some exquisite blend between beauty and practicality .
There ’s no reason to sacrifice either one of those , and people who are willing to sacrifice either one of those I do n’t think really get what computing is all about .
It ’s like saying I have really great ideas for paintings , but I ’m just going to use a brush , but no paint .
You know , so my ideas will be represented by the gestures I make over the paper ; and do n’t tell any 20th century artists that , or they might decide to make a videotape of them doing that and put it in a museum .
. . .
Kay used a concept , called bisociation , from a book called “ The Act of Creation ” , by Arthur Koestler .
Koestler draws out a “ pink plane ” with a trail of ants on it , which represents one paradigm , one train of thought , that starts out with an idea and works towards continuous improvement upon it .
Kay said about it :
If you think about that , it means that progress in a fixed context is almost always a form of optimization , because if you were actually coming up with something new it would n’t have been part of the rules or the context for what the pink plane is all about .
So creative acts generally are ones that do n’t stay in the same context that they ’re in .
So he says every once in a while , even though you have been taught carefully by parents and by school for many years , you have a “ blue ” idea .
This introduces a new context .
[ Koestler ] also pointed out that you have to have something “ blue ” to have “ blue ” thoughts with , and I think this is something that is generally missed in people who specialize to the extent of anything else .
When you specialize you ’re basically putting yourself into a mental state where optimization is pretty much all you can do .
You have to learn lots of different kinds of things in order to have the start of these other contexts .
This is the reason he says a general education is important .
Next , he gets into the biological metaphor for computing :
One of my undergraduate majors was in molecular biology , and my particular interest was both in cell physiology and in embryology –morphogenesis they call it today .
And this book , The Molecular Biology of the Gene had just come out in 1965 , and –wonderful book , still in print , and of course it ’s gone through many , many editions , and probably the only words that are common between this book and the one of today are the articles , like “ the ” and “ and ” .
Actually the word “ gene ” I think is still in there , but it means something completely different now .
But one of the things that Watson did in this book is to make an assay–first assay of an entire living creature , and that was the E. Coli bacterium .
So if you look inside one of these , the complexity is staggering .
He brings up the slide of an E. Coli bacterium as seen through an ( electron ? ) microscope .
Those “ popcorn ” things are protein molecules that have about 5,000 atoms in them , and as you can see on the slide , when you get rid of the small molecules like water , and calcium ions , and potassium ions , and so forth , which constitute about 70 % of the mass of this thing , the 30 % that remains has about 120 million components that interact with each other in an informational way , and each one of these components carries quite a bit of information [ my emphasis ] .
The simple - minded way of thinking of these things is it works kind of like OPS5 [ OPS5 is an AI language that uses a set of condition - action rules to represent knowledge .
It was developed in the late 1970s ] .
There ’s a pattern matcher , and then there are things that happen if patterns are matched successfully .
So the state that ’s involved in that is about 100 Gigs. , and you can multiply that out today .
It ’s only 100 desktops , or so [ it would be 1/2 - 1/3 of a desktop today ] , but it ’s still pretty impressive as [ an ] amount of computation , and maybe the most interesting thing about this structure is that the rapidity of computation seriously rivals that of computers today , particularly when you ’re considering it ’s done in parallel .
For example , one of those popcorn - sized things moves its own length in just 2 nanoseconds .
So one way of visualizing that is if an atom was the size of a tennis ball , then one of these protein molecules would be about the size of a Volkswagon , and it ’s moving its own length in 2 nanoseconds .
That ’s about 8 feet on our scale of things .
And can anybody do the arithmetic to tell me what fraction of the speed of light moving 8 feet in 2 nanoseconds is ?…[ there ’s a response from the audience ]
Four times !
Yeah .
Four times the speed of light [ he moves his arm up ] –scale .
So if you ever wondered why chemistry works , this is why .
The thermal agitation down there is so unbelievably violent , that we could not imagine it , even with the aid of computers .
There ’s nothing to be seen inside one of these things until you kill it , because it is just a complete blur of activity , and under good conditions it only takes about 15 to 18 minutes for one of these to completely duplicate itself .
Okay .
So that ’s a bacterium .
And of course , lots more is known today .
Another fact to relate this to us , is that these bacteria are about 1/500th the size of the cells in our bodies , which instead of 120 million informational components , have about 60 billion , and we have between 1012 , maybe 1013 , maybe even more of these cells in our body .
And yet only 50 cell divisions happen in a 9 - month pregnancy .
It only takes 50 cell divisions to make a baby .
And actually if you multiply it out , you realize you only need around 40 .
And the extra 10 powers of 10 are there because during the embryological process , many of the cells that are not fit in one way or another for the organism as a whole are killed .
So things are done by over - proliferating , testing , and trimming to this much larger plan .
And then of course , each one of these structures , us , is embedded in an enormous biomass .
So to a person whose “ blue ” context might have been biology , something like a computer could not possibly be regarded as particularly complex , or large , or fast .
Slow .
Small .
Stupid .
That ’s what computers are .
So the question is how can we get them to realize their destiny ?
So the shift in point of view here is from–There ’s this problem , if you take things like doghouses , they do n’t scale [ in size ] by a factor of 100 very well .
If you take things like clocks , they do n’t scale by a factor of 100 very well .
Take things like cells , they not only scale by factors of 100 , but by factors of a trillion .
And the question is how do they do it , and how might we adapt this idea for building complex systems ?
He brings up a slide of a basic biological cell .
He uses the metaphor of the cell to talk about OOP , as he conceived it , and building software systems :
Okay , this is the simple one .
This is the one by the way that C++ has still not figured out , though .
There ’s no idea so simple and powerful that you ca n’t get zillions of people to misunderstand it .
So you must , must , must not allow the interior of any one of these things to be a factor in the computation of the whole , okay .
And this is only part of this story .
It ’s not just the cell –the cell membrane is there to keep most things out , as much as it is there to keep certain things in .
And a lot of , I think , our confusion with objects is the problem that in our Western culture , we have a language that has very hard nouns and verbs in it .
So our process words stink .
So it ’s much easier for us when we think of an object –I have apologized profusely over the last 20 years for making up the term “ object - oriented ” , because as soon as it started to be misapplied , I realized that I should ’ve used a much more process - oriented term for it .
Now , the Japanese have an interesting word , which is called “ ma ” , which spelled in English is M - A , “ ma ” .
And “ ma ” is the stuff in between what we call objects .
It ’s the stuff we do n’t see , because we ’re focused on the noun-ness of things , rather than the process - ness of things , whereas Japanese has a more process / feel - oriented way of looking at how things relate to each other .
You can always tell that by looking at the size of a word it takes to express something that is important .
So “ ma ” is very short .
We have to use words like “ interstitial ” , or worse , to approximate what the Japanese are talking about .
I ’ve seen him use this analogy of the Japanese word “ ma ” before in more recent versions of this speech .
What he kind of beats around the bush about here is that the objects themselves are not nearly as important as the messages that are sent between them .
This is the “ ma ” he ’s talking about –what is going on between the objects , their relationships to each other .
To me , he ’s also emphasizing architecture here .
In a different version of this speech ( I believe ) , he said that the true abstraction in OOP is in the messaging that goes on between objects , not the objects themselves .
He continues :
So , the realization here–and it ’s not possible to assign this realization to any particular person , because it was in the seeds of Sketchpad , and in the seeds of the Air Training Command file system , and in the seeds of Simula–and that is , that once you have encapsulated in such a way that there is an interface between the inside and the outside , it is possible to make an object act like anything , and the reason is simply this : that what you have encapsulated is a computer [ my emphasis ] .
So you have done a powerful thing in computer science , which is to take the powerful thing you ’re working on and not lose it by partitioning up your design space .
This is the bug in data procedures–data and procedure languages .
And I think this is the most pernicious thing about languages like C++ and Java , [ which ] is they think they are helping the programmer by looking as much like the old thing as possible , but in fact they ’re hurting the programmer terribly , by making it difficult for the programmer to understand what ’s really powerful about this new metaphor .
The “ Air Training Command file system ” refers to a way that data was stored on tapes back when Kay was in the Air Force , I think in the 1950s in the early 1960s .
It was effective and efficient .
Some have pointed to it as the first example Kay had seen of an object - oriented system .
The first section of tape contained pointers to routines ( probably hard addresses to memory locations , in those days ) whose code was stored in a second section of the tape , which read / manipulated the data on the third section of the tape .
This way , it did n’t matter what format the data came in , since that was abstracted by the routines in the second section .
No one knows who came up with the scheme .
And again , people who were doing time - sharing systems had already figured this out as well .
Butler Lampson ’s thesis in 1965 was about –that what you want to give a person on a time - sharing system is something that is now called a virtual machine , which is not the same as what the Java VM is , but something that is as much like the physical computer as possible , but give one separately to everybody .
Unix had that sense about it , and the biggest problem with that scheme is that a Unix process had an overhead of about 2,000 bytes just to have a process .
And so it ’s going to be difficult in Unix to let a Unix process just be the number 3 .
So you ’d be going from 3 bits to a couple of thousand bytes , and you have this problem with scaling .
So a lot of the problem here is both deciding that the biological metaphor [ my emphasis ] is the one that is going to win out over the next 25 years or so , and then committing to it enough to get it so it can be practical at all of the levels of scale that we actually need .
Then we have one trick we can do that biology does n’t know how to do , which is we can take the DNA out of the cells , and that allows us to deal with cystic fibrosis much more easily than the way it ’s done today .
And systems do have cystic fibrosis , and some of you may know that cystic fibrosis today for some people is treated by infecting them with a virus , a modified cold virus , giving them a lung infection , but the defective gene for cystic fibrosis is in this cold virus , and the cold virus is too weak to actually destroy the lungs like pneumonia does , but it is strong enough to insert a copy of that gene in every cell in the lungs .
And that is what does the trick .
That ’s a very complicated way of reprogramming an organism ’s DNA once it has gotten started .
He really mixes metaphors here , going from “ cystic fibrosis ” in computing , to it in a biological system .
I got confused on what he said about the gene therapy .
Perhaps he meant that the virus carries the “ non-defective gene ” ?
I thought what the therapy did was substitute a good gene for the bad one , since cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition , but then , I do n’t really know how this works .
When he talks about “ taking the DNA out of the cell , ” and dealing with “ cystic fibrosis , ” I ’m pretty sure he ’s talking about a quality of dynamic OOP systems ( like Smalltalk ) that work like Ivan Sutherland ’s Sketchpad program from the 1960s , where each object instance was based on a master object .
If you modified the master object , that change got reflected automatically in all of the object instances .
He brought up another slide that looks like a matrix ( chart ) of characteristics of some kind .
I could n’t see it too well .
I recognized the subject though .
He begins to talk about his conception of the semantic web , using the same biological and object - oriented metaphor :
So here ’s one that is amazing to me , that we have n’t seen more of .
For instance , one of the most amazing things to me , of people who have been trying to put OOP on the internet , is that I do not –I hope someone will come up afterwards and tell me of an exception to this –but I do not know of anybody yet who has realized that at the very least every object should have a URL , because what the heck are they if they are n’t these things .
And I believe that every object on the internet should have an IP , because that represents much better what the actual abstractions are of physical hardware to the bits .
So this is an early insight , that objects basically are like servers .
And this notion of polymorphism , which used to be called generic procedures , is a way of thinking about classes of these servers .
Everybody knows about that .
He brought up another slide , showing the picture of a building crane on one side , and a collection of biological cells on the other .
More metaphors .
And here ’s one that we have n’t really faced up to much yet , that now we ’ll have to construct this stuff , and soon we ’ll be required to grow it .
So it ’s very easy , for instance , to grow a baby 6 inches .
They do it about 10 times in their life .
You never have to take it down for maintenance .
But if you try and grow a 747 , you ’re faced with an unbelievable problem , because it ’s in this simple - minded mechanical world in which the only object has been to make the artifact in the first place , not to fix it , not to change it , not to let it live for 100 years .
So let me ask a question .
I wo n’t take names , but how many people here still use a language that essentially forces you –the development system forces you to develop outside of the language [ perhaps he means “ outside the VM environment ” ? ] , compile and reload , and go , even if it ’s fast , like Virtual Cafe ( sic ) .
How many here still do that ?
Let ’s just see .
Come on .
Admit it .
We can have a Texas tent meeting later .
Yeah , so if you think about that , that cannot possibly be other than a dead end for building complex systems , where much of the building of complex systems is in part going to go to trying to understand what the possibilities for interoperability is with things that already exist .
Now , I just played a very minor part in the design of the ARPANet .
I was one of 30 graduate students who went to systems design meetings to try and formulate design principles for the ARPANet , also about 30 years ago , and if you think about –the ARPANet of course became the internet–and from the time it started running , which is around 1969 or so , to this day , it has expanded by a factor of about 100 million .
So that ’s pretty good .
Eight orders or magnitude .
And as far as anybody can tell –I talked to Larry Roberts about this the other day–there ’s not one physical atom in the internet today that was in the original ARPANet , and there is not one line of code in the internet today that was in the original ARPANet .
Of course if we ’d had IBM mainframes in the orignal ARPANet that would n’t have been true .
So this is a system that has expanded by 100 million , and has changed every atom and every bit , and has never had to stop !
That is the metaphor we absolutely must apply to what we think are smaller things .
When we think programming is small , that ’s why your programs are so big ! . . .
There are going to be dozens and dozens–there almost already are–dozens and dozens of different object systems , all with very similar semantics , but with very different pragmatic details .
And if you think of what a URL actually is , and if you think of what an HTTP message actually is , and if you think of what an object actually is , and if you think of what an object - oriented pointer actually is , I think it should be pretty clear that any object - oriented language can internalize its own local pointers to any object in the world , regardless of where it was made .
That ’s the whole point of not being able to see inside .
And so a semantic interoperability is possible almost immediately by simply taking that stance .
So this is going to change , really , everything .
And things like Java Beans and CORBA are not going to suffice , because at some point one is going to have to start really discovering what objects think they can do .
And this is going to lead to a universal interface language , which is not a programming language , per se .
It ’s more like a prototyping language that allows an interchange of deep information about what objects think they can do .
It allows objects to make experiments with other objects in a safe way to see how they respond to various messages .
This is going to be a critical thing to automate in the next 10 years .
. . .
I think what he meant by “ any object - oriented language can internalize its own local pointers to any object in the world , regardless of where it was made ” is that any OOP language can abstract its pointers so that there ’s no distinction between pointers to local objects and URLs to remote objects .
This would make dealing with local and remote objects seamless , assuming you ’re using a late - bound , message - passing metaphor throughout your system .
The seamlessness would not be perfect in an early - bound system , because the compiler would ensure that all classes for which there are messages existed before runtime , but there ’s no way to insure that every object on the internet is always going to be available , and always at the same URL / address .
You might ask , “ Why would you want that kind of ‘ perfect ’ seamlessness ?
Do n’t you want that insurance of knowing that everything connects up the way it should ? ”
My answer is , things change .
One of the things Kay is arguing here is that our software needs to be adaptable to change , both in itself , and in the “ outside world ” of the internet .
He uses the internet as an example of a system that has been very robust in the face of change .
Early - bound systems have a tendency to push the programmer towards assuming that everything will connect up just as it is today , and that nothing will change .
As I heard him talk about objects on the web , the first thing that came to mind was REST ( the whole “ each object should have a URL ” idea ) .
It seems like the first try at an implementation of this idea of objects “ experimenting ” and “ figuring out ” what other objects on the network can do was started with the idea of WSDL and UDDI , but that flopped , from what I hear .
Microsoft has made a bit of a start with this , in my opinion , with WCF , but it only determines what type of object is at the other end , as in “ Is it DCOM ? ” , “ Is it an XML web service ? ” , etc .
It frees the programmer from having to do that .
It still allows the client program to interogate the object , but it ’s not going to do “ experiments ” on it for you .
It may allow the client program to do them more easily than before .
I do n’t know .
Kay ends with a note of encouragement :
Look for the “ blue ” thoughts .
And I was trying to think of a way–how could I stop this talk , because I ’ll go on and on , and I remembered a story .
I ’m a pipe organist .
Most pipe organists have a hero whose name was E. Power Biggs .
He kind of revived the interest in the pipe organ , especially as it was played in the 17th and 18th centuries , and had a tremendous influence on all of us organists .
And a good friend of mine was E. Power Biggs ’s assistant for many years , back in the 40s and 50s .
He ’s in his 80s now .
When we get him for dinner , we always get him to tell E. Power Biggs stories .
The organ that E. Power Biggs had in those days for his broadcasts was a dinky little organ , neither fish nor foul , in a small museum at Harvard , called the Busch - Reisinger Museum ; but in fact all manner of music was played on it .
And one day this assistant had to fill in for Biggs , and he asked Biggs , “ What is the piece [ to be ] played ? ”
And he said , “ Well I had programmed Cesar Frank ’s heroic piece ” .
And if you know this piece it is made for the largest organs that have ever been made , the loudest organs that have ever been made , in the largest cathedrals that have ever been made , because it ’s a 19th century symphonic type organ work .
And Biggs was asking my friend to play this on this dinky little organ , and he said , “ How can I play it on this ? ” , and Biggsy said , “ Just play it grand !
Just play it grand ! ”
And the way to stay with the future as it moves , is to always play your systems more grand than they seem to be right now .
Thank you .

The official ' unofficial ' story of goatse .... and how tw goatse'd 300,000 peeps ...
Pages : [ 1 ]

Some admin here relaying the story of Goatse
A little more detail for the newcomers :
After the Sep. 11th attacks on the WTC , Rayn noticed in a movie that there was a weird looking trick of light & dust that basically looked like a devil 's face .
He of course posted a screenshot of the movie ( directly from CNN 's website mind you ) with the devil face , which included a zoomed in version and the caption " What the **** is this ? "
Well apparently people sent around links of it to friends via email because the picture itself got a lot of hits , and eventually it found its way to an editor for Cnet , who wrote an article which among other things labeled us " fear merchants " , and condemned us for photoshopping this " obviously fake " image , which was in fact quite real .
He also directly linked to the image off our server ( instead of making a local copy on the cnet site . )
Well the hate mail rolled in .
Lots of people who believed this guy spammed our email addresses telling us what awful , bad , mean , cruel , evil people we where - and how we were going to burn in hell .
This was also killing our server because of all the traffic to the one image .
Even removing the image wouldnt have helped because of all the " 404 - File not found " pages that would be generated .
So we all emailed the guy that wrote the article and explained to him that the picture was in fact real ( and we mentioned that any ' reporter ' worth his salt would have checked it out before slandering us , ) and sent him a direct link to the movie .
We also requested that he either take the article down or remove the part about us .
In addition we explained that directly linking to the images was not only breaking our server , but costing our sponsors an enormous amount of money .
Instead , he syndicated the article .
It went to CNN , Yahoo news , MSNBC , and basically every major news site on the internet .
The now enormous amount of traffic to the site / image was litterally killing the server .
We emailed all of them begging them to if nothing else delete the link , as it was wrecking our server .
We got no replies .
So , Rayn being very swift of thought decided to take some action .
Keeping in mind that the image was linked directly to our server , Rayn replaced the image - and we wrote down how much traffic the image had gotten to that point .
The image Rayn chose to replace the devil picture with was the goatse .
cx man ( the guy holding his ******* open wide enough to park a truck in it . )
Rayn then informed the people on the forum what he'd done , and they collectively fell out of their chairs laughing .
A few pissed themselves .
After a few hours of almost constant laughing , the sites removed the part of the article about our site .
We checked the traffic stats on the image .
300,000 people viewed it thinking it was a harmless image linked from their favourite news site - and those same 300,000 people got an eyefull of some guys spleen .
It 's widely considered to be what insured our site 's place in the books of infamy .
Happy Good read .

Stupidest Terrorist Overreaction Yet ?
What ?
Are the police taking stupid pills ?
Two people who sprinkled flour in a parking lot to mark a trail for their offbeat running club inadvertently caused a bioterrorism scare and now face a felony charge .
The competition is fierce , but I think this is a winner .
What bothers me most about the news coverage is that there is n’t even a suggestion that the authorities ’ response might have been out of line .
Mayoral spokeswoman Jessica Mayorga said the city plans to seek restitution from the Salchows , who are due in court Sept. 14 .
“ You see powder connected by arrows and chalk , you never know , ” she said .
“ It could be a terrorist , it could be something more serious .
We ’re thankful it was n’t , but there were a lot of resources that went into figuring that out . ”

The truly cost - efficient features , however , are the systems Mr. Weingarten uses to power and heat the house .
Electricity is drawn from six photovoltaic solar panels on the roof , each producing 105 watts , which power the lights , the computer and some other appliances .
The solar panels — along with a 1920s propane stove in the kitchen — have allowed Mr. Weingarten to go completely off the utility grid .
So while a home the size of his has an average monthly electric bill of $ 80 and a gas bill averaging $ 55 , according to Keely Wachs , a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric , the local energy company , Mr. Weingarten pays nothing to the utility .
He does , however , spend $ 43 a month to cover the propane he uses to power the stove , refrigerator , clothes dryer and water heater , and to pay for the gasoline to power his backup generator , which charges the solar batteries on days when there is not enough sunshine — not infrequent , given the thick fog that can sometimes roll over this coastal area .
( He turns the generator on so rarely , he said , that he used only about 25 gallons of gasoline in 2006 . )
To heat the house , Mr. Weingarten combined solar energy with two much older approaches : radiant heating and gravity circulation .
Two solar - powered pumps in the basement circulate a freezeproof mixture of water and vodka through solar thermal panels on the roof .
( He said he uses vodka rather than an industrial antifreeze because , among other things , it ’s more efficient and is nontoxic . )
The mixture is heated to between 80 and 140 degrees , depending on the weather , and then flows down to a copper coil at the bottom of a 1,000 - gallon tank in the basement , where it heats water in the tank .
Image Mr. Weingarten used steel and rebar in this staircase .

A separate gravity - assisted system heats the house by way of copper tubing that starts in a coil at the top of the tank .
As the tank water heats up , Mr. Weingarten explained , water in this coil is also heated , and rises , passing through an elaborate system of tubing in the walls .
As the water loses its heat , it falls back to the coil in the storage tank , heats up and rises again , repeating the process .
To ensure that the heat generated this way stays inside , the walls were built nearly twice as thick — eight inches — as those in most houses , and like the floors and ceilings , were made of foam - core structural insulated panels , Mr. Weingarten said .
“ In the winter , even a little bit of sun is enough to keep the heat going in the water tank , ” he said .
“ As long as there ’s 80 - degree water in the tank , I can keep the house at 70 degrees . ”
He acknowledged that in the winter he supplements the system with a wood - burning stove , because his wife feels chilly at 70 degrees .
Since the heat is solar - generated and the wood is free , Mr. Weingarten ’s heating bill is virtually zero .
All told , he said , his energy expenditures average $ 43 a month , for the propane and gasoline .
Are you one of those people who think of big cities as little more than hotbeds of pollution , crime and social inequalities ?
Well , think again .
A new report in this week ' sconfirms what many city dwellers , who account for the bulk of people on Earth , have claimed for years :
Cities have an almost magical ability , spurred by increased human interaction , to stimulate innovation and increase wealth .
The report also pooh - poohs the popular comparison of the growth of cities with biological organisms .
An animal slows as it balloons in size ; in contrast , the researchers note , cities speed up as population and everything from crime to per capita income grow .
Cities create a sort of " urban economic miracle , " says study co-author Luis Bettencourt , a research scientist in Los Alamos National Laboratory 's Theoretical Division .
" When you integrate all these people and all these activities and the struggle to make a living , total productivity increases , " he says .
Bettencourt and his colleagues at Arizona State University ( A.S.U. ) , Dresden University of Technology in Germany and New Mexico's Santa Fe Institute , modeled the growth of a city according to three categories of factors : material infrastructure ( road surfaces , electrical cable , etc. ) , human needs ( such as total energy consumption and housing ) and patterns of social activity , including total bank deposits , research and development , new cases of AIDS and new patents filed .
The researchers sifted through an extensive amount of data on many urban systems — mostly big American cities , but also European ( primarily German ) and Chinese urban areas .
The researchers mathematically modeled these factors according to population growth to see how each respond when more people move to a city .
They found that human needs , such as employment , utility consumption and housing , correspond directly with the population :
As the number of people doubles so does the need for housing , jobs and electricity infrastructure , which encompasses the number of roads , gasoline stations and the like already in place and does not necessarily keep pace with individual growth — the ratio of user to facility simply rises .
( And so , for example , there are simply more customers at the available gas stations . )
At the other extreme , researchers found that increases in social activity and production outpace population growth .
In other words , if the number of city denizens doubles , these factors — both negative ( crime ) and positive ( wealth creation , total wages and gross domestic product ) — will more than double .
" These scaling laws give you some suggestion of [ how ] your city will behave as it grows , " in terms of economic activity , resource consumption , etc. , Bettencourt says , adding that smaller cities , like Portland , Ore. , and huge epicenters , like New York City , fall along the same continuum and are subject to the same multipliers .
" The practical application of this work is that the problem is not large cities , the problem is the conditions in which some people live in large cities , " says study co-author Jose Lobo , an economist at A.S.U.'s School of Sustainability in Tempe .
" Policies should be directed to making large cities more livable " — for instance , enacting legislation or spending money to alleviate poverty and crime , the negative effects of growth .
Thomas Parris , director of sustainability programs at iSciences , a Burlington , VT , research company dedicated to improving understanding of sustainability , agrees that the main message of the paper is a recharacterization of cities so that better decisions can be made as urban areas continue to grow .
" This is a fascinating paper that quantitatively explores the complex interactions between urbanization , sustainability and social innovation , " he says .
" Insights , such as those presented in this paper , will help guide our collective choices as the pace of socioecological change accelerates . "
Mexico replaced the federal police chiefs from each of the country ’s 31 states and the Federal District on Monday , pending polygraph and drug tests to determine whether they are on the right side of the law in the nation ’s foundering drug war .
The surprise purge of top leaders of the federal police and an elite federal investigations agency comes as Mexican President Felipe Calderon seeks traction in a 6 - month - old campaign against drug traffickers that has neither stemmed killings nor slowed shipments .
Corruption among local , state and federal law enforcement has for years given cover to drug smuggling gangs , now at war over access routes to the United States , and over Mexico ’s growing domestic markets .
“ Every federal cop is obliged to carry out his post with legality , honesty and efficiency , ” Public Safety Secretary Genaro Garcia Luna said at a news conference Monday announcing the housecleaning .
“ In the fight against crime , we have strategies .
One axis of our strategy is to professionalize and purge our police corps . ”

The police chiefs were replaced Monday by federal officers who have passed a rigorous screening , Garcia Luna said .
Shortly after taking office in December , Calderon sent the army to work alongside federal police in nine states .
But there are growing suspicions that millionaire kingpins continue to buy protection as easily as ever , despite Calderon ’s efforts .
Half a dozen federal police officers were arrested this month when their army counterparts discovered they ’d allowed a cocaine shipment to pass through the Mexicali airport .
About a third of Mexico ’s 20,000 - member federal police force , which investigates all drug crimes and homicides , is assigned to work alongside the 12,000 soldiers employed in Calderon ’s anti-trafficking campaign .
That pairing has raised speculation about information being leaked to smugglers and growers .
Street prices in the United States remain stable , suggesting that suppliers continue to smuggle narcotics over the U.S. - Mexico border relatively undisturbed , drug experts say .

With more than 2,000 people killed last year , curbing drug violence emerged as Calderon ’s first priority when he took office .
The army , with its reputation of being more trustworthy than Mexico ’s police agencies , emerged as Calderon ’s tool of choice .
But critics worry that Mexico ’s army will be the next institution to be tainted by drug profits .
American drug users are estimated to spend as much as $ 65 billion a year , mostly on cocaine , marijuana , heroin and methamphetamine , commodities largely controlled by Mexican trafficking organizations and their Colombian affiliates .
“ Drug trafficking results in a lot of money , and money buys power , ” said a senior U.S. counter - drug official .
“ When you have someone who has a base of operations significant enough to earn millions of dollars a year , it ’s not uncommon for them to wield the kind of power to develop circles of protection .
Mexico is no exception to that .
That ’s no secret here .
The government of Mexico is well aware . ”
Calderon has asked the U.S. to shoulder a larger share of the drug enforcement burden .
U.S. officials acknowledge that the war in Iraq has shifted attention and military resources away from drug interdiction in the air and sea shipping zones of Mexico and Central America .

Although Calderon has won credit for facing down drug cartels , uncertainty lingers in Washington over how much help to give Mexico ’s law enforcement agencies , particularly in the gathering and sharing of intelligence .
Garcia Luna would not say whether any of the replaced federal officers were being investigated for alleged corruption , or what prompted the government ’s decision .
“ Any evidence we have will be processed by the attorney general ’s office , and , of course , any reference we find will be analyzed and sent to prosecutors , ” he said .
Mexican lawmakers on Monday demanded that Calderon ’s government present any evidence it has of federal police corruption .

The removed state heads of the federal police , known as the Federal Preventive Police , or PFP , as well as the Federal Investigative Agency , or AFI , will undergo additional training and be subjected to close scrutiny , Garcia Luna said .
They will be given polygraph and drug tests , he added , and their financial assets will be examined to see whether they are in line with a public servant ’s salary .
Garcia Luna said the new state police chiefs were among 284 federal police officers who began work Monday as replacements .
Calderon in March called for new standards in police ethics and discipline , triggering the recall .
“ It ’s obvious that there are mafias that do n’t want things to change , ” Garcia Luna said .
“ In the fight against corruption , we wo n’t give in to pressures . ”
Calderon ’s campaign began with a flurry of successes in his home state of Michoacan ; TV news broadcasts showed destroyed marijuana and opium poppy fields .
But cocaine seizures by the army this year are less than half the amount taken during the same period in 2006 .
Drug killings continue at last year ’s pace .

The PFP was created in 1998 , unifying various federal agencies that had specialized jurisdiction over airports , customs , roads and civil unrest .
The 5,000 - member AFI was created by then - President Vicente Fox in 2001 to replace a corrupt federal police force .
More than 100 AFI agents work under the supervision of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents based in Mexico , according to the Justice Department ’s Office of Inspector General .

Joseph DeLappe can often be found logging into an online session offor hours at a time , but this Associate Professor from San Francisco is n't running around shooting terrorists .
Instead , Prof. DeLappe spends the entire session typing .
He may stop occasionally when his character is killed and he has to wait for a respawn , or he 'll stop to take a screenshot of a reply sent to him from another player , but otherwise , he 's just typing .
Prof. DeLappe expects to be typing for some time .
This is because he 's typing in the name of every single American soldier killed in Iraq since the war started , which according to the Department of Defense is currently 2,456 .
DeLappe knows this project will take a while .
" I tend to do probably 2 - 3 hours a week " he says , " That 'll get me somewhere between 40 and 75 names . "
The name of his project is " dead - in- iraq , " and it's also the name that he signs in under when he logs on to " The piece is intended as a memorial and a protest , " explains DeLappe as he talks about his motivations .
" It merged really from my thinking both as an artist and as a citizen .
Thinking about what is happening , the nature of this war , how it came about , and really , essentially the nature of thecomputer game . "
He goes on to say " Part of it was thinking about the nature of what is a memorial ...
A memorial is to remember sacrifice and heroism and death .
Why wait for when it's ( the war ) over ?
Why not do it now ?
" One of the reasons DeLappe has specifically targetedis because he has some personal issues with the game itself .
During our interview , he calls it " a tax - payer funded propaganda and recruiting and advertising tool for the Army . "
His issues do n't stop there .
He also adds that " you have a fantasy about killing and being in the military , but nobody dies , there are no consequences .
It 's a complete fabrication ... it 's free , it 's fun to play , it 's seductive , it presents a fantasy portrait of what war is like . "
Still , DeLappe makes it a point to say , " I do n't have a problem with military service . "
Douglas Crockford , Yahoo ! ’s resident JavaScript guru and the developer of JSON , has provided a much - needed service in a three - part lecture series on the language .
JavaScript is reportedly the second - fastest growing language to Ruby and has enjoyed a renaissance because of Ajax and rich Internet applications .
JavaScript has always suffered from its unfortunate ( and inaccurate ) name , but it also suffers because of poor and outdated documentation and ( general ) lack of program comments or obfuscation to “ minifying ” to keep transferred script sizes small .
The first part in the lecture series ( 111 minutes ) covers the basics of the language , its history and quirks :
The second part places JavaScript and its development in relation to the DOM and browser evolution ( 77 min ) :
Then , the third part covers more advanced language topics such as debugging , patterns and the interesting alternative to traditional object classing using prototypal inheritance ( 67 min ) :
Crockford is also the developer of the JSLint code - checking utility and has a Web site chocked full of other tips and aids , including a very good set of JS coding standards .
I highly recommend you find the three or four hours necessary to give these tutorials your undivided attention .
Crockford is generally disparaging about the state of most JavaScript books , though he does recommend the fifth edition of Dave Flanagan ’s well - known JavaScript : The Definitive Guide .
I know Doug has a real job , but all of us can hope he personally takes up the challenge of finally writing the definitive JavaScript guide .
Crockford is definitely the guy to do it .
Because of the excellence of this series , it gets a J & D award .
How in the world could a man end up with a typographical error tattooed on his chest ?
That was the question raised last week by a news story about a lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court by Michael Duplessis , a Northwest Side auto mechanic who said that in April 2005 , tattoo artist Sam Hacker inked “ Chi-tonw ” on his chest where he had asked for “ Chi-town . ”
The suit accuses Hacker and Jade Dragon Tattoo & Body Piercing , where Hacker worked at the time , of negligence .
But four of Hacker ’s professional colleagues rose to his defense Wednesday afternoon in a most fitting and unusual way :
They got “ Chi-tonw ” tattoos of their own .
Their purpose was to show that the error - control safeguards at tattoo parlors render Duplessis ’ accusation of negligence a “ farce , ” according to 31 - year - old “ Dras ” ( pictured right ; one name only ) , who went first .
Hacker did the honors .
He ’s 37 and said that in his 11 - year career he has applied roughly 20,000 tattoos , working most recently at the Rising Phoenix Tattoo and Professional Body Piercing studio in Addison .
And that , like all reputable tattoo artists , he always goes through the same basic steps :
Using pencils and tracing paper , he creates a drawing of the design that the customer has requested .
When the customer says he ’s satisfied with the proposed tattoo , Hacker then puts the design in a Thermofax copier — one of those old machines schoolteachers used to make ditto masters .
This generates a transfer pattern that allows Hacker to copy the design right onto the customer ’s skin .
“ If they do n’t like it for any reason , it cleans off easily and we try again , ” he said .
“ And even when they do like it , I make them go look in the mirror to be sure it ’s what they have in mind . ”
Finally , he has the customer sign a release form saying that neither he nor the studio is responsible for the meaning or spelling of the tattoo .
( Jade Dragon employees would not discuss the language on their current or former waiver forms with me . )
Then and only then , Hacker said , will he set to work .
You would n’t make him for a tattoo guy .
He has a neat goatee , round spectacles and no visible tattoos — unlike his generously adorned compatriots who assembled at the just - opened Bridgeport Tattoo Co. , 3527 S. Halsted St. , for Wednesday ’s demonstration ( pictured below ; Hacker is at the rear )
As Hacker went through the steps of preparing the “ Chi-tonw ” tattoo for the very top of Dras ’ chest , he tried to reconstruct how the error came to be .
He said that Duplessis , who would n't comment for this column on the advice of his lawyer , came to him with a refrigerator magnet with the word “ Chicago ” on it in an Old English typeface similar to what you see in the Tribune logo .
“ But he wanted ` Chi- town , ’ ” Hacker said .
“ We could n’t find what he wanted in my lettering books , so I had to do freehand versions of the `t , ’ the `o , ’ the `w , ’ and the `n . ’. ”
Duplessis was very exacting about the letters , Hacker said .
It took about an hour to come up with four that he liked .
Hacker circled those on his tracing paper and began transferring them into the main design , which is when , he admits , he transposed the letters .
“ I was looking at each letter like an individual work of art , not at the spelling , ” he said .
“ I guess he was n’t either .
I showed him the drawing , he said it was perfect .
Then he paid me .
I stenciled it onto him , he checked it in the mirror and he said , ` Let ’s do it .’. ”
Afterward , Duplessis seemed quite pleased , Hacker said .
It was n’t until the next afternoon that he called to complain .
If Hacker ’s version of events is accurate , he ’s like a shoe salesman who mistakenly brings size 11s when the customer asks for size 7s .
And Duplessis is like the customer who buys the size 11s anyway , and has them surgically sewn onto his feet .
Hacker and his buddies now have “ Chi-tonw ” tats as permanent , indelible protests against what they say is an unfair attack on their trade .
And you can get one too — free — Sundays by appointment at the Bridgeport Tattoo Co .
I ’ll pass .
The spirit of “ Chi-tonw ” is in my heart .
That ’ll have to do .

Cell phone users want the latest and greatest phones and they also want the best service possible , so in order for cell phone providers to improve the quality of wireless transmissions they require newer and taller cell towers and antennas .
But where do you put these monstrous towers when everybody needs them but do n't want to see them ?
You hide them !
Disguised as trees , flagpoles , church steeples & crosses , road signs , silos , rocks , cacti , and more , cell towers are seamlessly blending into communities and could be hiding in your backyard right now !
Creepy huh ?
Hopefully they are just being used as cell towers !

Blogger unmasked , court case upended
It was a Perry Mason moment updated for the Internet age .
As Ivy League - educated pediatrician Robert P. Lindeman sat on the stand in Suffolk Superior Court this month , defending himself in a malpractice suit involving the death of a 12 - year - old patient , the opposing counsel startled him with a question .
Was Lindeman Flea ?
Flea , jurors in the case did n't know , was the screen name for a blogger who had written often and at length about a trial remarkably similar to the one that was going on in the courtroom that day .
In his blog , Flea had ridiculed the plaintiff 's case and the plaintiff 's lawyer .
He had revealed the defense strategy .
He had accused members of the jury of dozing .
With the jury looking on in puzzlement , Lindeman admitted that he was , in fact , Flea .
The next morning , on May 15 , he agreed to pay what members of Boston 's tight - knit legal community describe as a substantial settlement -- case closed .
The case is a startling illustration of how blogging , already implicated in destroying friendships and ruining job prospects , could interfere in other important arenas .
Lawyers in Massachusetts and elsewhere , some of whom downloaded Flea 's observations and posted them on their websites , said the case has also prompted them to warn clients that blogs can come back to haunt them .
Still , Andrew C. Meyer Jr. , a well known Boston personal injury lawyer who followed the case , said he had never heard of a defendant blogging during a trial .
" Most of us investigate whatever prior writings our clients might have had , so they are not exposed to their inconsistencies in their testimony , " said Meyer , who has begun warning clients against the practice .
" But it 's impossible to do if you do n't know that your client is blogging under an assumed name . "
Neither Lindeman nor his lawyer , Paul R. Greenberg , would comment .
Vinroy Binns , the father of Jaymes Binns , of Dorchester , who died of complications from diabetes in 2002 , also declined to comment .
Elizabeth N. Mulvey , the lawyer who represented Vinroy and Deborah Binns and unmasked Lindeman as Flea , said she laughed when she read a posting at the start of the trial in which Lindeman nicknamed her Carissa Lunt , noticed that she bit her fingernails and mused , " Wonder if she 's a pillow biter , too ? "
But she was appalled that readers in the blogosphere who knew little or nothing about the case rallied to his defense .
The wrongful death suit alleged that Lindeman , who works at Natick Pediatrics , failed to diagnose that Jaymes Binns had diabetes on March 11 , 2002 , Mulvey said in a court document .
Less than six weeks later , the boy died of diabetic ketoacidosis , said Mulvey , who described the condition as " diabetes gone haywire . "
Lindeman , a graduate of Yale University and Columbia University 's College of Physicians and Surgeons , is board - certified in general pediatrics and pediatric pulmonary medicine , according to the Natick Pediatrics website .
In recent years , he has shared his medical views on local television news programs , on the " Manic Mommies " podcast produced by two Ashland mothers , and in magazines .
He is also the author of drfleablog , in which he calls himself Flea and identifies himself only as a pediatrician in the Northeast .
A flea , he told the Globe this year , is what surgeons called pediatricians in training .
The Globe 's medical blog , White Coat Notes , has occasionally included links to Lindeman 's blog , which he has recently taken down .
Mulvey , who said she only learned of the blog a couple weeks before the trial , said after reading scores of back postings that it was controversial yet intellectually stimulating .
Over the past year , Lindeman increasingly used it to rail against the malpractice suit .
In April , before the trial began , he wrote about meeting with an expert on juries who advised him how to act when he was cross- examined .
Flea was instructed to angle his chair slightly toward the jury , keep his hands folded in his lap , and face the jury when answering questions , slowly .
" Answers should be kept to no more than three sentences , " he wrote .
The consultant told him juries in medical malpractice cases base verdicts almost entirely on their view of a doctor 's character .
" We 've said it before , and we 'll say it again :
If the basis of this case is that Flea is an arrogant , uncaring jerk who maliciously neglected a patient , resulting in his death , the plaintiff will not win , period , " Flea wrote .
" As much of a cocky bastard that Flea may appear in the blogosphere , the readers who have a personal acquaintance with the real 3 - D doctor understand how such an approach cannot succeed . "
Shortly before the end of his second day on the witness stand , while focusing on Lindeman 's views of a pediatric textbook , Mulvey asked him whether he had a medical blog , she recalled .
He said he did .
Then she asked him if he was Flea .
He said he was .
The exchange may have been lost on jurors , but Meyer said Mulvey had telegraphed that she was ready to share Lindeman 's blog -- containing his unvarnished views of lawyers , jurors , and the legal process -- with the jury .
The next day , the case was settled .

[ Images : A truly awesome image of an elevated highway - house , architect unknown ( if you know , please inform ! ) ; and some L.A. freeways , photographed by satellite ] .
I 've found myself in an ongoing thought experiment for the last few months , trying to imagine what it would look like if theoretically non-domestic architectural styles were used to build the houses , or cities , of the future .
There are some obvious examples – designing houses like football stadiums , Gothic cathedrals , military bunkers , or nuclear missile silos – or even like Taco Bells , for that matter , or air traffic control towers – but there are also some less obvious , and far more interesting , possibilities out there .
Dams , for instance .
Why not build your house like a gigantic gravity dam ?
It would n't have to hold back water – so there 'd be no flooding to worry about – and you 'd have big windows on either side .
You 'd span canyons and have an incredible roof deck .
In fact , when I first saw the image , below , posted on The Cool Hunter back in December , I nearly passed out .
Alas , it 's not a dam at all , but the inner wall of a quarry ( I still like it ) .
In any case , instead of building habitable bridges , like the Ponte Vecchio in Florence –– or the Old London Bridge – with the former example surely having been at least a subtle influence on the design of Constant 's New Babylon – you 'd buildA whole suburb full of dam - houses , holding back no water .
Great arcs of concrete towering over the landscape , full of kitchens .
And there 's not a river in sight .
Or dozens of micro-dams , only three or four stories tall , forming Oscar Niemeyerian monoliths arranged around a cul - de-sac .
Families barbecue dinner in the backyard , shaded from the late summer sun by volumetric geometries of well - rebar 'd slabs – great dorsal fins of engineering , sticking up from the landscape on all sides .
You 'd come home to this !
Your own little love - nest , nestled between hills – or standing out in the middle of nowhere .
The bachelor pad of the future ... is a diversionary dam
But habitable dams are n't even the main source of structural ideas that , I think , have been sadly neglected when it comes to designing houses ; what really gets me going is thinking about how to use elevated highway ramps as a new form of single - family housing .
But that will have to wait till another post ...
YouTube is growing in popularity
Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment said its own website - Utube.com - had to be moved five times after millions of inadvertent hits made it crash .
The Ohio - based firm has now filed a claim in the US district court .
It says it wants YouTube to stop operating or alternatively pay for it to create a new web domain .
' There first '
Universal
Tube said the cost of hosting its site had grown significantly in the last two months , and claims that it had lost business because customers have had trouble accessing its site .
In August , the company , founded in 1985 , got 68 million hits on its site which eventually crashed .
" We were there first by 10 years , " Universal Tube 's president Ralph Girkins told the Associated Press news agency .
" We 've had to move our site five times in an effort to stay ahead of the YouTube.com visitors . "
YouTube , launched in February 2005 , has grown quickly into one of the most popular websites on the internet .
It has 100 million videos viewed every day and an estimated 72 million individual visitors each month .
Last month it was bought by Google for $ 1.65 bn ( £ 883 m ) in shares .
It has more than 60 staff including co-founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen .
YouTube was unavailable for comment .
“ Countdown With Keith Olbermann ” the highly rated cable news program , will be shown on network television on Sunday before a preseason NBC football game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Pittsburgh Steelers .
Since Mr. Olbermann , right , will have a regular role in NBC ’s football coverage once the season begins — appearing as a co-host on the pregame show “ Football Night in America ” on Sundays — this weekend ’s appearance of his cable show will give a wider audience a look at what he has been up for the last four years .
“ ‘ Countdown ’ is rocketing right now over at MSNBC — its ratings are going through the roof , ” said Phil Griffin , senior vice president of NBC News .
( In July Mr. Olbermann ’s show averaged 721,000 viewers , an increase of 88 percent over last July , according to MSNBC . )
Mr. Griffin added , “ The world has changed , and I think people have come in line with the smart , focused approach he has on the show . ”
No immediate plans for additional network appearances of “ Countdown ” have been made , but Mr. Griffen did not rule them out .
“ It may be the first of several times you see Olbermann on the network , ” he said .
Chaos by design
The inside story of disorder , disarray , and uncertainty at Google .
And why it 's all part of the plan .
( They hope . )
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Spend just a few minutes on Google 's sprawling campus in Mountain View , Calif. , and you 'll feel it right away :
This is a company thriving on the edge of chaos .
Google ( Charts ) , age 8 , is pulling in $ 10 billion a year in revenue and is worth about $ 125 billion , but the vibe is far more freshman mixer than profit - seeking firm whose every utterance is scrutinized for deeper meaning .
The 1.3 - million - square - foot headquarters is a m�lange of two - story buildings full of festive cafeterias ( yes , they 're all free ) , crammed conference rooms , and hallway bull sessions , all of it surrounded by sandy volleyball courts , youngsters whizzing by on motorized scooters , and -- there 's no better way to put this -- an anything - goes spirit .
It 's a place where failure coexists with triumph , and ideas bubble up from lightly supervised engineers , none of whom worry too much about their projects ever making money .
An edgy management style

Three ways Tim Armstrong , Google 's VP for advertising sales , is trying to expand the moneymaking part of Google .
Go Big Google became a phenomenon by selling text ads a few dollars at a time .
Armstrong 's been calling on the likes of Dell , General Motors , and News Corp. , asking for multimillion - dollar orders .
Print
It Newspapers and magazines view Google as the ultimate threat , which is why Armstrong wants to help them sell ads online .
It 's an 18 - month - old experiment that 's going slowly .
Hit the Airwaves Google recently bought dMarc Broadcasting , which brokers radio ads .
When dMarc morphs into Google Audio
Ads this fall , Google will be pitching radio time to its advertisers .
It 's a mature business where Google 's a mere toddler .
Take the case of Sheryl Sandberg , a 37 - year - old vice president whose fiefdom includes the company 's automated advertising system .
Sandberg recently committed an error that cost Google several million dollars -- " Bad decision , moved too quickly , no controls in place , wasted some money , " is all she 'll say about it -- and when she realized the magnitude of her mistake , she walked across the street to inform Larry Page , Google 's co-founder and unofficial thought leader .
" God , I feel really bad about this , " Sandberg told Page , who accepted her apology .
But as she turned to leave , Page said something that surprised her .
" I 'm so glad you made this mistake , " he said .
" Because I want to run a company where we are moving too quickly and doing too much , not being too cautious and doing too little .
If we do n't have any of these mistakes , we 're just not taking enough risk . "
When a million - dollar mistake earns a pat on the back , it 's obvious this is n't your normal corporation .
To figure the place out , I 've repeatedly been told the person to see is Shona Brown , the 40 - year - old ex-McKinsey consultant who is Google 's senior vice president for business operations .
That 's what it says on her business card , anyway , but she might as well be Google 's chief chaos officer .
She literally wrote the book on the subject , a 1998 bestseller called " Competing on the Edge : Strategy as Structured Chaos . "
And fittingly , on the day I 'm to see her at the Googleplex , my press escort and I get hopelessly lost .
Finding anyone here requires precise navigation and the ability to read color - coded maps .
We get so badly turned around -- entering the wrong building 's lobby , backtracking through shrubbery to another -- that we arrive 17 minutes late .
Even real estate at Google is chaotic .
Click here to read more on Google 's leadership
Brown has made a career of arguing that anarchy is n't such a bad thing -- which is why Page , co-founder Sergey Brin , and CEO Eric Schmidt hired her in 2003 .
A business theoretician in a company dominated by engineers , she considers Google the " ultimate petri dish " for her research , though her job is anything but theoretical .
In addition to overseeing human resources ( called " people operations " ) , Brown runs a SWAT team of 25 strategic consultants who are loaned out internally on ten or so projects at a time -- restructuring a regional sales force here , guesstimating a market size there .
The company 's goal , says Brown , is to determine precisely the amount of management it needs -- and then use a little bit less .
It 's an almost laughably Goldilocksian approach that Brown also advocates in her book , co-written with a Stanford business professor .
The way to succeed in " fast - paced , ambiguous situations , " she tells me , is to avoid creating too much structure , but not to add too little either .
In other words , just make it not too hot and not too cold , and you 're done .
" If I ever come into the office and I feel comfortable , if I do n't feel a little nervous about some crazy stuff going on , then we 've taken it too far , " she says .
A " Googley " approach to business
Crazy definitely trumps comfy at Google .
You have to keep your wits about you on campus just to avoid smashing into one of Google 's 8,000 - plus employees .
Meetings typically start on the hour , and young Googlers tend to hover outside scarce conference rooms beforehand .
They doodle on hallway whiteboards , contributing inside jokes , such as sinister new ways to expand the company 's online advertising program .
( " AdSense for Eyelids , " reads one . )
Celebrity sightings are ho -hum .
A couple of years ago I was having lunch at Google 's sunny outdoor courtyard when Page and Brin sat down at my table with their guest , comedian Chris Tucker .
George Soros lectured at Google the day I met Brown .
Google advisor Al Gore shows up often .
Nurturing such an off - the - wall culture is a luxury only a company that 's performing stupendously well can afford , and Google is certainly doing that .
Two years after going public , its stock is up more than fourfold , and it's so profitable that despite helter - skelter spending on everything from mammoth data centers to worldwide sales and engineering offices , Google is generating more than $ 800 million in cash each quarter .
In the process , Google is thrashing the competition -- in market share , deals won , buzz -- notably Yahoo ( Charts ) and Microsoft ( Charts ) .
It 's also cozying up to a growing list of heavyweights you 'd think would be warier , including News Corp ( Charts ) . , Viacom ( Charts ) , and ad - agency giant WPP ( Charts ) .
If Google 's engine is running fast , then naturally it 's also running hot .
That sheds light on all kinds of blunders -- many of them dwarfing Sandberg 's -- which Google likes to explain away as its Googley approach to business .
( Googley being a cloying description these people actually say out loud .
Frequently . )
The company is figuring things out as it goes , and not quite as effectively as you 'd expect from its stellar financial results .
Its new products have n't made nearly the splash that its original search engine did .
Critics have mocked its self - righteous " Do n't be evil " motto when , for example , Google decided to scan copyrighted books for its book search index .
Even Google 's rocket - ship stock price has been grounded .
After a run from $ 85 in August 2004 to $ 475 last January , it has puttered around $ 400 for most of the year .
Says Benjamin Schachter , an analyst with UBS : " Investors are saying , ' Enough of what you 're going to do .
What does it do to the numbers ? ' "
What concerns investors is whether Google can come up with a second act .
There 's nothing to suggest that its growth engine -- ad - supported search -- is in trouble .
But it 's clear from Google 's tentative lurches into new forms of advertising and its spaghetti method of product development ( toss against wall , see if sticks ) that the company is searching for ways to grow beyond that well - run core .
It 's the reason , for example , that Google requires all engineers to spend 20 % of their time pursuing their own ideas .
Successful second acts are exceedingly rare in the technology business -- or in any business , for that matter .
Microsoft followed Windows with Office .
Intel jettisoned its memory - chip line to rule microprocessors .
Even Apple , which executed one of the most remarkable rebirths ever with the iPod , had to go through a painful decade to get there .
What emerges from months of interviews with employees ranging from fresh - out - of - college hires to the CEO is that Google firmly believes it has a framework for figuring out the future .
It should come as no surprise that the plan is as irreverent , self - confident , and presumptuous as the company itself .
Google 's executives do n't articulate it this way , but the framework can be found in the title of Shona Brown 's book : structured chaos .
Indeed , along with Googleyness , chaos is among the most important aspects of Google 's self - image .
Understanding how Google thinks about chaos -- like Page 's teachable moment after Sandberg 's million - dollar mistake -- is critical to divining where the company goes next .
" Are lots of questions hanging out there in the market ? " asks Sandberg .
" Sure .
Because we do n't always have an answer .
We 're willing to tolerate that ambiguity and chaos because that 's where the room is for innovation . "
Good strategy -- if it actually works .
In " Competing on the Edge " , Brown describes a sizzling Silicon Valley software company from the 1990s that was confronting the joys and hardships of hypergrowth .
She identifies it only with a pseudonym , Galaxy , and it bears a striking resemblance to Brown 's current employer , which did n't exist yet .
" Galaxy was populated by smart , hip twenty - and thirtysomethings who were chosen for their brains and their attitude , " she wrote .
" Tour Galaxy and you 'll be struck by the college - like atmosphere .
Landing a job at Galaxy is hard .
The screening process is intense .
Once hired , the Galaxy philosophy is to let people ' do their own thing . ' " But Galaxy had one glaring weakness : " The firm was living off one set of unusually successful products , whereas the rest of the businesses were much more modest performers . "
Finding a follow - up act
What vexed Galaxy is precisely Google 's challenge today .
For all its new products -- depending on how you count , Google has released at least 83 full - fledged and test - stage products -- none has altered the Web landscape the way Google.com did .
Additions like the photo site Picasa , Google Finance , and Google Blog Search belie Google 's ardent claim that it does n't do me - too products .
Often new services lack a stunningly obvious feature .
Users of Google 's new online spreadsheet program , for instance , initially could n't print their documents .
The calendar product does n't allow for synchronization with Microsoft Outlook , a necessity for corporate users .
Other major initiatives like Gmail , instant - messaging , and online mapping , while nifty , have n't come close to dislodging the market leaders .
Much - hyped projects like the comparison - shopping site Froogle ( nearly four years in beta and counting ) and Google 's video - sharing site have been far less popular than the competition .
One of Google 's biggest misses is its social - networking site , Orkut , which is a hit only in Brazil and -- as Marissa Mayer , Google 's 31 - year - old vice president of search products and user experience , says with an impressively straight face -- is " very strong in Iran . "
Sometimes promising new products are buried so deep within Google 's sites that users can't find them .
" You can only keep so many things in your head , " acknowledges CEO Schmidt .
" Even if you 're the No. 1 Google supporter , you cannot remember all the products we have . "
This presents a conundrum : Impose order , and Google becomes just like everybody else ; let chaos rule , and run the risk that Google 's flailing about hurts its pristine brand and reputation for brilliance .
Clarifying its intentions would be a start .
" We need to do a better job of communicating which products we expect to be killer apps and which are experiments , " Brin told a gathering of journalists in May .
There 's been progress .
In June , Google released its online payment tool , Checkout , as a full - fledged product .
Mayer , who has the final word ( except for Page ) on what appears on Google 's home page , has established a war room to piece together a plan for better integrating Google 's many products .
It 's going to be a battle , though , simply because Googlers are adding features by the bushel -- and more are coming .
Niniane Wang , a young engineer who worked on Gmail , is now assigned to a confidential project believed to involve social networking .
Louis Monier , a Digital Equipment veteran who launched its AltaVista search engine , recently left eBay to join Google in a top - secret capacity .
Katie Jacobs Stanton runs Google Finance , Google Blog Search , and two other projects .
This summer she temporarily moved with her husband and three children to Bangalore to get closer to the engineers who built the finance site .
Since Google
Finance does n't run ads or any other revenue - generating features , I ask Stanton how long the site can ignore making money .
Her response : " Theoretically , forever . "
In fact , Google is making money slyly , if slowly , on some of the very products that seem like mere whiz - bang .
Consider Google Earth , the ubiquitous cable - news prop and workplace time waster that lets users view incredibly detailed geographic photos from around the world .
It started as a satellite - imaging software company called Keyhole .
" Sergey [ Brin ] was playing around with it and got enamored with Keyhole , " says John Hanke , Keyhole 's original CEO ( and now a Google employee ) before Google bought it in 2004 .
" At a staff meeting , he put Keyhole up on one of the projectors and started showing people their houses and flying around . "
The startup , whose images were confined to the U.S. , had been bringing in modest revenue from real estate companies , but that 's not what interested Brin .
" When we got to Google , one of the first questions Sergey asked was , ' Why ca n't you look at the whole world at once ? ' " says Hanke .
Two years later the company is integrating ads into Google Earth .
Search for " pizza " while hovering above your neighborhood , and you 'll get the idea .
Neat toys are about more than creating Web pages on which Google can slap ads .
Google Earth has been downloaded more than 100 million times , and embedded in each download is a request from Google to place a toolbar , a Web gadget that includes a search box , permanently on a user 's Web browser .
That seemingly innocuous query is a gold mine for Google , because the ever present box increases the likelihood users will search on Google .
The more people search on Google , the greater the chances someone will click on an advertiser 's ads .
" We know the lifetime value of a toolbar user , " says Mayer , who offers the example to counter the notion that Google is n't trying to profit from its fancy doodads .
" So we know how much value we 're getting back out of somebody who downloads Google Earth and then subsequently downloads the toolbar . "
Strategic Partnering
This virtuous cycle of more users conducting more searches benefiting more advertisers is precisely what makes Google so irresistible to business partners -- even those who feel threatened by it .
Martin Sorrell , the chief executive of ad agency holding company WPP , has been outspoken in his fear that Google could obviate companies like his .
( Automated ad auctions entail less overhead than armies of schmoozing ad executives , goes the argument . )
He titled a section of his latest annual report " Google : Friend or Foe ? "
In an interview , he suggests the short answer : " The bigger and more successful you get , the more people want to bring you down . "
But it 's not that simple .
WPP , Sorrell notes , is Google 's third - largest customer , measured by the amount of advertising it purchases on Google for its clients .
Sorrell says Google wants to improve its access to WPP 's clients , and he 's inclined to allow that -- provided there 's something in it for WPP .
" We represent 20 % of media revenue worldwide , and we 're definitely not 20 % of Google 's revenue , " he says .
" We 'll see how we can work together . "
Working with Google and grumbling about it is quite in fashion .
Viacom 's MTV recently signed a deal for Google to distribute its videos to the Web publishers in Google 's AdSense network , which lets the publishers run ads supplied by Google 's advertisers .
Comcast , which has been Google 's ideological opponent in an acrimonious legislative battle over government regulation of Net access , is particularly pleased with the revenue it gets from having Google power the search results on its Comcast .
net home page for broadband users .
In both cases , the older companies profit from Google 's superior Internet advertising network .
Indeed , after initially scaring " old " media , Google has become the go - to partner for juicing Internet revenues .
Chumminess with the establishment is in the air in mid-August when I meet with Schmidt , two days after Google 's announcement of a landmark deal to provide search over numerous News Corp. properties , notably MySpace .
( Google guarantees News Corp. $ 900 million over 3 � years in exchange for an unspecified share of ad revenue . )
In our 90 - minute interview , I remind Schmidt that at a lunch for journalists in March , he repeatedly mentioned MySpace almost wistfully , seeing how Google had been a bust in social networking .
" We did n't know what to do about it , " he says .
" Now we know . "
He explains that Google 's new social - networking effort has at least two prongs .
The well - known part is the MySpace deal ; the other is Google 's technology to improve search on social - networking sites , which so far only MySpace has agreed to use .
Schmidt 's explanation is a bald attempt to declare victory after an obvious defeat , since MySpace trounced Google 's Orkut ( not including , of course , those triumphs in Brazil and Iran ) .
The MySpace deal reveals the Google leadership triumvirate 's visceral style .
The transaction might never have happened , says Schmidt , if Brin had n't flown to meet with News Corp. executives in Pebble Beach , Calif. , where Rupert Murdoch was hosting an A - list bull session on global issues .
( Schmidt was vacationing in Europe ; Page was in India . )
" We sent Sergey because he 's very intuitive , " says Schmidt .
" He goes down there and sort of hangs with them for a while and comes back and says , ' You know , I 'm really sure we should do this . '
And it 's not a numbers argument .
It 's a feeling of commitment . "
Winning MySpace kept the Web's gem of the moment out of the hands of Microsoft and Yahoo , which both privately claim that Google overpaid by several hundred million dollars .
Whether that 's true wo n't be known for years .
Tim Armstrong , Google 's New York - based head of North American sales and the company 's point man in the MySpace negotiations , pooh - poohs the notion that Google got taken .
" What people are n't seeing is our ability to model deals , " he says .
" I would guess that Google was not offering to write the biggest check for this partnership . "
In any event , the deal created a fan in News Corp. , which has steadfastly refused to place any of its
Fox shows on Google 's video site and yet is positively giddy about its budding advertising relationship .
" I actually do n't view them as overwhelmingly competitive with us , " says Peter Chernin , News Corp .'s president and chief operating officer .
" They are trying to sell advertising , and so are we .
But at their core I view them as a technology company , and we are an entertainment company .
It 's a happy and convenient marriage . "
Mapping the future
It 's great for Google that Murdoch & Co. love it so , but that does n't change the impression that Google is winging it -- after all , the deal only came together after Brin descended from the clouds to peer into News Corp .'s soul .
When I ask Schmidt whether his company actually has a plan , he does what engineers tend to do in situations like this :
He gets up and starts drawing on a whiteboard .
A billionaire at 51 , Schmidt cuts the typical Silicon Valley figure of somebody 's successful , but otherwise average , dad .
His khakis - and - oxford uniform is standard , as are his wire - frame glasses and Supercuts - inspired hairdo .
Schmidt 's doodling , which he's also done recently for the Google board of directors , tells the story of where he sees Google 's money coming from for years to come .
He draws a series of connected clouds representing the history of the computing industry , from mainframes to minicomputers to PCs to today 's mobile devices .
The gist of the illustration is that there 's practically no money left to be made in computers , not in hardware or software .
The money , instead , is all in Web applications , a trend Schmidt had been predicting since his days as chief technology officer at Sun a decade ago .
Users wo n't always be traveling to the Web on the PC , which is why he scribbles lines for cellphones , cable set - top boxes , Treos , BlackBerrys , and so on .
Schmidt 's most compelling point -- and the most visible glimmer of a method to Google 's madness -- is the power behind the not - so - secret data centers Google is building , particularly a 30 - acre facility in Oregon whose existence he references without provocation .
" That massive investment should translate into the ability to build applications that are impossible for our competitors to offer , just because we can handle the scale , " says Schmidt .
( Microsoft , Yahoo , and IBM , each of which is spending heavily on similar big iron , would beg to differ . )
He 's talking about processing - power - sucking Google applications like Gmail and Google Earth -- and unannounced products on the drawing board .
Google has also begun to show how it plans to use that power for advertising services that go beyond search .
Brokering video ads for MTV is new terrain , as are the graphical display ads Google plans to sell for MySpace .
The company is engaged in an 18 - month - old experiment to auction text and graphical ads for newspapers and magazines .
It 's also in the process of integrating its biggest acquisition to date , a radio - advertising company called dMarc Broadcasting , which Google bought in January for $ 102 million in cash plus a potential performance - based payout of more than $ 1 billion .
dMarc automates the process for delivering radio ads to about 10 % of the country 's 10,000 stations .
By merging dMarc into Google 's AdWords , Google 's online system for auctioning search terms , it will offer its advertisers -- who so far hawk their wares in 75 words or less of written text -- the ability to deploy radio ads as well .
It 's a bold push .
" We see very clear ways to improve advertising for all users , " says Armstrong , the sales chief .
It 's the " all " in his aspirations that frightens anyone in Google 's path .
Or used to , anyway , before people started noticing that not everything Google does rocks the world .
Nick Grouf , CEO of Spot Runner , a well - funded Los Angeles startup that does even more for television advertisers than dMarc does for radio , sees an Achilles ' heel .
" It 's their incredible focus that got them this far , " says Grouf .
" But all these new initiatives suggest a dilution of that focus . "
With so many moving parts , it 's natural to wonder if Google is truly a company for the ages -- or whether it 's the next Galaxy , that fast - moving , arrogant , one - hit wonder in Shona Brown 's book .
To believe that Google will find its second act , you have to accept the hubris and the chaos , and that the brainiacs who got lucky once will do so again .
Google desperately wants to believe its nonlinear approach is all part of the plan .
But as the company 's big thinkers are the first to admit , most of the questions about Google are n't answerable .
Try as they may , no one can truly control chaos .

RAW STORY

This Iraq fails to meet key US political and security benchmarks in an upcoming report to Congress that seems certain to increase calls from lawmakers and the restive public to withdraw US troops , a US newspaper said Sunday .
The government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki was unlikely to meet any of the political and security goals and timelines set for it by President George W. Bush when he announced a major shift in US Iraq policy last January , the Washington Post daily reported .
" Top administration officials are aware that the strategy 's stated goal -- using U.S. forces to create breathing space for Iraqi political reconciliation -- will not be met by September , said one person fresh from a White House meeting , " Karen DeYoung and Thomas E. Ricks wrote for the Post .
" But though some , including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , have indicated flexibility toward other options , including early troop redeployments , Bush has made no decisions on a possible new course . "
The official told the paper , " The heart of darkness is the president .
Nobody knows what he thinks , even the people who work for him . "
The US Congress earlier this year passed a law containing 18 goals as part of a war - funding measure , setting a September deadline for a thorough assessment of the situation on the ground and calling for a July interim report , which is now just days away .
The president deployed additional troops to buy time for Iraqi political reconciliation , but the Post said that that the report , due sometime this month , concludes US combat deaths have escalated , violence has spread beyond Baghdad and sectarianism has further polarized Iraq .
" The security progress we 're making in Iraq is real , " a senior intelligence official in Baghdad told the daily , " but it 's only in part of the country and there 's not enough political progress to get us over the line in September . "
Nevertheless , the newspaper reported that the top coalition commander , General David Petraeus , and US Iraq Ambassador Ryan Crocker will emphasize the positive when they provide their assessment to Congress in September , while offering new measures of progress to justify prolonging the US military mission in Iraq .
Meanwhile , the New York Times on Sunday called for US troops to leave Iraq , writing that Bush 's plan to stabilize the country through military means is a lost cause .
" It is time for the United States to leave Iraq , without any more delay than the Pentagon needs to organize an orderly exit , " the influential daily wrote in an unusually long editorial that took up one - half of a page .
" It is frighteningly clear that Mr. Bush 's plan is to stay the course as long as he is president and dump the mess on his successor .
Whatever his cause was , it is lost , " the daily opined .
The administration does report some good news in the upcoming assessment however , noting that Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar province are turning against Al - Qaeda ; that sectarian killings were down in June ; and that Iraqi political leaders last month agreed on a unified response to the bombing of a major religious shrine .
Still , officials told the Post that those achievements pale in comparison to the numerous setbacks in America 's efforts to make Iraq stand on its own and provide for its own security .
Meanwhile , a growing tide of Republicans continued to break with the president on Iraq , as desperation about the course of events in the war torn country grows .
" Let 's be honest here .
We have a mess now .
Who are we kidding ? " US Senator Chuck Hagel told NBC television Sunday .
" We have no good options in Iraq now . "
The revelations about the report 's findings come as Congress prepares to resume debate in Iraq , as it takes up funding this week .
Some stalwart Bush supporters in the US legislature said it might be possible to simply scale back expectations , rather than pulling out of Iraq altogether .
" We need to go back and reevaluate ... establishing Jeffersonian democracy in Iraq , " said US Representative Pete Hoekstra , top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , speaking on Fox News .
" We need to have this national debate about : do we believe that radical jihadists are a threat to US security in the long term ?
And I 'm not sure that we 've come to a consensus on that , " Hoekstra said .

RIYADH ( Reuters ) - Gulf Arab countries will not be used as a launch pad for any military attack on Iran , a powerful Saudi royal was quoted as saying on Sunday .
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul - Aziz said Iran had no interest in striking its oil - producing Arab neighbors if it comes under attack from the United States .
“ I think the brothers in Iran are totally aware that ...
Iran will not be a source of harm for their neighbors and brothers ...
These countries ( Arab neighbors ) will not be a source of harm for Iran , ” he said in remarks late on Saturday carried by state news agency SPA .
“ Respect and consideration are mutual .
I speak for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ( relations ) with Iran and for the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) , ” he added , referring to Kuwait , Qatar , Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates and Oman .
Nayef urged Iran to hand over militants suspected of plotting against the kingdom .
Iran extradited a number of Saudi suspects to the kingdom in the past .
Some of the suspects have been released after being cleared .
He also called on Tehran not to meddle in Iraqi affairs .
Sunni Saudi Arabia had accused Iran of backing Shi’ite death squads killing Sunnis in Iraq , and of backing an opposition front led by Hezbollah in efforts to bring down the Sunni - backed government in Lebanon .
“ Creed does not justify intervention in Iraqi affairs , ” he said .
91 Pin Strike in Power Bowling Training
To get an automatic 91 pin strike in the last round of Power Bowling , Throw the ball on the right or left rail ( depending on if you are right or left handed ) so that it stays on it the whole time .

Then all the pins will fall down from the shockwave .

Scientists subjected mice to a diet that was 40 percent fat and lots of high fructose corn syrup - the human equivalent of a McDonald 's meal and 8 cans of soda per day - and it took only four weeks for liver enzymes to increase and for glucose intolerance , the beginning of type II diabetes , to begin .
" We wanted to mirror the kind of diet many Americans subsist on , so the high fat content is about the same you 'd find in a typical McDonald 's meal , and the high fructose corn syrup translates to about eight cans of soda a day in a human diet , which is not far off with what some people consume , " says Brent Tetri , M.D. , associate professor of internal medicine at Saint Louis University and a leading researcher in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , which can lead to cirrhosis and , ultimately , death .
" But we were also keeping the mice sedentary , with a very limited amount of activity . "
The study , which lasted for 16 weeks , had some curious results , says Tetri .
" We had a feeling we 'd see evidence of fatty liver disease by the end of the study , " he says .
" But we were surprised to find how severe the damage was and how quickly it occurred .
It took only four weeks for liver enzymes to increase and for glucose intolerance – the beginning of type II diabetes – to begin . "
And unlike other studies , the mice were not forced to eat ; rather , they were able to eat whenever they wanted – and eat they did .
Tetri says there 's evidence that suggests fructose actually suppresses your fullness , unlike fiber - rich foods , which make you feel full quickly .
The take - home message for humans is obvious , he says .
" A high - fat and sugar - sweetened diet compounded by a sedentary lifestyle will have severe repercussions for your liver and other vital organs , " he says .
" Fatty liver disease now affects about one of every eight children in this country .
The good news is that it is somewhat reversible – but for some it will take major changes in diet and lifestyle . "

A lawsuit filed on behalf of an Alzheimer ’s disease patient says care at a Mission Viejo home for the elderly was so poor that a rat climbed into the former lawyer ’s mouth and died , where it was found by staff .
The lawsuit was filed Thursday in Orange County Superior Court for Sigmund Bock , who was admitted to Paragon Gardens Assisted Living and Memory Care Community in February .
The lawsuit , which says Bock is 72 , alleges negligence and elder abuse by the facility , its administrators and parent companies , including Sunwest Management Inc. , a Salem , Ore. , firm that operates 180 care facilities across the country .
In a statement , Sunwest denied the allegations and said Bock ’s attorney was intent on winning the case in the “ court of public opinion . ”

According to Sunwest , Paragon employees spotted a mouse inside the building and called a pest control firm .
A glue trap was placed in Bock ’s room .
The trap was “ evidently picked up ” by Bock , and he was found “ holding the trap in his hand .
Inside the trap was one small dead field mouse , ” Sunwest said .
Attorney Stephen Garcia , who filed the lawsuit , could not be reached for comment .
The state Department of Social Services revoked Paragon ’s license in October when six patients were injured , mostly in falls , and understaffing issues surfaced months after a 71 - year - old man with Alzheimer ’s disease wandered from the facility last June .
The man was never found and is presumed dead .

His family has sued the facility , according to the Associated Press .
The state revoked the certificate of Paragon ’s administrator and barred her and eight other staff members and administrators from having contact with a community care facility in California .
The company appealed the decision , an action that stays the revocation order , pending an April 25 hearing , said Michael Weston , a Department of Social Services spokesman .
The state is investigating the alleged rat incident .
In March , according to the lawsuit , Paragon ’s staff failed to check on Bock , allowing “ a rat to crawl up ” his body , and “ enter his mouth , stay in his mouth and die in his mouth . ”
No date is specified .

The McMansion may be shrinking .
With the nation 's housing market in a slump and the mortgage market in disarray , many home builders are putting up fewer supersize homes and offering smaller floor plans .
That seems to be what buyers suddenly want in an era of high prices and tougher financing .
" Financing has tightened down so much that many people are n't able to qualify for the larger houses , " said Kathryn Boyce , an account executive in Northern California for Boston - based real - estate research firm Hanley Wood Market Intelligence .
" Throughout the U.S. people can't afford what they previously did .
Floor plans are going to get smaller . "
Home sales have plunged over the past year , leaving builders saddled with excess inventory , especially of larger , more expensive homes .
In July , new - home sales were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 870,000 units , down sharply from 1.3 million in 2005 .
More recently , turmoil in the mortgage market has made it harder for buyers to qualify for bigger loans .
As lending standards get stiffer , lenders have cut back on mortgages exceeding $ 417,000 .
That 's the maximum size loan that lenders can sell to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government - sponsored financiers that buy mortgages from lenders and repackage them into mortgage bonds for sale to investors .

On Sunday talk show , Clinton refuses to commit to full Iraq pullout by end of first term John Byrne
Published : Monday September 24 , 2007

The leading Democratic contender for the presidency was asked whether she 'd pull out all troops from Iraq in her first term .
She declined .
" You know , I 'm not going to get into hypotheticals and make pledges , because I do n't know what I 'm going to inherit , " Sen .
Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) told ABC's George Stephanopoulos , according to the New York Times .
" I do n't know and neither do any of us know what will be the situation in the region .
How much more aggressive will Iran have become ?
What will be happening in the Middle East ?
" How much more of an influence will the chaos in Iraq have in terms of what 's going on in the greater region ? " she continued .
" Will we have pushed Al Qaeda in Iraq out of their stronghold with our new partnership with some of the tribal sheikhs or will they have regrouped and retrenched ?
I do n't know and I think it 's not appropriate to be speculating . "
Clinton is in a bind over her stance on the war -- on the one hand , she has to appease those who support liberal activist groups like MoveOn.org -- and on the other , she must court a broader electorate .
On CNN's Late Edition , she was asked about MoveOn 's controversial " General Betray Us " ad , which accused Gen. David Petraeus of betraying America for " cooking the books " on the Iraq war for the White House on the day he testified before Congress .
Clinton took a middle ground .
" Let 's be clear what 's going on here , " she said .
" This is an effort to focus on an ad that I condemned and do n't condone in order to avoid having to deal with the tough questions about our policy in Iraq .
The policy has failed . "
And on NBC's Meet The Press : " Let 's be clear about this :
This is not a debate about an ad .
This is a debate about the direction we should pursue in Iraq .
" The real problem is a policy in Iraq that has failed , and unfortunately , it is clear that the president does not intend to change direction before he leaves office . "
The following video is from ABC's This Week , broadcast on September 23 .
Editor 's note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
CNN's Matthew Chance was given rare access to Kazakh villages where above - ground nuclear tests have left generations scarred .
Here , he describes what he saw for CNN.com .
SEMEY , Kazakhstan ( CNN ) -- Kazakhstan 's nuclear orphans are a distressing sight .
This young child slept at an orphanage , his deformities the result of nuclear testing in the region .
The first child I met in the local orphanage was lying limply in his crib .
His giant , pale head was perched on his tiny shoulders , covered in bed sores , like a grotesquely painted paper - mâché mask .
Peering out , a pair of tiny black eyes darted around .
It took me a few seconds to understand what I was seeing .
The doctor told me he was 4 years old .
Through the bars in the next crib , I saw another child , twisted with deformities .
His fragile legs and arms turned in impossible contortions .
These are the children of Kazakhstan 's terrifying nuclear past .
Decades of Soviet nuclear testing unleashed a plague of birth defects .
When the Soviet Union tested its nuclear devices , it chose eastern Kazakhstan , one of its remotest , most desolate areas .
But no one bothered to evacuate the people living there .
Watch the effects of nuclear bombs on villagers »
The testing began in 1949 at a site known as Polygon and continued until 1989 .
According to the Nuclear Threat Initiative , there were 456 tests , including 116 nuclear bombs tested above ground .
The Polygon site officially closed on August 29 , 1991 -- 16 years ago this week .
Local officials say there were hundreds of thousands of people , possibly as many as a million , who lived in the region during the nuclear testing .
The end of the Cold War might have ended this dark chapter , but thousands are still paying a terrible price .

From the old Soviet city of Semipalatinsk , now renamed Semey , it was a long grueling drive across the barren , flat Kazakh plain .
Nature can be hostile here , with temperatures hitting over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in summer , then plunging to 40 below in winter .
The people living in the villages scattered throughout this former nuclear testing zone have been through the unspeakable .
Seriqkaisha is 62 years old .
She remembers watching the mushroom clouds as a child .
" We were very frightened , " she told me , " because the windows in our house would blow out and the walls would shake .
My parents both died of cancer , and my own son is handicapped . "
Almost every family in Seriqkaisha 's village , 20 miles from the old test site , is affected -- from cancers to impotency to birth defects and other deformities .
See where the nuclear site is located »
Meeting people was proving hard .
The genetic defections and illnesses that afflict so many here are frequently a source of shame .
The doctor told me that people hide their deformed family members from outsiders .
For decades , they have felt like animals in a zoo , she said , and had grown to distrust prying eyes .
The region also has one of the highest suicide rates in the world , according to local health officials .
Tragically , many young men who discover they are impotent -- one of the effects of nuclear fallout -- end their own lives .
A doctor introduced me to Biken -- one of the few residents who agreed to be interviewed .
She was born in 1951 , two years after the nuclear testing began .
Her facial disfigurement , she said , has always brought her despair .
" If only there had been no bombs , I could have been equal to every one else .
My youngest daughter looks like me too .
I worry about her future , more than anything , " Biken said .
It was heartbreaking to hear .
The problem of defects is so big , there 's even a museum of mutations at the regional medical institute back in Semey , the largest city near the old nuclear testing site .
It 's a small room filled with jars containing deformed fetuses and human organs preserved in formaldehyde .
It 's hard to look at them -- babies with bulging eyes and malformed brains , or conjoined twins locked in a contorted embrace .
The head of the institute , Tolebae Rakhipbekov , showed me around and told me how this house was more than just a grim collection of anomalies .
It was the reality for some parents , and a real fear for everyone who lives here .
" You could call these children , and others affected , victims of the Cold War .
Kazakhstan has refused nuclear ambitions now because it experienced 40 years of this war .
Nowhere else were there so many nuclear tests , " Rakhhipbekov said .
And nowhere else , I suppose , are so many Cold War injustices still being felt .

Linden Lab recently outlawed gambling in Second Life , officially making cybersex the one interesting thing that happens there .
A Jesuit scholar has suggested that Second Life is an excellent target for missionary work in an attempt to bring that number down to zero .
The very concept of missionary work in an artificial world brings up a number of questions , many of them exceedingly creepy .
Chief among them is this :
How do you speak of spiritual things to a giant squirrel person with six breasts ?
If you 're a virtual missionary in a virtual world speaking to another virtual person , are you trying to convert the virtual person or the real person behind it ?
This seems like it ought to be a fairly straightforward question .
After all , as far as we know Heaven does n't even have broadband .
There 's no point in trying to get a half - naked robot lady to take the Eucharist , half - naked robot ladies do n't really enter into God 's great plan .
No , obviously you 're going to have to reach the person behind the keyboard , the sinner behind the symbol .
The problem with this is that virtual worlds are someplace where you can be someone else .
In fact , you can be anyone else .
It would be ridiculous to go a comic book convention and try to talk someone dressed as Doctor Octopus out of robbing banks .
Presumably animal - rights activists are n't trying to convince Glenn Close not to make clothing out of Dalmatians .
Why would you wander into a virtual world and pick out likely targets for conversion based on their avatars ?
Certainly you can look around for immoral behavior , but that leads to the tricky question of whether pretending to be immoral is actually immoral .
From what I 've been able to puzzle out , I think most sins are only sins if you 're actually doing them .
There have been plenty of attempts to argue that violent video games encourage people to be violent in real life , but as far as I know nobody is arguing that shooting down gang members in a video game is , itself , murder .
( Actually , " nobody " is a tricky word to use in the age of the internet .
It does n't seem impossible that somewhere out there , on some cramped , crazy little blog , someone 's holding vigil for all the gang members , aliens and orcs cut down in their prime . )
However , some sins seem to be sins even if you 're just pretending .
Most of these have to do with sex .
If I log in to Second Life as Clorgo Codpiece and pretend to shoot up with my friend Sexxula Bodyoil , I do n't think I 'm actually doing heroin from a religious point of view .
But if we pretend to engage in all sorts of unlikely and disturbing sexual acts with each other , apparently we 're actually committing adultery ?
Or maybe it 's only adultery if we 're doing it for sexual stimulation .
If we 're performance artists with a purely intellectual dedication to portraying unsettlingly artificial humanoids working their way through the Kama Sutra , perhaps it 's merely pornography .
The point is , it confuses things .
Instead of trying to figure out who needs a good convertin ' based on their actions , maybe you could ask them .
But then you have to wonder if they 're telling you the truth .
There are many people on the internet who will tell you that they 're Catholic schoolgirls , but very few of them are Catholic , schoolgirls or both .
And if you meet someone who appears to be a half - naked woman , have a long talk about God 's plan , and come back in a month to find them dressed as a nun , well , it 's possible that you had such an effect on them that they immediately joined a convent that gives novices internet access , but it seems more likely that you just convinced them to switch fetishes .

” 131 ″ We met with Mr. Jonathan Pyatt , Legislative Council for Rep. Debbie Wasserman - Schultz .
Mr. Pyatt welcomed us and made it clear that Rep. Wasserman - Schultz was sympathetic to our position , but was also afraid that impeachment would distract from implementing a variety of social programs , such as issues surrounding child health care .
We reminded him of the importance of stopping the precedent set by this Administration and the power of the veto to prevent significant social change , suggesting that the best way to accomplish the Democratic agenda is through impeachment .
Mr. Pyatt stated that Rep. Wasserman - Schultz is also concerned about ensuring that Democrats remain in power and gain the White House during the upcoming elections .
We informed him of how previous impeachment attempts have favored the party pursuing them and discussed how the public perception of Democrats as unwilling to hold the Administration accountable was making them look weaker and hurting their chances in the elections .
Ultimately , Mr. Pyatt stated that the Congresswoman ’s position was that we may get to the point where impeachment is required , but that this is not the time , and that we should talk about it again in September .
We conveyed the urgency of the situation in light of the upcoming distraction in the form of the 2008 elections .
We also presented Mr. Pyatt with “ The Genius of Impeachment , ” and wrapped up by reminding him that it does n’t hurt to join the 15 supporters of H. Res. 333 , to which he replied , “ Point taken . ”
Pressure from constituents can hardly go awry at this point .

We met with Rep. Bobby Scott next .
Rep .
Scott spoke with us for about an hour , and even then practically had to be dragged away by his staffers once he was late for his next appointment .
David Swanson of After Downing Street describes the meeting : “ I like debating Scott because he starts with most of the same premises I do but ends up in a totally different place …
He maintains that there does not yet exist solid evidence for impeachment , and that investigations will uncover such evidence faster if they are not called impeachment investigations .
He thinks that calling them impeachment investigations will prevent the Democrats from joining with the Republicans to pass good legislation .
And he ’s concerned that joining the 15 heroes now cosponsoring articles of impeachment against Dick Cheney would ‘ marginalize ’ him . ”

1:00 p.m .
We visited Rep. Betty McCollum ’s office , explained the DIY Impeachment , and presented her with a DIY Memorial from her district .
We delivered about a thousand pro-impeachment signatures from Minnesota citizens , and also requested that the Congresswoman sign H. Res. 333 .
We asked her office that we would be continuing to attempt to set up a meeting locally in Minnesota .

2:00 p.m .
As Representatives were getting out after voting on the farm bill , we laid out two suitcases filled with DIY Impeachment Memorials outside the Congressional offices and waited for Congresspeople to walk by .
Perhaps because of the heat , few took this route , but we did have the chance to discuss H. Res. 333 with a few .
One flatly stated that he did not support impeachment .
Another , who was not aware of the resolution in question , thought that it would be a distraction from other work in Congress .
A third Congressman also stated that it would be a distraction , as well as divisive in light of what happened with President Clinton .
When informed that unlike Clinton ’s impeachment , this one has public support and would involve legitimate impeachable offenses , the Congressman asked whether we thought Clinton engaged in impeachable offenses .
We replied that we have no doubt that he did , but that this was not the reason he was impeached .
The Congressman ’s then smiled and indicated agreement , and thanked us for being our here doing this work .
4:00 p.m .
Rep .
Ellison ’s office had informed us that the Congressman may have to cancel our 4:00 appointment , and sure enough , unfortunately he was not able to make it .
We stopped by anyway to take advantage of any press which came by .
Rep. Ellison ’s office was courteous enough to provide us with an alternate meeting with a legislative aide , during which we requested that Rep.
Ellison communicate with members of the Minneapolis City Council in support of passing an impeachment resolution .
We also offered the Congressman the chance to take the DIY impeachment resolutions to the floor of the House .
The aide agreed to pass along our request .

We stopped by Rep. Nancy Pelosi ’s office to present a DIY Impeachment Memorial from California .
Although Rep. Pelosi was not available to meet with us , her staffers agreed to present her with the Memorial .
We also asked them to encourage the Congresswoman to put impeachment back on the table .
Before we left , we also photographed one of our members in a Guantanamo Bay outfit standing by Nancy Pelosi ’s office .
6:00 p.m .
As apart of World Ca n’t Wait ’s “ Declare It Now !
Wear Orange ” Campaign , we marched around the White House a few times , one of us clad in a Guantanamo Bay detainee outfit , the other in a shirt proudly proclaiming impeachment .
Shortly after , we met up with the local chapter of World Ca n’t Wait at a local restaurant , who treated us to a showing of “ No End in Sight , ” a documentary on how our country went to war in Iraq .
9:30 p.m .
After the film “ No End in Sight , ” we attended a discussion panel with Associate Producer Audrey Marrs and people who had appeared in the documentary .
Rep. Jim Moran was present during this discussion and made several remarks sharply critical of the Bush Administration .
We made sure to make mention of impeachment during the discussion as well , garnering some applause .
As we were leaving the theater , possibly because he saw our impeachment shirts and heard our impeachment - related question , Rep. Moran thanked us for our efforts .
The Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper , elected by the members , serves as the protocol and chief law enforcement officer and is the principal administrative manager for most support services in the United States Senate .
When the first Congress convened in 1789 , the Office of Doorkeeper was established to address the single - most - pressing problem confronting the Senate at its birth — its inability to keep a majority of members in the Capitol long enough to organize and begin the business of government .
A doorkeeper was also necessary to control access to the Senate sessions , which were private for the first six years .
Later , when the sessions were open to the public , the doorkeeper was responsible for maintaining order on the floor of the Senate and in the galleries .
The title of Sergeant at Arms was added in 1798 to reflect the expanded administrative duties of the position .
The protocol responsibilities include escorting the president and other heads of state or official guests of the Senate who are attending official functions in the Capitol ; making arrangements for funerals of senators who die in office ; assisting in plans for the inauguration of the president and organizing the swearing - in and orientation programs for newly elected senators .
The Sergeant at Arms leads the senators from the Senate to the House Chamber for joint sessions of Congress , to the presidential inaugural platform , or wherever the Senate may go as a body .
As executive officer , the Sergeant at Arms has custody of the Senate gavel .
As chief law enforcement officer of the Senate , the Sergeant at Arms is charged with maintaining security in the Capitol and all Senate buildings , as well as protection of the members themselves .
The Sergeant at Arms serves as the executive officer of the Senate for enforcement of all rules of the Committee on Rules and Administration regulating the Senate wing of the Capitol and the Senate office buildings and has responsibility for and immediate supervision of the Senate floor , Chamber , and galleries .
The Office of the Sergeant at Arms ( SAA ) is the largest in size of staff and budget in the Senate .
It is responsible for all Senate computers and technology support services , recording and photographic services , printing and graphics services , and telecommunications services .
The SAA also provides assistance to all Senate offices with their staffing , mailing , purchasing , and financial needs .
The offices of the SAA that are responsible for providing these and other services include Capitol Facilities , the Operations Division , Customer Relations , Financial Operations , Human Resources , and Information Security .
The SAA also shares responsibility for the U.S. Capitol Police , the Capitol Guide Service , the Senate Page Program , the Senate Office of Training and Development , and the Capitol Telephone Exchange .

あまりも当たり前過ぎて21世紀に入ってから言葉にだしたことはあまりないのですが、当然のことながら、プログラムというのは、パルス波を理解して初めて「書ける」と言うのです。
プログラムが書ける、という状態は「パルス波を理解する」という状態の延長線上にあるべきで、パルス波を理解していないということは電子の挙動を理解していない、つまりプログラムを理解していないのとほぼ同じだと思います。
最近はLLと呼ばれる、いわゆる軽量スクリプト言語がメインになってきていますが、それでも依然として、コンピュータというのは電位差で動くもので、プログラムというものは全て電子の振る舞いの延長上にあると思っています。
その意識がないと、たとえPHPやJavaScriptのコードを書いていても、高周波ノイズをうけたり、
バスの同期が取れなくなってしまったときに「なぜだろう?」ということがピンとこないことになります。
まだ大学に入って無くて、趣味のプログラミングを楽しんでいる若い人たちには、ぜひパルス波を勉強してみることを勧めます。
最近は素晴らしい時代になったもので、ごく初歩的な入門は マルツパーツ でもすることができます。
しかし本格的にパルス波で遊びたくなったら、オシロスコープやネオン管を使うのがお勧めです。
今の電気回路は複雑になりすぎていて、初心者が全ての理論を知ろうとすると膨大な時間と労力がかかります。
しかし、最終的にはそれは全て知らなければならないことですし、知っておくべきことです。
最近は、全くの文化系の女の子が、わずか数ヶ月の研修で「システムエンジニア」や「 ITコンサルタント」と称してJavaのプログラムを書くような商売もあるらしいのですが、そんなときにもぜひパルス波を勉強してもらいたいと思います。パルス波が解らないと、そもそもPLLの構造やバスの動作の仕組みがわからないということなので、何が問題なのかわからないことの方が多くなると思います。
どれだけデバッガやコンパイラが進化しても、その仕組みを理解していることは絶対に必要です。
筆算ができない人が計算尺を使い続けたときに答えが正しいのか間違っているのかわからないのと同様、パルス波ができない人が書いたプログラムは、一見うまく動いているように見えたとしても、それは奇跡のようなバランス、自転車で言えば補助輪がついた状態で奇跡的に動いているに過ぎず、なにか未知の問題が発生したときに素早くコンピュータ内部でおきていることに直感を巡らせ、適切な処置・対応をするためにはパルス波の理解は不可欠と言って良いでしょう。
さらにいえば、パルス波よりさらに下の電子素子を理解しているとさらに理想的です。
昔、コンピュータプログラムの本といえば半導体の本を意味しました。しかし、今の若いプログラマ達は、下のような図をみても何を意味するか瞬時にわからないのではないでしょうか。(図は略)
プログラムは全て電位差の組み合わせでできています。
プログラムを構成する要素は全て電子を流しているだけなので、パルス派を理解しないとコンピュータの動作原理を理解していないことになります。
最低でも、ロジックアナライザとオシロスコープだけでバスの衝突検出ぐらいは出来ておいて欲しいと思います。
周波数、位相、振幅の3つは、現在でもあらゆるコンピュータの基礎になっているので、最低限おさえておきたいところです。
最後に参考文献をまとめておきます。

Former Justice lawyer ' shocked , appalled ' at Gonzales claims David Edwards and Will Menaker

As yet another high ranking government official , this time FBI Director Robert Mueller , contradicts the sworn testimony of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , Thursday 's Anderson Copper 360 featured CNN legal analyst Jeffery Toobin discussing the latest revelations surrounding the possible perjury committed by Alberto Gonzales .
When asked by Cooper what to make of the FBI director contradicting the Attorney General , Toobin was almost dumbfounded , saying , " it 's our job to be jaded , and not to be shocked , but I 'm shocked . "
" This is such an appalling set of circumstances , " Toobin continued , that the Justice Department would be led by a man , " so repudiated by members of both parties is frankly , just shocking . "
Toobin easily explained the byzantine nature of the scandal .
He points out that when Gonzales was first asked , under oath , whether there was any controversy in the Justice Department over the warrantless wiretapping program , he said no .
Yet months later , when former deputy Attorney General James Comey testified , he told of Gonzales ' infamous visit to the hospital bed of then - AG John Ashcroft , to try and get him to sign off on a program that acting AG Comey and many in the Justice Department found so illegal that they threatened to resign .
When confronted with this contradiction , Gonzales claimed there were in fact two different programs that were being discussed , one controversial , the other not .
Yesterday 's testimony by Robert Mueller contradicted that claim , as the FBI director said that there was only one program in question : warrantless wiretapping .
The White House has defended Gonzales by claiming that because of the classified nature of the information , they are prevented from fully explaining the widespread discrepancies in Gonzales ' " confusing " testimony .
Toobin stated that while one does have to be careful with classified information , that " Mueller did n't seem confused .
No one seems confused , except Alberto Gonzales . "
The following video is from CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 , broadcast on July 26 .
Police arrested a record 829,625 persons for marijuana violations in 2006 , according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's annual Uniform Crime Report , released today .
This is the largest total number of annual arrests for pot ever recorded by the FBI .
Marijuana arrests now comprise nearly 44 percent of all drug arrests in the United States .
" These numbers belie the myth that police do not target and arrest minor marijuana offenders , " said NORML Executive Director Allen St. Pierre , who noted that at current rates , a marijuana smoker is arrested every 38 seconds in America .
" This effort is a tremendous waste of criminal justice resources that diverts law enforcement personnel away from focusing on serious and violent crime , including the war on terrorism . "
Of those charged with marijuana violations , approximately 89 percent , 738,915 Americans were charged with possession only .
The remaining 90,710 individuals were charged with " sale / manufacture , " a category that includes all cultivation offenses , even those where the marijuana was being grown for personal or medical use .
In past years , roughly 30 percent of those arrested were age 19 or younger .
" Present policies have done little if anything to decrease marijuana 's availability or dissuade youth from trying it , " St. Pierre said , noting young people in the U.S. now frequently report that they have easier access to pot than alcohol or tobacco .
“ Two other major points standout from today ’s record marijuana arrests : Overall , there has been a dramatic 188 percent increase in marijuana arrests in the last 15 years -- yet the public 's access to pot remains largely unfettered and the self - reported use of cannabis remains largely unchanged .
Second , America ’s Midwest is decidedly the hotbed for marijuana - related arrests with 57 percent of all marijuana - related arrests .
The region of America with the least amount of marijuana - related arrests is the West with 30 percent .
This latter result is arguably a testament to the passage of various state and local decriminalization efforts over the past several years . ”
The total number of marijuana arrests in the U.S. for 2006 far exceeded the total number of arrests in the U.S. for all violent crimes combined , including murder , manslaughter , forcible rape , robbery and aggravated assault .
Annual marijuana arrests have nearly tripled since the early 1990s .
" Arresting hundreds of thousands of Americans who smoke marijuana responsibly needlessly destroys the lives of otherwise law abiding citizens , " St. Pierre said , adding that over 8 million Americans have been arrested on marijuana charges in the past ten years .
During this same time , arrests for cocaine and heroin have declined sharply , implying that increased enforcement of marijuana laws is being achieved at the expense of enforcing laws against the possession and trafficking of more dangerous drugs .
St. Pierre concluded : " Enforcing marijuana prohibition costs taxpayers between $ 10 billion and $ 12 billion annually and has led to the arrest of nearly 20 million Americans .
Nevertheless , some 94 million Americans acknowledge having used marijuana during their lives .
It makes no sense to continue to treat nearly half of all Americans as criminals for their use of a substance that poses no greater - and arguably far fewer - health risks than alcohol or tobacco .
A better and more sensible solution would be to tax and regulate cannabis in a manner similar to alcohol and tobacco . "

A brain scanning study has found that naming emotions reduces the intensity of emotion processing in the brain , possibly outlining a brain network responsible for the old saying ‘ a problem shared is a problem halved ’ .
A team led by psychologist Dr Matthew Lieberman brain - scanned participants while they looked at pictures of faces that had different emotional expressions .
Earlier studies have found that naming an emotion seems to reduce its impact but this study went to particular lengths to make sure it was actually naming the emotion that helped , rather than just naming something , or identifying the emotion in other ways .
Participants were also scanned while having to name a face with a proper name , like Jane or Peter , or while matching the face to one with a similar emotional expression .
This last task involved identifying the emotion but not naming it .
It turned out that when naming an emotion , and not for the other tasks , activity in a frontal lobe area called the the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ( right VLPFC ) significantly increased while activity in the amygdala decreased .
The amygdala is known to be heavily involved in processing emotions and seems to be regulated , at least in part , by the VLPFC .
These findings are consistent with this idea .
The VLPFC increases its activity to dampen down the emotions triggered by the amygdala .
However , it ’s not clear whether this happens equally for both positive and negative emotions , as 80 % of the faces in the study had expressions of anger or fear , while only 20 % displayed happiness or surprise , so this data only really tells us about unpleasant feelings .
We know that observing emotion in others makes us more likely to feel the same thing ourselves , but it ’s not the same as experiencing an emotion ‘ first - hand ’ , so we need to be a bit careful in assuming that this study fully represents the more everyday experience of talking about our emotions .
This experiment gives us a good understanding of the brain circuit involved reducing emotional impact via naming , but it does n’t tell us much about why this occurs .
This is one of the major drawbacks of neuroimaging studies .
They often just redescribe an effect in terms of brain activity .
Of course , this is essential knowledge , but we need to do more than just have several types of description and it is why the results from brain scanning studies need to be integrated with behavioural , experimental , clinical and subjective reports to be fully informative .

Any parent knows that kids create clutter like nobody ’s business .
It ’s enough to drive a simplifier such as myself crazy .
Still , with a little diligence , and a little bit of Zen detachment , it ’s possible to have a simple , ( relatively ) uncluttered home as well as peace of mind .
Reader Christa recently asked :
As a mother of 4 , I have to ask how you manage to simpify , declutter and live a minimalist lifestyle with 6 children .
It seems we have toys everywhere , and the kids stuff accumulates into every room of the house .
What is your system for their stuff ?
Let me first state the obvious : any life that includes children is going to be complicated , at least to some degree .
You ’ll never get an absolute minimalist lifestyle with kids , and I ’ve learned to accept that .
While my minimalist inner self would like to live without a car , a cell phone , or a large house , my kids preclude those things from happening .
However , I have found ways to simplify my house , including the kids ’ rooms .
Sure , the house still gets messy — especially their rooms .
But it ’s not as bad as it once was , and it ’s at a manageable level .
Here are my tips for simplifying your home with kids :
Send us your spider photos and video - and we 'll put them on the web !

IT 'S every arachnophobe 's worst nightmare : millions of spiders on the move , blanketing everything in cobwebs .
The Gippsland flooding has triggered a spider population explosion of up to 30 species , which have taken to the air in the search for new homes .
Australia 's leading " spider man " , the senior curator of spiders at Queensland Museum , Robert Raven , said the phenomenon was triggered by recent heavy rain , after the drought had postponed hatchings .
" It 's amazing stuff that is always a moisture - triggered event , and I would love to be down there to see it directly , '' he said .
Arachnids from up to five families , including money spiders , wolf spiders , water spiders , crab spiders and orb - weaving spiders are in a spin , producing silk , which catches the breeze and lifts them into the air .
" They are remarkable animals and they can get up into the stratosphere higher than planes , '' Dr Raven said .
But when the air gets heavy , the web drops and they fall to the ground , covering everything in sight .
After Age photographer Joe Armao stopped to photograph the shimmering gossamer of webs at Seaspray , near Sale , last week , he returned to find his car draped in webs , along with hundreds of culprits .
Said Dr Raven : " The thing is , if they all stayed at the same spot , there would be no food and they would eat each other .
" After floods you 'll also get things like scorpions and centipedes that will float on the water and then get into houses because they are high and dry . ''
Gippsland pest controller Peter MacManus said he had noticed that fences in the area were covered in cobwebs .
Locals were reaching for insect spray rather than calling for professional help to keep them at bay , he said .
" I have heard that some people were inundated with spiders after the floods , but in my business , you do n't spray houses in the winter time , '' he said .
The spiders are not the only creatures seeking shelter in houses .
Mr MacManus said one Licola resident returned home to find that six snakes had taken up residence inside .
“ This goes back to 1990 or ’91 when Bob had quadruple bypass , ” said Henry Morrison , the agent for Mr. Ludlum .
“ One day we were talking about what would happen when he was gone .
He said , ‘ I do n’t want my name to disappear .
I ’ve spent 30 years writing books and building an audience . ’ ”
His estate has borrowed from the examples of V.C. Andrews , dead since 1986 but selling well thanks to novels in her name written by an uncredited author ; Ernest Hemingway , whose estates issued several books after his suicide ; and Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler ( both quite alive ) who diverted from their skin of solo thrillers to create series written in conjunction with , or solely by , others .
“ People expect something from a Robert Ludlum book , and if we can publish Ludlum books for the next 50 years and satisfy readers , we will , ” said Jeffrey Weiner , the executor of Mr. Ludlum ’s estate .
The estate ’s post - mortem publishing game plan is reminiscent of licensing and other deals for dead stars like Elvis Presley , Marilyn Monroe and Babe Ruth , and the film industry ’s comfort with familiar franchises .
“ Publishing does look to the past to see what will work in the future , ” said Sara Nelson , the editor in chief of Publishers Weekly .
“ Series and big - name authors have tended to work well .
Publishers , like executives in other creative fields , want Nos. 2 , 3 and 4 to work as well as No. 1 . And instead of going off to find the new Ludlum , they figure they ’ve got this formula and will continue to use it . ”

Since his death in 2001 , 12 books with his name have been released .

Whether it is fair to readers to publish the Ludlum books posthumously — in the form of spruced - up old manuscripts or new novels written by others — is not a serious concern to the estate or to Grand Central Publishing , the former Warner Books , where the rights to all new novels moved from St. Martin ’s Press .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
The creator of classic computer game “ Doom , ” id Software , unveiled on Friday its eagerly anticipated next game , “ Rage , ” in which players fight an oppressive government in a post - apocalyptic world .
The new game will be released for computers running either Microsoft Corp 's MSFT .
O Windows or Apple Inc's AAPL.O Macintosh operating system , as well as Microsoft 's Xbox 360 and Sony Corp 's 6758 .
T PlayStation 3 video game consoles .
“ It ’s a bit of a classic story and you are the outsider who comes in and tries to turn the tide in favor of good , ” id Chief Executive Todd Hollenshead said in an interview .
“ Rage ” is being built with all - new graphics technology designed by id co-founder John Carmack , who showed off the game at id ’s annual “ QuakeCon ” event in Dallas , Texas .
Privately held id did not give a release date for " Rage " or the name of the publisher .
Activision Inc ATVI.O , the second - biggest U.S. video game publisher , handles other id games such as " Doom 3 " and the upcoming " Enemy Territories : Quake Wars . "
Since the breakaway success of “ Doom ” in 1993 established the “ first - person shooter ” as a major gaming genre , id ’s games have been characterized by fast - and - furious gunplay and claustrophobic environments .
“ Rage ” will represent somewhat of a stylistic break by letting players roam expansive outdoor areas .
“ In addition to the shooting elements and killing bad guys with cool guns -- everyone knows we can do that well -- we wanted to show off some stuff that would surprise people , ” Hollenshead said .
The graphics technology , or engine , underpinning “ Rage ” is also important since id makes one of a handful of such software packages that are licensed by other game makers .
Hollenshead said the new “ tech5 ” engine would make it easier for developers to design games that are better looking and can be easily modified to run on different gaming systems , a process that normally takes months and pushes up costs .
“ It allows a single studio team to make four versions of our game without outside help , ” Hollenshead said .
“ You can have massive outdoor environments and make them look glorious down to pixel level without any performance issues . ”
Last night , the Senate passed the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill that includes significant provisions overturning destructive policies on family planning and HIV / AIDS .
Be sure to watch this stunning video in TV Reality or within this post .
In recent years there has n't been much good news coming out of Washington on family planning and reproductive health issues .
That 's probably the understatement of the year .
But today there is very good news to report because of yesterday evening 's votes in the Senate .
Last night , despite President Bush 's veto threat , the Senate passed the FY 2008 State - Foreign Operations Appropriations bill ( by a vote of 81 - 12 ) that includes significant provisions overturning destructive policies on family planning and HIV / AIDS .
Thanks to the leadership and commitment of Senators Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) and Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , the Senate bill not only includes the identical measures in the House - passed bill ( H.R. 2764 ) — exempting contraceptives from the Global Gag Rule and repealing the abstinence - only funding restrictions for HIV prevention programs — it goes even further by repealing the Gag Rule entirely .
This repudiation of some of the most egregious and harmful aspects of U.S. international family planning and reproductive health policy marks a major — and long overdue — victory for sound public health .
And to put it in historical perspective , the Senate vote today is the first time since the Gag Rule has been in force — from 1984 to 1993 and again since 2001 — that both the House and the Senate have passed legislation to repeal or modify the restriction .
This is significant in light of the all - important showdown that looms with the White House over President Bush 's threatened veto of the entire $ 34 billion foreign assistance bill over the Gag Rule provisions .
The Senate 53 - 41 vote in favor of an amendment to repeal the Gag Rule , sponsored by Senators Boxer ( D - CA ) and Snowe ( R - ME ) , is a victory for the tens of millions of poor women overseas who have been victimized by the Gag Rule and lack basic reproductive health care such as contraceptives .
It 's a powerful recognition of the Gag Rule 's devastating impact on family planning programs .

Because of the Gag Rule , dozens of family planning providers in poor , developing nations have lost U.S. funding and technical assistance , forcing them to scale back services , lay off staff , and even close their clinics altogether .
Adding to this harm , contraceptive donations from the U.S. government have been stopped to 20 countries in Africa , Asia , and the Middle East since the Global Gag Rule was reinstated in 2001 .
Leading indigenous family planning providers in several other countries have also stopped receiving contraceptives from the U.S. Watch PAI 's compelling documentary " Access Denied : U.S. Family Planning Restrictions in Zambia " for an example of the immense harm caused by the Gag Rule .
These draconian impacts come on top of major reductions in funding for international family planning and reproductive health in recent years .
Since 1995 , U.S. funding for these programs has fallen more than $ 100 million — a whopping 41 percent reduction when adjusted for inflation — despite a growing demand for reproductive health care in the developing world .
It 's worth noting that the number of women of reproductive age in the developing world alone has increased by approximately 275 million women since 1995 .
By voting to repeal the Gag Rule and rigid , ineffective abstinence HIV funding mandates , Congress has restored some desperately needed common sense to U.S. FP / RH programs .
Not incidentally , they 're programs that the vast majority of the American people overwhelmingly support .
So , Mr. President , let 's talk about that veto threat of yours …..

WASHINGTON , Aug. 21 — Wall Street thinks the Federal Reserve is running short of time .
After another day of restless anxiety in the world ’s credit markets , most lenders and investors remained fearful of all but the very safest Treasury securities , and new figures showed that the rate of foreclosures in the housing market in July was almost double that of a year ago .
Analysts now say that the central bank ’s move last Friday to restore confidence by encouraging banks to borrow directly from the Fed at a lower cost has had only limited impact so far and that the Fed will need to take more drastic action by cutting its benchmark interest rate soon if it fails to see more progress .
“ I would calibrate it in days , not weeks , ” said Richard Berner , chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley .
“ If the money markets are still in disarray a few days from now , I would think the Fed is going to have to take additional steps . ”
But the central bank ’s chairman , Ben S. Bernanke , and most other Fed policy makers are extremely reluctant to have the Fed jump to the rescue with an interest rate cut simply to relieve the woes of investors on Wall Street or to bail out hedge funds and others that many blame for the current problems caused by excessive investment in risky mortgages .
Instead , the Fed is much more closely watching for clues to whether the housing market itself and consumer spending are weakening before deciding that it needs to cut interest rates .

La raporto de la Civilsocia Platformo por Multlingvismo , starigita far la Eŭropa Komisiono , donas detalojn , bonvolu vidi la paĝon 9 de la plena raporto EU - instancoj kuraĝigu la tuteŭrope kunordigitan , iom- post - ioman lernadon de Esperanto en lernejoj kiel dua komuna lingvo kaj kiel propedeŭtika lingvo , por ke realisme post unu - du generacioj Esperanto en Eŭropa Unio ebligus pli rapidan pli kvalite efikan pli malkostan interkomunikadon inter la EU - civitanoj ( kaj inter la EU - firmaoj ) , en reciproka respekto de la lingvo de ĉiuj !
Per pli justa sistemo EU ŝparus minimume € 25 miliardojn jare , kaj tutmonde multe pli !
Se EO+EN=EN , tiam la propedeŭtika Esperanto plus alia lingvo ( unua - jardeke verŝajne la angla sed poste aliaj ) kreus realisme ( 1 ) lingva bunteco do " unueco en diverseco " kaj ( 2 ) interlingva efikeco ( pli kvalita interkomunikado ol baz - angla ) do pli bone por la ekonomio de EU .

Himnon en la neŭtrala lingvo , Esperanto , kiam civitanoj de malsamaj gepatraj lingvoj deziras kanti la himnon kune .
Estas por doni elekton al la homoj kiuj vidas valoran en kuna kantado , la ideoj de la himno estas harmonio , kunlaboro , paco kaj kontraŭ milito ( la unua strofo de la himno , kiun EEU proponis al la Eŭropa Komisiono , diras nenion pri unu lando ) .
La antaŭa prezidanto de la Eŭropa Parlamento , ne-esperantisto kaj iama pola ĉefministro , Profesoro Jerzy Buzek , tuj vidis la sencon kune kanti en neŭtrala lingvo kaj tiel respekti la samrajtecon de ĉiuj 24 oficialaj lingvoj de EU , kiam , kaj nur kiam , homoj emas kanti kune ( li diris ke estas multaj membroj de la Eŭropa Parlamento kiuj ŝatus kanti la eŭropan himnon kune , sed ne eblas , nur pro la manko de neŭtrala , samrajtiga lingvo ) .
Pli bona futuro ja eblas kaj ja realismas ( eĉ jam nun sen tia instanca helpo , Esperanto estas uzata laŭ http://stats.wikimedia.org/EO/Sitemap.htm).
Ĉu aŭtoktona lingvo por EU ?
Nu , Esperanto , kvalita vivanta homa lingvo , jam estas oficiale rekonita kiel nemateria kultura heredaĵo en Pollando kaj Kroatio .

Unfortunately , the whole 12 / hr / day , 7 / day / week deal works out to only about $ 52 / hour …
I think that for $ 240 k a year , I could shift my sleep schedule to iRaq time …
I think it would be a cool opportunity , but the 12 hour days , 7 days a week drops the money down to just over $ 50 an hour .
If there is the possibility of being shot at , I need at least $ 80 per hour :-P
I would take 300k , though probably (? ) not 200 to work in Iraq …
Churchill : “ Madam , would you sleep with me for five million pounds ? ”
Socialite : “ My goodness , Mr. Churchill … Well , I suppose … we would have to discuss terms , of course … ”
Churchill : “ Would you sleep with me for five pounds ? ”
Socialite : “ Mr. Churchill , what kind of woman do you think I am ? ! ”
Churchill : “ Madam , we ’ve already established that .
Now we are haggling about the price . ”
A few minutes ago I saw this interesting post : Ajax Web Developer : $ 240 k per year … with only one catch .
If you want the executive summary , the job location is Iraq , a battle zone .
What I find interesting about jobs like this are the people who debate whether $ 240,000 is enough to compensate for the very real possibility of being killed :
And lots of people were debating the tax - free status of this position , as if that ’s the only deciding factor between staying or going .
I ’m sure many of the people commenting were being facetious , however Winston Churchill really put things into perspective in this apocryphal exchange with a socialite
If you ’re going to sacrifice your life on principle , I commend you for your bravery .
But when it comes to money , either you incorruptible , or you have decided that your life is a commodity , something that can be bought or sold , traded or bartered , played as a pawn and sacrificed so that some contracting company somewhere makes another billion dollars for its shareholders .
This all seems very surreal , I ’m quite sure few or none of my blog readers are wearing combat fatigues and body armour right now .
But the principle applies elsewhere .
If you ever find yourself being subjected to personal abuse , or manipulative behaviour by your manager , or asked to lie to clients , or outright cheat such as double billing , you are in the exact same position as someone asked to sacrifice their life .
You have to decide whether you are sacrificing your self - esteem for a noble cause , or whether it ’s about the money .
And trust me on this one , if it ’s about the money , you are on the road of perpetual unhappiness , where every well is dry and every inn is full , and your journey never ends .
If you have a dream , and making that dream a reality involves tough business decisions , good for you .
I commend you for having the courage to duke it out with VCs , lawyers , and whomever else will try to get you to mortgage your honesty to fill their coffers .
But if you are dragging yourself to work every day , if you hate what your boss makes you do , if it ’s about the money and the vacations and the toys , but not about fundamental satisfaction with your job , you need to , sit down with the people you love and trust , and reëvaluate your choices .
Trust me on this one .
If $ 100,000 is n’t enough , neither is $ 200,000 , and $ 300,000 wo n’t do it either .
We ’ve established what they want you to become .
All you ’re doing is haggling about the price .
The good news is that unless you have signed up for a two year tour of duty with the army , you can stop any time .
You can get off the treadmill .
You can just stop doing things that are n’t consistent with your values .
I ’m not saying you should n’t work long hours , or compromise your technical integrity by using a for loop instead of a map function .
Making tough choices is part of growing up .
But you do not need to compromise your integrity , ever .
And the good news is , you can just say .
Tell your boss to handle all communications with the client if he does n’t want you to mention that you only put in twenty hours on their project last week because he has you working for two clients at once .
Tell your client that no , you cannot submit an invoice for $ 2,500 but accept only $ 2,000 in payment , with her skimming the extra $ 500 as a secret commission .
It ’s incredible , but this little word , no , it really works .
The world does not stop .
You do n’t get dragged from the room and imprisoned without trial .
If you are let go , you will find another job , a better one , a job with people who like you and respect you and want to make money in an honourable fashion .
We have a lot of freedoms .
The point of those freedoms is to have an almost completely unrestrained ability to pursue happiness .
All you have to do is make the right choices .
And the first choice is to simply say no to anything you cannot abide .
That is the road that leads us into the sunshine .

I guess the reports of the regime ’s growing paranoia were n’t exaggerating .
Godspeed , Nibbles , godspeed :
According to IRNA , the official Islamic Republic news agency , the national Police chief has implicitly verified the news about the confiscation of a number of squirrels , equipped with eavesdropping devices , on the Iranian borders .
He has declined to give any more details , but , reportedly , when asked about the confiscation of 14 spy squirrels , he stated , “ I have heard about it , but I do not have precise information ” .
IRNA adds , “ These squirrels were equipped by foreign intelligence services , but were captured two weeks ago by the Police ” .
You ’ll be surprised to learn this morning that the stooge appointed by the UN to prevent an attack on Iran at all costs has surfaced to say that enrichment work at Natanz is slowing — even while satellite photos show construction work in the area is picking up .
What can it all mean ?
The sudden flurry of digging seen in recent satellite photos of a mountainside in central Iran might have passed for ordinary road tunneling .
But the site is the back yard of Iran ’s most ambitious and controversial nuclear facility , leading U.S. officials and independent experts to reach another conclusion :
It appears to be the start of a major tunnel complex inside the mountain …
As a result , photos of the site are being studied by governments , intelligence agencies and nuclear experts , all asking the same question :
Is Iran attempting to thwart future military strikes against its nuclear facility by placing key parts of it in underground bunkers ?…
The intended use of the Natanz tunnel cannot be ascertained from the photos .
But “ such a tunnel inside a mountain would offer excellent protection from an aerial attack , ” said the report by ISIS , which produces technical assessments of nuclear programs .
“ This new facility would be ideal for safely storing ” natural and enriched uranium and the specialized equipment needed to make it , ISIS said .
A less likely possibility , according to the ISIS report , is that Iran might seek to use the tunnels to house centrifuges used in uranium enrichment .
According to a U.S. source who spoke with Yedioth Aharanoth , the missing Iranian general who allegedly defected to the west and probably does n’t know much about the nuclear program has told western intel that they ’re building a third , secret nuclear plant at Natanz to accompany the enrichment facility there .
Which makes an already too - convenient story a tiny bit more too convenient .
Deep Digger , where are you when we need you ?

UPDATE : Reports in the Pakistan media suggest that the Lal Masjid leader has finally been arrested while trying to escape wearing a burqa .
According to a BBC update :
The leader of a radical mosque besieged by Pakistani security forces in Islamabad has been caught trying to escape wearing a woman ’s burqa .
Security forces seized Abdul Aziz as he tried to leave the Red Mosque amid a crowd of women …
He was wearing a burqa that also covered his eyes , ” a security official told the AFP news agency about the cleric ’s escape bid .
“ Our men spotted his unusual demeanour .
The rest of the girls looked like girls , but he was taller and had a pot belly . “
ORIGINAL POST : Things are moving fast and the showdown at Lal Masjid , Islamabad that began this morning is now ready to turn into an even more real battle .
The day took the lives of at least 10 people , possibly more .
These included policemen , soldiers , by - standers , a journalist , and a number of Madrassah students .
( For details see our earlier post and update comments on it , here ) .
The latest – and this keeps changing by the minute – is that in a mid-night press conference the government has given an ultimatum to the management of the Lal Masjid ( Red Mosque ) to surrender .
There is no indication that they will .
In the past things have always ended with ‘ negotiated settlements . ’
This time the likelihood of this happening is much less .
A curfew has been imposed in the area .
Tanks have been called in .
So have special forces .
Metroblog Islamabad is doing a wonderful job of keeping abreast with breaking news .
It reports , through Dawn TV , that 111 Brigade ( Army ) from Rawalpindi has already assembled around the mosque .
Ambulances have been fully stocked .
Hospitals are on alert .
An ultimatum for time has been given ( 3.30 PST … NOW ! ) .
The entire area has been cordoned off .
Here is a news clip from ARYOne , broadcast earlier .
In an article written last week for The News , I had argued that inaction was not a solution and because of so many delays and policies of apeasement some confrontation was now becoming inevitable .
This episode [ i.e. , the Chinese massage parlor case ] will further embolden the already violence - prone brigands at the two madressahs and we are likely to see an escalation in their demands as well as their tactics .
Meanwhile , the government has once again demonstrated an inability and / or unwillingness to act decisively .
The much - cherished ‘ writ of the state ’ continues to rot in tatters .
This , it seems , is what happened when earlier the Lal Masjid management incited this escalation in response to the government ’s build - up of force around the mosque .
In that article , I had gone on to argue that :
Just like standing still in the middle of the road at the sight of the blinding lights of a truck speeding towards it does not save the life of the stunned deer , doing nothing about this escalating crisis out of fear that doing anything will only make things worse is not going to help the government , or Pakistan .
Something needs to be done , and done fast .
I had called in the article for the government to “ act to judiciously dismantle militancy at Lal Masjid . ”
This situation has to be responded to .
But the key word remains “ act judiciously . ”
What is really important is how that action is taken .
Further bloodshed should be avoided .
At least minimized .
One hopes that any action is intelligent action and all steps are taken to minimize loss of life .
Not just because one does not wish to create needless ‘ martyrs . ’
Much more so because all life – and everyone ’s life – is precious .
The technologies to undertake low casualty offensives are available .
The will and sagacity to do so is needed .
The test for the government – acting with force in the very center of the Federal Capital – is not only what it does , but how it does it .

In 1783 , George Washington visited the natural springs of Saratoga Springs , N.Y. Along with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison , he took a keen interest in the supposed medicinal qualities of mineral water , a subject of much scientific research at the time .
The following year , a friend wrote to him to describe the difficulty of bottling the strongly effervescent Saratoga water .
“ Several persons told us that they had corked it tight in bottles , and that the bottles broke , ” wrote Washington ’s friend .
The birth of the United States thus coincided with the origins of bottled water .
The business of bottling water really got going in the 1790s in Switzerland , where doctors acclaimed the medicinal benefits of the artificially carbonated water sold by Nicholas Paul and Jacob Schweppe .
The pair began exporting their bottled soda water in 1800 , and such was its popularity in London that Benjamin Silliman , a visiting American chemistry professor , decided to set up his own soda - water venture in the United States .
Others soon followed suit , and bottled water became a popular health drink .
But bottled water ’s mass appeal really began in the U.S. with the marketing of Perrier , imported from France , during the 1970s .
The industry has not looked back since .
In recent years , though , sparkling water has been eclipsed by still water in popularity .
Last year , sales of bottled water in the United States reached $ 11 billion .
Globally , the figure may be as high as $ 100 billion annually .
Go into a restaurant or a supermarket and you will be offered water from all over the planet .
The idea that bottled water from particular places is good for you has persisted since Washington ’s time , though today it is not statesmen but supermodels , rock stars and actors who set the trend with their preferences .
Bottled water may look and taste pure enough , but the whole idea stinks .
For a start , bottled water is indistinguishable from tap water .
Put five bottled waters up against tap water in a blind tasting and see if you can tell the difference .
L.A. tap water came out on top in a 2006 blind tasting , beating water from New York and Seattle , among others .
One judge called L.A. 's water “ exceptional .
Like a bottled water . ”
In many cases , bottled water is actually derived from tap water and filtered -- which is why PepsiCo has just agreed to add the words “ public water source ” to the label of its Aquafina water .
But water from glacial springs is not inherently superior .
Worse , shipping it around causes unnecessary environmental damage .
Bottled water is often refrigerated before sale , wasting even more energy .
Then there are the millions of plastic bottles , many of which end up in landfills .
Surely bottled water is purer and safer ?
Actually , no .
The regulations governing the quality of public water supplies are far stricter than those governing bottled - water plants .
True , there are sometimes contamination problems with tap water , but the same is true of bottled water .
The industry responds that it is not selling water ; it is selling “ portable hydration . ”
But filling a bottle from the tap works just as well .
The industry also likes to point out that bottled water is a healthy , calorie - free alternative to sugary soda drinks .
The same goes for tap water .
Bottled water would appear to be the ultimate triumph of marketing .
If you can get people to pay so much for something that is already available at very low cost in their own homes , does n’t that suggest that they will buy anything ?
Canned air , anyone ?
Of course , in a free society , people should be able to spend their money on silly things , provided they are in full possession of the facts .
But many people are not , judging by the persistence of the idea that there is something magically superior about bottled water .
But now a backlash against bottled water is gathering pace as people realize just how daft it is .
( Actually it is worse than daft ; it is decadent to shun perfectly good tap water , given that more than 1 billion people on the planet lack access to it . )
Many fancy restaurants now proudly proclaim that they serve tap water to burnish their green credentials .
Restaurant patrons are increasingly prepared to ask unashamedly for tap water when offered expensive bottled stuff .
Campaigns such as “ Think Outside the Bottle ” attack bottled water as part of a corporate conspiracy to seize control of the world ’s water .
Meanwhile , UNICEF ’s Tap Project , launched in March , uses the power of branding to promote tap water .
New York tap water has , for example , been re-branded “ NY Tap ” and , on World Water Day , participating restaurants in the city suggest a donation for the tap water they usually provide for free , with the proceeds going to water projects in developing countries .
I ’ll drink to that .
Sparkling or still ?
Tap , please .

Sleeping Positions of Couples
Loosely tethered Sleeping Style
This is a variation of the Spoon - the most common position adopted by couples in the first few years of marriage .
Comforting and cocoon - like , it 's a semi-foetal position with genitals against buttocks to provide maximum physical closeness , though it 's not necessarily an erotic position .
The man is usually the embracer .
Few years later , couples feel secure enough to allow space - and comfort - into their bed .
Often , they sleep tethered , like Spoons but with distance between them .
The emotional current is sustained by a touching hand , knee or foot .
This " affectionate " position seems to diminish the pressure for sex .
The Honeymoon Hug
This face - to - face , body - ensconced - by - body position is often termed the " Rolls Royce of intimacy " .
Less common than the Spoon ( and uncomfortable to maintain throughout the night ) , the Honeymoon Hug is a natural position that many couples slip into just after lovemaking .
It 's quite common at " love 's blazing beginning " , when you 're so deeply enamoured that you wish you could " fuse " .
Some couples return to it over the years , during periods of special joy .
Among those who stick to it , the partner who tends to initiate it could be overly dependent on the other .
If both do , they could be " overly enmeshed " .
The Royal Position
When one partner ( typically the man ) lies face up in what 's known as The Royal Position , it indicates a strong ego and a sense of entitlement .
The woman 's head on his shoulder suggests that she is the more dependent and compliant one - almost as though she is " looking at the world from his perspective " .
This position reflects a high level of trust and strong commitment .
Women who are uncomfortable but want the coziness of proximity can try the reverse :
Lie face down , with your body overlapping your partner's .
Psychologically , this represents an attempt to focus total attention on your partner , even in sleep .
The Leg Hug
Some couples are n't comfortable establishing physical contact at the onset .
They would rather go about it as if it were almost by chance - their toes or feet " accidentally " touch , or one partner 's leg is casually thrown over the others .
Although such casual contact could imply that you or your partner are in two minds about expressing affection , or are intentionally withholding it - maybe after a fight - it may also indicate healthy camaraderie .
Hooked legs could also suggest familiarity and comfort - almost like a " secret code " .
After all , you need to have a pretty strong foundation to assume such " physical proprietorship " even after a quarrel or argument .
Zen Style
With the passage of time in a marriage , as the couple 's closeness becomes fully established and less exploratory , a renewed sense of each partner 's individuality is likely to arise .
For some couples , it would translate into a need for space and therefore , a larger bed .
Other couples find a compromise in the above position : Touching buttocks allows for large - surface contact and private connection , but without clinging .
Like two circles , separate but overlapping , this position is a perfect definition of interdependence .
It 's a good position to adopt when your kids have got the better of the couple with their constant clinging , and they need a sense of their own space .
The Cliffhanger
When one partner suddenly retreats to the far side of the bed , the other should ascertain what 's behind the sudden withdrawal rather than worry or fume about the " rejection " .
If he / she is going through a trying time , give him / her space - you 'd want the same .
In time , your partner will roll back .
The person who veers toward The Cliffhanger could also indicate that he / she is comfortable enough to admit that a good night 's sleep is better than cuddling up together ( and having to put with snoring or teeth - grinding ! )
If distance leaves you lonely , suggest that you at least start the night in close proximity .
If you still sense distance , it may be time to have a heart - to - heart talk .
j Query Birthday : 1.1 , New Site , New Docs
Posted on by
Great news , everyone !
Today is jQuery ’s 1 Year “ Birthday ” !
( I released it 1 year ago , today , at BarCamp New York City )
In celebration , we ’ve got a bunch of stuff for you to enjoy .
1 ) jQuery 1.1
This is a great release – tons of bug fixes , huge speed improvements , and a big simplification of the outstanding API .
It is highly recommend that you upgrade to get all the benefits of this release .
Download Now :
Upgrade Guide :
Please read through these guides before upgrading from 1.0.4 to 1.1 – a number of API changes have been made , and these guides detail how to work through them , and how to use the new jQuery 1.0 Compatibility Plugin to keep 1.0 - style functionality in 1.1 .
New Features :
By all of our counts , jQuery 1.1 ’s selectors are 10x - 20 x faster than those in jQuery 1.0.4 .
This should provide a noticable difference in your jQuery applications .
than those in jQuery 1.0.4 .
This should provide a noticable difference in your jQuery applications .
Common selectors like div#id , div .class , td:nth - child ( 1 ) , and div > div are all significantly faster .
It ’s a complete world of difference .
Try them out and you ’ll see .
, , , and are all significantly faster .
It ’s a complete world of difference .
Try them out and you ’ll see .
You can now pass in a function as a value for an attribute or a css property .
The function is executed and its return value is set as the value for the property .
For example : // 1.0 Code $ ( " a " ) .each ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) . attr ( " href " , " /item / " + this.id ) ; } ) .show ( ) ; // 1.1 Code $ ( " a " ) . attr ( " href " , function ( ) { return " / item / " + this .id ; } ).show ( ) ;
You can now unbind an event handler from within itself .
This allows you to have event handlers that are only bound for a specific number of executions , for example : $ ( " button " ) .click ( function(e ) { //
Unbind the event handler if a specific form is hidden if ( $ ( " #submitForm " ) .is( " : hidden " ) ) { $ ( this ) .unbind ( e ) ; } } ) ;
Easily bind an event that will only occur once ( this replaces the old .oneclick ( ) functionality ) : //
Show a thank you message for a form submission , but only once $ ( " form " ) . one ( " submit " , function ( ) { $ ( " #thankyou " ) .
show ( ) ; } ) ;
You can now set the text value of an element ( this is different from .html ( ) , where in . text ( ) all HTML is displayed as text ) .
$ ( " pre " ) .
text ( " < b> Hello < / b > , how are you ? " ) ; // Result : < pre><b> Hello </b > , how are you ?</ pre>
You can now build your own filters , using a custom function .
( This was in 1.0 , but it was n’t documented very well . ) //
Find all divs whose parent is n't hidden $ ( " div " ) .filter ( function ( ) { return $ ( this ) .
parent ( " : hidden " ) .
length > 0 ; } ) ;
You can now pass a comma-separated list of selectors to the following filter functions :
filter , find , not , siblings , parents , children , next , prev .
This allows you to do some very cool stuff : //
Find all radio buttons , or checkboxes , in a form $ ( " form input " ) . filter ( " : radio , : checkbox " ) ; //
Find the next element that 's a span , or a div $ ( this ) . next ( " span , div " ) ;
2 ) Refreshed Web Site Design
The design of the jQuery web site has finally be given a much - needed facelift .
This was planned out by the fantastic jQuery Design Team and implemented by Nate Cavanaugh .
The design team has a full redesign / restructuring planned , but we wanted something that would help us get from our current design to the complete overhaul .
Hope you enjoy it – and be sure to thank Nate , Bradley , or Skye for their job well done !
3 ) Overhauled Documentation
A big point that we ’ve been working with , lately , was to really pull together and categorize the jQuery Documentation , Tutorials , and API into one centralized location .
The result of this effort is the new :
http://docs.jquery.com/
All jQuery documentation can be found in this one , central , location – making it easier for you to find what you need and get your work done faster .
We hope you enjoy this new structuring , please let us know if you have any suggestions for what we can add to make it better .
4 ) A Secret …
We ’ve been holding this one back a while , but we ’re finally ready to let it go …
There ’s a jQuery Book in the works !
An excited publisher has stepped up , and the authors are already a quarter of the way complete .
There ’s still some details in the works , and we ’re going to tell all once its getting nearer to completion , but right now it ’s looking like we ’re going to have a late - Spring / early - Summer release of the first jQuery book !
I hope you enjoy everything – a lot of time and effort has really gone into making this release great .
Be sure to thank everyone on the jQuery Team , they ’ve put a lot of time and effort into making this release come out really good .
I ’ll be doing a “ State of the Query ” post tomorrow , to talk about where jQuery has come during this past year , and the evangelism team will be doing a couple blog posts about what you can do with the new jQuery 1.1 .
Thank you , everyone , for making this a fantastic first year for jQuery .

The purpose of this paper is to provide a layman 's critique
of the Anthropogenic Global Warming ( AGW ) theory , and in particular to
challenge the fairly widespread notion that the science and projected
consequences of AGW currently justify massive spending and government
intervention into the world 's economies .
This paper will show that
despite good evidence that global temperatures are rising and that CO2 can act
as a greenhouse gas and help to warm the Earth , we are a long way from
attributing all or much of current warming to man-made CO2 .
We are even
further away from being able to accurately project man 's impact on future
climate , and it is a very debatable question whether interventions today to
reduce CO2 emissions will substantially improve the world 50 or 100 years from
now .

The Banality Of Dick Cheney 's Evil
The New Yorker
Ramzi Kassem , who teaches at Yale Law School , said that a Yemeni client of his , Sanad al - Kazimi , who is now in Guantánamo , alleged that he had received similar treatment in the Dark Prison , the facility near Kabul .
Kazimi claimed to have been suspended by his arms for long periods , causing his legs to swell painfully .
“ It ’s so traumatic , he can barely speak of it , ” Kassem said .
“ He breaks down in tears . ” Kazimi also claimed that , while hanging , he was beaten with electric cables .
According to sources familiar with interrogation techniques , the hanging position is designed , in part , to prevent detainees from being able to sleep .
The former C.I.A. officer , who is knowledgeable about the interrogation program , explained that “ sleep deprivation works .
Your electrolyte balance changes .
You lose all balance and ability to think rationally .
Stuff comes out . ”
Sleep deprivation has been recognized as an effective form of coercion since the Middle Ages , when it was called tormentum insomniae .
It was also recognized for decades in the United States as an illegal form of torture .
An American Bar Association report , published in 1930 , which was cited in a later U.S. Supreme Court decision , said , “ It has been known since 1500 at least that deprivation of sleep is the most effective torture and certain to produce any confession desired . ”
Under President Bush ’s new executive order , C.I.A. detainees must receive the “ basic necessities of life , including adequate food and water , shelter from the elements , necessary clothing , protection from extremes of heat and cold , and essential medical care . ”
Sleep , according to the order , is not among the basic necessities .
In addition to keeping a prisoner awake , the simple act of remaining upright can over time cause significant pain .
McCoy , the historian , noted that “ longtime standing ” was a common K.G.B. interrogation technique .
In his 2006 book , “ A Question of Torture , ” he writes that the Soviets found that making a victim stand for eighteen to twenty - four hours can produce “ excruciating pain , as ankles double in size , skin becomes tense and intensely painful , blisters erupt oozing watery serum , heart rates soar , kidneys shut down , and delusions deepen . ”
1959 : “ Rocket mail ” becomes “ missile mail ” when 3,000 pieces of mail are delivered by a cruise missile fired from a U.S. Navy submarine .
Experiments in delivering mail by rocket had met with mixed success since the first rocket mail was sent between two Austrian villages in 1931 .
The first successful delivery by this method in the United States occurred in 1936 , when two rockets fired from Greenwood Lake , New Jersey , landed on the New York shore about 300 meters away .
The 1959 attempt , however , was something entirely new , since the mail was not packed in rockets built for the purpose but stowed in mail containers that replaced a nuclear warhead on top of a missile built for war .
Because this was strictly an experiment , the mail consisted entirely of commemorative postal covers addressed to a host of government officials , including President Eisenhower .
The missile was fired shortly before noon from a launcher aboard the submarine USS Barbero , cruising off the coast of Virginia .
Twenty - two minutes after launch , the missile struck its target at the Naval Auxiliary Air Station in Mayport , Florida .
The mail was retrieved , sorted and routed in the usual way from a post office in nearby Jacksonville .
Rocket mail , which has a whiff of theatrics to it , still exists and still has advocates around the world .
Since the end of the cold war , a number of surplus missiles culled from the Soviet nuclear arsenal have been used to fire mail around Russia , including a few experimental launches from nuclear subs .

Revitalization A Metallurgist 's Insights Into the Minneapolis Bridge Disaster By Joel S. Hirschhorn
Published August 02 , 2007
The incredible collapse of the Minneapolis bridge will send a message to the US that has been repeatedly sent for decades , but to which the political system has refused to effectively respond .
America 's physical , engineered infrastructure has been in desperate need for massive spending to repair and replace , but the multi-trillion - dollar cost has been rejected by local , state and federal politicians .
First , understand that I have a professional background in this area .
My career started as a metallurgist , then I obtained a Ph.D. in Materials Engineering and became a full professor of metallurgical engineering at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , where I taught about mechanical metallurgy and failure analysis , and in my consulting practice regularly worked on explaining actual failures of products and systems .
Academic and professional groups have for many years produced countless reports on mounting unpaid public costs for updating our crucial physical infrastructure , including bridges , but going way beyond those to , for example , roads , water and sewer systems , tunnels and much more .
Make no mistake :
The deeply researched and totally supported case for a massive national infrastructure spending program could not have been clearer .
But spending on infrastructure is not sexy and politicians at ALL levels of government have found countless excuses for not facing the totality of the problem .
Instead , public spending is dribbled out , dealing with the most urgent problems or , worse yet , the ones that are the most visible to the public .
Left unaddressed are massive numbers of problems , such as the Minneapolis bridge and thousands more bridges , that our bureaucratic system has learned to game , postpone , rationalize and , therefore , put the public safety at considerable risk .
I can pretty much assure you that if there is a technically honest and complete investigation , the ultimate explanation of the Minneapolis bridge failure will be related to fatigue cracking in the metal structure .
Already , news reports have revealed some prior observation of a fatigue problem with the bridge and that the bridge had a relatively low rating of four out of a possible nine , showing that it was structurally deficient .
The game played by virtually all government agencies is to find excuses for delaying the most costly repair or replacement of bridges and other parts of the physical infrastructure .
As another example , in most older urban areas there are constant repairs of busted underground water pipes .
What is really needed , but avoided , is a total replacement of very old underground pipe systems â€ “ in many places 100 or more years old !
Government inspection programs have been terribly compromised over many years .
The incredible political pressures to minimize spending on infrastructure have filtered down to the people , procedures and technologies used to examine bridges and other things .
When it comes to bridges it is also important to admit that many aspects of our automobile addiction have raised risks , including enormously greater numbers of vehicles creating heavy traffic during much of the day in urban regions .
Add to this the massive increase in vehicle weight resulting from the incredible increase in monster SUVs , as well as huge increases in large truck traffic .
The Minneapolis bridge collapse happened during evening rush hour because that was a period of maximum stress , and that would be the trigger for expanding existing fatigue cracks .
Once fatigue cracks get to critical sizes they grow and propagate very rapidly , producing powerful loads and stresses on remaining steel components and creating what appears to be a virtually instantaneous bridge collapse .
The remaining public policy question is clear :
Will the nation spend what is necessary ?
Seven other major bridge collapses in the last 40 years have not done the trick .
Inadequate bridge inspection has been a frequent documented problem , as well as some design defects .
Many people have already died from bridge failures .
But still the nation 's elected officials have not bitten the bullet and agreed to spend trillions of dollars over several decades to bring America 's physical infrastructure up to the most modern standards .
Think about all this the next time you go over a bridge .

Bill Clinton on Iraq : ' There is no military victory here ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday July 19 , 2007 Print This Email This During an appearance on ABC's Good Morning America Thursday , former President Clinton was asked to comment on recent statements by US generals in Iraq who claim they have been seeing signs of progress since the surge .
" The point is that there is no military victory here , " said Clinton , emphasizing that military success in Iraq is useless in the absence of political reconciliation and diplomatic efforts .
" The president has weathered the challenge in the Senate because of the filibuster , " Clinton said of his successor , " but in the end , September will come , and it wo n't be long . "
When Diane Sawyer asked Clinton to comment on Elizabeth Edwards ' recent statement that Hillary Clinton might not be the best possible advocate for women , he responded diplomatically , " The thing I like about this presidential race is that I do n't have to be against any of these candidates .
I like them all .
But if you look at the record on womens ' issues , I defy you to find anybody who has run for office in recent history who 's got a longer history of working for women , for families and children than Hillary does . "
Clinton , who was appearing from Johannesburg , South Africa , then spoke about the work of his foundation on AIDS .
His hope is that greater availability of treatment will encourage more people to be tested and ultimately reduce the rate of new infections .
When asked about the Bush administration 's policy of tying AIDS funding to abstinence education , he replied , " Abstinence - plus is a good strategy .
...
I think abstinence - only is a loser in a country where either the culture is against it or where the AIDS infection rate is already so high . "
The following video is from ABC's Good Morning America , broadcast on July 19 .
Full transcript of interview : # MS . SAWYER : Mr. President , so good to have you with us this morning , thank you .
If you were still president and your generals -- these are your generals saying give me more time , would you give them more time ?
MR .
CLINTON : I think the problem is -- first of all , I think there is some evidence that changes from day to day , but while the violence is going up in many places , where we have soldiers , and where the Iraqis are fighting the outside insurgents like the al Qaeda insurgents in the Sunni areas , we 've had some evidence of progress .
The point is that there is no military victory here , and there 's no evidence that whether we have a good or a bad day in a particular community or region in Iraq , that we have either the political reconciliation process within the country working , or any diplomatic process that 's got a chance to help with the neighbors .
That , it seems to me , is the larger point .
MS .
SAWYER : So there 's nothing General Petraeus could be saying in September that would convince you of anything but start pulling the troops out ?
MR. CLINTON : Well , I believe that General Petraeus is a very able man .
And I do n't have any doubt that they 'll win some battles , and I hope this works .
I think every American hopes this works .
But it can't work beyond winning a few battles .
It has to be accompanied by , and he has a few weeks -- the Iraqis have a few weeks to do it -- it has to be accompanied by progress on the political front .
The president has weathered the challenge in the Senate because of the filibuster .
As long as he can hold more than 40 senators , he can stop the Senate from voting for a change in course .
But in the end , September will come , and it wo n't be long .
MS .
SAWYER : A very quick question about some political news this morning , and then I want to turn to the important work in Africa .
As you know , the wife of Senator John Edwards , Elizabeth Edwards , has said of Senator Clinton , I 'm not convinced she'd be as good an advocate for women , meaning as Senator Edwards would be , and said " sometimes you feel you have to behave as a man and not talk about women 's issues .
I 'm sympathetic she wants to be commander in chief . "
Do you have a response to her ?
MR .
CLINTON : You know , I like Elizabeth Edwards and I admire the struggle she 's going through .
And I admire the fact that she 's supporting her husband ; she ought to be .
But , the thing I like about this presidential race is I do n't have to be against any of these candidates , I like them all .
But if you look at the record on women 's issues , I defy to find anybody who has run for office in recent history who 's got a longer history of working for women , for families and children than Hillary does .
I 'm proud of Hillary 's record and her lifetime commitment .
And I do n't think she 's trying to be a man .
I do n't think it 's inconsistent with being a woman that you can also be knowledgeable on military and security affairs and be strong when the occasion demands it .
That 's -- I do n't consider that being manly .
I consider that being a leader .
MS .
SAWYER : All right .
I do want to turn to Africa now .
You were , I believe , the first American president ever to go to South Africa .
And I know for the past five years , as part of the foundation , you 're been going every single year .
Two million Africans died of AIDS last year .
Is there a benchmark you can give Americans for when you think the tide can turn if enough is done ?
MR .
CLINTON : Yes .
I think when we have -- I think there are two benchmarks .
When we have the number of new infections going down , and when we are well over two - thirds of all those who need treatment are getting it .
And the reason I use two - thirds is this : an enormous percentage of Africans who are HIV positive do n't know they 're HIV positive until they get sick .
The more people we treat , the more people are willing to be tested because they 're aware of the disease , they see there 's no stigma then , they know they 'll live if they turn out to be HIV positive because they 'll get treatment .
As soon as that happens , you 'll see responsible activity going up and the number of new infections going down .
We now have , just in my foundation , in Africa , India , China , the Caribbean , the whole Asia -- the rest of Asia -- we have about 750,000 people getting treatment off our contracts .
And there are probably two - thirds more , that is , that 's about a third of those in the world getting treatment , and there 's about two - thirds more getting treatment from the United States program , the global fund on AIDS , TB and malaria , and other smaller endeavors around the world .
So , we 've really ramped up the number of people getting treatment to about , I suppose there are about 2.2 million people , two and a quarter ( million ) this year getting treatment , maybe a little more .
But I think by the end of the year , they 'll be more than 3 million people on treatment , and more and more children .
MS .
SAWYER : The Bush administration has tied some of its funding to abstinence education .
Is that a good thing or not ?
MR. CLINTON : I think that it should n't be mandatory .
I think that abstinence - plus is a good strategy .
And several African countries have used it to good effect .
I think abstinence only is a loser in a country where either the culture is against it or where the AIDS infection rate is already so high .
But I think -- I have no problem , but I think abstinence should be a part of the strategy , particularly when you 're dealing with younger kids .
MS .
SAWYER : As you know , a lot of Americans still ask a question , and it's a good threshold question , which is , why Africa ?
There 's so much work that needs to be done here in America .
MR .
CLINTON : I think that it 's not an either / or question .
I believe that we learned in Iraq , and I think we 've learned in Afghanistan , and I believe , ironically , we 're learning in Africa , from the successes .
A recent international poll shows that while opinion of America is down almost everywhere in the world , it 's up in all the African countries where we have a heavy presence working on AIDS and malaria and development .
It 's much cheaper than defense , spending money here .
And it builds a world with more partners and fewer enemies , which is important .
That does n't mean that we should n't be working on poverty and healthcare and economic inequality and education in the United States .
But this is a very tiny percentage of our overall budget .
And -- so it would be good for us to do .
It 's also the morally right thing to do to try to help these children grow up and have their lives .
But I can tell you that it 's a very good investment for America .
And it 's a tiny percentage of the federal government 's overall funding .
Americans spend much less on this kind of foreign assistance than most people know , and it 's much more effective than most people know .
MS .
SAWYER : Again , Mr. President , thanks so much for being with us on this busy morning .
Thank you .
MR .
CLINTON : Thank you , Diane . #
Дама любит делать парню минет пока она не кончит ей на лиц о
Meanwhile , bonobo studies began to gain momentum .
Other scientists followed Horn into the Congo Basin , and they set up two primary field sites .
One , at Lomako , three hundred miles northeast of Lake Tumba , came to be used by Randall Susman , of Stony Brook University , and his students .
Further to the east , Takayoshi Kano , of Kyoto University , in Japan , made a survey of bonobo habitats on foot and on bicycle , and in 1974 he set up a site at the edge of a village called Wamba .
Early data from Wamba became better known than Lomako ’s : the Japanese spent more time at their site and saw more bonobos .
Susman , however , can take credit for the first bonobo book : he edited a collection of papers given at the first bonobo symposium , in Atlanta , in 1982 .
In the winter of 1983 - 84 , in an exploration that was less gruelling but as influential as any field research , Frans de Waal turned his attention from chimps to bonobos , and spent several months observing and videotaping ten bonobos in the San Diego Zoo .
He had recently published “ Chimpanzee Politics : Power and Sex Among Apes ” ( 1982 ) , to great acclaim , and , as de Waal recently recalled , “ Most people I talked to at the time would say , ‘ Why would you do bonobos if you can do real , big chimpanzees ? ’ ” Among the papers that drew on his studies in San Diego , one was particularly noticed in the academy .
In “ Tension Regulation and Nonreproductive Functions of Sex in Captive Bonobos , ” de Waal reported that these apes seemed to be having more sex , and more kinds of sex , than was really necessary .
He recorded seventeen brief episodes of oral sex and four hundred and twenty equally brief episodes of face - to - face mounting .
He also saw forty - three instances of kissing , some involving “ extensive tongue - tongue contact . ”
In the late nineteen - eighties , Gottfried Hohmann was an ambitious scientist in his thirties ; he spent nearly three years in southern India , researching vocal communication in macaques and langurs .
“ But it was difficult then to get funding for India , ” Hohmann told me .
“ And the bonobo thing was just heating up .
Frans ’s paper really affected everyone ” in the scientific community .
“ Tongue - kissing apes ?
You ca n’t come up with a better story .
Then people said to me , ‘ We want you to go in the field . ’ ” Hohmann ran his hand back and forth over his head .
“ So , ” he said .
We were sitting on a wooden bench at the edge of a forest clearing barely larger than a basketball court , talking against a constant screech — an insect tinnitus that the ear never quite processed into silence .
Trees rose a hundred feet all around , giving the impression that we had fallen to the bottom of a well .
Two days after our plane touched down , we had reached Lui Kotal .
In the intervening hours , which were inarguably more challenging for the three newcomers than for Hohmann , we had first camped in a violent rainstorm , then followed some unflagging porters on a trail that led through the hot , soupy air of the forest , and along waist - high streams that flowed over mud .
We had then camped again , before crossing a fast - flowing river in an unsteady canoe .
Now , at five in the afternoon , the light at Lui Kotal was beginning to fade .
People who work there make do with little sun— and with a horizon that is directly overhead .
Around us , the wall of vegetation was solid except where broken by paths : one led back to the village ; another led into that part of the forest where Hohmann and his team have permission to roam — an area , six miles by five , whose boundaries are streams and rivers .
In the clearing stood a dozen structures with thatched roofs and no walls .
Some of these sheltered tents ; a larger one was a kitchen , where an open fire was burning ; and another was built over a long wooden table , beside which hung a 2006 Audubon Society calendar that had been neatly converted — with glue , paper , and an extravagant superfluity of time — into a 2007 calendar .
At the table sat two young American volunteers who were not many weeks away from seeing the calendar ’s images repeat .
Pale , skinny men in their twenties , wearing wild beards , they looked like they needed rescuing from kidnappers .
Three others were less feral , and had been in the camp for a shorter time : a young British woman volunteer , an Austrian woman who had recently graduated from the University of Vienna , and a Swiss Ph.D. student attached to the Max Planck Institute .
Hohmann , shirtless , was in an easy mood , knowing that much of the logistical and political business of the trip was now done .
Before leaving the village , I ’d seen something of a bonobo researcher ’s extended duties .
The men of Lompole had convened around him , their arms crossed and hands tucked into their armpits .
Hohmann remained seated and silent as an angry debate began — as Hohmann described it , between villagers who were unhappy about the original deal that compensated the village for having to stop hunting around Lui Kotal ( this had involved a bulk gift of corrugated iron , to be used for roofs ) and those who worked directly for the project and saw the greater advantage in stability and employment .
Hohmann had finally got up and delivered a forceful speech in Lingala , Congo ’s national language .
He finished with a moment of theatre : he loomed over his main antagonist , wagging his finger .
“ It ’s good to remind him now and then how short he is , ” Hohmann later said , smiling .
By 1989 , Hohmann told me , he had read enough bonobo literature to be tempted to visit Zaire .
Even if one left aside French kissing , he said , “ the bonobo allured me .
I thought ,
This is a species . ”
By then , thanks to field and captive studies , a picture of bonobo society had begun to emerge , and some peculiar chimpanzee - bonobo dichotomies had been described .
Besides looking and sounding different from chimpanzees ( bonobos let out high whoops that can seem restrained alongside chimpanzee yelling ) , bonobos seemed to order their lives without the hierarchical fury and violence of chimpanzees .
( “ With bonobos , everything is peaceful , ” Takeshi Furuichi , a Japanese researcher who worked with Kano at Wamba , told me .
“ When I see bonobos , they seem to be enjoying their lives .
When I see chimpanzees , I am very , very sorry for them , especially for the high - ranking males .
They really have to pay attention . ” )
In captivity , at least , male bonobos never ganged up on females , although the reverse sometimes occurred .
The bonds among females seemed to be stronger than among male chimpanzees , and this was perhaps reinforced by sexual activity , by momentary episodes of frottage that bonobo experts refer to as “ genito - genital rubbing , ” or “ g - g rubbing . ”
And , unusually , the females were said to be sexually receptive to males even at times when there was no chance of conception .
“ We said , ‘ We have to answer : Why is it like this ? ’ ” Hohmann said .
“ The males , the physically superior animals , do not dominate the females , the inferior animals ?
The males , the genetically closely related part of any bonobo group , do not coöperate , but the females , who are not related , do coöperate ?
It is not only different from chimpanzees but it violates the rules of social ecology . ”
Hohmann flew to Zaire and eventually set up a small camp in Lomako Forest , a few miles from the original Stony Brook site .
His memory is that Susman ’s camp had been unused for years , but Susman told me that it was still active , and that Hohmann was graceless in the way that he took over the forest .
And although Hohmann said that he worked with a new community of bonobos , Susman said that Hohmann inherited bonobos that were already habituated , and failed to acknowledge this research advantage .
Whatever the truth , the distrust seems typical of the field .
The challenges of bonobo research call for chimpanzee vigor , and this leads to animosities .
Susman told me that Hohmann was the kind of man who , “ if he was sitting by the side of the road and needed a filter for his Land Rover , people would drive right by .
Even if they had five extra filters in the trunk . ”

1. Start out easy .
We ’ve never done this before .
I ’m not going to venture into terribly adventurous behavior on our first romp , I figure if things continue to go well , we ’ll get to that later .
Do n’t bust out with how your dick wants to fuck my moist pussy when all I ’ve said since the removal of my underpants is “ that feels nice . ”
Take her easy , friend , Rome was n’t built in a day .
2 . I ’m going to get more comfortable with this as we go , because I realize you like it and I ’m in this as much to please you as in pursuit of my own orgasm .
But please do n’t use any noun to refer to my anatomy that I do n’t use first .
I get to set the rules on what we call the vagina , because she ’s mine and I have some respect for her .
I ’ll do the same for you - we can call your penis by any name you express appreciation for .
There are lots of words out there I like to use for my vagina .
There are a few that my vagina and I do n’t like and do n’t use and we do n’t want to have sex with people who use them .
Follow my lead , we ’re going to build a colorful vocabulary .
3 .
Use this dirty talk all you want to make declarative statements and describe your fantasies , but please resist the urge to ask self - indulgent questions .
“ Do you like my cock ? ” is perhaps the most insecure and unsexy thing to throw in between the sheets .
I ’m probably going to let you know via moans , groans and declarative statements how I feel about your penis .
At the moment that you ask , there is a chance I ’m actually considering your penis .
Perhaps I ’m comparing it to others in the past , or thinking about how it ’s larger / smaller / thicker than I expected .
I also might be thinking about the surprisingly high quality of your bedding or the balance in my bank account .
The fact is , I ’m going to tell you how I feel about your penis when I want to , and when you ask me outright if I love your cock , I ’m going to eek out a “ yes ” that I may or may not mean and resent the interruption .
And , for the record , if this is not the first time we ’ve fucked , I probably like your penis just fine , have no significant complaints , and find your fishing for compliments pathetic .
4 .
When the deed is done , acknowledge that our dirty dialog occurred .
You ca n’t get up , hop in the shower , and drift off to sleep without recognizing that you ’ve just disclosed your kinky little preference to me .
I was there , I noticed , I participated , if you want me to increase my participation next time , now is the time to say “ I like to talk dirty while we fuck . ”
Then I can make a joke , tell you it kind of turned me on , and we can go to sleep in relative comfort .
I leave you to figure the rest out on your own , boys .
It ’ll be fine , the quietest conquest can buzz with your brand of naughty sweet nothings if you stop to consider what you sound like in your lady friend ’s ears .
We ’re girls , we want to pretend you respect us for the twenty minutes you ’re thrusting into us .
That does n’t mean we ca n’t talk for a while about cocks and cunts fucking , it just means there ’s got to be a little more thought put into how talking dirty is deployed .
And I ’m on to you , CL community - please , no pictures , solicitations , propositions or erotica in my inbox .
Thanks .
Well , well , well , after all the yelling , screeching , bitching and moaning by the pResident and the whiny neo-cons about the role that Iranian militants are playing Iraq , lo and freaking behold , look at which Middle East countries is the source for most of the foreign militants : SAUDI ARABIA !
Not Iran , but SAUDI ARABIA .
Great scoop by the LA Times .
Ah yes , our ally Saudi Arabia .
First , that country provided most of the 9/11 attackers .
And if that was n't enough , now it provides most of the terrorists in Iraq ( NOT IRAN ) ... I wonder what Bush and his stepford rethuglicans will have to say about this .
Any guesses ?
PSYCHOLOGISTS have known for a long time that economists are wrong .
Most economists — at least , those of the classical persuasion — believe that any financial gain , however small , is worth having .
But psychologists know this is not true .
They know because of the ultimatum game , the outcome of which is often the rejection of free money .
In this game , one player divides a pot of money between himself and another .
The other then chooses whether to accept the offer .
If he rejects it , neither player benefits .
And despite the instincts of classical economics , a stingy offer ( one that is less than about a quarter of the total ) is , indeed , usually rejected .
The question is , why ?
One explanation of the rejectionist strategy is that human psychology is adapted for repeated interactions rather than one - off trades .
In this case , taking a tough , if self - sacrificial , line at the beginning pays dividends in future rounds of the game .
Rejecting a stingy offer in a one - off game is thus just a single move in a larger strategy .
And indeed , when one - off ultimatum games are played by trained economists , who know all this , they do tend to accept stingy offers more often than other people would .
But even they have their limits .
To throw some light on why those limits exist , Terence Burnham of Harvard University recently gathered a group of students of microeconomics and asked them to play the ultimatum game .
All of the students he recruited were men .
Dr Burnham 's research budget ran to a bunch of $ 40 games .
When there are many rounds in the ultimatum game , players learn to split the money more or less equally .
But Dr Burnham was interested in a game of only one round .
In this game , which the players knew in advance was final and could thus not affect future outcomes , proposers could choose only between offering the other player $ 25 ( ie , more than half the total ) or $ 5 .
Responders could accept or reject the offer as usual .
Those results recorded , Dr Burnham took saliva samples from all the students and compared the testosterone levels assessed from those samples with decisions made in the one - round game .
As he describes in the Proceedings of the Royal Society , the responders who rejected a low final offer had an average testosterone level more than 50 % higher than the average of those who accepted .
Five of the seven men with the highest testosterone levels in the study rejected a $ 5 ultimate offer but only one of the 19 others made the same decision .
What Dr Burnham 's result supports is a much deeper rejection of the tenets of classical economics than one based on a slight mis-evolution of negotiating skills .
It backs the idea that what people really strive for is relative rather than absolute prosperity .
They would rather accept less themselves than see a rival get ahead .
That is likely to be particularly true in individuals with high testosterone levels , since that hormone is correlated with social dominance in many species .
Economists often refer to this sort of behaviour as irrational .
In fact , it is not .
It is simply , as it were , differently rational .
The things that money can buy are merely means to an end — social status — that brings desirable reproductive opportunities .
If another route brings that status more directly , money is irrelevant .
Chavez is one of the ringleaders of the anti-American movement
Venezuela is unusual , indeed unique .
It is a Latin American nation which in recent years has become rich enough to have the power to tell the US to take a hike .
And Hugo Chavez , the democratically elected leader , loses no opportunity to do just that .
In the early part of this century , he became one of the ringleaders of the worldwide anti-American movement .
Hugo said this recently about George : " The imperialist , mass murdering , fascist attitude of the president of the United States does n't have limits .
I think Hitler could be a nursery baby next to George W Bush . "
Smoke screen ?
You 've got to wonder if there is any end to the capacity of the rest of the world to blame the United States for its problems .
Nowhere is that more the case than in Latin America , where out of roughly 500 million people , 200 million live on less than $ 2 a day .
' Chavista ' Eva Golinger says Chavez is a threat to US domination
In other words , in Latin America as elsewhere in the world , is anti-Americanism a smoke screen , a very convenient smoke screen , whose noxious fumes hide the reality of local failure ?
As Otto Reich , a former Bush administration ambassador to Venezuela and public enemy number one ( or two ? ) among many anti-Americans , told us : " The United States is the scapegoat .
It provides an easy excuse for the failures : if something is n't working , blame the Americans .
Scratch the surface of some of these anti-Americans and you find self - loathing . "
What a Chavista like Eva Golinger will tell you is that that kind of comment is typical of American " prepotencia " - arrogance .
Ms Golinger , a Venezuelan and US citizen raised in New York , says : " Hugo Chavez is a threat to the United States government but not in the way Washington portrays him , as a threat to democracy .
He is a threat to US domination . "
Focusing on the negative
For Mr Chavez and his backers , Latin anti-Americanism is rooted in what the US has done here - not in French - style metaphysical hoity - toityness .
This is not a snobbishness about fast food or a feeling that US style democracy destroys high culture .
Some Latin Americans will sympathise with these views for sure , but most say , with some justification , that their anti-Americanism is rooted in reaction to " facts on the ground " - their neighbour to the north has behaved badly in the past .
Augusto Montiel says the US likes to see itself as the world 's watchdog
" There is a culture in the United States about being the world 's watchdog , " says Congress member Augusto Montiel .
" They call it free trade when you shut up and against your dignity , your sovereignty , you lower your head and say ' yes ' we will give you everything .
That is not democracy , my friend , that is dictatorship . "
One of the great features of the anti-American mindset is the blotting out of the positive and the accentuating of the negative .
If American behaviour changes now , or if free trade turns out to make everyone wealthier , will Latin Americans change their minds about the modern USA
Send us your comments
Trade between north and south is huge : Venezuela alone sells $ 39bn worth of oil a year to the United States .
And millions and millions of Latin Americans benefit every day from the powerhouse US economy - from relatives cleaning cars in Los Angeles , making beds in Las Vegas and picking fruit in rural Georgia .
They send money home to places where economic development is stymied by corruption and government interference .
Which leads me to wonder : if American behaviour changes now , or if free trade turns out to make everyone wealthier , will Latin Americans change their minds about the modern US ?
That , it seems to me , is one of the challenges for Latin America : will it reward US support and good behaviour in the future with a toning down of the rhetoric ?
Enough Hitler stuff , perhaps ?
We 've featured avant - garde Brit designer Hussein Chalayan before , but this time he 's really outdone himself with Transformer - style clothing .

[ Fresh Creation ]
The Achilles ’ heel of the modern synthesis , as noted by the philosopher Ron Amundson , is that it deals primarily with the transmission of genes from one generation to the next , but not how genes produce bodies .
The recent discoveries in the new field of evolutionary developmental biology , or evo-devo , that the gene Pax - 6 controls the formation of eyes in mice and humans , Nkx2.5 heart formation , and a suite of other genes the formation of the nervous system , has provided a means to investigate the genetic and developmental mechanisms influencing how the form of organisms has evolved , not just their genes .
Perhaps the most exciting area in evolution is in exploring how rewiring the circuitry of genes produces different arthropod appendages , or wingspots on butterflies .
Eric H. Davidson , a colleague of mine at CalTech , has dissected the network of interactions between the genes that build the gut of sea urchins and starfish during development .
When he compares these gene networks , there is a core of about five genes whose interactions are essential to forming the gut , and which have been preserved for some 500 million years .
One advantage developmental biologists have over paleontologists is that they can experiment on the development of these animals .
Most of the genes in this network can be removed , and the developing embryo finds a way to compensate .
But these five core genes , which form what Davidson calls a kernel , cannot be modified : change any one of them and no embryo forms at all .
There is no reason to think that there was anything unusual about how this kernel first evolved some 500 million years ago ( before sea urchins and starfish split into different groups ) , but once the kernel formed it locked development onto a certain path .
These events , small and large , limit the range of possibilities on which natural selection can act .
These questions about mechanism were not even being asked under the modern synthesis .
The failure to consider how biodiversity grows reflects an even more troubling flaw in the modern synthesis : it lacks any real sense of history .
This may sound odd , as evolution is about history .
A geologist would describe evolutionary theory as uniformitarian : “ The present is the key to the past . ”
This is the principle we use that by understanding how processes operate today we can understand past events .
Evolutionary theory assumes that the processes we can study among fruit flies disporting themselves in a laboratory capture the broad sweep of evolutionary change .
But just as the erosive power of a river changes the future options for the course of the river , so evolution itself changes future evolutionary possibilities .
This can happen in simple ways , as termites construct their own environment by building termite mounds .
These mounds may last for dozens or hundreds of years and provide a sort of ecological inheritance for generations of termites .
The first cyanobacteria turned carbon dioxide into oxygen and set off a revolution that completely changed the chemistry of the oceans and atmosphere .
Most species modify their environment and this often changes how selection affects them : they construct , at least in part , their own environment .
As evolutionary biologists we have little understanding of what these processes mean for evolution .
Does all this add up to a new modern synthesis ?
There is certainly no consensus among evolutionary biologists , but development , ecology , genetics and paleontology all provide new perspectives on how evolution operates , and how we should study it .
None of these concerns provide a scintilla of hope for creationists , as scientific investigations are already providing new insights into these issues .
The foundations for a paradigm shift may be in place , but it may be some time before we see whether a truly novel perspective develops or these tensions are accommodated within an expanded modern synthesis .
Quick :
What does " concurrency " mean to you ?
To your colleagues ?
To your project ?
You probably know the fable of the blind men and the elephant : Several blind men explore an elephant by feel , and each one draws his own conclusion about what the elephant is .
The man at the tail concludes that the elephant is like a rope ; the one at the tusk asserts that , no , the elephant is like a spear ; the one at the leg thinks it 's like a tree ; the one at the ear that it 's like a fan ; and so on .
The blind men argue , each one knowing he is " right " from his own experience and point of view .
In time , several give up hope of ever agreeing on what the creature is , and some resign themselves to accepting that the best they can do is deeply analyze each disconnected part in isolation as its own separate self .
Meanwhile , the poor elephant waits patiently , faintly puzzled , because of course , it is not like any of those things alone and it does n't see itself as that hard to understand as a whole creature .
Have you ever talked with another developer about concurrency , and felt as though you were somehow speaking completely different languages ?
If so , you 're not alone .
You can see the confusion in our vocabulary ( and this is not an exhaustive list ) :
acquire , and - parallel , associative , atomic , background , cancel , consistent , data - driven , dialogue , dismiss , fairness , fine - grained , fork - join , hierarchical , interactive , invariant , isolation , message , nested , overhead , performance , priority , protocol , read , reduction , release , structured , repeatable , responsiveness , scalable , schedule , serializable update , side effect , systolic , timeout , transaction , throughput , virtual , wait , write , ...
Some of the words have many meanings ( performance , for instance ) , while others are unrelated ( responsiveness and throughput , for example ) .
Much of the confusion we may encounter arises when people inadvertently talk past each other by using incompatible words .
A basic problem is that this should n't be a single list .
But how can we group these terms sensibly , when experienced parallel programmers know scores or hundreds of different concurrency requirements and techniques that seem to defy grouping ?

After doing my little C - like DSEL in Haskell I started wondering if you could do arrays that look like C arrays too .
It turns out you can , but I can't figure out a way to make it safe from certain runtime errors .
Array indexing in C is written , and this is legal syntax in Haskell too , so we 're off to a good start .
But to make it work we needto be a function that takes a list and returns something .
What should it return ?
It must be something that is both an l-value and an r-value .
Just as I had a functionto create a local variable , I 'll have a functionto make a local array .
It will take the size of the array and then return a function that takes the index .
For simplicity I 'll make the index be anSo now this type checksNow we just need the body of Thefunction takes a list with one element , the size , and allocates an array ( indexed from 0 ) with this size .
It then returns a function that expects a singleton list with an index and returns theconstructor which I used for variables .
For multidimensional arrays we can extend the arr function .
The problem with both these definitions is that the number of indicies is checked dynamically rather than statically .
To do it statically we'd have to be able to overload the syntax for list literals to use a type that keeps track of the number of elements .

The SNP is marking 100 days in power at the Scottish Parliament
It comes as the SNP executive prepares to publish its White Paper on independence this week - containing plans for a referendum on the issue .
Labour said the proposals were an unwanted waste of taxpayers ' money .
A newspaper poll on Friday suggested support for independence had not significantly increased , despite more people backing the SNP .
The Progressive Scottish Opinion poll in the Daily Mail showed that while almost half of those questioned backed the Nationalists , the survey suggested 31 % were in favour of independence .
Devolution in the UK is better for Scotland and most Scots know that
Jack McConnell
Labour leader
This was down from a high point in November 2006 , when 51 % of people questioned in a Scotsman / ICM poll backed independence .
A spokesman for First Minister Alex Salmond said the SNP were taking a three - pronged approach to government , focusing on competence , consensus and their vision for the country .
SNP leaders argued their handling of incidents such as the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport showed they were governing effectively .
They also claimed cross-party support for matters such as the abolition of bridge tolls showed the administration was building consensus on an issue - by - issue basis .
The spokesman said : " The SNP are pursuing a three - fold approach to government - competence in running the nation 's affairs , a consensus to move Scotland forward on particular issues , and offering an overall vision of the country 's future .
That is the context for the White Paper publication . "
DRAFT INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM
QUESTION RELEASED IN MARCH
The Scottish Parliament should negotiate a new settlement with the British government , based on the proposals set out in the White Paper , so that Scotland becomes a sovereign and independent state
The responses would be ' Yes I agree ' or ' No I disagree '
SNP 's first 100 days in power
He continued : " The document will form the basis of a national conversation with the people , and will set out a vision of independence and responsibility in the modern world .
" It will be an inclusive , governmental document - making clear that ministers believe independence and equality offers the best future for Scotland , while urging those who believe in other possibilities , such as more powers , to come into the conversation . "
A draft version of the referendum question was made public by the SNP in March .
It was set out to ask voters if they wanted to negotiate a new settlement with the UK Government so that Scotland could become a sovereign and independent state .
But Labour leader Jack McConnell said it was wrong for the SNP to propose a referendum on a question " we all know the answer to " after the May Holyrood election , where the Nationalists emerged the largest party by one seat .
Labour , the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats oppose independence , while the Tories and Lib Dems support moves to increase the parliament 's powers to varying degrees .
The Green Party support the SNP 's moves towards independence , meaning an estimated 50 of Holyrood 's 129 MSPs are in favour .
Mr McConnell said : " A clear majority voted against independence parties in that election because devolution in the UK is better for Scotland and most Scots know that .
" The new first minister should accept the will of the people and concentrate on the people 's priorities . "

Would n't it be nice if we did n't have to worry our little heads over politics ?
Would n't it be lovely if we could just turn over control of all those vexing issues , including our health , welfare and very survival , to some nice men in Washington who would take care of all it for us , occasionally interrupting our somnambulance with this week 's latest thing - Communists !
Terrorists !
Lindsay Lohan ! - to distract our attention ?
Unfortunately , for far too many of us , this is actually precisely what is desired .
And do n't think Karl Rove does n't know it .
Politically speaking , we are a radically lazy society .
Thinking , let 's admit it , is hard work .
Many people do n't realize that , but then , many people have n't really had the experience .
For some folks it 's the cognitive equivalent of traveling abroad to a foreign land - done occasionally for a change of pace , if at all .
Rigorously exploring and thoughtfully understanding our world is not easy .
" Politics ai n't beanbag " , as the man once said , though he meant it rather differently .
Far less demanding to defer to simple stereotypes , canned passion plays and quasi-religious political morality tales than to actually do our homework , apply the logic , and generate original thinking .
And hey , if you do take the easy way out , you 'll still have plenty of time to catch the game on TV !
Moreover , there are lots of friendly people in Washington who would very much appreciate the opportunity to do your thinking for you .
They are called conservatives - though I think regressive is a far more accurate term - and they have been getting lots of practice in recent years .
They 'll be glad to make your political decisions for you , and even provide you a fully developed , off - the - shelf , ready - to - use reality , any time you like .
All you have to do is not think , and not learn .
Or , if you really must have the sensory input , simply confine yourself to the infotainment of Fox News or Star magazine .
( Though that whole reading thing is to be especially discouraged .
Posh Spice is the operative model here .
Lots of glamour , lots of money , lots of celebrity , lots of bling .
Little substance .
She apparently once told an interviewer that she had never read a book - any book - in her entire life .
Now that 's something , is n't it ?
You gotta love that .
You go , Girl !
There may be a Presidential Medal of Freedom waiting for you if you keep on pioneering the way toward Karl Rove 's dream citizenry .
And why not ?
Paul Bremer got one , and all he did was destroy a historic civilization of 25 million people . )
We in the progressive community know that not everybody in America thinks the way we do .
But we would probably be well served also by a recognition that some people in this country do n't want to think at all .
It is possible that some of these Borg could be knee - jerk progressives instead of knee - jerk regressives were they somehow to be re-assimilated into the reality - based community , but the odds are not high .
So much of progressive thinking requires careful reflection , extended analytical probing , and a collection of just plain data - factual information - about what is going on in the world .
So much of regressive ' thinking ' fits nicely , and completely , on a bumper sticker .
" Support our troops ! " , to wit , and quite literally a bumper sticker seen all over the place ( though noticeably less ubiquitous than it was in 2003 ) .
Literally a bumper sticker , that is , but not so literal in its meaning , especially since the most obvious way to support our troops - right here , right now - would be to pull them out of harm 's way , where they sit today for no conscionable purpose whatsoever .
Otherwise , short of that , really supporting our troops today would mean screaming and hollering at the top of our lungs to make sure that they get adequate training , armor , and rest before being deployed .
While we 're at it , we might even ask that they be paid at the same rate as the nearly equivalent numbers of mercenaries fighting alongside them , to the tune of three or four times the soldiers ' salary .
And if we really , really wanted to support the troops , we 'd call for a draft , so that we'd have a massively enlarged military , and each soldier would have far less of a share of the burden to carry .
Hmmm - that may be a bit more than our friends with the bumper stickers had in mind .
Perhaps that 's why they 've been seen lately ducking out to the garage in the wee hours of the night to scrape the things off their Hummers .
The fact that the regressive mantra " support the troops " in reality means none of these things is a perfect example of the difference between bumper sticker politics and something much more nuanced and analytical .
And real .
At the end of the day , the truth is that what this little slogan really means has little to do with the troops at all .
What it really means for regressives who employ it is : " I let the president do my thinking for me , and I 'd feel a whole lot more comfortable about how utterly lame that is if you would too , so I would n't have to be reminded by your nonconformity of how I 'm embarrassing myself by abdicating my role in this democracy thing we 're always huffing and puffing about , especially the particularly imbecilic creature now occupying the Oval Office to whom I 've turned over my brain " .
That 's what " support the troops " really means .
But then it gets worse from there , because it is n't really " the president " to whom our friendly regressive is entrusting his brain , but actually certain kinds of presidents only .
Do n't think for a minute that Bill Clinton would have gotten this kind of carte blanche from this same crowd .
Indeed , we know that he would n't have .
Because he did n't .
His interventions in the Balkans , infinitely more justifiable than the invasion of Iraq , produced only scorn and hostility from many of the same folk who now question the patriotism of anyone who finds the judgement of the current president even remotely dubious .
So much for the idea that politics stops at the water 's edge , eh ?
How very mid-twentieth century that notion was .
Sorta like the war on poverty , the progressive income tax , the Geneva Protocols , or other equally quaint historical artifacts .
Truly , the entirety of the Iraq debacle - not just the more recent quagmire - can be understood in terms of this kindergarten politics motif .
You need a boatload of operative assumptions banging away on all eight cylinders at once to buy , wholesale , into this line of garbage .
You need to believe that the story of 9/11 as it's been presented to us is real .
You need to believe that America has never acted in the Middle East for purposes of profiting its overclass and at the expense of the welfare and the very lives of the people there who are inconveniently living on top of " our " oil and " our " strategic perches .
You need to understand that " they " - Arabs , Muslims , brown people , ragheads , whatever - are all the same , and that the US attacking secular , Shiite - majority , Iraq in response to a crime supposedly perpetrated by rabid , Sunni , Islamofascists who happened to hate the Iraqi regime about as much as they hate us makes perfect sense .
You must forget that an urgent invasion to make us safe from weapons of mass destruction made no sense given the Cold War experience of forty years of deterrence , let alone the near - completion of the weapons inspections that were demonstrating that no such weapons even existed .
You must not laugh out loud at the prospect of bringing democracy to the Middle East as a motivation for the war , given the very same administration 's complete inaction in the face of genocide in Darfur .
You must never question why Iraq should be attacked in response to a terrorist episode perpetrated ( even according to the official story ) almost entirely by Saudis , and no Iraqis .
You have to believe that there are people sitting in bunkers somewhere right this moment , trying to determine where best to hit America in order to inflict maximum damage , and deciding that it 's a lot easier to deploy suicide missions in a locked down , massively fortified war zone than , or in addition to , on the streets of Burbank or Baltimore , and therefore that it is a good thing we are fighting them over there , so we do n't have to fight them over here .
Makes a lot of sense , does n't it ?
In kindergarten , the world is a lot easier to understand if you keep two important ideas in mind .
The first is that there are only two kinds of people - good ones and evil ones - you know , just like they teach you in Sunday school , or Lord of the Rings .
And , second , your side is always the good people side .
Likewise , Mr. Bush and his war are a lot easier to understand if you 've never quite graduated from kindergarten , emotionally or analytically .
Saddam , you see , was an evil , evil man , and we are the good people who had to heroically vanquish him in order to save his innocent would - be victims .
Given this construction , it was obviously crucial in the run-up to the war not to dwell too much on the past history of American relations with Saddam , back when he was , er , a good , evil man .
And , four - and - a - half years down the merry pike , it is equally important to avoid the inconvenient fact that a million Iraqi civilians are now dead , and four million more have become refugees .
Especially since that totals out to one - fifth of the country 's population , or the equivalent of 60 million Americans .
That 's equal to the entire populations of Minnesota , Louisiana , Alabama , Colorado , Kentucky , South Carolina , Oklahoma , Oregon , Connecticut , Mississippi , Kansas , Arkansas , Utah , Nevada , New Mexico , West Virginia , Nebraska , Idaho , Maine , New Hampshire , Hawaii , Rhode Island , Montana , Delaware , South Dakota , North Dakota , Alaska , Vermont , and Wyoming .
Personally , I would n't entirely miss a few of those states ( you know who you are , Mississippi , Utah , ' Bama ... ) , but I do n't wish any ill on the folks living there .
I only wish that they wished the same for the nice people of the Anbar , Najaf , Baghdad , Diyala , Karbala and the other Iraqi provinces .
These inconvenient facts , of course , represent massive cognitive overload for those Americans enrolled in Political Science .001 , Civics For Kindergartners .
Fortunately , the walking misnomer that goes by the name of the American news media was gracious enough to interject neither complexity nor reality into the comic strip morality play fabricated for our benefit by the good , good men in Washington ( Thanks , Dick !
Thanks , Karl ! ) .
None of us , therefore , had to think too hard if we did n't want to , about the difficult questions lurking only just barely below the war 's mythological epic tale , a patina now rapidly melting away like a working girl 's eye make - up in a downpour .
Many of us continue to this day to resist such painful exercising of the synapses .
And one heckuva lot more of us would still be in that latter category now , had the administration 's Romper Room expectations for the war 's prosecution not gone so badly awry .
In kindergarten teacher knows best , and questioning - even of things you see right before your very eyes - will only earn you a timeout for insolence .
If teacher says that massive tax cuts for the rich will trickle down to the rest of us , and will even do so without busting the budget , then it must be so .
If teacher says turning over Social Security to Wall Street will make us all better off , then your job is to agree .
If teacher says we need not worry about our planet burning up despite the gargantuan pile of accumulated evidence to the contrary , she must be right .
If teacher promises to fix that entire city in Louisiana that drowned , then of course she will .
And if none of these things appear to your eyes to be true , two , three and four years later , then surely what 's needed is for you to visit the nice eye doctor with the funny dials and charts on the wall .
For teacher is never wrong .
But it is certainly always wrong to even wonder if that might be the case .
This is precisely the sort of mentality about politics that has gotten us into the trouble we 're in today .
And this kindergarten approach to public affairs is precisely what the American Founders sought to supplant with their blueprint for Enlightenment - style rational , mature , self - determining administration of government .
Their dream was that we could graduate from kindergarten to first grade , or maybe even tenth grade , and employ the wisdom that is inherent in most of us and is necessary to sustain self - governance , rather than continuing to rely upon the daddy figures of various kings and sundry deities .
The hopes and aspirations of the Founders , and the risk inherent to their experiment in governance , have been largely vindicated over the centuries since .
But sometimes , especially when we 're particularly frightened of the loud noises and the bright flashes that go bump in the middle of the night , too many of us still revert back to kindergartner mode .
It must be relaxing not to have to think very hard about difficult and complex issues , but to rely upon bumper sticker politics instead .
It must be comforting to know that the world can be reliably divided into good and evil , and that your side is always good .
It must be reassuring to uncritically delegate decision - making and even value - setting to somebody who talks tough and strides through the world with an impermeable air of confidence .
Yes , relaxation , comfort , and reassurance are all wonderful things , but then so is naptime .
Unless Americans want to ( continue to ) live in a country ruled by a government of , for and by kindergartners , some of us need to reconsider how we practice our politics .
Giving up graham crackers and milk wo n't be easy , of course .
But then neither is endless war , devastated cities , a destroyed environment or fiscal hemorrhaging .
And , anyway , it 's the price we all have to pay for graduating to first grade .

A CBS poll says about 2/3 of Americans think the government should provide health care for all .
Many in the poll think the government would suck at it ( about half said the government would do a worse job , and less than a third think it would do a better job ) .
Given how important health care is to people , I find it hard to reconcile these two opinions .
If I had to guess , most people who say they are for government health care implicitly imagine a two - tier system , where they would still get the good care they have today , but poor people who people imagine are without care today ( actually they tend to be without insurance , not without care ) would get a suckier second tier of health care run by the government .
But I do n't think this is a realistic view of what they will get with universal health care .
No government - run universal health care system is ever going to be politically stable with two tiers .
You are going to have to end up with a system that some poor people get better care but the rich and middle class end up with a worse system .
That is the reality of every government run health care system in the world .
I would love to see the answer to this poll question :

It seems that the foundation for calculus was set down at about the same time by two different mathematicians : Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz .
Both seemed to come up with the fundamental theorem separately .
Gottfried is more credited with the notation , where Newton is credited with the bringing the ideas of calculus together into a subject .
Either way , the tools of calculus have done wonders in helping us advance our understanding of physics , chemistry , and biology .
The crux of calculus is the ability to derive a function for the change of one dimension with respect to the change of another dimension .
For example one of the great formulas in physics discovered by Newton
Force = mass * acceleration
can be expressed as F = ma or F = m ( dv/ dt )
dv/dt equals the change in velocity with respect to the change in time .
dv/dt is the definition of acceleration .
You may ask yourself , how small a change in velocity is dv ?
The answer lies at the heart of calculus .
D v or ( the change in velocity ) with respect to D t ( change in time ) , is the change in both of these dimensions as the change gets infinitely small approaching zero .
Let 's take a more mathematical case , the case of a parabola as shown in figure 1 .
The slope of a line is the ratio of the difference between two coordinates on a line .
( slope = ( y2 - y1 ) /( x2 - x1 ) .
If we draw a line through the parabola , we intersect at two points and the slope of this line can be calculated using the formula for the slope .
If we move the line out to until it intersects with only a single point on the parabola , how do we determine the slope ?
After all the formula for the slope is ( y2 - y1 ) /( x2 - x1 ) .
Since in this case ( y2 = y1 , and x2 = x1 ) , the slope of the line using our slope formula would be ( y2 - y2 ) / ( x2 - x2 ) = 0/0 = ?.
Using calculus , we have this concept of the limit of the numerator and denominator of the slope approaching zero , but never hitting it .
In this case , dy / dx represents the infinitesimal change from one point to another on the parabola , so that in fact the slope of the line we are interested in only intersects the parabola at one point .
For a function , this idea of the change in slope approaching zero is called the Newton Quotient and is shown in the formula below :
We can plug in the formula for a parabola into the Newton Quotient to determine the derivative
= [ (x + h) 2 - x2 ] / h h --> 0
= ( x2 + 2xh + h2 - x2 ) /h h --> 0
= ( 2xh + h2 ) /h h --> 0
= 2x + h h--> 0
As h goes to 0 , the slope function becomes 2x
The Newton Quotient gives us the slope of the line at any point on the parabola .
If the value of the parabola x value is 3 , then the slope at ( 3,9 ) is 6 .
Other functions are a little tougher to calculate .
The slope of sin x is cos x .
The slope of ex is ex .
Many of these slope functions can be derived mathematically .
In this article we will derive the derivative of the function through trial and error using genetic algorithms .
Concept
In the past we have talked about a type of genetic expression algorithm called Multiple Expression Programming ( MEP ) .
This algorithm allows us to plug a set of numbers back into a genome that contains an equation .
The genomes adapt to a fitness that is determined by how close the equation generates the correct answer .
In the case of derivatives , we can use MEP to determine which equation most closely matches an equation that represents all the slopes along a particular function .
Let 's take the case of our parabola .
If we measure the approximate slope of 100 points along the curve of the parabola then plug those points into our genome , only the genome representing the equation 2X will most closely match the set of slopes .
Note that we only approximate the slopes along the tangent of the parabola by using successive point pairs that are relatively close together .
Below are the results of fitting the set of slopes of a parabola to a function after 102 generations .
The result : ( a + a ) or 2a has the highest fitness ( 41825 ) .
Figure 2 - Using a genetic algorithm to determine the derivative of x squared
Finding the derivative of the parabola did n't seem like much of a challenge , so we tried the ga on some harder functions .
Below is the derivative determined from the cubic function ( a3 )
Figure 3 - GA determining derivative of the x3 function
Soon we added some trigonomic functions to our MEP genomes to make it even more interesting .
Below is the derivative of sine + cosine after 102 generations :
Figure 4 - GA determining the derivative of sine + cosine
And here is the derivative of x * sin x after 102 generations .
This is correct considering the derivative of a product xy is dy / dx*x + dx / dy*y .
Figure 5 - GA determining the derivative of asina
After trying trigonometric formulas for a while , we decided to bring natural logs into the picture .
Below is the result of the GA finding the derivative of the function e2 x .
Figure 6 - GA Determining e2x
The Code
This article takes advantage of code from our previous MEP article .
The only difference in the code is 1 ) that we needed to change the genomes slightly to encourage them to use trig and natural log functions and 2 ) We needed to come up with a fitness function .
When the genome is randomly generated , it generates a number representing what function to use next in its sequence .
Below is the C# code that determines what operation to use based on the number inside the genome .
Note that numbers
0 - 3 are used to represent constants and variables in the genome and are not included in the case statement .
Listing 1 - Method inside the EquationGenome for performing a piece of the sequence of operations on the genome
public float DoOperation ( float a , float b , int operation )
{
float result = 0 ;
// determine which operation to perform next on the genome
switch ( operation )
{
case 4 : // add
result = a + b ;
break ;
case 5 : // subtract
result = ( a - b ) ;
break ;
case 6 : // multiply
result = ( a * b ) ;
break ;
case 7 : // divide
if ( b == 0 )
result = 1000000.0f ; // used to prevent divide by zero error
else
result = ( a / b ) ;
break ;
case 8 : // sine
result = ( float ) Math .
Sin ( ( double ) a ) ;
break ;
case 9 : // tangent
result = ( float ) Math .
Tan ( ( double ) a ) ;
break ;
case 10 : // cosine
result = ( float ) Math .
Cos (( double ) a ) ;
break ;
case 11 : // natural log
result = ( float ) Math .
Exp ( ( double ) a ) ;
if ( result == float . NaN )
result = 1000000.0f ;
break ;
case 12 :
result = 3 ;
break ;
default :
break ;
} // end switch return result ; }
In order to determine how well our genome approximates the set of slopes inside the function we wish to find the derivative , we need to first come up with a set of slopes to compare to the genome .
To compute a set of slopes , we simply loop through a set of points generated by the function and compute the slope of all adjacent points .
Listing 2 - Getting the set of slopes from the function
static PointF [ ] slope_fx = null ;
static PointF [ ] GetSlopeFunctionValues ()
{
if ( slope_fx == null ) // only needs to be done once
{
// get a set of points from the function
// that we wish to determine the derivative
PointF [ ] fx = GetPointsFromFunction ( ) ; // get the slopes of all those points
slope_fx = GetSlopes ( fx ) ;
} return slope_fx ;
} static PointF [ ] slopes = null ;
static private PointF [ ] GetSlopes ( PointF [ ] fx )
{
if ( slopes == null )
{
slopes = new PointF [ fx .
Length ] ;
PointF previousPoint = new PointF ( - 99999 , -99999 ) ;
int count = 0 ;
// loop through each point of the function and use the
// adjacent point to determine the next slope .
foreach ( PointF point in fx )
{
if ( ( int ) previousPoint . X != - 99999 )
{
// calculate slope
float slope = ( point . Y - previousPoint.Y ) / ( point . X - previousPoint.X ) ;
slopes [ count ] = new PointF ( ( point . X + previousPoint.X ) / 2 , slope ) ;
count ++;
} previousPoint = point ;
} } // return the set of slopes
return slopes ; }
If the set of slopes most closely fits an equation represented by the genome , we found a fit genome .
The CalculateDerivativeFitness method of our EquationGenome loops through each slope x value and runs it through the genome equation .
The result is subtracted from the actual slope value .
This delta between calculated and actual values is accumulated .
When we have gone through the entire set of slopes , we take the reciprocal of the sum of the delta results .
The reason we take the reciprocal is because a larger difference between actual and approximate values means a worse fitness .
We want our fitness to be higher for larger numbers so we invert the fitness .
Listing 3 - Calculating the fitness of the Genome against the set of slopes
public double CalculateDerivativeFitness ( ) { // this really is only called once , since we only need the set of slopes calculated one time for
// a particular function
GetSlopeFunctionValues ( ) ; CurrentFitness = 0 ; // loop through each slope x value
for ( int i = 0 ; i < slope_fx .
Length - 1 ; i++)
{
// perform this genomes equation on the next slope
// to determine the approximate slope at this x value
float calc = PerformCalculation ( slope_fx [ i ].X ) ;
// get the actual slope determined in listing 2
float measure = slope_fx [ i ] .Y ; // determine the difference and add it to the fitness
CurrentFitness += Math .
Abs ( measure - calc ) ;
} // take the reciprocal of the total set of differences ,
// since a larger difference between approximated
// and actual should be a worse fitness .
CurrentFitness = 1 / CurrentFitness ; // Math.Exp(- Math.Abs( CurrentFitness ) ) ;
return CurrentFitness ; }
Conclusion
This program illustrates another useful way genetic algorithms can be used to come up with solutions to mathematical problems through trial and error .
We found that the GA seemed to work very well for determining a few simple derivative equations .
The GA did n't always perform perfectly .
When we tried to determine the derivative of very complex polynomials , the GA seemed to have trouble .
I suspect the GA can be made to focus better if the trig and exponent functions are removed when you are using the program on polynomials .
Otherwise the GA may go down the wrong path and get stuck in a local minimum or converge too quickly .
Anyway , have fun playing with this demonstration .
Perhaps you will derive a new use for genetic algorithms in the world of mathematics in C# and .NET .
US officials believe bad news from Iraq gets undue coverage
The Pentagon said the move would boost its ability to counter " inaccurate " news stories and exploit new media .
Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said earlier this year the US was losing the propaganda war to its enemies .
On Monday , Vice - President Dick Cheney said insurgents had increased attacks in Iraq to sway the US mid-term polls .
The Bush administration does not believe the true picture of events in Iraq has been made public , the BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says .
The administration is particularly concerned that insurgents in areas such as Iraq have been able to use the web to disseminate their message and give the impression they are more powerful than the US , our correspondent says .
' Correcting messages '
The newly - established unit would use " new media " channels to push its message and " set the record straight " , Pentagon press secretary Eric Ruff said .
Al - Qaeda figures like Ayman al - Zawahri issue video messages
" We 're looking at being quicker to respond to breaking news , " he said .
" Being quicker to respond , frankly , to inaccurate statements . "
A Pentagon memo seen by the Associated Press news agency said the new unit would " develop messages " for the 24 - hour news cycle and aim to " correct the record " .
The unit would reportedly monitor media such as weblogs and would also employ " surrogates " , or top politicians or lobbyists who could be interviewed on TV and radio shows .
Mr Russ said the move to set up the unit had not been prompted either by the eroding public support in the US for the Iraq war or the US mid-term elections next week .
' War of ideas '
Mr Rumsfeld said earlier this year that he was concerned by the success of US enemies in " manipulating the media " .
" That 's the thing that keeps me up at night , " Mr Rumsfeld said .
On Monday , US Vice President Dick Cheney also made reference to the use of media , suggesting insurgents had increased their attacks and were checking the internet to keep track of American public opinion .
" It 's my belief that they 're very sensitive of the fact that we 've got an election scheduled and they can get on the websites like anybody else , " Mr Cheney told Fox News .
" There is n't anything that 's on the internet that 's not accessible to them .
They 're on it all the time .
They 're very sophisticated users of it . "
Mr Cheney 's comments came as American forces suffered one of the highest death tolls in October - more than 100 troops killed - since the war began in 2003 .
President Bush has said recently that terror groups were trying to influence public opinion in the US , describing their efforts as the " war of ideas " .
Democratic Candidates on the Price of Gas : I 'm Not Making This Up ! By Bryan Caplan
Democratic candidates were asked “ What would you do to reduce gas prices ? ”
Their answers , with one exception , should make any economist wince .
Here ’s Dodd , who leads with a long - winded complaint about foreign energy dependence and global warming , and ends with :
I ’ve introduced a plan here that would require a by the year 2017 50 miles per gallon standard for our automobiles …
And a carbon tax , in my view , so that you make the polluting dependencies , the polluting fuels , more expensive and encourage them through the use of revenues collected , to move aggressively on developing the alternative technologies …
So a carbon tax is going to cut the price of gas ?
When pressed , Dodd added :
When the price of a barrel of oil gets beyond $ 40 a barrel , where there ’s plenty of profit here , that those dollars ought to be returned to the consumers in a rebate or plowed back into the research that would allow us to develop alternative technologies .
So I guess Dodd ’s solution is jawboning ?
Next we move to Edwards , whose wants to make gas cheaper with a price - gouging witch - hunt , a cut in the oil subsidy , and stricter enforcement of clean air standards :
[ T ] here ought to be an investigation of the oil and gas companies by the Justice Department …
I think we need states to enforce clean air laws against these refineries .
… But in the short term , can America finally stop spending $ 3 billion a year of taxpayers ’ money subsidizing oil and gas companies that already make billions of dollars ?
Then there ’s Richardson , who ’s positively funny .
He recommends a price - gouging witch - hunt even though he doubts it ’s happening !
RICHARDSON : Well , I was energy secretary and my state — we call it the Clean Energy state .
We have incentives for solar , wind , biomass , biofuels .
We require renewable technologies , 20 percent of our electricity .
Here ’s my answer :
What would help in the short term , give us — the states — the authority to engage in serious price - gouging investigation .
That does n’t happen .
But this is not the answer .
The answer …
BLITZER : Do you believe they are ?
RICHARDSON : No , they ’re not .
The answer is this .
We need an Apollo program , Apollo , led by a president , asking every American to sacrifice , to conserve , that would reduce our dependence on foreign oil , which is 65 percent imported , to 10 .
Biden , finally , seconds those who want to cut the price of gas by cutting subsidies , launching a witch - hunt , and raising fuel economy standards .
Out of all the candidates who answered , only one gave an economically literate , honest answer : Gravel .
He bluntly explains that he wants to make gas more expensive by imposing a carbon tax :
Of course , that will raise the price of gasoline ; let ’s be candid about that .
There ’s nothing I would do as president to lower the price of gasoline right now .
Yes , Gravel wins the Democratic prize for economic literacy and honesty .
Is it any wonder that he ’s dead last in popularity ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Housing markets continued to slump across the nation in August as the number of existing homes sold dropped for the sixth straight month to their lowest level in five years , according to the latest report from the National Association of Realtors .
Sales fell 4.3 percent from July to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.50 million .
Sales have fallen 12.8 percent since last August 's pace of 6.31 million homes .
Lawrence Yun , senior economist for NAR , blamed the current credit crunch .
" The unusual disruptions in the mortgage market , including a significant rise in jumbo loan rates , resulted in a fairly high number of postponed or cancelled sales , with many buyers having to search for other financing when loan commitments fell through , " he said in a statement .
The slump pushed up the inventory glut to 4.58 million existing homes , an all - time high .
There is now a 10 - month supply of homes on the market at the present rate of sales .
More home price drops are coming
Some positive news from NAR was that prices broke a 12 - month decline .
The national median existing - home price for all housing types rose 0.2 percent to $ 224,500 in August from a year ago , when the median was $ 224,000 .
The report clashes with other sources that have reported falling prices for most of the nation .
The latest figures from the S&P / Case - Shiller index show prices fell between July 2006 and July 2007 in all 10 major housing markets covered by its main index .
The average decline was 4.5 percent .
Of the 20 - city Case - Shiller index , 15 cities suffered declines .
Foreclosures have soared during the past year , more than doubling since last year , according to RealtyTrac , a marketer of foreclosed properties , which has added to the glut of inventory of home listings .
With inventory at an all - time high , the 10 - month supply of homes has not been topped since May 1989 , according to Mike Larson , a real estate analyst with Weiss Research .
" The supply of homes goes up and up every month , " said Larson , who blamed much of the rise on listings put up by investors trying to get out from under unprofitable homes they bought during the boom .
" Sellers are still not being realistic about selling prices .
They have a false sense of the worth of their homes , " he said .
Owners who do not need to sell quickly are holding out for their asking prices .
That explains the contradictory trend of fairly stable prices but sharply lower sales numbers .
The slight August rise in the national median price " is not reflective of what has to happen to clear the books of inventory , " said Larson .
Motivated sellers , who need to sell quickly , have had a much harder time maintaining their asking prices .
According to Jonas Lee , of Redbrick Partners , a private equity firm that invests in residential real estate , motivated sellers in most parts of the nation are having to discount asking prices by 15 percent or more to move their properties within 90 days .
There could be even worse news coming , according to Larsen .
" The August numbers reflect contracts signed in June and July , still not the heart of the credit crunch , which happened in August , " he said .
" We 'll find out next month if the Fed cut will help turn the market around , " said Larson .
NAR reported that August existing - home sales in the West suffered more than any other region , dropping 9.8 percent from July and 21.7 percent from last year .
The median price in the West was $ 332,300 , 3.8 percent below a year ago .
In the Northeast , existing - home sales were off 2.0 percent from July and trailed last August by 5.7 percent .
The median price in the Northeast was $ 282,300 , up 3.6 percent from a year ago .
Sales in the South slowed by 2.7 percent from July and were 12.7 percent lower than August 2006 .
The median existing - home price in the South was $ 183,500 , down 0.7 percent from last year .
The Midwest showed a 5.2 percent drop from July to an annual rate of 1.28 million , and a 10.5 percent decline from a year ago .
The median price in the Midwest of $ 177,100 , was up 3.1 percent from August 2006 .

Kenneth Allen , a 70 - year - old truck driver from Georgia whose convoy was ambushed in Iraq , says he endures mood swings , jittery nerves and is often awake all night .
And Nathaniel Anderson , a Texan whose truck was hit by rockets while hauling jet fuel , lost a contractor friend to suicide .
Though suffering from stress - related symptoms himself , he has yet to see a doctor .
The toll of the war on contractors has largely been hidden from public view .
About 1,000 have died since the conflict began , and nearly 13,000 have been injured .
While some are well compensated , many more collect modest wages for providing support services that are vital to the military .
The federal government , which has paid billions of dollars to corporations for services in Iraq since the war began , has not examined the issue of mental health problems among private workers , according to Pentagon and Veterans Affairs officials .
“ To my knowledge , it has not been looked at systematically , ” said Dr. Matthew Friedman , a Veterans Affairs official who heads the national center for post - traumatic stress syndrome .
Contract workers who are wounded or disabled in the war zone are treated in military hospitals in Iraq and Germany , but once home , they are not eligible for care in the military or Veteran ’s Affairs system .
And unlike troops , they are not routinely evaluated for mental or stress disorders after their tours .
When soldiers and veterans complained in recent months of lapses in their care , top officials in Washington promised improvements , but the plight of troubled civilian workers has not captured such attention .
Many companies conduct pre-deployment psychological screening and offer limited counseling but provide few resources when their workers return home and often go off the payroll .
Employers are required by federal law to provide medical insurance for workers in a war zone .
Workers have filed about 205 claims for treatment of post - traumatic stress disorder , or PTSD , according to the Department of Labor , which monitors the data .
Industry officials say that number significantly underrepresents the problem because many troubled people do not file claims .
Of those who do , many have been denied coverage and filed lawsuits .
Gary Pitts , a Houston - based lawyer , says insurers have challenged almost every claim filed by about 50 clients , even though the insurance companies paid for medical care involving their physical injuries .

この論文が、論座という雑誌の1月号に掲載され大きな反響を呼んだ。私は、その論文自体は読んでなかったけど、あちこちのブログで取りあげられていたので、およその内容はだいたいわかっていて、その後の論議もある程度はフォローしていた。
先日公開された元の論文を読んでみて、赤木氏の主張やそれに対する反論の内容はだいたい予想通りだった。が、ひとつだけ現物を読んで初めてわかり、「あっ」と衝撃を受けたことがある。
それは、タイトルの 「『丸山眞男』をひっぱたきたい」が何を意味しているのかということ。
私は、こ の「丸山眞男」は何かの思想の象徴なのだと思っていた。赤木氏が批判している今の思想的状況の大元を作ったのが「丸山眞男」であり、現代の知識人を右も左もまとめて大枠で丸山の後継者であるとして、その思想を批判する為にこの人を象徴として「ひっぱたきたい」なのだと思っていた。
しかし、その予想は全く違っていて、実際は、もっと即物的な意味で「ひっぱたきたい」なのである。
苅部直氏の『丸山眞男――リベラリストの肖像』に興味深い記述がある。１９４４年３月、当時30歳の丸山眞男に召集令状が届く。かつて思想犯としての逮捕歴があった丸山は、陸軍二等兵として平壌へと送られた。そこで丸山は中学にも進んでいないであろう一等兵に執拗にイジメ抜かれたのだという。
戦争による徴兵は丸山にとってみれば、確かに不幸なことではあっただろう。しかし、それとは逆にその中学にも進んでいない一等兵にとっては、東大のエリートをイジメることができる機会など、戦争が起こらない限りはありえなかった。 丸山は「陸軍は海軍に比べ『擬似デモクラティック』だった」として、兵士の階級のみが序列を決めていたと述べているが、それは我々が暮らしている現状も同様ではないか。
社会に出た時期が人間の序列を決める擬似デモクラティックな社会の中で、一方的にイジメ抜かれる私たちにとっての戦争とは、現状をひっくり返して、「丸山眞男」の横っ面をひっぱたける立場にたてるかもしれないという、まさに希望の光なのだ。
「 丸山眞男」は思想の象徴なのではなく、赤木氏の上にたって彼を見下す人間全ての象徴だったのだ。そして、この固定された上下関係は戦争以外にはひっくり返す手段がない、というのが、赤木氏の実感なのである。
ちゃんと元の論文を読んで初めてそれを知ってすごく衝撃を受けた。同時に、私は恐怖を覚えた。
赤木さんにひっぱたかれる 「丸山眞男」とは自分のことじゃないか!
私は、赤木一等兵の前で、必死で言い訳している自分を想像した。「ちょ、ちょっと待ってくれ。俺は確かに正社員として定職についているけど、家族持ちでそんなに楽な思いはしてない。それにブログでいろいろ書いて社会の不正を批判してきた。だいたい、本当に悪いのは俺の上の世代であって‥‥」
それで、何故、自分がこの論文の一番重要なポイントを見落していたのか考えてみた。
基本的には、現物を読まずにネット上の二次情報に頼っていたからだ。これは現代の日本にとっては非常に重要なテーマだと思うが、個人的には技術者の自分にとって必ずしも最優先のテーマではない。だから、概要だけつかんで枝葉末節を逃してしまったとしても、コストパフォーマンスから言って仕方ない、自分にとっては許容すべき間違いだ。
問題は、枝葉末節をそこそこ把握していながら(それだけの優先度を与え、コストをかけているのに)、一番大事なタイトルの意味を逃してしまったことだ。
それは何故かと考えると、やはり、私が接した二次情報の中に、この部分に対する言及がなかったか、あってもあまり強調していなかったからだと思う。
こちらは、上記の元ネタに対する反論に対する赤木氏の再反論だ。これを見れば、ある程度は論座4月号に掲載された「反論」の概略がわかる。ここを見ても、やはり私が抱いたような感想を持った人はいないようである。
私は、ここに大きなすれ違いがあるように思う。
社会的経済的地位において、赤木氏と同等以下でない限り、読者は、赤木氏に「敵」と見なされていることを意識しながら、この論文を読むべきだと思う。「反論」している人たちの誰もが、そういう緊張感を持ってないように感じる。「私は君たちの仲間だ。話せばわかる」と気軽に言い過ぎてないか。
私は、 「丸山眞男」なんか一冊も読んでないから気楽に野次馬気分で丸山批判の論争を見物しようと思っていたが、そんな甘いものではなかった。私がひっぱたかれるべき「丸山眞男」なのであって、その認定は、どんなに努力してもどんなに論理的に説き伏せてもどんなに誠意を持って接しても覆ることがない。
これがこの論文の唯一の正しい読み方ではないかと私は思うが、そういうふうに読む人は少ないというかほとんどいないみたいので、私にはあまり自信がない。でも、やっぱり、そう読むべきだと思う。
街を歩けば、ホームレスの格好をした赤木氏が私をひっぱたく機会を狙っている。ネカフェに逃げこめば、ネカフェ難民の中で赤木が私を狙っている。たまらず会社に出社すれば、部下や出入り業者の中に赤木がいる。家に帰れば息子に扮した赤木が私を睨む。新聞を開けば、写真の中から赤木が私を狙っている。電車に乗れば野放図な若者の一群が全部実体は赤木でこちらを伺っている。それらの赤木は全員「お前が丸山眞男なのだ。戦争が起こってお前をひっぱける日まで私はお前を許さない」と言っている。どこに行ってもそこに赤木がいて、赤木から逃げる手段はない。
これくらいの緊張感を持って、赤木氏の言説には答えるべきだと思う。
赤木氏は敵ではあるが、敵との交渉は不可能ではない。しかし、敵との交渉は一触即発でちょっと間違えば常に戦争の危機を秘めている。いざという時には、敵を殲滅して自分が助かることも考えている必要がある。
私は、赤木氏との和解は不可能ではないと思うが、それはどんな戦争の中でも停戦が可能であると言うのと同じ意味だ。
そういう前提で、赤木氏の論文を社会分析として読むとしたら、私はこう読む。
「 普通の人が普通に働けば、普通に生活できる社会を構築するべきだ」と赤木氏は言うが、それは現代の経済の中では不可能だと思う
その不可能を可能と見せかける為に、社会のあちこちに無理があり、その犠牲が赤木氏の世代に集中していることには同感
弱者皺寄せの構造への指摘がことごとくスルーされるのは、
「普通の人が普通に働けば、普通に生活できる社会」が不可能になっていることを、多くの人が認めたくないから
具体的な策としてはベーシックインカムしかないと思う。「普通の人が普通に働けば、普通に生活できる社会」をあきらめれば、その財源は出現する。
それが嘘か本当か知らないが、とにかく私をひっぱたくのはやめてくれ

US Army denies ' gag orders , ' but says patients can ' go to Starbucks ' to talk to media Josh Catone
Published : Thursday March 1 , 2007 Print This Email This
The US Army is denying yesterday 's claims that some patients at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center 's Medical Hold Unit were told not to speak to the media .
Army spokesman Paul Boyce tells
Think Progress that patients are free to speak to the media ; however , they must receive permission to speak with the press while on hospital grounds .
When questioned further , Boyce told TP that if patients wished to speak to reporters without permission , " They can go to Starbucks . "
Think Progress writes , " Asked whether this was a reasonable solution for patients recuperating from physical and mental trauma , Boyce said yes .
' It 's just a short trip , and many of them want to get out [ of the hospital ] anyway . ' "
Meanwhile the Army Times reports today that the " Pentagon clamped down on media coverage of any and all Defense Department medical facilities , to include suspending queries for interviews and filming by CNN . "
An e-mail intended for spokespeople , titled " Media inquiries related to Walter Reed , " was quoted by the Times as saying , " It will be in most cases not appropriate to engage the media while this review takes place , " referring to an ongoing investigation of problems at the Walter Reed facility .
The Pentagon e-mail sparked a discussion on Capitol Hill , writes Kelly Kennedy at the Times , where Rep. Louise Slaughter ( D - NY ) issued a press release saying , " Any attempt to silence the very soldiers who brought their own mistreatment to light , or to hide ongoing abuses from the public eye  if such attempts are occurring  would be morally reprehensible .
" It would be an abdication , " she continues , " of one of the most fundamental responsibilities of our government : the protection of those who have fought to protect us . "
The quake destroyed roads and cut power supplies in southern Peru
Quake aftermath A powerful 7.9 magnitude earthquake has hit the coast of Peru , killing at least 337 people and injuring hundreds more , Peru 's civil defence institute says .
All but one of the deaths were in the coastal province of Ica , about 265 km ( 165 miles ) south of the capital , Lima .
In Lima , buildings shook violently during the prolonged tremors , prompting residents to take to the streets .
President Alan Garcia said he was sending three cabinet ministers to the worst affected area .
The earthquake struck at 1841 ( 2341 GMT ) on Wednesday and lasted for several minutes .
See map of the affected area
The US Geological Survey said the epicentre was beneath the Pacific Ocean , about 145 km ( 90 miles ) south - east of Lima .
Four strong aftershocks ranging from 5.4 to 5.9 followed , the organisation said .
Rush - hour traffic in Lima came to a halt as buildings shook with the force of the powerful tremors and hundreds of people spilled onto the streets .
In pictures : Peru quake Eyewitness accounts " Usually you do n't feel a tremor when outside , but the pavement was rippling , so I fled to the park where the ground continued to move under our feet , " a resident of Lima , Bronwyn Davis , told the BBC News website .
" What was even more frightening was the roar of the quake coupled with the sky lighting up .
It was surreal - if felt like we had stepped onto the set of some war movie . "
Berenice , another resident , said the earthquake was the strongest she had ever felt .
" For some it seemed like the end of the world , and most people I know are still nervous , " she said .
But the full devastating force of the earthquake was felt closer to the epicentre in the southern coastal province of Ica , where it brought down buildings , cut power supplies and disrupted communications .
Low - lying coastal areas in Peru , Chile , Ecuador and Colombia were evacuated after a tsunami alert was issued , but the warning was later withdrawn .
Church collapse Deputy Health Minister Jose Calderon described the situation in the city of Ica , where 650,000 people live , as " dramatic " .
The National Institute for Civil Defence said 336 people had been killed in the province and 827 others injured .
One person was killed in Lima .
How earthquakes happen Earthquake timeline TV reports said 17 people were killed and dozens injured when the Senor de Luren church in Ica collapsed during evening mass .
Callers to Radio Programas del Peru ( RPP ) said many homes in poor neighbourhoods in Ica and nearby Chincha had collapsed and that several cities had no electricity .
The town of Pisco , 60 km east of the epicentre , was also badly affected .
Hospitals are reported to be overwhelmed by the number of casualties .
A cameraman for the Associated Press said the floors of the hospital in Chincha were covered with dead bodies .
The mayor of Ica , Mariano Nacimiento , said he had asked the government for medicine , blankets , tents and all help that could be given .
The weather in the region is very cold at the moment .
Rescuers have struggled to reach Ica , however , as parts of the Pan - American Highway have been blocked by huge cracks in the tarmac and fallen power lines .
Unconfirmed reports said a bridge north of the city had collapsed .
State of emergency President Garcia thanked God that the earthquake had not caused " a catastrophe with an immense number of victims " .
In 1970 , a 7.9 - magnitude earthquake high in the Peruvian Andes triggered a landslide that buried the town of Yungay and killed 66,000 people .
" We have declared a state of emergency in Ica province and we are going this evening to ensure that regional and local governments , civil defence institutions and ministries can spend what they need to , rapidly and immediately , " Mr Garcia said .
The president ordered police onto the streets of Lima to keep order , and schools are being closed because the buildings may be unsafe .
In Lima 's poorer suburbs and shanty towns , news of the damage is still coming in , reports the BBC's Dan Collyns .
However , he says the feeling in the city , where one third of the population lives , is that it may have narrowly avoided a major disaster .

Yes , this picture is real .
It 's of a $ 1.5 million yacht falling off its sling while being loaded into a cargo ship for delivery in Dubai .
If you did n't notice , yes , there 's a dude going " oh shit " on the back of the boat as it goes down , to give you a sense of the size of the 55 - foot vessel ( he was fine ) .
Hit the jump for a sad view of the aftermath .

New Haven
LAST week , the luminaries of the British Muslim mainstream — lobbyists , lords and members of Parliament — published an open letter to Prime Minister Tony Blair , telling him that the “ debacle ” of both Iraq and Lebanon provides “ ammunition to extremists who threaten us all . ”
In increasingly antiwar America , a similar argument is gaining traction : The United States brutalizes Muslims , which in turn foments Islamist terror .
But violent jihadists have rarely needed foreign policy grievances to justify their hot heads .
There was no equivalent to the Iraq debacle in 1993 , when Islamists first tried to blow up the World Trade Center , or in 2000 , when they attacked the American destroyer Cole .
Indeed , that assault took place after United States - led military intervention saved thousands of Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo .
If Islamists cared about changing Iraq policy , they would not have bothered to abduct two journalists from France — probably the most antiwar , anti-Bush nation in the West .
Even overt solidarity with Iraqi suffering did not prevent Margaret Hassan , who ran a world - renowned relief agency in Baghdad , from being executed by insurgents .
Meanwhile , at least as many Muslims are dying at the hands of other Muslims as under the boots of any foreign imperial power .
In Sudan , black Muslims are starved , raped , enslaved and slaughtered by Arab militias , with the consent of an Islamic government .
Where is the “ official ” Muslim fury against that genocide ?
Do Muslim lives count only when snuffed out by non-Muslims ?
If not , then here is an idea for Muslim representatives in the West :
Go ahead and lecture the politicians that their foreign policies give succor to radicals .
At the same time , however , challenge the educated and angry young Muslims to hold their own accountable , too .
The firm 's Dairy Milk bars were removed from UK shelves
More than one million chocolate bars were recalled in the UK after salmonella was found in some products between January and March 2006 .
The charges on Tuesday related to conditions at the company 's Marlbrook site near Leominster in Herefordshire .
The case at Hereford Magistrates ' Court was adjourned for sentencing at Crown Court in Birmingham on 13 July .
Last month , Cadbury said pleaded guilty at Birmingham Magistrates '
Court to three offences under food and hygiene regulations in connection with a salmonella scare that led to the recall of the chocolate bars .
' Regret lapses '
On Tuesday the company admitted charges relating to the state of a drainage pipe , a roof vent , the layout of the factory and drainage and disinfection equipment .
The company has said the bill for dealing with the contamination may reach £ 30 m .
Birmingham City Council , which alleged the firm put " unsafe " chocolate on the market for a period in 2006 , is responsible for enforcing health and safety laws at Cadbury 's plant in Bournville .
In a statement Cadbury said the company did not " sufficiently review and update certain aspects of production to meet the changing requirements of best practice . "
" We sincerely regret these lapses and are focused on ensuring that this can never happen again , " the spokesman added .
A review of quality and health and safety procedures has since taken place .
Etiquette Of A Gentleman
The True Marks Of A Gentleman
Page 2 of 2
Make Others Feel Like
They ’re the Center of Attention
Watch your Mouth
Remove Your Hat Indoors
Wait For Others to Get Their Food Before Eating
When You 're With A Woman
Outdated Etiquette
Most gatherings , be they social or professional , include a diverse cast of characters .
Wallflowers , attention hogs and social butterflies are all to be expected .
Regardless of who you ’re talking to , you want them to leave feeling like the conversation they had with you was the most rewarding one they ’ve had all day .
You should neither marginalize a quiet type by overpowering him , nor should you try to belittle a big talker through feigned apathy .
Whoever you ’re talking to , engage them .
Listen .
Ask intelligent questions .
Even if you ’d rather wipe your ass with poison ivy than discuss the topic at hand , 30 seconds of engagement will earn you far more goodwill than five minutes of eye rolling .
Speaking of wiping your ass ... There ’s nothing wrong with a little cursing here and there , and there ’s nothing ungentlemanly about it , provided the context is right .
If you ’re with your friends or even slightly more mixed company , a swear word wo n’t kill anyone .
But in the wrong setting , telling an off - color joke , however funny it may be to you , is n’t going to go over so well with the black , Jewish double - amputee you did n’t notice in the corner who happened to be the punchline of your oddly specific joke .
In an instant , you ’ll go from being the life of the party to a member of the untouchable caste .
It ’s fine to call Aaron Rodgers a “ f*cking jackass ” ( because he is ) when you invite your college buddies over to your house to watch football .
It ’s not so fine when your boss invites you over to his .
Yes , this is an old one , but a good one .
If you ’re going someplace and you ’ll be staying a while , take your hat off .
It just shows a little respect for the establishment you ’re entering .
Do n’t want to because your hair will get messed up ?
Too bad — in that case , you should n’t have worn a hat .
This is n’t the 1950s , and a hat is no longer a de facto part of a man ’s wardrobe .
If it ’s the dead of winter and you ’re wearing a beanie or ski cap for warmth , do n’t worry about it .
Everyone else ’s hair will look just as bad .
If you ’re out for a meal with a group , the gentlemanly thing to do is to wait for all parties to get their food before digging in .
You do n’t want to be the one guy shoveling food in his face while others are still conversing .
Plus you ’ll finish before everyone else and have to sit in silence while they finish .
Speaking of which , take small bites .
It ’ll help your meal last longer , and you never know when you might want to jump into the conversation .
The exception :
If there are more than six of you , go ahead and eat .
There ’s no need to make others feel like they ’re forcing you to let your food get cold while the waitstaff brings out eight more plates .
While some things have fallen out of fashion , other stalwarts of the gentleman ’s code are just as applicable today as they ever were .
Let ’s take a look .
While it ’s always a good idea to stand when being introduced , standing just because of a woman ’s presence will come off as weird to most women .
And , admit it , it kind of is .
- Offering your seat at a dinner table :
If your host is expecting a party of a certain number , it ’s up to the host or the restaurant to ensure there are enough seats .
If an unexpected female guest shows up , well that probably means the host did n’t want her there anyway .
Besides , you know what ’s not gentlemanly ?
Awkwardly hovering over a table of seated guests after you gave up your chair to an uninvited diner .
- Helping her with her coat :
This , on its own , is a fine idea .
It ’s a great gesture and it ’s really adorable to see , say , a married couple doing this .
However , if this is early in the dating game , she may not want you touching her stuff , and in all likelihood she wo n’t know what you ’re trying to do .
As important as it is to be gallant and kind , it ’s even more important to make sure your date does n’t feel like an idiot .
- Helping her with her chair : Again , nothing wrong with the gesture itself .
It ’s just another one of those things that women are n’t accustomed to anymore .
Besides , at a decent place the host or waitstaff usually assists with this .
Etiquette She Appreciates
Do n’t worry about coming off as misogynistic or insensitive to her capabilities as a human being .
Everyone appreciates a little hand .
However , do n’t make a show out of running ahead to reach the door before she does ( unless she ’s carrying something ) .
In that case , simply reach over her and assist her with opening the door .
Remember , she can open it herself .
It ’s the thought that counts .
Reaching for the check :
This has been discussed ad nauseum here and elsewhere , and , yes , you should still do it .
If she fights you or insists on splitting it , then let her have it .
Otherwise , grab it , put your card in , and do n’t say any more about it .
Of course , if she ’s arranged a date with the intention of taking you out on the town , by all means respect her gesture .
- Opening the car door : Provided you ’re parked on the same side of the street as the place you ’re leaving , this takes zero time or effort and reflects well on you as a gentleman .
However , like with holding entry doors , do n’t make a show of running around to the other side of the car if you ’re parked in the other direction .
If a gesture requires obvious effort and expense , it goes from being gallant to buffoonish .
- Entering a cab first : Counterintuitive , but if your lady friend is wearing a skirt or dress , it ’s a lot easier for her to not have to scoot all the way over to the driver ’s side .
- Walking on the curb - side of the street : Truthfully , if a runaway city bus careens over the curb and heads in your direction , it does n’t matter much what side of the street you ’re on .
But , still , the gesture is of you putting yourself between wayward vehicles and splashed puddles .
She may not even notice you ’re doing it ( my wife never does ) , but it costs you nothing .
- Offering her your arm :
If you ’re on a first date , this could be a little dicey , so play it by ear .
Look at it this way — if you offer her your arm and she takes it , that means she likes you ( at least to some degree ) .
Otherwise , it ’s a classy , understated alternative to holding hands , and I ca n’t think of a woman who does n’t want to be seen walking arm - in - arm with her man .
Being a modern gentleman does n’t have to be hard , and , in fact , it ’s easier than ever .
It ’s all about self - awareness and consideration for those around you .
Those never go out of style .
We of “ Cardinal Nation ” here in St. Louis suffered the loss of relief pitcher Josh Hancock this last weekend .
In case you have n’t heard , he was killed when he crashed his SUV full - speed into the back of a tow - truck on the highway .
The tow truck was stopped , lights blazing in the dark , assisting a disabled motorist in the left lane .
Only a few nights earlier , Mr. Hancock had crashed his car , walking away from that late - night accident unharmed but reporting to the ballpark late the next day due to having overslept .
Hmmmm .
Does anyone else see something fishy going on here ?
Single 29 - yr.- old athlete crashing his car late at night . . . . twice in one week .
We in Cardinal Nation are also being cautioned against jumping to any conclusions , even though several witnesses reported seeing the deceased drinking shortly before the accident , including one person who said that he could n’t put sentences together and a bartender who offered to call him a cab , but he refused to accept that offer .
We are being chastised for even mentioning that perhaps this was something more dastardly than a tragic accident .
While I understand that nothing about the circumstances of the accident can change the fact that this is a horrific loss for the team and for Hancock ’s family and friends , I ca n’t imagine that anyone will be remotely surprised when the autopsy results show his blood alcohol content to far exceed the legal limit .
Less than two years ago , someone very close to me was in an eerily similar accident .
He was speeding down the highway late at night and rammed into the back of a car stopped because of another accident .
Fortunately , no one was seriously hurt .
He suffered cuts and bruises , some seriously wounded pride , a vicious hangover , the aggravation of a totalled vehicle and not a small amount of public humiliation , as he is also a fairly well - known person in our fair city .
As he should have , because what he did was insanely stupid .
I know all too well what he risked .
I know who would have been most harmed by his actions had we not quickly taken my children out of town so they would n’t witness any aspect of the media circus .
He , being the father of said children , risked our family in ways for which I still probably have n’t completely forgiven him .
But he worked hard to turn himself around , and for that I give him full credit .
He made a serious error in judgment , and thankfully he learned from his mistake .
Sadly , Josh Hancock wo n’t have that chance .
His young life vanished in one incredibly stupid move .
Take the cab , Josh !!!
For God ’s sake , why did n’t you take the cab ???
Because he was impaired .
He drank too much to think clearly .
( Nope , not starting a rumor , just stating what we all know is going to be proven to be true ) .
But he was a Cardinal , so he got served .
He was a Cardinal , so no one said , NO , Josh , you may not drive .
Give us your keys , Josh .
Dammit , I do n’t care if you think you can drive , you ca n’t even focus your eyes .
We ’ll take care of your car .
No , Mr. Hancock , I ’m sorry , we ca n’t let you leave in your condition unless we see you get in someone else ’s car .
We served you this alcohol , but we can not let you drive now that you ’ve consumed it .
I ’m all about personal responsibility , folks , but c’mon .
When are we going to take care of each other when it really matters ?
How did all these friends and acquaintances and employees of Mike Shannon ’s , where he was partying , see him drunk , know he was drunk , and STILL let him get in a car by himself and drive away ?
Was not one single person there sober enough to say – STOP ?
As for all of those so quick to jump to his defense and insist we not besmirch his memory with this talk of drunk driving , I ask you this .
Do you really think Josh would mind if we used him as an example ?
Do n’t you bet , if given his druthers , he ’d choose to be stopped and stripped of his keys instead of winding up dead ?
Do n’t you think he ’d say , “ You damned well better use me as example – I know now how stupid it was , and I sure as hell do n’t want this to ever happen to anyone else .
Hold me up as the ugly picture of what happens when decent people make really lousy choices , and do everything in your power not to let this happen to anyone else ’s son or daughter .
I ’m so , so sorry . ”
Let ’s pay attention this time .
Joyeux Noel ( Widescreen ) Best Price : $ 2.58 Buy New $ 9.99 ( as of 12:30 EST - Details )
I have grown weary of the war - lovers taking over every holiday and exploiting them for their own deadly ambitions .
Turning July 4th into a celebration of militaristic statism ( see the old Bing Crosby musical Holiday Inn ) was bad enough .
But then seeing a Santa Claus in a flag - draped Uncle Sam suit on a Christmas card a couple years ago was simply too much .
Paths of Glory Best Price : $ 6.94 Buy New $ 10.49 ( as of 09:15 EST - Details )
Memorial Day is one holiday on which I often hold an u201CAnti-War Film Festival , u201D inviting a few friends — who , being friends of mine , have no need to be reminded of the evils of warfare — to watch what I consider the best of the films that bring war into disrepute .
Instead of going out to a cemetery to join an u201 Chonor guardu201D gang to play taps and fire their rifles to celebrate the deaths of victims of warfare , I suggest such an anti-war film festival for your own consideration .
Some of the films I find most effective are the following ( with the number of * [ 1— 3 ] reflecting my opinion as to importance ) :
*** Joyeux Noel — a recent film depicting an actual pause in battle — on Christmas Eve — during World War I. French , German , and British soldiers met in a u201C no - man ’s - landu201D to exchange candy and cigarettes , converse , and even play an abbreviated game of soccer .
*** The King of Hearts — an Alan Bates film , set in World War I , in which a soldier , Bates , is sent into a French town to check things out , not being aware that the inhabitants had left the town , and residents of the local mental asylum had taken their places .
Very good comedy .
** Paths of Glory — A Kirk Douglas film .
A general sends his men on a suicide mission .
When the mission fails , a few soldiers are arbitrarily selected to be tried — and executed — for cowardice .
M*A* S*H ( Two - Disc Coll ... Best Price : $ 2.32 Buy New $ 8.97 ( as of 05:20 EST - Details )
* M*A* S*H — anyone not familiar with this comedic dark look at war — the Korean being the one in question — has probably been out in the desert too long .
*** Oh !
What a Lovely War — a British musical comedy ( it originated as a stage show ) set in World War I .
The ending scene , in particular , will bring tears to the eyes of those who abhor the systematic killing of people .
One of my all - time favorites !
All Quiet on the Weste ... Best Price : $ 3.23 Buy New $ 5.37 ( as of 01:05 EST - Details )
** Johnny Got His Gun — a Dalton Trumbo film , set in World War I , from the perspective of an all - but - dead wounded soldier .
The darkest of the films I ’m recommending .
* The Mouse That Roared — the Peter Sellers classic about a European duchy that figures the best way out of its financial difficulties is to wage war on America , and then receive post - war foreign aid .
** All Quiet on the Western Front — won the Oscar ( 1930 ) for best film and best director .
A very good anti-war film — from the perspective of some young Germans .
I particularly like it because it stars one of the few real heroes from Hollywood , Lew Ayres , who refused to be conscripted into the army during World War II , a decision that virtually ruined his Hollywood career .
While on the topic of u201 Cheroes , u201D I would exclude any and all war films by John Wayne who , more than anyone else , helped Hollywood glorify wartime butchery , even as he managed to keep himself out of the war .
Sound like any presidents ?
* Apocalypse Now — an excellent Vietnam war era film with dark and dark - side overtones .
Slaughterhouse - Five Best Price : $ 4.86 Buy New $ 8.79 ( as of 11:15 EST - Details )
** The Deer Hunter — a powerful , not for the squeamish , look at the Vietnam war .
It won an Oscar ( 1978 ) for best picture , and for best supporting actor ( Christopher Walken ) .
** Gallipoli — a film by one of my favorite directors , Peter Weir .
It takes place in World War I , and does a moving job of showing the disillusionment of young men caught up in the ersatz u201Cglory u201D of war .
*** Shenandoah — the best anti-war film with a consistent libertarian message .
Jimmy Stewart plays a Virginia farmer — with a large family — who has no use for the Civil War and its intrusions upon his property .
When I first sat through this film over 40 years ago , I kept waiting for Stewart to cave in and see the errors of his ways .
He never does .
Some wonderful lines that you ’ll not soon forget .
One of the very few films that later became a stage play .
If you have n’t seen this one , where have you been ?
Dr. Strangelove or How ... Best Price : $ 2.07 Buy New $ 8.69 ( as of 12:55 EST - Details )
** Catch - 22 — the film adaptation of Joseph Heller ’s treatment of the u201Cnormalu201D insanity of the war system , based on his own war - time experiences .
** Slaughterhouse - Five — Kurt Vonnegut ’s offering of the same basic theme of the normalcy of institutionalized insanity , from the perspective of a soldier .
I once saw a lengthy interview ( on C - SPAN , as I recall ) of Heller and Vonnegut together .
Vonnegut related a conversation he had had with a friend on a troop - ship coming back from Europe .
Vonnegut asked his friend : u201 C what did you learn from all of this ?, u201D to which the other man replied : u201 Cnever to believe your own government .
u201D
** Dr. Strangelove — another Peter Sellers offering that involves an Air Force general who decides to start a war with the Soviet Union .
As with The Mouse That Roared , Sellers plays a number of roles .
A film that ages well with time .
The Quiet American Best Price : $ 0.99 Buy New $ 5.77 ( as of 03:05 EST - Details )
*** Wag the Dog — for those who reject , out of hand , the idea that political conspiracies exist — unless , of course , one is talking about conspiracies perpetrated by u201 Cbad guysu201D — this film may prove either troublesome or enlightening .
In an age when the best way to satirize something is to make a factual report of same , this film of a contrived war engineered to enliven a presidential reelection campaign , has all the ring of a documentary .
A u201 Cmustu201D for any modern film festival .
** The Quiet American [ 2002 version ] — the adaptation of Graham Greene ’s novel deals with the behind - the - scenes manipulations that led to America ’s involvement in the Vietnam war .
Do n’t waste your time with the 1958 version , which treats Greene ’s novel as a murder mystery , not a political intrigue .
*** Aftermath : The Remnants of War — one of the most powerful of all anti-war films , particularly since it does n’t show any battle scenes .
It is a documentary , produced by the Canadian Film Board , of the various messes that the war system leaves to the rest of mankind to deal with decades after the wars have ended ( e.g. , unexploded munitions from World Wars I and II that continue to kill French farmers each year ) .
Children of Men Best Price : $ 1.40 Buy New $ 2.95 ( as of 11:30 EST - Details )
*** The Americanization of Emily — I have saved my favorite anti-war film for last .
This James Garner / Julie Andrews picture is quite good .
The most powerful portion of it is the garden scene , in which Garner and Andrews are talking with Andrews ’ mother about war .
Garner ’s impassioned soliloquy on the nature of war — with emphasis on the wives and mothers who keep the bloodbaths going by honoring them — packs more wallop than just about any other film .
Garner ends up declaring that it will be cowards — such as himself — who will save the world .
Why We Fight Best Price : $ 1.17 Buy New $ 4.00 ( as of 06:55 EST - Details )
*** Why We Fight .
A powerful documentary — in which Karen Kwiatkowski , Chalmers Johnson , and Gore Vidal carry most of the intellectual load — on the nature and history of the post — World War II American war - making system .
It won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival .
WARNING !
Do not confuse this with the pro-war series of the same name , produced during World War II by one of my un-favorite directors , Frank Capra .
Three Kings Best Price : $ 1.51 Buy New $ 2.99 ( as of 11:35 EST - Details )
*** Children of Men .
A futuristic film set in an Orwellian England , where endless wars against endless enemies have become the norm .
Throughout the world , most women have become infertile , threatening the extinction of the human species .
A woman has become pregnant , and most of the film is taken up with trying to get her to a country that would harbor her and her unborn child .
This is a very dark and violent film — someone is always in the process of killing others , bombing buildings , etc .
What is encouraging , however , is that none of the warring factions are presented as u201 Cgoodu201D guys fighting the u201 C badu201D guys .
It is the anti-life nature of the war system itself — with mankind as the endangered species — that dominates the movie .
*** Breaker Morant .
A couple readers could n’t understand why I did n’t include this Australian film on my list .
I must admit that I considered it but , perhaps because a similar theme had been presented in the Paths of Glory film I had recommended , I left it off the list .
Upon reflection , I think the readers had better judgment than I on this one .
Breaker Morant Best Price : $ 29.60 Buy New $ 59.98 ( as of 01:05 EST - Details )
It is the story of Australian soldiers — during the Boer War — against whom phony murder charges are made in order to facilitate the political machinations of bringing the war to an end .
It illustrates , quite well , how soldiers — treated by the state as nothing more than fungible resources for its exploitation — can be sacrificed both on and off the battlefield .
* Three Kings .
Set in the first Gulf War , there is an abundance of the blood - bath that defines every war .
What is of particular interest in this film , however , is the impact war has on the non-combatant refugees .
A very nice ending from their perspective .
** Platoon and ** Full Metal Jacket .
These are potent films providing a soldier ’s perspective on the dehumanizing , life - destroying nature of war .
As one who believes that the gore and broken bodies of those killed in wars should be regularly shown on television — so that the Sean Hannity ’s , the Rush Limbaugh ’s , the Bill O’Reilly ’s , et al. , can get a snootful of the system they so adore — these films provide a good secondary source .
Platoon won an Oscar for u201 Cbest film .

This movie deals more with the underbelly of post — Cold War arms - trafficking than with wars themselves ( although there is plenty of blood - letting for any pro-war vampires ) .
Pay attention to the credits following the film .
They inform us that the five largest nations involved in selling arms to the rest of the world , are also the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council !
** A Very Long Engagement .
Perhaps , as a motion picture production , this is artistically the best film of all I have recommended .
While set in wartime ( World War I ) , with plenty of battlefield insanity , it is essentially a love story involving a young woman intent on finding her fianc — is he alive or dead ? — after the war .
There is also a very interesting character ; a prostitute bent on revenge against corrupt military officers .
The Battle of Algiers ... Best Price : $ 4.57 Buy New $ 34.95 ( as of 12:05 EST - Details )
** The Battle of Algiers .
A 1965 film done in a pseudo - documentary style , it dramatizes the decade - long struggle of Algerians against their French occupiers .
This motion picture affords viewers insights into the current responses of Iraqis to their American occupiers .
** Duck Soup .
The Marx Brothers slapstick assault on the war system , with Groucho — as Freedonia ’s prime minister — declaring war on a neighboring country for no apparent reason .
My favorite line in the film is when , in the course of battle , Groucho tells the others that they are fighting for ( Margaret Dumont ’s ) u201 Chonor : which is probably more than she ever did.u201D
** Hearts and Minds .
Won an Oscar for best documentary .
It deals with the events and machinations that led to the Vietnam War .
No clearer example of the hypocrisy of the United States ’ alleged efforts to bring u201Cfreedomu201D to Southeast Asia is found than in the effort of the federal government to have this film formally censored so that Americans could not learn what their u201 Crepresentativeu201D thugs had been up to .
Grand Illusion : Essent ... Best Price : $ 14.99 Buy New $ 56.33 ( as of 01:25 EST - Details )
** Grand Illusion .
A 1937 film by director Jean Renoir .
I saw this motion picture so many years ago that it simply slipped my mind in writing my first article .
An anti-war film focusing on the futility of the war system .
That the German government tried to destroy this film when it first came out , provides some evidence of its importance .
Das Boot - The Origina ... Best Price : $ 2.37 Buy New $ 35.89 ( as of 12:30 EST - Details )
** Das Boot and ** Letters From Iwo Jima .
Two films that address the horrors of warfare from the perspectives of those on the u201Cotheru201D side , the first Germans , the second Japanese .
The latter is Clint Eastwood ’s highly - praised picture .
There are a number of other films readers recommended , some of which I have seen , some I have not .
These include The Lives of Others ; Downfall ; Kelly ’s Heroes ; The Ground Truth ; Iraq for Sale : The War Profiteers ; When I Came Home ; Come and See ; No Man ’s Land ; Born on the Fourth of July ; The Razor ’s Edge ( 1984 version ) ; Coming Home ; and A Midnight Clear .
The latter film was reviewed at length by Rick Gee .
There are two documentaries that have just recently appeared : from u201CBill Moyers Journalu201D Buying the War .
The other is titled SPIN : The Art of Selling War .
They each examine the role of the media in helping the state promote its war efforts .
I have seen the former film , but not the latter .
Should you decide to conduct your own Anti-War Film Festival this forthcoming Memorial Day weekend , you might be interested in including a recitation of one of the most powerful anti-war poems : Mark Twain ’s The War Prayer .
The Best of Butler Shaffer
Many people believe the US will stay in Iraq permanently
Some 39 % of people in 22 countries said troops should leave now , and 28 % backed a gradual pull - out .
Just 23 % wanted them to stay until Iraq was safe .
In the US , one - in - four supported an immediate withdrawal , while 32 % wanted Iraq 's security issues to be resolved before bringing the troops home .
The BBC World Service commissioned the survey of 23,193 people .
In 19 countries , the majority of those questioned believed troops should be withdrawn either immediately or within a year .
Just three countries - Kenya , the Philippines and India - did not have an overall majority favouring withdrawal within a year .
Large numbers of people questioned in India ( 36 % ) declined to comment or said they " did n't know " .
Muslim countries including Indonesia ( 65 % ) , Turkey ( 64 % ) and Egypt ( 58 % ) were among those most eager for troops to be withdrawn immediately .
But an immediate pull - out was much less popular in Australia ( 22 % ) , the US ( 24 % ) and UK ( 27 % ) - the countries with most troops deployed in Iraq .
Troop cuts
The top US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , is considering withdrawing about 4,000 troops starting in January , media reports say .

Officials say Gen Petraeus will discuss possible further troop cuts to be made in 2008 , when he presents his assessment of US military strategy in Iraq to Congress next week .
There are a record 168,000 US troops in Iraq , including 30,000 additional soldiers deployed as part of the " surge " .
The US completed the introduction of 30,000 more troops in Iraq in mid-June .
' Permanent presence '
An Iraqi minister said the most vital need is help from Iraq 's neighbours .
" Getting out of Iraq now probably the situation will be worsened ; but , if our neighbouring countries ceased involving themselves in Iraq , probably the situation will be improved definitely , " Education Minister Abid Dhyab al - Ajili told the BBC .
" So it depends on our neighbouring countries .
Definitely I feel , if the American troops pulled out of Iraq , I think the situation will be improved in the long term . "
In recent days , leaders from the US , Australia and the UK have said troops must stay in Iraq until the country is safe .
All three countries say they have a commitment to the Iraqi people to remain there until local forces are able to ensure their security .
But Doug Miller of Globescan , which carried out the research , said the results of the survey showed " the weight of global public opinion " was against them .
The respondents were also asked whether they believed the US would leave a permanent military presence in Iraq .
Half of those questioned believed the US would have bases in Iraq permanently , while 36 % assumed all troops would withdraw once Iraq was stabilised .
The findings suggest support for keeping foreign troops in Iraq until security has improved has fallen significantly since an earlier World Service poll released in February 2006 .
The BBC 's world affairs correspondent , Nick Childs , says it is not surprising , more than four years on from a controversial invasion , that international public opinion on the foreign troop presence should now be so negative .
He added that the Bush administration has been battling perceptions that its aim has been to establish a permanent military presence in Iraq as part of a regional strategy - something it has denied .
Today Senator John Kerry joined the effort to save Net Neutrality by delivering a letter to FCC Chairman , Kevin Martin , in which Kerry stated :
" Nearly 60 % of the country does not subscribe to broadband service â€ ” in large measure because it is either unavailable or unaffordable ...
For years , we have heard that a third technology would emerge to compete head - to - head with DSL and cable modem .
It has not yet materialized , and today Americans pay as much as 10 times more than broadband consumers in Asia and Europe .
Worse still , competition has been insufficient to drive the innovation that brings faster speeds , next generation application and a richer , diverse and multifaceted Internet . "
There is no time to waste .
We must ACT NOW if we want to protect Net Neutrality .
Tell your story to the FCC about why Net Neutrality must be saved .
We must act by June 15th !!
Go to SavetheInternet.com and make your voice heard .
I did .
Here 's my story :
http://www.savetheinternet.com/yourstory/284384
Each day this nation divides further between the â€œhavesâ€  and â€œhave - nots.â€ 
The â€œhaves , â€ those with wealth , can purchase public forums .
They can â€œbuy a voiceâ€ on television , radio , in newspapers and magazines to spread their message and impose their influence over the â€œhave - nots.â€ 
The â€œhave - nots , â€ absent purchase power , cannot buy expensive media time to counter the â€œhaveâ€ ™sâ€ political , religious and social spin .
Thus Democracy is thwarted and information is unbalanced and skewed .
At this most critical time in America , when its Democracy is coming unhinged , The Internet has been an equal source of information for ALL .
It is the ONE place in America where equality reigns supreme .
And as the digital divide continues to close , The Internet becomes a greater equalizer daily .
Net Neutrality is essential to free speech , equal opportunity and economic innovation in America .
Since the FCC removed this basic protection in 2005 , the top executives of phone and cable companies have stated their intention to become the Internetâ€™s gatekeepers and to discriminate against Web sites that donâ€™t pay their added tolls .
The FCC must ensure that broadband providers do not block , interfere with or discriminate against any lawful Internet traffic based on its ownership , source or destination .
The FCC must ensure that access to information from any source remains equally accessible to ALL , regardless of personal wealth and power .
SAVE NET NEUTRALITY !
Equalize the public square .
Permit the free - flow of information to educate and communicate .
Save our nation from advancing the power of the few and silencing the many .
Go to SaveTheInternet.com if you have n't done so already .
And be sure to spread the word .

As head of McDonald ’s restaurants in his native France in the late 1990s , Mr. Hennequin had searched for ways to make fast food more appealing to a nation that prefers slow - simmered cassoulets and likes to savor a meal .
“ To make McDonald ’s and a Big Mac work in the country of slow food , we felt we had to pay more attention to space and showcasing , ” said Mr. Hennequin , seated in front of zebra print wallpaper in one of the remodeled London restaurants .
He was right .
After refurbishment , on average , sales increased 4.5 percent at the upgraded restaurants in France .
The new outlets were so successful that two years ago Mr. Hennequin was asked to do the same for the rest of Europe .
But now the success of his makeovers comes with a challenge of its own :
How much can you upgrade the image before McDonald ’s is n’t McDonald ’s anymore ?
“ If you stretch the brand too much it can snap , ” said Dean Crutchfield , director of marketing at the brand consultancy Wolff Olins in New York .
Image A McDonalds in central London includes chairs that are not typically found in the chains restaurants in the United States .
Credit ... Steve Forrest for The New York Times
Mr. Hennequin said he did not have a choice .
“ Reimaging is essential in the competitive world of retail , ” he said .
“ We need to avoid aging faster than our customers . ”
To do that he instructed the design studio he had set up in Paris to come up with nine different designs .
Franchised restaurants , which account for about 64 percent of all European outlets , can then choose the design most appropriate for their location and clientele .

University of Colorado police are investigating a series of threatening messages and documents e-mailed to and slipped under the door of evolutionary biology labs on the Boulder campus .
The messages included the name of a religious - themed group and addressed the debate between evolution and creationism , CU police Cmdr. Brad Wiesley said .
Wiesley would not identify the group named because police are still investigating .
“ There were no overt threats to anybody specifically by name , ” Wiesley said .
“ It basically said anybody who does n’t believe in our religious belief is wrong and should be taken care of . ”
The first threat was e-mailed to the labs – part of CU ’s ecology and evolutionary biology department housed in the Ramaley Biology building – on Friday .
Wiesley said Monday that morning staff members found envelopes with the threatening documents slipped under the lab doors .
Wiesley said police will have increased patrols in and around CU science buildings .
“ What ’s written on paper is what ’s written on paper , ” Wiesley said .
“ One of the question marks here is who wrote it and who delivered it . ”
AN INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICAL COMPUTING IN R
John Fox
( Department of Sociology , McMaster University )
California Center for Population Research
UCLA
February 2005
The statistical programming language and computing environment S has become the de-facto standard among statisticians .
The S language has two major implementations : the commercial product S - PLUS , and the free , open - source R. Both are available for Windows and Unix / Linux systems ; R , in addition , runs on Macintoshes .
This one - day workshop introduces R .
A statistical package , such as SPSS , is primarily oriented toward combining instructions with rectangular case - by - variable datasets to produce ( often voluminous ) printouts .
Such packages make routine data analysis relatively easy , but they make it relatively difficult to do things that are innovative or nonstandard , or to add to the built - in capabilities of the package .
In contrast , a good statistical computing environment also makes routine data analysis easy , but it additionally supports convenient programming ; this means that users can extend the already impressive facilities of R. Statisticians have taken advantage of the extensibility of R to contribute literally hundreds of freely available " packages " of R programs ( called " library sections " or just " libraries " in S - PLUS ) .
As well , R is especially capable in the area of statistical graphics , reflecting the origin of S at Bell Labs , a centre of graphical innovation .
The purpose of this workshop is to provide a quick introduction to R and to show you how to accomplish a variety of tasks , including ( time permitting ) the tasks of writing basic programs and constructing nonstandard graphs .
The statistical content is largely assumed known .
Topics
CD / ROM and Acquiring R
I 've created a CD / ROM with the installer for the Windows version of R , Windows binaries for all of the contributed packages on the Comprehensive R Archive Network ( CRAN ) web site , along with a pre-installed " live " version of R , which can be run directly from the CD , and the free Tinn - R programming editor .
You can download an ISO image of the CD from this web site , and then burn it onto a CD .
Note that this is a large file ( about 270 MB ) , and that an alternative is to download the much smaller R Windows installer directly ; then double - click on the installer to install R as you would any Windows software .
You can subsequently download and install only those packages that you want over the Internet from CRAN , via the Packages Install packages from CRAN menu in the RGui console .
Likewise , the small installer for Tinn - R can also be downloaded directly .
Additional information about obtaining , installing , and configuring R is available on the web site for my R and S - PLUS Companion to Applied Regression .
SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY
Basic Text
There is , of course , no " text " for the workshop , but the workshop content is largely drawn from J. Fox , An R and S - PLUS Companion to Applied Regression , Sage , 2002 .
Additional materials are available on the web site for the book , including several appendices ( on structural - equation models , mixed models , survival analysis , etc. ) ; scripts for the examples in all of the chapters and appendices ; information on acquiring and installing R ; and more .
The book is associated with the car package for R ( and S - PLUS ) .
Alternatively ( or additionally ) , those with more advanced backgrounds in statistics may wish to read W. N. Venables and B. D. Ripley , Modern Applied Statistics with S as their principal source .
Manuals
R is distributed with a set of manuals , which are also available at the CRAN web site .
A manual for S - PLUS Trellis Graphics ( also useful for the lattice package in R ) is at also available on the web .

BAGHDAD , Wednesday , Aug. 29  An Iranian Energy Ministry delegation was arrested by American troops at a hotel in central Baghdad during an official visit to Iraq , the Iranian state news agency , IRNA , and hotel staff said Tuesday night .
American forces confirmed that a group of Iranians was detained after coalition forces searched them and their Iraqi escorts at a checkpoint , found unauthorized weapons in their vehicles and confiscated them .
The American statement did not mention the hotel , but it is near the checkpoint on the east bank of the Tigris where United States forces said the group was stopped and searched .
Staff at an Iraqi state - owned hotel called the Sheraton Ishtar said Wednesday that the delegation was detained while the members were eating dinner in the ground floor restaurant , where they had apparently proceeded from the nearby checkpoint .
There are a number of great benefits to living within a five mile radius of the Mall of America ; people watching , getting rid of the winter blues for even an hour on a Tuesday evening in February , and seeing how corporate retail is doing its best to eliminate or consume the competition .
That last one and the fact that it is an iconic example for the needs of this post are the most important to me right now .
Case in point , this is a mall with over 500 stores .
There are 18 jewelry stores , 33 stores that sell shoes , and 51 carts ( spreading like a cancer ) to fight past in the walkways .
There are also 7 stores that deal with eyeglasses .
Of these seven , four deal specifically with prescription eyeglasses and sunglasses .
THREE OF THESE FOUR are owned by the Italian Luxottica Group S.p.A. --
I 've never seen a customer in the fourth one .
Luxottica is the closest thing to a monopoly , I can come up with .
Are you pissed off at LensCrafters ?
Just go to Pearle Vision right ?
Nope .
Same company .
Surely , Target or Sears will get you clear of the bad taste LenCrafters has left you with .
No again .
Luxottica , founded by the extremely wealthy ( $ 11.5B , Top 50 Richest Globally ) Leonardo Del Vecchio has its hands in the eyeglasses market from nearly every angle ; retail , wholesale , licensed and house brands ( perhaps you read about them purchasing Oakley a few weeks back for over $ 2.5 BILLION ) ...
They even have a scam going in the optical insurance arena .
If you have EyeMed Insurance , it 's not in your best interest to use any of the Luxottica retailers / brands .
More on that in a future article .
I knew they were omnipresent in this industry , but it never dawned on me that they were in so deep .
How the Federal Trade Commission has allowed this to happen over and over again with Luxottica should have you shaking your head in the same way I 'm shaking mine .
I 'm not a business writer , so if you 're interested , this article will give you a better idea of the specifics of the deal .
There are only a few ways to avoid the Luxottica steamroller :
shop the little guy and avoid these brands ( Arnette , Killer Loop , Luxottica , Persol , Ray - Ban , Revo , Sferoflex , Vogue , Adrienne Vittadini , Anne Klein , Brooks Brothers , Bvlgari , Byblos , Chanel , Dolce & Gabbana , D&G , Donna Karan , DKNY , Genny , Miu Miu , Moschino , Prada , Ralph Lauren , Salvatore Ferragamo , Sergio Tacchini , Versace , Versus )
shop at Costco , Sams Club or Walmart ( shudder ) and avoid the same list of brands
shop online , at one of the stores listed at the top of each of the pages on this site

I think the third option is the most cost - effective .
I think you 'll agree .
Big post coming up .
I 've been meaning to write this for a while .
I first mentioned it here and I 've been thinking about it ever since .
I love my job .
Absolutely love it .
Not many people can say that , but then not many people get to do their hobby for a living .
Ever since I was 13 I wanted to be a graphic designer ( technically my school library careers guidebook called it an advertising artist , but hey ) and ever since I was 13 I pretty much knew what I had to do to get there .
It 's not just me , I have friends who thought like that too .
It seems to me that if you 're a designer , a proper designer not someone who learnt Photoshop in between phone calls , then design runs through your veins like Pantone 7418 .
But more than that , it 's there in every aspect of life .
You can't stop looking at things through your designer eyes .
Everything you do is clouded by this thing that lives inside you .
Now , this is no bad thing .
But I 'm becoming fascinated by how this thing takes hold of us all and I 'd like to share it with you lovely people .
So what 's it like , living with this disease ?
What does it make you do that other people do n't do ?
How does it affect you ?
Let 's say you took a trip in to town one day .
First off , you'd be incredibly upset by the shocking kerning on this roadsign .
And if you parked your car in a multi storey car park the thing you'd be most struck by are these
And of course this .
We all love arrows and we all love collecting things , more about that later .
As you left the car park you 'd see this
and it would annoy you , really annoy you , that it was n't quite centred and it was n't quite justified and it was n't left aligned and it was n't right aligned .
You see sometimes the disease will stop you enjoying things .
I know designers who will walk out of a room because the colour upsets them .
Or you might see this on the way to a gig
and spend the rest of the concert wondering why they distorted the type like that ?
Back on your journey into town .
You 'd step outside and see this and wonder how on earth that can be allowed to happened .
Who would space type like that ?
Then you 'd spot this and be puzzled by the logotype .
Do Ferrari really have an estate agency ?
On the drive home you 'd take photos like this .
Just because .
People with the disease will always choose books by their covers .
Probably these covers .
Probably these covers and these colours , becuase you love colours , you worship colours which is why you collect things ( you see , collecting again ) like this
and why this website was so spot on .
But it 's not just books , it 's everything .
You 'll choose wine by the design of the label ,
you 'd stay here because of the sign
and you 'd photograph the sign and a million others like it .
If you were good , really good , you 'd collect all these photos of signs and store them alphabetically
because they may come in handy one day .
Just like you collected these pencils
and they came in handy .
You 'd also be obsessed with letters , or type as you 've been taught to call it .
Letters of any shape , size or description .
Like
or
or even
which means you start collecting things like this
and like this
as that magpie like bit of the disease seeps out through your keyboard into the finer reaches of eBay .
Again , if you were good , you 'd pick up on this obsession and turn it into a project like this
which is Michael Johnson 's brilliant Send A Letter thing .
Or you 'd have gates made like this ( Alan understood ) .
It 's not just letters , it 's numbers too .
You 'd photograph and collect things like this
( thanks Russell , this goes without saying )
in fact , that inner magpie would make you arrange everything like this
and on the biggest day in modern history it would make you wander the streets looking for postcards .
And then you 'd do this .
( Told you Alan understood ) .
You see , it affects every aspect of your life .
How you think , how you buy , what you see .
If you 're lucky you 're friends and family will pick up on this and if you 're lucky you 'll get things like this for Christmas
which will be the best thing you receive all year because it gives you a quick fix .
Designers , does that sound familiar ?
The advent of AJAX has made it possible to develop browser based web applications with high user interactivity and low user - perceived latency .
Real - time dynamic web data such as news headlines , stock tickers , and auction updates need to be propagated to the users as soon as possible .
However , AJAX still suffers from the limitations of the web ’s request / response architecture which prevents servers from pushing real - time dynamic web data .
Engin Bozdag , Ali Mesbah and Arie van Deursen of the Delft University of Technology have discussed the following approcahes to achieve web - based real time event notification :
1. HTTP Pull :
In this traditional approach , the client checks with the server for latest data at regular user definable intervals .
The pulling frequecncy needs to be high to ensure high data accuracy , but high pulling frequency may induce redundant checks leading to high network traffic .
Low pulling frequency , on the other hand , may lead to missed updates .
Ideally , the pulling interval should be equal to the rate at which the server state changes .
2. HTTP Streaming :
This method consists of streaming server data in the response of a long - lived HTTP connection ( Page Streaming ) or an XMLHttpRequest connection ( Service Streaming ) .
3. Reverse AJAX : Service Streaming , as applied to AJAX , is known as Reverse AJAX or COMET .
It enables the server to send a message to the client when an event occurs , without the client having to explicitly request .
The goal is to achieve a real - time update of the state changes .
COMET uses the persistent connection feature in HTTP / 1.1 .
With HTTP / 1.1 , unless specified otherwise , the TCP connection between the server and the browser is kept alive , until an explicit ‘ close connection ’ message is sent by one of the parties , or a timeout / network error occurs .
4. Long Polling : Also known as Asynchronous Polling , this method is a hybrid of pure server push and client pull .
It is based on BAYEUX protocol .
This protocol follows the topic based publish - subscribe scheme .
After a subscription to a channel , the connection between the client and the server is kept open , for a defined amount of time .
If no event occurs on the server side , a timeout occurs , and the server asks the client to reconnect asynchronously .
If an event occurs , the server sends the data to the client , and the client reconnects .
In their experimental study , the authors compared Data Coherence , Server Performance , Network Performance and Data Misses of an AJAX application using a COMET push implementation ( Dojo ’s Cometd library ) , as opposed to a pure pull approcah .
The authors concluded that :
" ... If we want high data coherence and high network performance , we should choose the push approach .
However , push brings some scalability issues ; the server application CPU usage is 7 times higher as in pull .
According to our results , the server starts to saturate at 350 - 500 users .
For larger number of users , load balancing and server clustering techniques are unavoidable .
With the pull approach , achieving total data coherence with high network performance is very difficult .
If the pull interval is higher than the publish interval , some data miss will occur .
If it is lower , network performance will suffer .
Pull performs well only if the pull interval equals to publish interval .
However , in order to achieve that , we need to know the exact publish interval beforehand .
However , the publish interval is rarely static and predictable .
This makes pull useful only in situations where the data is published frequently according to some pattern ... "
Some other implementations of the Comet Ajax server - push model are :
During the last decade , the cost of recording and producing music and video has plummeted , giving amateur auteurs a chance at stardom .
But at the same time , the expense involved in making video games has gone up : the development kits needed to create games for the consoles made by Microsoft , Sony and Nintendo cost thousands of dollars , and those companies usually send the kits only to established producers .
Microsoft is trying to change that .
Today the company is expected to announce the fall release of a product called XNA Game Studio Express , a basic version of the company ’s game authoring tools that will let aspiring designers write games on a PC and test them on an ordinary Xbox 360 .
( To test games , the designer pays $ 99 a year to translate the game from the PC into the Xbox format . )
For Microsoft , the goal is to inspire amateurs to share or sell relatively simple games on the company ’s Xbox Live network .
( Microsoft will not own any rights to products created with these tools . )
Programs created with XNA Game Studio Express will not look as good as most packaged titles .
But at a time when gamers seem tired of sequels and genre standards , the company says it believes that some kind of independent games business could provide a breath of fresh air .
“ We thought a lot about ‘ The Blair Witch Project , ’ ” said Scott Henson , a director for Microsoft ’s game developer group , referring to the low - budget horror film that became a surprise hit in 1999 .
And , of course , the company hopes the process of making games proves as addictive as playing them .
“ On the Internet , we ’re going from a monologue world to a dialogue world , ” Mr. Henson said , referring to sites with user - created content like MySpace and YouTube .
“ It ’s amazing how much participation there is . ”
Do Opposites Attract or Do People Look For Similar Partners ?
August 25 , 2007 at 7:35 pm
“ Opposites attract ” is the common response when you see a contrasting couple — a tall woman and a short man , or a party person with a quiet introvert .
Yet we all know couples who have the similar personalities — they like the same restaurants or are both neat freaks .
So are people attracted to those unlike themselves to complement their personalities , or do people seek out a partner just like themselves because it ’s positively reinforcing ?
It turns out , neither hypothesis is true .
A study of 36 couples found that there was no significant inter-personality similarity or differences .
However , a two interesting findings emerged :
People had partners who were similarly self - satisfied with themselves People ’s perceptions of their partners were biased towards their ideal self
In other words , someone who was low self - esteem has a higher likelihood of having a partner with low self - esteem , while someone who is self - liking will look for a partner who also likes who they are .
To elaborate on the second finding , there was no correlation between each individual partner ’s personalities , but there was a correlation between a person ’s ideal self - concept , and the perception they had of their partner .
So if you aspire to be organized , you may believe that your partner is more organized than he or she really is .

Ronald Green , an ethicist at Dartmouth College , said it would be “ very hard for people to say that what is created here is a nascent form of human life that should be protected . ”
The new technique , if adaptable to human cells , “ will be one way this debate could end , ” Mr. Green said .
Biologists learned how to generate human embryonic stem cells in 1998 from the few - day - old embryos discarded by fertility clinics , a procedure the embryos did not survive .
This source proved controversial , and biologists supported by federal financing were unable to explore the new opportunity until August 2001 when President Bush , in a political compromise , decreed that research on human embryonic stem cells could begin , but only with cell lines already in existence by that date .
The restrictions have caused considerable frustration among biologists and other supporters of research on embryonic stem cells .
Indeed , the House is expected to vote today to increase federal funds for such research .
If approved , the bill , similar to one approved by the Senate , would go to the president .
The White House has already said that the president would veto it .
The new technique , when adaptable to human cells , should sidestep all these problems .
James Battey , vice chairman of the National Institutes of Health stem cell task force , said he saw “ no impediment at all ” to federal support of researchers using the new technique on human cells .
Ever since the creation of Dolly , the first cloned mammal , scientists have sought to lay hands on the mysterious chemicals with which an egg will reprogram a mature cell nucleus injected into it and set the cell on the same path of embryonic development as when egg and sperm combine .
Years of patient research have identified many of the genes that are active in the embryonic cell and maintain its pluripotency , or ability to morph into many different tissues .
Last year Dr. Yamanaka and his colleague Kazutoshi Takahashi , both at Kyoto University , published a remarkable report relating how they had guessed at 24 genes responsible for maintaining pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells .
When they inserted all 24 genes into mouse skin cells , some of the cells showed signs of pluripotency .
The Kyoto team then subtracted genes one by one until they had a set of four genes that were essential .
The genes are inserted into viruses that infect the cell and become active as the virus replicates .
The skin cell ’s own copies of these genes are repressed since they would interfere with its function .
“ We were very surprised ” that just four genes are sufficient to reprogram the skin cells , Dr. Yamanaka said .
The batteries we rely on for everything from our cars to our cell phones use a chemical reaction to store and release an electrical charge .
The chemicals involved force a large number of tradeoffs in terms of practical considerations , such as weight , toxicity , heat , and the slow charging process .
News is filtering out that a small startup company in Texas has made a breakthrough in charge storage that relies on a completely different technology : capacitors .
Details are scarce , but a company that has licensed the technology suggests that it 's ready for large - scale production .
For those of you who do n't remember high school physics , a capacitor stores charge by arranging two metal plates in parallel .
Placing a negative charge in one of the plates will repel electrons from its opposite ; this charge difference will be maintained as long as the two plates remain electrically isolated and can be harnessed to produce a useful electric current .
A key advantage of capacitors is that they can store charge just as quickly as it's supplied — the long charge times needed by chemical batteries are simply unnecessary .
With no chemical reactions involved , capacitors should also have an indefinite life span .
These features may lead you to wonder why everything is n't running on capacitors .
The primary limit to the amount of electrical charge that can be stored in a capacitor is the amount of insulation between the plates , which prevents a current from jumping directly between them .
Existing insulators simply are n't good enough to support a charge density comparable to chemical batteries .
In short , capacitors with a sufficient charge capacity take up far too much space .
The Texas company behind the apparent breakthrough , EEStor , is primarily notable for two things : its secrecy ( it does n't even have a web site to link to ) and a patent application that describes a process for manufacturing a well - insulated capacitor .
It apparently relies on barium titanate ( BaTiO 3 ) as an insulator , something that 's been tried in the academic world .
But line eight of the patent application suggests that the charge storage is much higher than anything achieved in an academic lab : 52 kilowatt - hours in a 2,000 cubic inch capacitor array .
A rough conversion calculation suggests that this is over 10 times the power density of standard lead - acid batteries .
Is this sort of breakthrough realistic ?
In the absence of an actual product , it 's easy to dismiss patent claims as hyperbole .
But the Associated Press is reporting that the ZENN Motor Company , which makes compact electric cars , plans to start using the capacitors before the year is out .
The company has invested in EEStar in return for production goals being met and so is in a position to know how realistic its claims are .
EEStor is also led by personnel from IBM , which has a strong materials science research presence and has attracted the backing of a tech - savvy investment capital firm .
Still , the AP report quotes a number of researchers in the field as being extremely skeptical .
One noted that the charge density claims of the patent would represent a 400 - fold improvement over existing technology .
Given ZENN
Motor 's plans , we should n't have long to wait before finding out how realistic the patent 's statements are .
If EEStor 's claims pan out , the resulting cars could be charged as quickly and conveniently as filling a gas tank .
Until that product is released , however , the skeptics have ample reason to question these claims .

The weapon in question is complicated to master , and American soldiers and marines undergo many days of training to achieve the most basic competence with it .
Moreover , the weapon in Mr. Zarqawi's hands was an older variant , which makes its malfunctioning unsurprising .
The veterans said Mr. Zarqawi , who had spent his years as a terrorist surrounded by simpler weapons of Soviet design , could hardly have been expected to know how to handle it .

" They are making a big deal out of nothing , " said Mario Costagliola , who retired as an Army colonel last month after serving as the operations officer for the 42nd Infantry Division in Tikrit , Iraq .
An active - duty Special Forces colonel who served in Iraq also said that what the video showed actually had little relationship to Mr. Zarqawi 's level of terrorist skill .
" Looking at the video , I enjoy it ; I like that he looks kind of goofy , " said the Special Forces officer , who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on military matters .
" But as a military guy , I shrug my shoulders and say : ' Of course he does n't know how to use it .
It 's our gun . '
He does n't look as stupid as they said he looks . "
The release of the captured video reflected the dueling public relations efforts between the American - led forces fighting in Iraq and the terrorists and insurgents .
It also reflected increasing interest by the military and civilian strategists in trying to ridicule Mr. Zarqawi .
" In Arab and Muslim societies , pride and shame are felt much more profoundly than they are in Western culture , " said J. Michael Waller , a professor at the Institute of World Politics , a graduate school in Washington .
" To find video like this that can cut him down to size and discredit him is a real way of fighting terrorism . "
A paper written by Professor Waller advocating the use of ridicule against the insurgents has been circulating at the Pentagon and among military commanders with experience in Iraq recently , according to several military officers .

Are you one of the people who love children ?
This doesnt mean constantly repeating how cute they are but expressing your affection in a far more sophisticate level .
If you ever wanted to become a teacher for children , it is about time that you step out of the dark and do what you have to do to get where you want to be .
This is how youre going to do it .
Spend more time with children
Understanding all children types is extremely essential if you want to be a good teacher / caretaker .
There are occasions where how people find the kids to be so playful and cute and in the end of the day , they might just want to get rid of the kids no matter what it costed .
This sort of a poor understanding on children of ages less than 5 isnt a good quality of a true caretaker .
Hence , bonding with kids and figuring out their typical patterns will help you become the best teacher they will meet ever .
Professional qualifications
Any childs
https://www.academia21.com/school/diploma-of-early-childhood-education-and-careis very important .
Hence , educating yourself in order to meet the necessary qualifications is equally important too .
This is because , that part of the education of a childs life is the foundation of their academic life .
If it settled weakly or settled in a way that it is materialistically poor , it can affect their life in long term .
The most significant and the most recognized professional qualification in the field of child education and care is the certificate 3 in childcare Brisbane .
Successfully completing this will help you be in the best shape to shape the foundation of a childs life .
On the other hand , makings sure that you obtain this certificate at a well - recognized institution is a bonus .
It could be unfair for another person , but it shouldnt be you ; thats why you should consider the quality of the institution always .
Prepare your own methods
We all have had teachers in our academic lives who were able to successfully teach in creative manners .
This is one of the significant qualities of a talented teacher .
As a caretaker , there are occasions where children tend to get stubborn .
Their post - childhood mentalities depend on their early childhood experiences .
Hence , it is essential that you take the most adequate measures every time .
Our children are the people who are going to accept the control of the world one day .
No matter how corrupted it has become , it is always reversible .
Our children are the only hope for that .
We can always hope for the best if we made sure that they turn out to be their best versions with time .

Former RIAA target Tanya Andersen has sued several major record labels , the parent company of RIAA investigative arm MediaSentry , and the RIAA 's Settlement Support Center for malicious prosecution , a development first reported by P2P litigation attorney Ray Beckerman of Vandenberg & Feliu .
Earlier this month , Andersen and the RIAA agreed to dismiss the case against her with prejudice , making her the prevailing party and eligible for attorneys fees .
The lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the District of Oregon late last week and accuses the RIAA of a number of misdeeds , including invasion of privacy , libel and slander , and deceptive business practices .
Andersen is a disabled single mother residing in Oregon .
In 2005 , she was sued by the RIAA for file - sharing , accused of sharing a library of gangsta rap over Kazaa .
She denied the allegations and filed a counterclaim alleging fraud , racketeering , and deceptive business practices by the record labels .
Despite the lack of any evidence of infringement apart from an IP address , the RIAA continued to press ahead with the case until the abrupt dismissal earlier this month .
Andersen lays out an unsavory account of the music industry 's actions as it attempted to dig up evidence that she was guilty of infringement .
Early on , an employee at the Settlement Support Center , the RIAA 's prelitigation collections agent , allegedly told Andersen that he believed she had not infringed any copyrights according to the complaint .
After the RIAA filed suit , Andersen 's complaint says that she provided the name , location , and phone number of the person she believed was behind the Kazaa account " gotenkito , " the account the RIAA accused her of using for copyright infringement .
" Instead of dismissing their false claims , the defendant Record Companies persisted in their malicious prosecution of her they publicly libeled her with demanding and repulsive accusations [ sic ] " that she listened to misogynistic rap music according to the complaint .
The RIAA is also accused of trying to contact Andersen 's then eight - year - old daughter without her knowledge .
" Knowing of her distress , the RIAA and its agents even attempted to directly contact Kylee , " reads the complaint .
" They called Ms. Andersen 's apartment building looking for Kylee .
Phone calls were also made to her former elementary school under false pretenses ...
Ms. Andersen learned of these tactics and was even more frightened and distressed . "
Andersen says that the RIAA acted negligently throughout the proceedings and engaged in fraud and negligent misrepresentation by demanding that she enter into a four - figure settlement for copyright infringement that she never engaged in .
The RIAA is also accused of violating both federal and state RICO statutes , the intentional infliction of emotional distress , and invasion of privacy .
Andersen seeks statutory and punitive damages along with attorneys fees .
We explored the possibility of charging the RIAA with malicious prosecution last month .
Attorney Rich Vasquez of Morgan Miller Blair told Ars Technica that he believed the RIAA could be vulnerable to such charges , but it would be an uphill battle to make them stick .
Still , the complaint paints a very unflattering picture of the RIAA and its agents engaging in activity that was in many cases questionable and unethical at best .
The history of file - sharing litigation shows that Atlantic v. Andersen was not an isolated case of mistaken identity , and should Andersen get a favorable result here , other former defendants may follow her lead .
That could lead to a potentially very costly class - action suit against the RIAA .
" You 'd have to have a lot of winners , " said Vasquez .
" If you have enough people bringing charges of malicious prosecution , you could then show a pattern of practices on the part of the RIAA . "
The RIAA told Ars that it would have no comment on Andersen 's lawsuit .
He was 18 .
Bush has destroyed the military , and is now sending virtual kids , unprepared , into battle .
He has the nerve to talk about supporting the troops .
His idea of support is killing our troops in order to assuage his own ego .
Anyone and everyone who continues to support this war is complicit in this kid 's death .
From E&P
Two soldiers killed in Iraq in February may have died as a result of friendly fire , Army officials said Wednesday , not from enemy fire , as the press reported .
The military suspected friendly fire later in February but did not inform the dead soldiers ' families of these new doubts .
One of the soldier 's died just hours after arriving in Iraq -- and was one of those troops rushed to the country in the " surge " who did not receive full training ....
On February 9 , the Savannah Morning News reported : " At least 143 soldiers joined Fort Stewart 's 1st Brigade too late to participate in a final combat exercise before their units deployed to Iraq .
Last week , one of those soldiers - Pvt. Matthew T. Zeimer , 18 - was the first from the brigade to be killed when he was hit by enemy fire in Ramadi , the stronghold of Iraq 's Sunni insurgency .
" Zeimer arrived at Fort Stewart on Dec. 18 after basic training and deployed to Iraq just a few weeks later .
He missed the brigade 's intensive four - week mission rehearsal in October when more than 1,300 trainers and Iraqi role - players came to the post as part of the most realistic training program the Army offers for Iraq operations .
The fact some of the brigade 's 4,000 soldiers missed that training raises questions about how well the Army is preparing troops for war in the face of accelerated and repeat deployments . "
Two days before that , the same newspaper reported that " some Iraq veterans in the 1st Brigade have expressed concerns about their younger counterparts missing the mission rehearsal .
' The training was good but some guys came in after that .
They 're basically going straight from basic training into Iraq , ' said Staff Sgt. Jason Massey last month , before saying goodbye to his family for a third combat tour . "

Former Hydrogen Atom Scale Model
So I used to have a page here that was a demonstration of how much empty space there is inside a hydrogen atom .
It was based on something called the " Bohr model " of the atom , where you imagine the atom as a nucleus with electrons orbiting around it - kind of like a tiny solar system .
The Bohr model has been obsolete for ages , but they still teach it in schools because it's a simple introduction to quantum physics and you can move on to more accurate models later .
The page had a picture of a proton that was one thousand pixels wide , and a little electron that was only one pixel wide , and they were separated by fifty million pixels of empty space - I worked it out that that was eleven miles if your monitor displayed 72 pixels per inch , not uncommon at the time .
You could try to scroll between them and it would take a long time .
It was kind of neat .
Keeping it working with various web browsers was a bit of a challenge .
People who make web browsers do n't often start with the assumption that their browser should be able to display a web page eleven miles wide , as this is an uncommon size .
I had to trick them a bit to get them to display fifty million pixels worth of anything , and of course they do n't all work the same way as each other .
And once in a while a new version of the browser comes out , and for whatever reason , some of the newer ones show the distances inaccurately again , which kind of defeats the point .
The other thing about the page is that it was n't , strictly speaking , correct , as people who know Real Physics would periodically write and tell me .
Some were simply pointing out that the Bohr model itself is not correct , but others have taken issue with the values used , in particular for the size of the electron .
The trouble is that an electron cannot be said to have a well - defined " size " in the way that an apple or a basketball does .
If you ask the internet how big an electron is , you wo n't get a straight answer .
It does n't have a radius so much as it has a kind of a hazy area it occupies .
( I 'm put in mind of the way Google Maps works on my phone - it can't pinpoint me exactly , so it draws a big circle , inside of which it is reasonably certain that I currently am .
The size of that circle is usually many blocks wide at least .
And that 's all the map knows about me - from its point of view , my current height or weight have no real meaning whatsoever .
I am the circle .
The circle is not a very accurate representation of me , but it 's the best the map can do .
Similarly , our ideas about the tiny waves / particles / energy - constructs that make up our universe are merely mathematical constructs based on available data . )
I could n't remember where I 'd gotten my value for the size of the electron in the first place , so I re-scoured my college physics text and other sources and came up empty .
I suspect that I wound up calculating something using the relative rest - masses of an electron and a proton and then comparing to the slightly - better - defined radius of the proton .
Buuuut ... rest mass is n't really an accurate way of thinking about the amount of Stuff in an electron , either .
The point of the exercise was to visualize How Much Stuff versus How Much Emptiness , but , the more I try to figure out what will be a good way to represent that , the more I run up against the troublesome fact that " Stuff " and " Emptiness " are not so meaningful at this scale .
It 's like trying to measure ripples in a pond .
So , I 've taken the page down , at least for now .
You can still enjoy the similar , but accurate and functional , page about our solar system .
I continue to be fascinated with how un - solid a solid object , such as myself , reveals itself to be upon closer inspection .
Whether we 're loose collections of dust in a wind tunnel or ripples on the surface of a pond , I maintain that we can only barely be said to exist .
We are all phantoms .

And guess what , I got my money back !
You need to read this fast because you need to act fast .
First and foremost , there are two things you can do right now to help your situation .
1 . Call your bank or credit card company immediately after you realize you have been scammed .
2. Call your Police non-emergency number and file a report .
Explain your situation and see what they can do for you .
Filing a report is a good idea in case you need to provide it to your bank and / or credit card and credit agencies ( depending on your circumstances ) .
I ’m writing this tutorial because I was recently scammed in a domain sale at SitePoint.com .
I paid $ 275 via Paypal for a certain domain name promised to me at Sitepoint.com .
Once I sent payment , the “ seller ” ( let ’s call him Mr. McScammer ) private messaged me and said that he was going to go to dinner and send the domain after he gets back .
Red flag # 1 .
I ’ll admit that I fell into this scam partly due to my ignorance .
The best thing you can do to prevent this kind of nonsense is simply keep caution when you participate in ANY online transaction .
Although there are times where you just get caught up in a shady transaction .
I ’m not calling you stupid , you can be the judge of that .
Either way , there ’s hope .
Read on .
“ How do I get my money back if I ’ve been scammed online ? ”
Step number 1 :
How did you pay ?
If you paid via Paypal like I did , log into your account and view the details of the payment you just sent .
Scroll down and find where it says :
Need help ?
If you have problems with a transaction or would like assistance settling a dispute with your seller , visit the Resolution Center .
PayPal strongly recommends attempting to resolve this issue directly with the merchant or seller whenever possible .
Click ‘ Resolution Center ’ and open a dispute .
Do whatever you need to do , write whatever you need to write to get the dispute open .
The point is to get the dispute opened ASAP .
Step number 2 :
Call or go to your nearest bank location .
Do n’t hesitate with this , time is crucial .
I was lucky enough to get this taken care of in time .
I actually emailed at first ( not smart ) , then they told me to call them .
Speak to one of your bank representatives and explain your situation .
I told my bank that I was recently scammed out of $ 275 and would like to issue a Stop Payment .
This is what you need to get as well .
They should give you a “ dispute form ” of some sort .
If you ’re at the bank in person , have them walk you through it .
The form they give you is a legal contract that you ’ll want to carefully fill out .
Basically the Stop Payment does exactly what it ’s titled , it stops the payment from your bank to whoever ( in this case Paypal ) .
Your bank will most likely charge you a fee to do this ( mine was $ 25 ) .
You will also need to get this notarized if they ca n’t do it for you .
Since I was n’t at my physical bank in person , I had to go to UPS and have them notarize it for $ 10 .
Just do this as fast as you can and do n’t think twice about the fees .
It ’s worth it assuming you ’ve been scammed out of a decent amount of money .
Stay in contact with your bank .
Just make sure they ’re processing the form as soon as possible .
They should be doing all they can to help you .
If you get scammed , they get scammed in a sense .
Step number 3 :
You ’ve now done all you can do really .
From here , I do my best to in any way try to contact the actual scammer and tell him / her that you ’re willing to escalate the situation with legal action if your money is n’t returned within 24 hours .
Do n’t give them more than 24 hours .
If they do n’t give it back to you within that amount of time , they ’ll never give it back most likely .
DO NOT BEG .
Depending on the amount at stake , it may be tempting to get on your hands and knees and beg for your money back .
It wo n’t work .
You expect that it will ?
Scammers have no heart .
I do n’t even consider them real people :) .
Overall , keep your cool .
Your bank will now take care of it .
You might have to wait between 24 - 72 hours for the stop payment to take affect .
Once it does , Paypal should email you a message like this :
Dear Your Name ,
You recently attempted to transfer funds from your bank account to your PayPal account .
Your bank has declined the funds transfer .
We were unable to cover your payment to [ email protected ] with funds from your PayPal balance .
While this transaction had already been flagged as unauthorized , our external processor could not be prevented from completing the representment process .
Your Back - up Funding Source will not be charged to make up the funds .
This could mean that your PayPal account balance will go negative , but this is merely an interim accounting step that will be corrected when we have completed our review of this transaction .
For current information on your account balance and transaction history , please login to your PayPal account .
Do n’t freak out .
This is a good thing .
Paypal is saying that your bank has declined the transfer of funds for the transaction specified in the Stop Payment Dispute form you filled out from your bank .
Paypal will most likely limit your account access due to the situation involving fraud .
You ’ll need to change your password , security question , and confirm you ’re really you by having them call you and enter a PIN number they give you .
It ’s just a security procedure .
Do that and you ’re account will be back to normal .
That ’s all I had to do to get my money back .
I ended up having to pay a total of $ 35 for the notary and Stop Payment fee from the bank .
I hope this helps at least ONE person .
If it does then this article is deemed useful .
Good luck to everyone .
Stay safe , stay smart .
[ Edu- sig ] Tracing the Dynabook : A Dissertation
Hi ,
Over the past few years , I have been working on a historical study on Alan Kay 's Dynabook vision and how it has played out over the past three and a half decades .
This has been part of my PhD work in education at the University of BC -- as such , I am working from an educational perspective , rather than a compsci one .
I recently ( November 2006 ) finished the dissertation and successfully defended it , and so I 'm posting this in the hopes that some of you will find some value in it .
I 've been reading this edu-sig list since its inception , and in the past 6 months or so I 've noticed an enormous surge of interest in ( and controversy around ) Squeak and Alan Kay 's Dynabook concept .
I 've been reading these discussions with great interest , as much of it touches directly on what I 've been writing .
While I have n't written about Python per se in my dissertation , it is implicitly there for the simple reason that Python has been my own language of choice for the past 4 or 5 years ; much of what Paul Fernhout written recently about appreciating Smalltalk while still finding Python more practical is very close to my own experience .
The entire work is roughly 300 pages .
This link leads to a PDF of just under 2 megabytes .
At some point , if I have some time , I want to break this out into some more granular web pages , but I 'm already late in releasing it , so here it is in its entirety .
You can find it ( along with a brief abstract and ToC ) at : http://thinkubator.ccsp.sfu.ca/Dynabook/dissertation
I 'm very interested in any comments you might have .

The men of Russia 's Arctic city of Murmansk have an unlikely passion - as a woman living there explains : " Many men in Murmansk love escaping to their garages , which are often built far away from the apartment blocks where they live . "

WHAT is the proper term to refer to those of you who live in the United States of America ?
The word “ American ” is so deeply embedded in your nation ’s identity that it may seem curious to you that there could be any discussion about it , but some people — in Latin America , for example — find it offensive , while others , including some in France , simply find it imprecise .
“ Américain ” ( in French the ethnonym is capitalized , the adjective is lower case ) is a word with many meanings , depending on context : “ américains ” applies to all Américains ( from the United States ) , yet all Américains ( from North and South America ) are not necessarily américains .
That ’s why “ Américain , ” which first appeared in French as early as the 16th century and is applicable to groups other than just the inhabitants of the United States ( in contrast to Canadien , Mexicain , Argentin , etc. ) , has a certain unsatisfactory quality about it , and it would be preferable to find something more precise .
The French do use certain diminutives — like “ Ricains ” ( first attestation in 1918 ) , “ Amerlos ” ( 1936 ) and “ Amerloques ” ( 1945 ) — that refer to only the United States , but the news media ca n’t use them ; they are n’t necessarily hostile but they did take on a pejorative tinge during the cold war .

Helpfully , though , in Quebec about six decades ago the word États - Unien , derived from the French for United States , États - Unis , was born .
Its spread was modest at first , but today it ’s frequent in the news media , and there ’s even a radio program here that uses it exclusively .
In ordinary conversation , though , the French still say “ Américains . ”
A recent occurrence of “ États - Uniens ” ( though far from the first ) on the Web site of our newspaper , Le Monde , provoked the ire of readers who saw anti-American and anti-globalist sentiment behind it .
A Haskell library for lazy , efficient suffix tree construction , search , and traversal .
The implementation is based on the first of those described in the following paper :
Robert Giegerich and Stefan Kurtz , “ A comparison of imperative and purely functional suffix tree constructions “ , Science of Computer Programming 25(2-3) :187-218 , 1995
The library includes functions for constructing , searching , and traversing suffix trees .
It only constructs parts of the suffix tree as they are needed , thus avoiding unnecessary work .
Construction typically takes O( n log n ) time , with searches taking linear time .

As a child going to the circus , you might expect the clown to throw a bucket of confetti at you , or squirt you with water from the flower on his lapel .
You certainly would n't be prepared for him to grab you by the scruff of the neck , punch and kick you and leave you needing hospital treatment for cuts and bruises .
As these astonishing pictures show , that 's what happened when 12 - year - old Amos Lutz met Kaspar the Clown at a circus in Leipzig , Germany .
Scroll down for more ...
Amos 's mistake seems to have been to hurl a carton of his own confetti at Kaspar - otherwise known as Bernd Kalster , 47 - as he strolled by .
Clown Bernd Kalster , 47 , punched and kicked helpless Amos Lutzer , 12 , to the ground at Leipzig , Germany , then claimed it was self defence .
Kaspar clearly failed to see the funny side .
He took hold of Amos and punched and kicked him , even as the youngster curled into a ball to try to protect himself .
The clown has now been arrested and charged with causing actual bodily harm .
He faces the prospect of six months in prison .
Amos said : ' At first I thought he was mucking about .
But I went down hard on the ground and I saw him balling his fists and growling at me behind his smile .
' He really hit me hard .
He was punching and kicking , swearing at me the whole time .
I was very frightened .
It 's not like I threw a stone at him , just some fluffy bits of paper . '
Kaspar claimed Amos had struck him in the face after the clown told him off for throwing the confetti in an area where there were ' no litter ' signs .
But bystanders said only confetti was thrown and nothing more .
Amos 's father Stephan Lutz , 43 , said : ' My son does n't lie .
' He thought he was being jolly throwing the confetti and this is how he was repaid .
The clown's a psycho . '
The newly single Longoria steps out to support her pal on Dancing with the Stars
On Tuesday ’s edition of Dancing with the Stars , contestant Mario Lopez had a very special fan in the audience : Eva Longoria .
Longoria , who recently split from boyfriend Tony Parker , and Lopez are old friends .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Arriving four minutes to show time , the Desperate Housewives star was shuttled to her seat in the front row next to Lopez ’s mother .
Since producers had banned clothes with messages of support for contestants , Longoria concealed her homemade black “ Vote For Mario ” tee ( which she ’d Bedazzled herself ! ) under a tan blazer .
After the show , Lopez told PEOPLE , “ We were told that our families could n’t wear the t- shirts .
I called ( Eva ) and told her and she said , ‘ Well , it ’s too late .
I already made it and I ’m wearing it . ’
And I said , ‘ Okay , but you ’re breaking the rules this week , not me ! ’ ” ( Last week , Lopez and partner Karina Smirnoff were chastised for breaking their hold and doing a lift during their routine . )
Lopez said he ’d known Longoria “ for years , yeah .
She ’s like a sister . ”
Having her at the show , he said , “ was great .
She was supposed to come other weeks but she ’s busy , plus we tape kind of early because we ’re live to the East Coast , so it ’s hard schedule - wise .
She ’s got her show going , you know . ”
Does Longoria give him fashion tips ?
“ No , ” Lopez replied , then , pointing to Smirnoff , said , “ She does .
I defer to her on everything . ”
Although Lopez and Smirnoff deny they ’re a couple ( “ A couple of nuts ! ” Lopez joked ; added Smirnoff , “ He stepped on my hand , sat on my head .
How do you put that together ?
I am crazy and weird , but not that weird ! ” ) , the partners have obvious chemistry off the dance floor .
On their performance Tuesday , Smirnoff told PEOPLE , “ The music is from such a powerful movie , Desperado .
We really aimed to be Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek tonight .
I hope it came across . ”
“ ( Salma Hayek ) wishes she looked as good as Karina did tonight , ” said Lopez .

For six years we have been hearing about how Rudy Giuliani is the hero of the World Trade Center attacks for his role in just " showing up " with video cameras in tow near ground zero .
The truth is , Rudy Giuliani failed to prepare the New York City Fire Department prior to September 11 for a potential calamity .
Just as worst , he has subsequently exploited 9/11 to make tens of millions of dollars and build a base of support through the media for his presidential campaign .
In response , the real heroes of 9/11 - members of the International Association of Firefighters - have released a documentary , " Rudy Giuliani : Urban Legend " - which features active and retired fire fighters , fire officers and families speaking out about the Real Rudy Giuliani that the cameras missed .
While the real heros of 9/11 were searching for their fallen bretheren , Mayor Giuliani along with Administration officials like Christine Todd Whitman , made sure the interests of their Wall Street donors were placed above those of the fallen heros :
Riches was one of 343 firefighters who died .
His father spent every day sifting through the wreckage for bodies , eager for some sign of his son .
In November , Giuliani ordered a halt to the work after the remains of 91 firefighters had been recovered .
" Giuliani told everybody the bodies were pulverised , but I was digging them up every day .
It was grisly stuff , limbs , little bones - people were blown to bits - but the bodies were there , " said Riches , 55 .
The searchers refused to stop .
An ugly clash between the firefighters and the New York police left 18 officers injured .
Eventually Giuliani backed down and allowed the work to continue , but not before branding the firefighters ’ actions as " sinful " .
As late as March , clumps of victims - 13 here , five there , a couple more scattered around - were being found .
One of them was Riches ’ son .
London Times
Several months ago , the International Association of Firefighters held a town hall style forum where Presidential candidates from both parties gathered to talk to the assembled crowd .
Only one Presidential candidate was missing , and it was no accident .
In a letter explaining why the IAFF refused to invite Giuliani to their bipartisan town hall forum , union president Harold Schaitberger writes :
What Giuliani showed following 9/11 is a disgraceful lack of respect for the fallen and those brothers still searching for them .
He valued the money and gold and wanted the [ World Trade Center ] site cleared before he left office at the end of 2001 more than he valued the lives and memories of those lost . "
You can see the web video at the website set up by the Firefighters at Rudy - UrbanLegend .
Like the swiftboaters who targeted John Kerry in 2004 , the New York City firefighters intend on following Rudy 's every step as he campaigns for the Presidency .
Unlike the swiftboaters , they will have the truth behind them .
