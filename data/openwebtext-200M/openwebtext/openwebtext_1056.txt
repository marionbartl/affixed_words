BEIJING / NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - China and India lashed out on Friday at the possibility of tariffs slapped on carbon - intensive exports , even though analysts said proposed U.S. measures were years away and would be hard to implement .

Green protectionism is likely to cause unease at next week ’s G8 meeting in Italy and separate 17 - member Major Economies Forum gathering .
It is also a growing concern in U.N. talks that aim to seal a broader climate pact at the end of the year in Copenhagen .
China , the world ’s top greenhouse gas emitter , said carbon tariffs would violate the rules of the World Trade Organization as well as the spirit of the U.N. ’s Kyoto Protocol .
Carbon tariffs would “ seriously hurt the interests of developing countries ” and “ disrupt the order of international trade , ” the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement posted on its website .
While it did not directly refer to the United States , China ’s comments come a week after the lower house of the U.S. Congress passed the Clean Energy and Security Act , also known as the Waxman - Markey Bill , which includes so - called “ carbon equalization ” provisions that could kick in from 2025 .
The measures are meant to give rich nations a way to protect their domestic industries that fear putting a price on carbon emissions will make their goods more expensive compared with exports from developing nations .
Some industries also fear jobs and energy - intensive manufacturing could shift to poorer nations .
“ We are completely surprised and rather dismayed by the development .
This is an attempt to bring trade and competitiveness into environmental negotiations , ” a top Indian climate negotiator said in reference to the U.S. legislation .
The steps in the Waxman - Markey Bill would involve raising duties on imports from countries that are not making the same effort to cut emissions and would focus on goods such as cement and steel , which need a lot of energy to make .
“ This is the quid pro quo for cap - and - trade , but the international community ca n’t be held down by the domestic political compulsions of President Obama , ” said the Indian official , who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to reporters .
Obama said last week he was not in favor of climate - linked protectionism .
“ LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD ”
Concerned their efforts to curb greenhouse gases would put their industries at a competitive disadvantage , the United States , Canada and the European Commission have all put forward proposals to “ level the playing field . ”
Under the U.S. bill , which still needs to pass the Senate , a U.S. cap - and - trade scheme would start in 2012 and the most trade - sensitive sectors would be given emission allowance rebates to cover the costs of complying with the carbon trade scheme .
Those rebates will last till about 2025 .
By mid-2022 the president must decide how to tackle competitive concerns after 2025 and would examine whether competitor nations have agreed to emissions reduction targets , energy intensity targets or steps such as sectoral caps or export tariffs that place a price on carbon .
The idea is to give India and China and other major developing nations time to enact climate - friendly measures .
“ I think generally they ’re using this as a means to pressure developing countries to take stronger action on emissions , ” said Zhang Haibin , a professor of environmental politics at Peking University and an adviser to the Ministry of Commerce on trade and climate change policies .
“ But if the United States takes unilateral action without proper multilateral consultations and agreement that could spark big trade disputes , a trade war even , ” he said .
That kind of clash comes at a sensitive time in the world ’s battle to slow climate change , with this December ’s meeting in Copenhagen seen as a pivotal moment .
“ This is completely unacceptable .
It will completely derail the Copenhagen process , which is already at a complicated stage and completely gridlocked right now , ” said Sunita Narain , head of New Delhi - based Center for Science and Environment .
COMPLEX PICTURE
But some experts say the risk of such measures is small , given the logistical complexities involved .
“ If you look at real life , how is it going to be implemented ?
That ’s going to be a very complicated matter .
I ’m not sure people have thought clearly , technically how to make this happen , ” said Changhua Wu , Greater China Director of The Climate Group , an NGO that helps governments and companies trim carbon emissions .
“ In the meantime , there are other stakeholders in the U.S. , big companies that operate in China and India .
They have their opinions as well .
So it ’s going to be a very complicated picture , ” she added .
Ultimately , the measures could accelerate the development of domestic carbon exchanges in emerging countries , which have thus far sold most of their carbon abatement tariffs internationally .
“ If the Senate approved similar legislation before December , the likelihood of domestic carbon pricing being introduced in Asia potentially increases , ” said Simon Smiles , Asian thematic analyst for UBS in Hong Kong , who has studied the cost impact of domestic emissions trading and carbon tariffs on Asia firms .
“ I continue to see the political expediency of carbon - related import duties .
But as the legislation currently stands , the near - term risk of border adjustments based on the amount of carbon in goods imported into the U.S. appears very low . ”

The publican of a remote West Coast hotel has died after being punched in the face by a woman during a late - night drinking session , police say .
Westport police said David White , owner of the Little Wanganui Hotel about 20 kilometres south of Karamea , intervened in a disagreement between two female patrons about 2.30 am yesterday .
One of the women allegedly punched Mr White in the head and he fell to the floor where he died .
Paramedics tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate Mr White , who is believed to have been aged 42 .
The incident at the only pub in Little Wanganui has rocked the tiny settlement but it did not surprise one local resident .
" We know who did it and she is an absolute mad woman . "
Inspector Alan Weston , of southern police communications , could not say whether either of the women were in custody or if charges had been laid .
Mr White had been at the hotel for about five years with his partner , Kirsty Barkman , and their daughter .
However , the hotel is for sale and Mr White had only just agreed to drop the asking price , real estate agent Adrian Chisholm said .
" I guess he and his partner had come to the end of what they could do .
Like a lot of these businesses , you do get burnout . "
Dan Vos said his friend 's death had shocked the community .
" He was as strong as an ox .
He could pick up three times what most men could .
He walked like a locomotive .
" He was well - respected by the whole community .
He used to run the cricket club for the young kids .
He was a big sportsman and outdoors man . "
Dave Webster , co-owner of Karamea 's Last Resort retreat and bar , said the Little Wanganui Hotel was a traditional West Coast pub .
" The clientele was n't rough but you can't always control who walks in your door . "

Another Housing Bubble ?
“ [ We ] must control the risk of real estate loans , ” said a mystery banker .
“ In the first half of the year , our country ’s banking loans expanded rapidly … but the loans growth has led to accumulated risks also increasing . ”
Our man of the moment said his banking sector had become “ not prudent and impulsive ” in issuing loans for new housing projects , many of which have falsified their capital levels to meet current standards .
He urged lenders to “ strengthen risk management ” right way , before they loan themselves into poor credit positions .
So who is he ?
Robert Shiller , who just recently suggested another housing bubble could be in the mix ?
Or maybe some vintage Ben Bernanke , circa 2007 ?
Nope … Liu Mingkang , the head of China ’s version of the FDIC , said the above over the weekend at a conference in Beijing .
China bulls take heed .
And at the risk of belaboring the obvious — he ’s Chinese .
We know what kind of exigency would get an American regulator to speak out against a bubble in the making .
We imagine it ’s far more politically dangerous for a member of the Chinese government to publicly go against the grain .

The question we have been focused on for some time now is whether we end up with inflation , or deflation , and what that endgame looks like .
It is one of the most important questions an investor must ask today , and getting the answer right is critical .
This week , we have a guest writer who takes on the topic of the great experiment the Fed is now waging , which he calls The Great Reflation Experiment .
One of my favorite sources of information for decades has been and remains the Bank Credit Analyst .
It has a long and
storied reputation .
One of their enduring themes has been the debt super cycle .
Investors who have paid attention to it have been served well .
I am taking a little R&R this weekend , but I have arranged for my friend Tony Boeckh to stand in for me .
Tony was chairman , chief executive , and editor - in - chief of Montreal - based BCA Research , publisher of the highly regarded Bank Credit Analyst up until he retired in 2002 .
He still likes to write from time to time , and we are lucky enough to have him give us his views on where we are in the economic cycles .
Gentle reader , we are all graced to learn from one of the great economists and analysts of our times .
Pay attention .
Central bankers do .
You can read his extensive bio at www.boeckhinvestmentletter.com and I will tell you how to get his letter free of charge at the end of this letter .
And , he told me to mention that his son Rob is now helping him write , so there is a double byline here .
Now , let ’s just jump in .

The Crash of 2008 / 9 should be seen as yet another consequence of long - term , persistent US inflationary policies .
Inflation does n’t stand still .
It tends to establish a self - reinforcing cycle that accelerates until the excesses in money and credit become so extreme that a correction is triggered .
The bigger the inflation , the bigger the correction .
Once a dependency on credit expansion is well established , correcting the underlying imbalances becomes extremely difficult .
Reflation has occurred after each major correction , and this one is proving no exception .
Return to discipline in the current environment would be too painful and dangerous .
Once on the financial roller coaster , it is very hard to get off .
Moreover , the oscillations between peaks and valleys become increasingly large and unstable .
Policymakers , money managers , and most forecasters have argued that the crash was a “ black swan ” event , meaning
that it had an extremely low probability of occurrence .
That is grossly misleading , as it implies that the crash was so far beyond the realm of normal probabilities that it was unreasonable to expect anyone to have foreseen it .
That argument has been used to justify the widespread complacency that prevailed in the years leading up to the crash .
Policymakers are still failing to recognize the systemic causes of the crash and seem to believe that enhanced regulation will prevent history from repeating .
While it is true that regulators were asleep at the switch or looking the other way , they were not the cause .
The Debt Super Cycle
The real culprit is the US debt super cycle , which has operated for decades , mostly in a remarkably benign manner .
The inflationary implications of the twin deficits ( current account and fiscal ) , as well as the steady increase in private debt , have been moderated by the integration of emerging markets into the global economy .
The massive increase in industrial output from China , India , and others has enabled persistent credit inflation in the US to occur with virtually no consequence to date ( other than periodic asset price bubbles and shakeouts ) .
How long the disinflationary impact of emerging - market productivity growth will persist and how long these nations will continue loading up on Treasuries , will be instrumental in determining the course that the Great Reflation will take .
Tougher regulation is surely appropriate , but it will not stop the next inflationary run-up unless the system is fixed .
In the final analysis , newly minted money and credit must find a home somewhere .
Some Background on US Inflation
Inflation , to be properly understood , should be defined as a persistent expansion of money
and credit that substantially exceeds the growth requirements of the economy .
As a consequence of excessive monetary expansion , prices rise .
Which prices go
up and at what rate depends on a number of factors .
Sometimes it is the prices
of goods and services that are the most visible symptom of inflationary
pressures .
That was the case in the 1970s when the Consumer Price Index ( CPI )
hit a peak rate of 14 % per annum .
Sometimes it is the prices of assets such as
homes , office buildings , stocks , or bonds that reflect the inflationary
pressure , as we have seen in more recent years .
When inflation becomes pervasive , and other conditions are supportive , it can engulf a whole industry .
We saw
this in the financial sector in the period leading up to the crash .
The
supporting conditions or “ displacements , ” to use the terminology of Professor
Kindleberger , were financial innovation , deregulation , and obscene profits and
salaries .
These drew millions of bees to the honey .
All great manias are
accompanied by malfeasance , in this case the biggest Ponzi scheme in history
and many other lesser ones .
It is relatively easy to steal when prices are
rising and greed is pervasive .
Overspending and a general lack of prudence
always become widespread when a mania infects the general public .
Rational
people can do incredibly stupid things collectively when there is mass
hysteria .
The origins of post - war inflation go back to the late 1950s and early 1960s , though
some would take it back much further .
In the 1960s , the US dollar started to
come under pressure as a result of US inflationary policy and foreign central
banks ’ ebbing confidence in their large and growing dollar reserve holdings .
The US responded with controls and government intervention in a number of
areas : gold convertibility , the US Treasury bond market , the Interest
Equalization Tax , and , ultimately , intervention on wages and prices .
These
moves clearly flagged to the world that external discipline would be subjugated
to domestic employment and growth concerns .
The policy was formalized when the
US terminated the link between gold and the dollar in August 1971 , essentially
floating the dollar and setting the US on a course of sustained inflation .
Of
course , the dollar floated down , which , among other things , triggered the
massive rise in general prices in the 1970s .
The next episode of credit inflation began in the 1980s , paradoxically triggered by
the success of Paul Volcker ’s move to break the spiral of rising general price
inflation through very tight money .
He succeeded famously , and the CPI headed
sharply lower along with interest rates , setting the stage for the massive US
debt binge and the series of asset bubbles that followed .
It was easy for the
Federal Reserve to pursue expansionary credit policies while inflation and
interest rates were falling .
The Great Reflation Experiment of 2009
Private sector credit , the flipside of debt , maintained a stable trend relative to GDP
from 1964 to 1982 ( Charts 1& 2 ) .
After that , the ratio of debt to GDP rose
rapidly for the 25 years leading up to the crash , and is continuing to rise .
The current reading has debt close to 180 % of GDP , about double the level of
the early 1980s .
The magnitude and length of this rise is probably
unprecedented in the history of the world .
Even the credit inflation that was
the prelude to the 1929 crash and the Great Depression only lasted five or six
years .
Prior to government bailouts and stimulus , the panic , crash , and precipitous economic decline of 2008 / 9 were
clearly on track to be much worse than the post - 1929 experience .
The
pervasiveness of leverage – from banks to consumers to supposedly
blue - chip companies – and the illusion of stability in the system , were
fostered through the 25 years that this credit bubble has grown , basically
uninterrupted .
The speed and magnitude of the bailouts and stimulus – the
end of which we wo n’t see for a long time – aborted the meltdown .
However , the story is far from over .
The Great Reflation Experiment ultimately has two components .
The first is a rise in federal government
deficits , debt , and contingent liabilities .
The second is an expansion of the
Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet .
Both are unprecedented since World War II .
US
federal government debt is likely to reach close to 100 % of GDP over the next 8
to10 years , according to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) and supported by
our own calculations ( Chart 3 ) .
Anemic growth , falling tax revenue , increased
government spending , and bailouts of indigent states , households , businesses , along
with an aging population , will all undermine public finances to a degree never
before seen in peacetime .
According to CBO data , government debt could reach
300 % of GDP by 2050 as contingent liabilities are converted into actual
government expenditures .
This massive peacetime deterioration in public
finances will have grave consequences for living standards and asset markets ,
particularly in the longer run .
In the short run , huge deficits and growth in government debt are necessary .
They will continue to play a crucial
role in deleveraging the private sector and in helping to fill the black hole
in the economy that has been caused by the sharp increase in household savings .
Further out , government deficits will put upward pressure on interest rates .
However , much of the economy , particularly housing and commercial real estate ,
is far too weak to absorb an interest - rate shock .
Therefore , the Federal
Reserve will have to monetize much of the rise in government debt , making it
extremely difficult to unwind the explosion in the Fed ’s balance sheet and
consequent rise in bank reserves – the fuel that could be used to ignite
another money and credit explosion .
The bottom line is that the Fed is in a very difficult position .
Its room to maneuver is either small or nonexistent ,
and the markets understand this .
That is why there is a sharp divergence between
those worried about price inflation and those fearing a lengthy depression .
Implications for Investors
Investors are also in an extraordinarily difficult predicament .
From the peak in 2007 ,
household wealth declined by about $ 14 trillion , over 20 % , to the first quarter
of 2009 .
Tens of millions of people had come to rely on rising house and stock
prices to give them a standard of living that could not be attained from
regular income alone ( Chart 4 ) .
They stopped saving and borrowed aggressively and
imprudently against their assets and future income , some to live better , some
to speculate , and many to do both .
That game is over .
Pensions have been devastated and people ’s appetite for risk has declined dramatically .
The return on safe liquid
assets ranges from 0.60 % to 1.20 % , depending on term and withdrawal penalties .
Reasonable - quality bonds with a five - year maturity provide about 4 % .
Bonds with
longer maturities have higher yields but are vulnerable to price erosion if
inflationary expectations heat up .
As for equities , people now understand that
blue chip stocks carry huge risk .
GE , once considered the ultimate “ bullet - proof ”
stock , dropped 83 % in the panic , and Citigroup lost 98 % .
Revelations of massive
fraud schemes have further damaged trust and confidence in markets .
Against this backdrop we offer a few thoughts .
First , an increase in price inflation as
reflected in the CPI is a long way off .
The degree of excess capacity in the
world is probably the greatest since the 1930s , although excess capacity does
get scrapped during recessions .
Western economies will remain depressed for
years , and China will also be important in keeping inflation down .
Its capital
investment is larger than the US ’s in absolute terms .
It is currently 40 % of
GDP and growing at 30 % per annum .
Profit margins in China will probably get
squeezed , which , together with the huge amount of underemployed labor , means
that the Chinese will keep driving their export machine at full throttle ,
continuing to flood the world with high - quality , inexpensive goods .
Therefore ,
investors who need income are probably safe holding reasonably high - quality
bonds in the five - year maturity range .
A bond ladder is a very useful tool for
most people .
Holdings are staggered over , say , a five - year time frame , and
maturing bonds are invested back into five - year bonds , keeping the portfolio
structure in the zero - to - five - year range .
In this way , some protection against
a future rise in price inflation and falling bond prices can be achieved .
Second , massive monetary stimulus is good for asset prices in the near term ( e.g .
stocks , bonds , houses , commodities ) in a world of very weak price inflation and
a soft economy .
That is true as long as the economy does not fall apart again ,
which is very unlikely given all the stimulus present and more to come if
needed .
Therefore , investors who can afford a little risk should own some
assets that will ultimately be beneficiaries of the wall of new money being
created and thrown at the economy .
There is a major risk to our relative near - term optimism , and that is the US dollar .
Foreign central banks
hold $ 2.64 trillion , overwhelmingly the largest component of world reserves .
The US role as the main reserve currency country is compromised by its
persistent inflationary policies and current account deficits , a subject high
on the agenda at the recent G - 8 meeting in Italy and referred to frequently by
China , Russia , Brazil , and others .
Foreign central banks fear a large drop in
the dollar , which would cause them potentially huge losses on their reserve
holdings .
They do n’t want more dollars , and yet they do n’t want to lose
competitive advantage by seeing their currencies go up against the dollar .
To
preserve their competitive position , they have to buy more when the dollar is
under pressure .
On the other hand , since the 1930s the US has never subjugated
domestic concerns to external discipline .
Officials may talk of a strong - dollar
policy , but their actions always speak differently .
Their attitude towards
foreign central banks is , “ We did n’t ask you to buy the dollars . ”
The US has
typically seen such buying as currency manipulation to gain an unfair trade
advantage .
The most likely outcome is a nervous dollar stalemate or , as Lawrence Summers once
described it , “ a balance of financial terror . ”
The most important central banks
will continue to hold their noses and buy the dollar to keep it from falling
too sharply .
However , this is a fragile , unstable situation , and the dollar
must fall over time .
Investors need to diversify away from this risk .
There are
three obvious ways .
The first is investing in high - quality US equities that have a majority of their
earnings and assets in hard - currency countries .
The second is investing in gold and related assets .
Gold will probably remain in a tug of war for some time .
On the
negative side , it is faced with nonexistent global price inflation , even
deflation , and a sharp decline in jewelry demand .
On the positive side ,
concerns over U. monetary and fiscal debauchery will almost certainly heat up .
As the odds of the latter increase , gold will be a major beneficiary , and
investors should have a healthy insurance position in this asset class .
Third , most foreign currencies will also benefit from these fears , and hence investors can also protect
themselves by diversifying into non-dollar assets in the best - managed
countries .
Some of these are emerging markets like China , which are liquid , in
surplus , fiscally stable , and still growing well in spite of the global
economic downturn .
If and when the world economy begins to recover , and should
price inflation stay low , asset bubbles are likely to recur .
Where and when is
always hard to tell in advance .
Good prospects are in emerging - market equities ,
commodities , and commodity - oriented countries .
So , to sum up , in the next six to 12 months we look for a weak but recovering US economy , a continued
deflationary price environment , pretty good asset and commodity markets , and
continued narrowing of credit spreads .
This view is based on the assumption
that the new money created has to go somewhere , a stable to modestly falling
dollar , and an anemic world economic recovery next year .
A buy and hold strategy has been bad advice for the past 10 years .
The S&P is down 45 % from its peak in
early 2000 .
The investment world is likely to remain very unstable in the face
of the difficult longer - run problems discussed above .
Investors , whether they
like it or not , are in the forecasting game , and forecasting is all about time
lags .
The exceptional circumstances of the current environment make any
assessment of time lags extraordinarily difficult , and mistakes will continue
to be costly .
For that reason , holding well above average liquidity , in spite
of the paltry returns , is sensible for most people whose pockets are not deep
enough to absorb another hit to their net worth .
They are in the unfortunate
position of having to wait until the air clears a bit and more aggressive
action can be taken with higher confidence .
Warren Buffet has properly reminded
us on numerous occasions that a price has to be paid for waiting for such a
time , but then most of us are n’t as rich as he is .
A Beach , New York , and Maine
I want to thank Tony and Rob for writing this week ’s letter .
You can go to their
website , www.boeckhinvestmentletter.com and see some of their recent letters , or send an email to nfo@bccl.ca and get put on their regular list for the free letter .
As you are reading this , I am hopefully reading on a beach , relaxing under an
umbrella .
Tiffani and Ryan are on a cruise in the Caribbean .
They just got
back the wedding videos from last year , and they are a hoot .
They had one
cameraman with an old Super 8 camera , so that video looks like something from
the 60s .
At some point they will put it on You Tube .
Interesting to contrast
the old format with the new .
I get back late Monday , and then leave early Wednesday for a quick trip to New
York and then on to the Shadow Fed fishing weekend organized by David Kotok .
My
youngest son , now 15 , will be with me for our fourth trip .
Maybe this year I
can catch more than he does .
So far , it has not even been close in either
quantity or quality .
Each year , we make small bets ( bragging rights are more on the line ) on where the markets will be the next
year .
So far , I am money ahead , as I get a few calls right .
Last year the
financial markets were just starting to melt down as we met .
It will be
interesting to see if any of us came close this year .
There are some fairly well - known
names in the room , so it will be interesting to see who got it right .
And even
more interesting to try and figure out where we will be next year at this time .
I will report back .
And that blank spot that was my fall travel calendar ?
Looks like I will be going to South America in the fall
( Argentina , Brazil , and Uruguay ) .
A few other dates look to be firming up .
It
has been way too long since I was in South America , and I am looking forward to
it .
Have a great week .
Your going to mix in some sci-fi with the economics reading analyst ,

When I was growing up , our house backed onto woods , a thin two - acre remnant of a once - mighty wilderness .
This was in a Maryland city where the enlightened planners had provided a number of such lingering swaths of green .
They were tame as can be , our woods , and yet at night they still filled with unfathomable shadows .
In the winter they lay deep in snow and seemed to absorb , to swallow whole , all the ordinary noises of your body and your world .
Scary things could still be imagined to take place in those woods .
It was the place into which the bad boys fled after they egged your windows on Halloween and left your pumpkins pulped in the driveway .
There were no Indians in those woods , but there had been once .
We learned about them in school .
Patuxent Indians , they ’d been called .
Swift , straight - shooting , silent as deer .
Gone but for their lovely place names : Patapsco , Wicomico , Patuxent .
A minor but undeniable aura of romance was attached to the history of Maryland , my home state : refugee Catholic Englishmen , cavaliers in ringlets and ruffs , pirates , battles , the sack of Washington , “ The Star - Spangled Banner , ” Harriet Tubman , Antietam .
And when you went out into those woods behind our house , you could feel all that history , those battles and dramas and romances , those stories .
You could work it into your games , your imaginings , your lonely flights from the turmoil or torpor of your life at home .
My friends and I spent hours there , braves , crusaders , commandos , blues and grays .
But the Wilderness of Childhood , as any kid could attest who grew up , like my father , on the streets of Flatbush in the Forties , had nothing to do with trees or nature .
I could lose myself on vacant lots and playgrounds , in the alleyway behind the Wawa , in the neighbors ’ yards , on the sidewalks .
Anywhere , in short , I could reach on my bicycle , a 1970 Schwinn Typhoon , Coke - can red with a banana seat , a sissy bar , and ape - hanger handlebars .
On it I covered the neighborhood in a regular route for half a mile in every direction .
I knew the locations of all my classmates ’ houses , the number of pets and siblings they had , the brand of popsicle they served , the potential dangerousness of their fathers .
Matt Groening once did a great Life in Hell strip that took the form of a map of Bongo ’s neighborhood .
At one end of a street that wound among yards and houses stood Bongo , the little one - eared rabbit boy .
At the other stood his mother , about to blow her stack — Bongo was late for dinner again .
Between mother and son lay the hazards — labeled angry dogs , roving gang of hooligans , girl with a crush on bongo — of any journey through the Wilderness : …
Jason Clay of the World Wildlife Fund gave a talk yesterday about video and social change , featuring the video below that tries to convince people to think through the impacts of their consumption , and what changes could be made to make use of resources more efficient .
His talk this morning looks at these issues in far more detail , asking hard questions about the sustainability of human life on a single planet in the wake of increasing consumption .
This ends up being a conversation primariy about agriculture and food production , which Clay characterizes as the single largest threat to the planet .
Clay tell us that he grew up on a Missouri farm , which he ran for five years before going to college .
He tells us that there ’s an old midwestern saying : “ If you do n’t know where you ’re going , any road will get you there . ”
In environmental terms , we need to know where we ’re going and where we are on the journey .
Ultimately , our population times consumption needs to be sustainable within the footprint of our planet – right now , we ’re consuming roughly 1.25 earth ’s worth of resources .
If China consumes at the rate that the US population does , we need two new earths just for Chinese consumers .
Clay asks whether consumers should have a choice about buying sustainable products .
His answer – nope .
They need to all be sustainable – consumers need to choose based on other metrics .
We need to focus on agricultural sustainability because agriculture is our major threat towards biodiversity .
WWF chose 35 key biodiversity locations around the world to protect – the threat to all is human impact , and the threat of agricultural and ranching encroachment is twice as large as any other threat .
We currently farm 33 % of the world ’s terrestrial surface , 57 % of non-river and mountain land .
An additional 12 % of terrestrial land is protected .
The fate of that remaining 30 % will be determined in the next few years .
Right now , we ’re seeing agricultural encroachment into forest and wetlands at 0.6 % a year .
Agriculture uses 70 % of all water on the planet .
One crop – rice – uses 14 % .
Water scarcity means that agriculture is becoming more unpredictable , more variable .
This makes it hard for farmers to borrow against their future production .
“ If American and Brazilian farmers do n’t get money to plant , we ’re going to starve . ”
We waste roughly 60 % of the water allocated towards agriculture
And we ’ve lost half our topsoil in the last 150 years .
Agriculture may provide 25 - 40 % of greenhouse gases – we do n’t really know because we do n’t know how carbon is released from soil .
And these ugly numbers all precede biofuels .
By 2050 , we ’ll have 3 billion more people in the world , and food consumption will likely triple .
That ’s because people spend money upgrading their diets before anything else , and “ better ” diets mean more animal protein .
In the US , we ’ve tried very hard to keep food inexensive – we pay less than 10 % of our income for food in the US , eating out about 40 % of the time .
But we do n’t necessarily pay for externalities .
If you buy a large burger , the farmer gets paid about $ 0.25 for the ground beef .
Growing that beef could require anywhere from 3000 to 15,000 liters of water – is that really a fair price for water ?
( Clay quipps , “ Water is the new carbon – lack of water will kill you in a couple of days , unlike climate change , which takes decades . ” )
The problem with getting a handle on these issues is that even big companies do n’t have a huge amount of control over their carbon impacts directly – Coke , Clay tells us , controls less than 15 % of their carbon impact directly , and the rest comes from the supply chain .
“ Generally carbon and water impacts are n’t under control of large brands or retailers – they occur upstream , in primary production of commodities . ”
That means that improving corporate efficiency does n’t get the job done – you need to work with suppliers and their suppliers .
When WWF looks for places where they can impact supply chains , they look at these numbers :
– 1.4 billion producers of raw materials
– 6.7 billion consumers
– 15 commodities that represent the most potential for positive environmental impact
– 300-500 companies dominate 70 - 80 % of trade in each of those commodities
– 200 companies represent 50 % of 15 commodities , and 100 represent 25 % of those 15
WWF ’s take : let ’s focus on those 100 companies .
( Cargill is , by far , the most important of these companies . )
The goal is to get them to commit to ensuring that 25 % of one of these commodities will be sustainably produced , checked against third - party standards of sustainability , buy 2020 .
These goals need to be public and transparent to avoid greenwashing .
And there ’s a ton of interest in doing this – 21 companies have already partnered with WWF , and WWF is trying to bring in 15 more a year .
Mars has committed to making 100 % of their cocoa sustainable .
That ’s important because they buy more cocoa that any other companies .
Clay theorizes that 25 % of the market is what it takes to “ flip ” a market – producers realize the economic benefits of sustainable production through higher prices and longer contracts and other producers will follow their lead in the hopes of reaching these markets .
WWF is focusing on cotton , palm oil , soy , sugar , bananas , pineapple , cocoa , coffee , wild fish , farmed salmon and shrimp , beef , pulp and paper , timber and biofuels .
Bananas , pineapple , cocoa and coffee are critical to a number of regional economies , while the other are key global commodities .
( Clay pauses to wax lyrical on aquaculture – it now produces more fish than wild caught , and the production goes in strange places .
Turns out that Mars vastly more fish than WalMart … to make cat food . )
Around each of these products , WWF convenes a roundtable to discuss global standards for impact , creating 4 - 8 key , measurable impacts that can be tracked and measurably reduced .
Once we start setting standards and monitoring impacts , we ’re able to answer tricky questions , like whether we ’re better buying local or not from a greenhouse gas point of view .
It turns out that transport is only a tiny component in the carbon footprint of most products – 85 % of greenhouse gas is attributable to production .
So we ’ve now got good studies that demonstrate that it ’s far smarter from a carbon impact to raise lamb in New Zealand , freeze it and ship it to the UK than to grow locally .
This sort of analysis turns into uncomfortable news for environmentalists .
Tesco looked into building more small stores and encouraging people to walk to them , rather than big stores with parking lots .
They discovered that the carbon impact of the food people eat to power their walk to the store outpaces the gains from reduced car usage !
The analysis of a grande latte – in the video above – shows that a company like Starbucks uses almost no water in producing a beverage , a few liters in producing a cup and lid , and hundreds in growing the coffee .
You can bring a recyclable cup , and you ’ll save some water … but if you really want to save water , you need to address the supply chain .
Clay looks closely at China ’s increased consumption of pork – China has more pigs than the rest of the world combined .
As China eats further up the food chain , they ’re buying massive amounts of soy from Brazil .
That soy is grown on former rain forest .
Brazil is basically exporting soil and water to China in the form of soy , cotton and sugar .
We ’ve got to find some way of increasing productivity if this trade is going to continue .
There are eight key crops in the world which are responsible for 50 % of the world ’s calories .
We need a 3 % growth rate in production to meet our food needs – the two most critical crops , wheat and rice ( which provide 80 % of the globe ’s calories ) , have less than a 1 % growth rate .
None of the crops with a growth rate over 2 % grow in the tropics .
So we may need to get tricky .
Mars discovered that 20 % of cocoa trees were responsible for 80 % of their suppliers ’ crops .
And they discovered that providing water during the dry season doubled production .
Between careful irrigation and sequencing genes to discover the most productive cocoa strains , Mars predicts that their producers can grow 300 - 400 % of their crops on 30 - 40 % of currently farmed land .
The rest can grow trees to sequester carbon , act as grazing land or as watershed .
And it ’s possible these techniques could be applied to oil palm and cassava , critical food crops in cocoa producing regions .
As meat consumption moves to the developing world , so does meat production .
For meat to be 10 % of the world ’s calories , we can raise meat using nothing more than agricultural waste .
But to bring meat production to 20 % of calories , we need to double world grain production , which is just not possible .
So we need to get more efficient .
The humble fish stick is a miracle of engineering – it allows us to use 60 - 70 % of the weight of a fish , and the remainer can go towards aquaculture feed .
Fish will soon replace poultry , which was the previous miracle protein .
( Think tilapia or catfish .
Not much flavor , but the goal is to create a protein - rich substrate for spices . )
Poultry efficiency – in terms of converting grain calories into protein ones – has doubled in efficiency every eight years over the past century .
Now we need to look at other metrics .
Producing a kilo of chicken requires 32 liters of water …
Brazilian farmers figured out how to bring the numbers down to 16 liters .
But the grain to feed the chicken requires 2500 liters per kilo – if we can reduce that 10 % , we ’ll see an amazing impact .
We get even bigger impacts through rehabilitating abused and abandoned land .
In Brazil , farmers are buying land at 10 cents on the dollar and letting it grow grasses for five years .
They ’re able to borrow against the land , because when it ’s rehabilitated , it ’s more productive than agricultural land in use .
In Borneo , farmers are buying land that was abused and planting oil palms – Clay says they ’re selling carbon sequestration and palm oil simultaneously .
Business models that have multiple impacts at the same time are Clay ’s obsession .
He talks about conversations he ’s had with Dupont about capturing sulphur from coal - burning energy plants .
His idea – Dupont should capture nitrogen and sulfur and give it away to fertilizer producers .
They ’ll retain the rights to trade NOx and SOx credits .
He predicts the model is so profitable that Dupont will be compelled to put the technology in for free in Indian and Chinese coal plants .
Making these systems work requires monitoring the commodities produced .
When agricultural standards emerged , they came into play to allow people to make purchases sight unseen , defined by specifications – a bushel of # 2 corn was a certain color , a certain quality and a cerain moisture .
We ’re now asking to buy products with values that are n’t verifiable through careful analysis .
Was this organically produced ?
Does it contain GM materials ?
What ’s the water usage ?
Is it fair trade ?
Was child labor involved ?
We do n’t sell cocoa and child labor separately – we sell cocoa that ’s free of child labor .
We can – and need to – sell commodities bundled with cerain water and standards as well .
This wo n’t necessarily add cost – we ’re capable of being more efficient with water and carbon footprints .
But it will require third - party verification .
Clay wants to see market standards emerge , before government standards come into play , because he believes markets will set a higher bar .
He also believes we need to get over the idea of having completely separate supply chains .
“ You do n’t buy green energy .
You buy the bragging rights about green energy . ”
As long as a company is producing a certain amount of energy sustainably , you do n’t care if your electrons come from coal or water .
Perhaps a similar blurring can take place in agricultural markets .
I thought that this was one of the most revolutionary talks I ’ve heard in a long time .
Clay argues that , while consumers can have a modest impact on the environment , the real change needs to happen at corporate supply chain levels .
This calls into question lots of well - meaning green orthodoxy .
If it does n’t matter all that much if you bring a recyclable cup to the coffee shop – at least in comparison to the coffee production – what other “ truths ” do we need to examine more closely ?
One questioner asks whether we would n’t benefit from small , polyculture farms throughout the world .
Clay administers “ tough love ” in response – polyculture ’s great to feed a family , but it probably wo n’t get it out of poverty in the same way that selling commodities will .
And small farmers have the biggest impact per ton of any on the planet .
It ’s not a scaleable way to produce food and address these issues of carbon and water .
I raised the concern that some of the well - meaning green efforts are paradoxically bad for the environment , citing Tesco ’s “ carbon count ” … which encouraged consumers to buy less sustainable produce from Britain than more sustainable from Kenya .
It turned an environmental good faith gesture into a retrograde action in green terms , as well as a damaging form of protectionism .
On the other hand , people clearly want to do the right thing as environmentalists – they just do n’t know what it is .
Clay suggests that it ’s an and , not an or – we can take actions in our lives , but we need good data to make the right choices .
But we also need to take actions as citizens .
We can become informed on these issues and put thoughtful pressure on large corporations to change .
He suggests letters to the Cokes and Nestles of the world , suggesting that a dozen letters is worth far more than thousands of Greenpeace postcards .
I was thrilled to see Saul Griffith – who gave the other best talk on these subjects I ’ve attended in recent years – in the audience .
That talk , at last year ’s ETEch , looked closely at global power production and consumption and each of our personal footprints .
Talking with Saul afterwards , I noted that he ’d responded to his research by making massive personal changes in his life – travelling less , becoming mostly vegetarian .
Clay ’s talk seemed to suggest that the real impacts come at a corporate level , while Saul wondered whether there ’s a moral responsibility that comes from understanding this sort of calculus .
Saul assures me that the perspectives are compatible – I ’d love to continue the conversation with them both to see whether the answer is that we should apply pressure for big changes at a corporate or government level , or whether we need personal change as well .
A massive simulated earthquake will rock a six - story wooden condominium to the brink of collapse Tuesday , during one of the largest shake - table experiments undertaken to date .
The simulation , which will be webcast live July 14 at 11 a.m. EDT on the National Science Foundation website , is designed to test how a mid-rise wood - frame building would stand up to shaking from an earthquake around magnitude 7.5 .
Update :
This post was updated Wednesday morning to include video from the shake experiment , below .
“ We ’re taking it to an earthquake level that ’s associated with being on the verge of collapse , ” said civil engineer Michael Symans of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , who helped design the test building .
“ We do n’t expect it to collapse , but we expect it to be very vulnerable to a strong aftershock that could cause it to collapse . ”
The 23 - unit condo building currently sits on the world ’s largest shake table , a 50 - by - 60 - foot structure in Miki , Japan .
The table will simulate the motions of the 1994 earthquake in Northridge , California , amplified about 1.5 times .
Sensors on each floor of the building will record motion and detect internal damage , generating valuable data about how wooden structures perform in a quake .
Although wooden buildings are cheaper and faster to construct than those made of steel , very few mid-rise structures in the United States are currently built of wood .
“ Even in seismically vulnerable parts of the West Coast , there just is n’t much of an understanding of how taller wood structures will behave under ground shaking , ” Symans said .
“ It might be desirable to build in wood , but at this point that ’s not an option from a building - code point of view , partially because we just do n’t know what will happen in an earthquake . ”
The test marks the final experiment in a four - year collaboration called the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Wood project , funded by a $ 1.4 million grant from NSF and donated materials from the industrial manufacturer Simpson Strong - Tie .
The project ’s first experiment subjected a two - story wooden house to a magnitude 6.7 earthquake , which severely damaged the structure .
The engineers determined that homes built to current building standards might not topple during a large earthquake , but they ’d likely never be livable again .
For the current test , they experimented with new design principles meant to help the condominium withstand shaking .
“ Basically , what happens during an earthquake in multiple - story building is something called a ‘ soft story , ' ” said civil engineer John van de Lindt of Colorado State University , who led the condo design .
“ It ’s not as stiff as the story above it , and the earthquake demands more stiffness from the lower story .
This can develop into a pancake collapse , which damages the building and can kill people . ”
The new design distributes the stiffness vertically throughout the height of the building , van de Lindt said , to reduce the chance of a soft - story collapse .
On June 30 and July 6 , engineers subjected the condo to preliminary testing , seen in the video below .
In the two smaller earthquake simulations , the building sustained very little damage .
“ So far , it looks like it ’s working like a charm , ” he said .
“ If there were families living in this condo , they would n’t even have to move out . ”
Tuesday ’s quake may be a different story .
Numerical models predict a 3 percent drift , which means that each story of the building will shift over about three inches — enough to cause significant damage , but not enough to cause collapse .
The only way to validate the computer models is to do a full - scale simulation , and that ’s something that ’s never been done before on such a large building .
“ The reality is that we really do n’t know what will happen , ” Symans said .

LOVE QUOTES
" Love is a temporary madness .
It erupts like an earthquake and then subsides .
And when it subsides you have to make a decision .
You have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part .
Because this is what love is .
Love is not breathlessness , it is not excitement , it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion .
That is just being " in love " which any of us can convince ourselves we are .
Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away , and this is both an art and a fortunate accident .
Your mother and I had it , we had roots that grew towards each other underground , and when all the pretty blossom had fallen from our branches we found that we were one tree and not two .

Now we know why Google Voice apps were only released for BlackBerry and Android .
Apple rejected Google 's official Google Voice app when it was submitted for approval six weeks ago .
What .
The .
Shit .

Here 's the quote from the Google spokesperson to TechCrunch :
" We work hard to bring Google applications to a number of mobile platforms , including the iPhone .
Apple did not approve the Google Voice application we submitted six weeks ago to the Apple App Store .
We will continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users - for example , by taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers . "

This news comes on the heels of Sean Kovacs ' GV Mobile Google Voice app being pulled from the store for " duplicating features . "
Even though , TechCrunch relates , Phil Schiller himself personally approved GV Mobile and called Kovacs to apologize when its initial approval was delayed months ago .
TechCrunch suspects , probably correctly , that apps for Google Voice are being rejected at least in part through AT&T 's influence , since Google Voice lets you send free text messages and delivers cut -rate international calls — on top of making phone numbers even more meaningless — making it scary to AT&T in way like Skype VoIP over 3G .
Either way , it seems obvious the Google Voice service is being targeted for extinction , at least as a native app on the iPhone .
Google plans to take the same route it was forced to take with Latitude on the iPhone — web app land .
It 's an interesting switch for Google and Apple on the app front , actually .
Google was noted for getting away with using private APIs in its Google Mobile app to make the voice search command work .
Now Apple 's rejected two of its major apps in a row , in a way validating Google 's belief that web apps are the future anyway .
Advertisement
It seems somewhat silly , and a bit of a reach , to insinuate the rejections are signs of brewing hostilities between Apple and Google , but you have to figure if there were n't any behind the rejections , they 've at least got to be causing some anxiety by now .
Advertisement
Whatever the reasons , it sucks , and as Jason Kincaid says , what 's really troubling about this rejection is that it appears that " Apple is now actively stifling innovation . "
And the whole black box app approval process does n't exactly alleviate that sinking feeling either .
After all , if Google does n't stand a chance , how does anybody else ?

Graphics Enhancements
In Windows 7
When Microsoft officially releases Windows 7 on October 22 , 2009 , they will be delivering to the world what they promised Windows Vista would be ... with a few nifty extras , of course .
So , you can't blame some folks for skipping Windows Vista and hanging onto Windows XP while Microsoft gets Windows 7 working .
Beta testers have so far been very impressed with Windows 7 .
It 's fast and it 's stable .
One of the reasons is the improved graphics capability in Windows 7 .
Microsoft seemed hesitant in utilizing the full capabilities of the graphics processor in Windows Vista , which was a real shame .
Windows 7 changes all that , and that 's what we will be talking about today .
Back in June , we first revealed inside information on the kind of improvement in graphics that you will see in Windows 7 .
That first article focused on DirectX improvements in Windows 7 , which covers everything from Direct 2D to Direct3D 11 .
This article will refer to the same topics , albeit in much less detail , so be sure to give our in - depth article on Direct3D Improvements
In Windows 7 a read .
In this article , we will focus on the Windows 7 graphical desktop , which will also include everything from Aero to 3D gaming and video playback .
Although Microsoft has publicly revealed some details on some of these improvements , this article will give you the full details .
Windows 7 Graphical Desktop
Windows 7 builds upon the work done on harnessing the GPU for acceleration of desktop elements as well as games in Windows Vista .
The Windows 7 graphical desktop now makes full use of the 2D , 3D and video engines of the GPU in these ways :
2D Engine : The Windows 7 WDDM 1.1 driver model introduces graphics device interface ( GDI ) hardware acceleration of the GPU 's 2D engine .
This reduces the memory footprint of Aero .
The Windows 7 WDDM 1.1 driver model introduces graphics device interface ( GDI ) hardware acceleration of the GPU 's 2D engine .
This reduces the memory footprint of Aero. 3D Engine : The Windows 7 Desktop Windows Manager ( DWM ) has better support for Direct3D 10 and introduces support for Direct2D and Direct3D 11 .
The Windows 7 Desktop Windows Manager ( DWM ) has better support for Direct3D 10 and introduces support for Direct2D and Direct3D 11 .
Video Engine : The Windows 7 WDDM 1.1 driver model introduces several optional features for video playback that will help standardize playback of high - definition content through DirectX Video Acceleration - High Definition ( DXVA - HD ) .
It will also improve both the security of graphics data as well as overlay presentations .
Let 's take a closer look at these improvements .

Pakistan 's fight against the Taliban is an illusion .
The world may view it as a battle for Pakistan 's soul , but the generals in Rawalpindi , with whom real power rests , are not so sure .
If they were , 200,000 of their finest fighters would n't be chewing grass on the eastern border with India while the so - called battle for Pakistan 's survival rages on in the north - west .
Blackmailing the world by threatening imminent collapse is vintage Pakistan .
Recently , President Asif Ali Zardari told Der Spiegel that the safety of Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal depended entirely upon how well the world supported democracy in his battered country .
" If democracy in this country fails , if the world does n't help democracy , " he warned , " then any eventuality is possible . "
Having placed the burden of Pakistan 's recovery from the mire of its own making on the world 's shoulders , Zardari listed the " help " that his government expected : " billions of dollars " .
But Pentagon documents released earlier this month give an alarming account of where the benignant billions of aid dollars poured into Pakistan 's coffers over the last decade have ended up : on the most modern weaponry – combat aircraft , laser - guided kits , anti-ship missiles , air - to - air missiles – for use against India .
Under the cloak of this conflict , Pakistan has equipped itself for battle with its traditional enemy , rapidly increasing its nuclear weapons at the same time .
The Taliban 's recent targets have unsettled their erstwhile paymasters , but nothing seems to deter Islamabad from continuing with its policy of patronising Islamic extremists – so long as they are devoted to destroying India .
Punjab is littered with these groups .
In Lahore last month , Yahya Mujahid told me that his group , the banned Jamat - ud - Dawah , would continue to fight against Indian rule in Kashmir .
The operations " have gone somewhat cold " , he admitted .
But he spoke confidently and strode assuredly – a man who knew things would turn in his favour .
Three weeks later , Hafiz Saeed , Jamat - ud - Dawah 's leader , who had been detained after India produced several dossiers linking him to last November 's Mumbai attacks , was freed .
Among the reasons cited by the Lahore high court in ordering Saeed 's release was this bolt from the blue : " The security laws and anti-terrorism laws of Pakistan are silent on al - Qaida being a terrorist organisation . "
The trial was a farce , a repetition of Pakistan 's time - tested tactic of appearing to act against anti-India jihadis while not taking any action at all .
Mani Shankar Aiyar once described Pakistan as a country " divided against itself , but united against India " .
From that delusional feudal megalomaniac Zulfi Bhutto's pledge to wage a " thousand - year war " against India to General Pervez Musharraf 's desperate attempt in 1999 to nuke it , hatred of India has been the constitutive sine qua non for Pakistan 's survival .
It is the one bugbear that makes Pakistanis out of Sindhis and Baluchis , Pathans and Punjabis .
Many Pakistanis
I spoke to agreed that their country has gone to the dogs .
But Kashmir still evokes the romantic idea of a Muslim nationhood .
Pakistan continues to be defined by the struggle that created it – a struggle founded upon the premise that Muslims and Hindus can not co-exist in one nation .
With all of India 's social failings , its success at forging a nationality out of its diversity stands as a towering repudiation of this idea , and merely by being itself , impeaches the logic of partition .
Pakistan cannot justify its existence as long as India accommodates religious diversity .
It is not enough that Pakistan is a Muslim country : for its creation to be truly vindicated , the country it was carved out of must be Hindu .
As long as Kashmir , a Muslim - majority state , remains part of India , Pakistan will view partition as unfinished business and itself as its incomplete product .
But the Pakistan that was created in 1947 ceased to exist in 1971 with the creation of Bangladesh – in a manner that does n't just cast deep moral questions on Pakistan 's claim to speak for Kashmiri Muslims , but also offers an object lesson against indulging procrustean nationalisms , of which Pakistan remains a paragon .
Created expressly to safeguard the Muslims of the subcontinent , Pakistan perpetrated the biggest genocide of Muslims since the arrival of Islam in south Asia .
At least 3 million East Pakistanis in what is now Bangladesh were slaughtered by West Pakistani soldiers within the space of a few months in 1971 .
The Islamic bond which animates Pakistan 's jihadist policy in Kashmir was absent during this massacre .
It was secular India , its forces led entirely by non-Hindus – a Muslim air marshal ( Idris Latif ) , a Sikh commander of ground forces ( JS Aurora ) , a Parsi chief of army ( Sam Manekshaw ) , and a Jewish strategist and principal negotiator ( JFR Jacob ) – which intervened to liberate Pakistanis from the madness of Pakistan .
What remained of Pakistan in 1971 became a plaything of the military - feudal - political elite who turned it into a back office for the outsourced wars of big powers .
Three decades later , Pakistan represents state failure , religious extremism , terrorism , nuclear proliferation .
Few dispensations have failed their people on the scale that Pakistan has : it exists solely to provide subsistence to the military establishment .
Within the next 20 years , Pakistan as we know it today will probably not exist .
Built on the idea that differences between people must ultimately culminate in permanent division , Pakistan has become a victim of the very logic that created it : from Karachi in the south - east to Peshawar in the north - west , Jinnah 's children are carrying his divisive message to its logical extreme .
The tragedy is that this is not an aberration , but the acme , of the idea of Pakistan .
• This article was amended on 21 December 2011 .
It originally stated that at least 7 million East Pakistanis were killed by West Pakistani soldiers in 1971 .
This has now been corrected

The boys were told to write down what they had seen A figure with a lemon - shaped head told two boys to follow it in an apparent close encounter with aliens in Staffordshire , government files say .
The figure told the boys : " We want you , come with us , " according to a report from 1995 which has been released by the Ministry of Defence .
The boys told police they had seen the figure in a field just before midnight on 4 May in Chasetown .
However the farmer who owned the field later told police he had seen nothing .
The boys had run to the police station and asked the officers to come outside and look across the distance at a glowing red saucer - shaped object .
' Come with us '
The officers thought it was an aircraft .
Their report said they boys appeared " agitated and distressed " after gazing at the alleged UFO .
I could hardly breathe and we turned around , it just shot off in the air and the sky did n't light up .
It just went .
Vanished
Boy 's account of the UFO
They said it had emitted an intense heat before zig - zagging off east to west .
" They stated the object was about four houses high in the sky and about 40ft away from them , " said the report .
" They then , reluctantly , went on to say that a voice which came from a lemon - like head , which appeared beneath the machine , said ' we want you , come with us ' .
" Both appeared upset and shocked and as such it was increasingly difficult to obtain detailed information from them . "
The police sent the boys home and told them to write up their account .
Ran away
One said he was drawn to the field off Rugeley Road , Burntwood , by an intense heat .
He said when they walked into the field there had been a flash of light and a spaceship allegedly appeared , which had sent his friend 's face " the colour of beetroot " .
His friend said after hearing the command to go with the lemon - headed figure , he " just said ' run ' " .
He added : " I could hardly breathe and we turned around , it just shot off in the air and the sky did n't light up .
" It just went .
Vanished . "
He said the boys did not want to tell anyone because they thought they would not be believed .
The report said police visited the site two days later and found a farmer spraying his crops .
He said he had seen nothing unusual .

FF13 Graphics Changes in Action August 2 , 2009
Some of the graphical changes made by Square Enix to later builds of Final Fantasy XIII are becoming clear when released screenshots are studied and compared by fans .
Two released screenshots are almost identical but are from different builds , giving fans a look at changes made to the game engine .
The question on the lips of many fans will be why these changes have been made .
The first screenshot here was released by Square Enix in August 2008 , before Advent Children Complete shipped .
This screenshot is from the older build of the game .
Before moving on to the next screen , make note of the floor textures , rocky sea and the hair of the characters .
The next image is a screen from the video featured on the exclusive Final Fantasy XIII footage found on the Western Advent Children Complete Disc - and a later build of the game than the screenshot above .
Take note again of the changes in the floor texture - in this newer build of the game it is a slightly more simple design .
The sea is considerably less choppy and the hair of the characters is quite different - possibly rendered in a different way .
More subtle changes in the images include the textures of Lightning 's clothes and her shoulders are considerably less rounded in the later build .
The game also appears to have added depth of field effects , throwing the Snow and Vanille in the background out of focus .
Us at UFFSite ?
We believe that the early shots were likely doctored , improved or running on the Crystal Tools engine on PC - we 're likely now just seeing true screenshots of the game , which still look amazing .
The real question is , which one looks better ?

" MySpace mom " Lori Drew has had her misdemeanor guilty verdict overturned by the federal judge handling the case , the LA Times reports .
Violating a website 's terms of use is not , it seems , a federal crime after all .
Horrible things are n't always crimes
The guilty verdict against Lori Drew , prosecutors crowed , would send an " overwhelming message " to online bullies .
Though she escaped conviction on felony charges , the 49 - year - old Missouri mom could have still faced three years in prison or fines of up to $ 300,000 for launching an online harassment campaign that ended in the suicide of a teenage neighbor .
Drew was due to be sentenced today .
But the " message , " legal observers worried , may be that anyone who uses a website without paying close attention to those ubiquitous Terms of Service risks committing a federal crime .
The judge shared those concerns .
Drew 's story is , by now , familiar : Concerned that her daughter Sara was being badmouthed by a former friend , 13 - year - old Megan Meier , Drew took protective parenting way too far .
Together with Sara and an employee , Drew created a MySpace account for a fictional teen boy , " Josh Evans , " who would extract evidence of Megan 's trash talk .
But after luring the girl in with flirtatious banter , the prank took a crueler turn , and " Josh " unleashed a barrage of vicious insults — publishing a number of Megan 's intimate messages to salt the wound .
The sudden betrayal proved too much for Megan , who had a history of depression :
The girl hanged herself in her closet on an October afternoon in 2006 .
The story provoked widespread outrage , both in Drew 's hometown and around the Internet .
But when local authorities determined that Drew and her accomplices did not appear to have violated any criminal laws , California - based U.S. Attorney Thomas O'Brien stepped in , claiming jurisdiction on the grounds that MySpace 's servers were located in Los Angeles .
O'Brien had a legal theory as unorthodox as his assertion of authority .
MySpace may be full of bogus or pseudonymous profiles , but the site 's terms of service technically require all users to provide " truthful and accurate " registration information .
Since use of the site is conditional on acceptance of those terms , prosecutors argued , use in violation of those terms constituted " unauthorized access " to MySpace 's computers .
And " unauthorized access " violated a provision of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act intended to apply to computer hackers .
" Unauthorized access " is a mere misdemeanor — and that 's all the jury was willing to find Drew guilty of .
But the charge can be elevated to a felony if that access is " in furtherance " of some other illicit act , whether a crime or a civil tort .
So , for instance , upload a few minutes of copyrighted video to YouTube , and you 've violated the site 's terms of service while simultaneously committing copyright infringement .
Congratulations , you 're a felon !
The prosecution 's theory brought together some strange bedfellows in opposition to the criminalization of ToS violations .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed an amicus brief calling the case a threat to online free speech .
And the conservative Heritage Foundation called the prosecution an affront to the rule of law , warning , " If Lori Drew is convicted , we all , as Americans , will have to suffer the greater consequences . "
A New York Times analysis in the wake of the verdict opened with the rhetorical question : " Is lying about one ’s identity on the Internet now a crime ? "
Lori drew and her cohorts testified that they had n't read MySpace 's terms of service before embarking on their harassment campaign .
Most people probably do n't — and there 's some reason to think that 's a good thing .
A study published in October 2008 estimated that if everybody read the privacy policies on websites they frequented , the aggregate time lost would impose costs of up to $ 365 billion in lost productivity .
Judge George
Wu has now concluded that Drew 's behavior was not in fact a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ; his written opinion explaining that conclusion will appear next week .
He appears to have concurred with the EFF , however , that " by its plain terms , the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits trespass and theft , not more contractual violations of terms of use . "
Because no facts are in dispute — only matters of legal interpretation —
Wu has the power to override the jury 's verdict in the case .

| POLITICO Staff White House disables e-tip box
Following a furor over how the data would be used , the White House has shut down an electronic tip box — [ email protected ] — that was set up to receive information on “ fishy ” claims about President Barack Obama ’s health plan .
E -mails to that address now bounce back with the message : “ The e-mail address you just sent a message to is no longer in service .
We are now accepting your feedback about health insurance reform via http://www.whitehouse.gov/realitycheck.”

The “ flag ” service was introduced Aug. 4 , with a White House blog post saying : “ There is a lot of disinformation about health insurance reform out there , spanning from control of personal finances to end of life care .
These rumors often travel just below the surface via chain emails or through casual conversation .
Since we ca n’t keep track of all of them here at the White House , we ’re asking for your help .
If you get an email or see something on the web about health insurance reform that seems fishy , send it to [ email protected ] ”
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said at a briefing shortly after the service launched : “ We 're not collecting names from those e-mails . …
All we 're asking people to do is if they 're confused about what health care reform is going to mean to them , we 're happy to help clear that up for you .
Nobody is keeping anybody 's names . ”
Sen . John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , wrote a letter to Obama raising privacy concerns about what the senator called an “ Obama monitoring program . ”
“ I can only imagine the level of justifiable outrage had your predecessor asked Americans to forward e-mails critical of his policies to the White House , ” Cornyn wrote .
“ So I urge you to cease this program immediately . ”
In a later statement , Cornyn said : “ Of course the White House is collecting names . …
It is inevitable .
Anyone with access to the [ email protected ] account has access to the names and email addresses that are collected in that account . …
How are they purging names and e-mail addresses from this account to protect privacy ? ”
Mr Holding , a former army reservist , set off alone on Saturday to tackle Victoria 's second highest peak - Mount Feathertop .
He sent a text message to his partner at 6.30 pm to say he had arrived at Federation Hut and expected to arrive home at 4 pm yesterday .
The alarm was raised when he had not returned by 9.30 pm .
Mr Holding 's father received weak telephone contact from his son late last night .
Premier John Brumby said the minister ’s father , Bruce , said he had received the phone contact at 10.30 pm on Sunday night .
‘‘ The area concerned , as you know , has got poor reception and conditions were very bad , ’’ Mr Brumby said .
‘‘ He [ Bruce Holding ] got the call back , so it showed the number had come back from Tim ’s phone , but the call did n’t get through . ’’
Mr Overland said police remained hopeful of finding Mr Holding .
" He is an experienced bushwalker .
We have n't given up hope on him , " Mr Overland said .
Most of the search teams , including police , the State Emergency Service ( SES ) and volunteers from Search and Rescue Victoria , are expected to shelter at Federation Hut tonight .
Another six were camping on the western side of the mountain .
Mr Brumby said he was increasingly concerned about Mr Holding ’s welfare , saying it was too dangerous for rescuers to search through the night .
" He ’s an experienced bushwalker , he would have presumably bedded down , but they are difficult conditions . "
Earlier today , a team of bushwalking volunteers from Melbourne arrived in Bright to join the search for the Water Minister .
Bush Search and Rescue Victoria convenor Frank Zgoznik said the conditions were difficult and it was likely to be icy on the summit .
‘‘ We ’re heading up three different routes up the the summit and it will probably take us till the evening to get there , ’’ he said .
There was no chance of sending a helicopter up this evening , so the search party would work in teams of four in an effort to cover as much ground as possible , he said earlier today .
Searchers have packed three days ’ worth of equipment , including ice axes , harnesses , crampons and ropes .
He said the temperature was expected to be about zero or below .
‘‘ We might find ice , we might find some dry snow , ’’ Mr Zgoznik said .
Transport Minister Lynne Kosky arrived in Bright today to lend support to Mr Holding ’s parents and his partner , who have been briefed by police at Bright station .
A police spokeswoman said Mr Holding was '' fairly well - prepared for being out on the mountain overnight with a couple of thermals , a Gore - tex jacket , tent and dehydrated camping food ’’ .
Ms Kosky said she was optimistic that her colleague would be found alive .
" Tim ’s very prepared .
He ’s done a lot of bushwalking and so we ’re just looking forward to catching up with him at the end of all this , ’’ Ms Kosky said .
Mr Holding told a group of bushwalkers yesterday morning he had changed his mind about climbing to the peak of Mount Feathertop because of the dangerous conditions .
The bushwalkers are the last people to have seen the minister .
The 37 - year - old minister spoke to the walkers about 8.30 am as they made their way to Federation Hut on the mountain and Mr Holding walked north .
Acting Superintendent Wayne Rotherham said Mr Holding told the group he had intended to climb to the top but had changed his mind and would head back towards his car , which remains parked at the base of the mountain .
‘‘ He had [ planned to walk to the summit ] but he had decided that he was n’t going to now because it was too steep .
He said he was going to make his way back to the car , ’’ Acting Superintendent Rotherham said .
He said searchers were taking three different routes towards the small track where Mr Holding was last seen , not far from Federation Hut .
‘‘ We are focusing on that area and fanning out from there , ’’ he said .
‘‘ We do n’t know if he continued walking or took a different track .
There are a number of tracks that go from there , so we have different search teams going in from different locations but obviously it is very difficult because of the terrain and conditions . ’’
Low cloud , wind and snow are hampering the search , with helicopters unable to be used because of poor visibility .
Mr Holding stayed at Federation Hut on Saturday night as the temperature plummeted to minus seven .
A bushwalker who also spent the night in the hut told online his walking group set off about 30 minutes after the minister left the hut for a solo hike about 7.30 am .
As the group headed towards Mount Feathertop they saw the minister ’s footprints veering off the path .
Police last night picked up a weak signal from Mr Holding ’s mobile phone but have been unable to use it to pinpoint his location .
Acting Superintendent Rotherham said Mr Holding ’s phone could be low on power or out of range , or may have been dropped by the minister .
Victorian Premier John Brumby says he is concerned that his friend and colleague ’s mobile phone is ‘‘ inactive ’ ’ .
He said Mr Holding was an experienced hiker who had tackled the Kokoda Track .
He was well - equipped with food , a tent and sleeping bag but did not have snow shoes or an emergency beacon .
Earlier , State Emergency Service state duty officer Jeff Cartwright said an extra 12 specially trained alpine SES searchers would help police look for Mr Holding today .
He said ‘‘ white - outs ’’ were possible in low cloud and snow which made it difficult to tell where the ground ended and horizon began .
Mount Feathertop is the second - highest mountain in Victoria at 1922 metres and is popular with walkers .
Located near the town of Bright in Victoria ’s north - east , it is often known as the Queen of the Victorian Alps .
About 5,000 hikers tackle the summit of Mount Feathertop every year , but few in winter and alone .
Locals say the track can be treacherous in snow , with nearby Mt Hotham recording a 89 cm fall yesterday .
" I have n't got a good feeling about it , but that does n't mean much , '' the operator of a Bright outdoor store , who gave his name only as Stephen , said .
" I 've been here probably in Bright now 30 years and there 's been a few who have been lost and not been found for several months later , until the snow disappears .
" You only hope that they find him in good condition . ''
Mr Holding is a rising star of Victoria ’s Labor Party and holds the multiple portfolios of water , finance , WorkCover , TAC , tourism and major events .
During his decade in Parliament as the MP for Lyndhurst , in Melbourne ’s south - east , he has held cabinet positions for police and emergency services , corrections , information and communication technology , financial services industry and manufacturing and export .

I. Warning Against Fiduciary Media
Early in the 20th century , Ludwig von Mises warned against the consequences of granting the government control over the money supply .
Such a regime inevitably creates money through bank credit that is not backed by real savings — a type of money that Mises termed " fiduciary media . "
In 1912 , Mises wrote ,
It would be a mistake to assume that the modern organization of exchange is bound to continue to exist .
It carries within itself the germ of its own destruction ; the development of the fiduciary medium must necessarily lead to its breakdown . [ 1 ]
Mises knew that breakdowns of economic activity were the inevitable outcome of government interference in the monetary sphere .
However , public opinion has not correctly diagnosed the root cause , regularly blaming instead the free market system — rather than the government — for the malaise .
In times of crisis , people call for more government intervention in all sorts of markets , thereby setting into motion a spiral of intervention which , over time , erodes the liberal economic and social order .
It is therefore a rather discomforting truth that today 's governments the world over produce fiduciary media , the very kind of money Mises had warned us against .
It is an inflationary regime .
The relentless rise in the money stock necessarily reduces the purchasing power of money to below the level that would prevail had the money supply not been increased .
Early receivers of the new money benefit at the expense of those receiving it later .
What is more , the creation of fiduciary media artificially suppresses market interest rates and thereby distorts the intertemporal allocation of scarce resources .
It leads to malinvestment , which must eventually erupt in collapsing output and employment .
II .
The Relentless Increase in Fiduciary Media
The world - wide financial and economic debacle bears testimony to Mises 's analysis of the harmful economic and political forces set into motion by a government - sponsored , fiduciary - media regime .
In an effort to fight the correction of the distortions caused by state - sponsored fiduciary media , governments , on the one hand , are running up huge amounts of public debt to finance their outlays — that is , they are engaging in deficit spending .
( See Figure 1 . )
Figure 1
On the other hand , central banks have lowered official interest rates essentially to zero and have expanded the base money supply at unprecedented rates — this is to a large extent a reflection of central banks monetizing the commercial banks ' troubled assets .
( See Figure 2 . )
Figure 2
Unprofitable banks will be restored back to health for the purpose of churning out even more new credit and money .
This is widely seen as a necessary step to reverse the recession — in actuality the very process that corrects malinvestment — into a recovery .
Indeed , in order to prevent inflation - induced boom from collapsing , it is never enough to keep credit and money stocks at current levels .
Ever - greater doses of credit and money are needed .
The production structure , which has been formed by the relentless increase in credit and money at ever - lower interest rates , begins to unravel as soon as the injection of additional credit and money comes to an end .
Murray N. Rothbard described the disastrous effect set into motion by ever - greater levels of credit and money succinctly : " Like the repeated doping of a horse , the boom is kept on its way and ahead of its inevitable comeuppance , by repeated doses of the stimulant of bank credit . " [ 2 ]
Such a strategy has its limits , though :
It is only when bank credit expansion must finally stop … either because the banks are getting shaky or because the public is getting restive at the continuing inflation , that retribution finally catches up with the boom .
As soon as credit expansion stops , the piper must be paid . [ 3 ]
III .
Deflation Fears
In view of the strong rise in the monetary base , it might be surprising that some market observers keep expressing fears over deflation — that is , a decline in the money stock accompanied by its usual symptom : falling prices across the board .
If banks start reining in loans extended to private households , firms , and government entities , the economy 's credit and money stock will contract — and money would quickly be in short supply .
A decline in the money stock would not only force down consumer , producer , and asset prices ; it would also entail bankruptcies of firms , private borrowers , and banks on a grand scale , as the latter would no longer succeed in rolling over their ever - higher debt levels .
In the United States and the Euro area , for instance , the banking sector is about to deleverage and de-risk its balance sheet .
If the banks shrink their balance sheets , the credit and money supply in the economy will decline .
Is something unfolding that bears a similarity to what happened in Japan , beginning at the end of the 1990s and continuing to around 2005 , when the banks ' loan supply contracted ?
It is this very question that deserves close attention from those who want to get an idea of what may lie ahead for the West .
Figure 3
III .
Political opposition to deflation
Under a regime of government - controlled money , it is a political decision whether or not the money stock changes — that is , whether there will be ongoing inflation ( a rise in the money stock ) or deflation ( a decline in the money stock ) .
Governments have a marked preference for increasing the money stock .
It is a tool of government aggrandizement .
Inflation allows the state to finance its own income , public deficits , and elections , encouraging a growing number of people to coalesce with state power .
A government holding a monopoly over the money supply has , de facto , unlimited power to change the money stock in any direction and at any time that is deemed politically desirable .
This can be done through various measures .
The " normal way " is providing commercial banks with favorable credit conditions , allowing them to lend to private households , firms , and public sector entities — thereby issuing new money .
If this does n't work , the government and central bank can pursue alternative routes :
First , the government can increase its deficit and oblige banks to monetize government debt .
By increasing spending ( for example , on unemployment benefits , infrastructure , etc. ) , the newly created money stock enters the pockets of the people .
Second , the central bank can start buying assets from banks and other firms ( e.g. , stocks , housing , etc. ) , thereby distributing new money through direct purchases .
Third , the government can nationalize banks , obliging them to keep extending credit to the private and public sector on " favorable terms . "
And fourth , the central bank can create Friedman helicopter money , and " somehow [ distribute ] it to the public as a transfer payment . " [ 4 ]
The government can prevent the economy 's money supply from contracting if a no-deflation policy is supported by public opinion .
Mises was well aware of the ideologically and politically rooted inflation bias when he wrote : " The favor of the masses and of the writers and politicians eager for applause goes to inflation . " [ 5 ]
One can expect the inflation bias to be especially pronounced in times of emergency .
Faced with falling production and rising unemployment — the unavoidable result of fiduciary media , of inflation itself — people may all too easily consider further inflation to be the lesser evil .
Hence , inflation breeds even more inflation .
Mises noted that people
hold that although inflation may be a great evil , yet it is not the greatest evil , and that the State might under certain circumstances find itself in a position where it would do well to oppose greater evils with the lesser evil of inflation . [ 6 ]
Mises , however , refuted this " emergency " argument :
No emergency can justify a return to inflation .
Inflation can provide neither the weapons a nation needs to defend its independence nor the capital goods required for any project .
It does not cure unsatisfactory conditions .
It merely helps the rulers whose policies brought about the catastrophe to exculpate themselves . [ 7 ]
Mises 's firm anti-inflation view — and his recommendation for a return to sound money ( that is , free market money ) — rested on his awareness of the disastrous consequences of an inflationary policy :
With regard to these endeavors we must emphasize three points .
First : Inflationary or expansionist policy must result in overconsumption on the one hand and in mal - investment on the other .
It thus squanders capital and impairs the future state of want - satisfaction .
Second :
The inflationary process does not remove the necessity of adjusting production and reallocating resources .
It merely postpones it and thereby makes it more troublesome .
Third : Inflation cannot be employed as a permanent policy because it must , when continued , finally result in a breakdown of the monetary system . [ 8 ]

CO2 will take its toll on wheat nutrients ( Image : RESO / Rex Features )
You may have thought that the silver lining of rising carbon dioxide levels would be a boost in crop yields .
But evidence is mounting that we may trade quantity for quality .
The discovery that staple crops like wheat have less protein when grown in high concentrations of CO 2 has already caused concern , but the bad news does n’t stop there .
Ramping up CO 2 also changes the balance of amino acids and several trace elements , says Petra Högy from the University of Hohenheim in Germany .
Advertisement
Together with Andreas Fangmeier , also at the University of Hohenheim , and his team , Högy grew wheat in open fields over three years while blowing extra CO 2 over the plots to achieve the concentrations of the gas that are expected to be reached by around 2050 .
Iron out
They found several changes in the wheat grains , including an 8 per cent drop in iron and a 14 per cent increase in lead .
“ Both of these changes would be bad for human health .
The drop in iron is particularly worrisome as half of the world ’s population are already iron deficient , and this is going to get worse , ” says Högy .
The team also looked again at the drop in protein that had already been seen and found that essential amino acids – including those important for children – are affected by it , not just non-essential protein components .
In addition , wheat grown under high - carbon conditions was worth less money , with smaller grains that are harder to sell for good prices and different dough properties due to the changed protein composition .
No quick nitrogen fix
The researchers do not know all the reasons for the changed balance of nutrients and minerals but argue that other experiments show that simply increasing nitrogen fertiliser is unlikely to restore the lack in grain protein .
Not all the changes are bad however , says Högy : “ The heavy metal cadmium also decreased by 14 per cent , which might be positive , ” she says .
Iraki Loladze of the University of Nebraska - Lincoln , who predicted that rising CO 2 would lead to smaller amounts of micronutrients in crops almost seven years ago ( PDF ) , says he is concerned by the continuing lack of awareness of this problem :
“ The effect of rising CO 2 on our food quality is [ one of ] stealth – it ’s there , but our scientific radars are not tuned to it .
“ This study is important because it brings into sharp focus this effect on wheat – one of the largest sources of calories and nutrients for humans . ”
Wheat is not the only crop to suffer carbon - induced changes beyond having less protein .
Ros Gleadow of Monash University in Melbourne , Australia , who recently reported rising cyanide levels in cassava , says that plants such as eucalyptus respond to rising CO 2 levels by making more defensive chemicals , which may make the plants a worse food source for farm animals and wildlife in the future .

Last week , Ted Olson .
Today , Dick Cheney :
Dick Cheney rarely takes a position that places him at a more progressive tilt than President Obama .
But on Monday , the former vice president did just that , saying that he supports gay marriage as long as it is deemed legal by state and not federal government .
Speaking at the National Press Club for the Gerald R. Ford Foundation journalism awards , Cheney was asked about recent rulings and legislative action in Iowa and elsewhere that allowed for gay couples to legally wed .
“ I think that freedom means freedom for everyone , ” replied the former V.P. “ As many of you know , one of my daughters is gay and it is something we have lived with for a long time in our family .
I think people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish .
Any kind of arrangement they wish .
The question of whether or not there ought to be a federal statute to protect this , I do n’t support .
I do believe that the historically the way marriage has been regulated is at the state level .
It has always been a state issue and I think that is the way it ought to be handled , on a state - by - state basis . …
But I do n’t have any problem with that .
People ought to get a shot at that . ”
We hate Dick Cheney here at AMERICAblog.com .
Hate him .
But , even a broken clock is right twice a day .
And , as Sam Stein , who wrote the article above , notes , this statement make Cheney more progressive than Obama on marriage equality .
If Cheney can support marriage equality , there ’s really no excuse for Obama and other leading Congressional Democrats .
Cheney has been using similar language since 2004 , when he broke with his boss , George Bush , over the constitutional amendment to ban same - sex marriage :
At a campaign rally in this Mississippi River town , Cheney spoke supportively about gay relationships , saying “ freedom means freedom for everyone , ” when asked about his stand on gay marriage .
“ Lynne and I have a gay daughter , so it ’s an issue our family is very familiar with , ” Cheney told an audience that included his daughter .
“ With the respect to the question of relationships , my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone .
…
People ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to .
“ The question that comes up with the issue of marriage is what kind of official sanction or approval is going to be granted by government ?
Historically , that ’s been a relationship that has been handled by the states .
The states have made that fundamental decision of what constitutes a marriage , ” he said .
And , Congress should stay out of it .
But , in 1996 , President Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) , which put the federal government in a position to regulate marriages at the state level .
DOMA needs to go .
And , this further confirms all the polling that shows when people know someone gay , it makes them more likely to be supportive of issues like marriage equality .
Frankly , I do n’t think Dick with be with us absent that .
But , he is — and here ’s the video .
Cheney almost sounds human :

Asda claims its new bike is the country 's cheapest .
It may also be the nastiest and most poorly built
Earlier this month , Asda boasted that it was to start selling " the cheapest
bicycle in the UK " .
Having bought into the notion that to get a half decent new bike you had to pay at least £ 300 for it , I was intrigued to find out what you 'd get for less than a quarter of that amount – Asda 's adult machines cost just £ 70 .
And so it was that I have spent the past month juddering around London on a 26in British Eagle 18 - speed women 's mountain bike in a patronising purple shade .
My first outing on the Purple Eagle ended on a sour note when the handlebars started turning in an entirely unhelpful and counter - intuitive way every time I rounded a corner .
The headset was horribly loose , and I had no tools on me to fix it .
Herein lies the first problem with buying what bike snobs refer to as a BSO ( bike shaped object ) : you have to build it yourself .
The Eagle comes in bits , meaning you have to attach the pedals , front wheel , handlebars and saddle to the frame .
Asda's PR folks made mine , but the lesson is the same .
Are you sure you know how to put it together properly ?
If not , you can either take it to your local bike dealer and hope they wo n't laugh you out of the shop when you ask them to do it for you ( and if they oblige , you 'll pay at least £ 20 for it ) .
Or you can risk getting it wrong .
The best - case scenario is that , like me , you end up walking home .
Let 's not contemplate the worst case .
The second problem was the grip - shift gears , which are operated by twisting the end of the handlebars .
Very quickly I wished that British Eagle had concentrated on getting three gears right rather than making 18 substandard ones .
Every time I went over a speed bump I changed gear ; even on the flat there was always an irritating clicking sound which spoiled every ride .
On the scale of annoyance , it was rather like being at the cinema and having someone kick the back of your seat all the way though the film .
To test the bike properly I decided to take it on a grand tour of north London 's Three Peaks : Crouch Hill , Highgate Hill and Muswell Hill .
Yorkshire folk will no doubt dismiss these bourgeois mounds as mere hillocks , but tackling them on my weighty ( 18kg ) , graceless machine felt like I was scaling Pen -y - Ghent on a pedal - powered tractor .
The good thing about mountain bikes is that they have super - low gears , but as the Purple Eagle could never stay in any gear for long , I may as well have been on a single speed .
After 40 miles or so of gentle bimbling , I took the bike into my local bike shop , Two Wheels Good , and got the owner , Jonathan Boyce , to give it a once over .
He groaned as I wheeled it in – " We see these a couple of times a week and so often the repairs cost more than the bike , " he said , adding that he gave me " four to six weeks " before the bike was too jiggered to ride .
Jonathan 's advice for those on a budget is to scrape together £ 100 to buy a decent secondhand bike rather than waste money on the Purple Eagle or any of its relatives .
Here are some of the flaws Jonathan noticed :
1. The Purple Eagle is a ladies ' bike .
So why the men's saddle ?
2 . The components are rubbish and made out of the biking equivalent of a supermarket own - brand .
The derailleur , gear shifts and more are made by a brand that sounds like Shimano but is n't .
It 's even written in the same font .
3 . The brakes are made from plastic , rather than more expensive aluminium , and so will flex and bend , wasting energy .
4 . The handlebar stem is the old " quill " style ( instead of attaching to a steerer tube it fits directly into the headset and screws onto the forks ) , rather than an a -head stem .
5 . The rear derailleur is hooked onto the axle , rather than bolted straight to the frame , making it almost impossible to adjust the gears properly .
6 . The cheap plastic pedals will " simply fall apart before long " .
7 . The rear wheel was badly out of true .
8 . The front wheel was n't round , and was wobbling about the place as if the bearings have already gone .
Apparently this should n't happen on a decent bike until you 've done at least 1,000 miles .
But the biggest problem I had with the Lumbering Eagle was that it was horrible to ride .
Every time I was due to set out on it , I cast a jealous glance at my lovely , nimble racer and prepared myself for the unpleasant ride ahead .
This is the real downer with cheap bikes : they put you off cycling .
August 17 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
Some quotes from the beginning of Albert Camus ‘ “ The Rebel “ :
“ Not every value entials rebellion , but every act of rebellion tacitly invokes a value …
The part of himself that [ the rebel ] wishes to be respected he proceeds to place above everything else and proclaims it preferrable to everything , even to life itself …
As a last resort , he is willing to accept the final defeat , which is death , rather than be deprived of the personal sacrament that he would call , for example , freedom .
Better to die on one ’s feet than to live on one ’s knees …
Rebellion , contrary to current opinion , and though it springs from everything that is most strictly individualistic in man , questions the very idea of the individual .
If the individual , in fact , accepts death and happens to die as a consequence of his act of rebellion , he demonstrates by doing so that he is willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of a common good which he considers more important than his own destiny …
Therefore he is acting in the name of certain values which are still indeterminate but which he feels are common to himself and to all men .
We see that the affirmation implicit in every act of rebellion is extended to something that transcends the individual insofar as it withdraws him from his supposed solitude and provides him with a reason to act …
Rebellion , though apparently negative , since it creates nothing , is profoundly positive in that it reveals the part of man which must always be defended …
In out daily trials rebellion plays the same role as does the “ cogito ” [ ‘ I think , therefore I exist ’ ] in the realm of thought : it is the first piece of evidence .
But this evidence lures the individual from his solitude .
It founds its first value on the whole human race .
I rebel – therefore we exist . ”
We are one deep fryer away from happiness .

Holy kowtow : Can society please grow up and stop bowing to theological straw men ?!
by Jeremy Hooper
If one who is lobbying against lowering the voting age were to do so on the basis of their personal belief that casting a civil ballot is ungodly , that person would be laughed out of American politics .
If a person fighting healthcare reform suggested that their resistance was due to their support for faith healers as the only means of medication , their voice in the debate would be muted faster than you can say , " pass the peyote . "
If the head of the FDA wanted to set the nation 's dietary policy based on her own faith - based distaste for shellfish and other treif , the nation 's Christians would surely revolt .
So why is it that when it comes to CIVIL marriage equality , the sole form of marital parity that LGBT activists are seeking from the government , that a majority of people still accept lines like this as an acceptable basis for shutting out tax - paying gay couples :
We need to be ready to flood Albany and Trenton with phone calls and emails from people who understand : Marriage matters .
It is God ’s idea , and He saw that it was good .
NOM PAC New York Marriage News [ NOM ]
Sure , a large portion of marriage participants have a religious ceremony that invokes some sort of God or Gods .
Sure , our government confers the power of the state onto faith leaders for the purposes of solemnizing marriage .
Sure , there are some people who do n't consider anyone , LGBT or S , married unless a Bible is present .
But none of this changes the reality of civil marriage .
None of this changes the fact -- THE FACT ! -- that religious ceremony is a wholly optional , completely ancillary component of the kinds of marriages for which gay folks and their allies are fighting !!
We could not have more respect for this country 's commitment to religious freedom .
We have zero problem with anyone choosing to see us as unmarried or even immoral in the " eyes of God . "
But what we ask for demand in exchange is for people of all faiths to start addressing this civil marriage debate in the terms that accurately encapsulate what 's on the table .
These " protect marriage " folks are the ones who need to start protecting true religious freedom , which allows for non-belief , gay - accepting belief , interfaith belief , varying degrees of agnosticism , etc .
And they need to must start acknowledging that when it comes to the civil recognition of their own different - gendered marriages , their ceremonies ( no matter how glorious or godly ) are the elective component of the whole process .
The civil marriage license is not !!
Your thoughts
It also ignores the fact that thousands of gay people DO marry with all sorts of religious trappings , within faiths and churches / synagogues / shrine , etc .
I was married , in front of witnesses with every requirement Jewish marriage usually has - the contract , the ring , the chuppah , even ( though NOT required ) a rabbi .
Oh , and the rabbi is legally able to perform marriages in my state , so that even matches the civil requirements .
Where is MY religious freedom ?
Where is the religious freedom of Quakers , Reform and Reconstructionist Jews , liberal styles of Christianity ?
( Especially the Quakers - could you imagine saying Quakers were n't a part of the founding and establishment of this nation ? )
I find it odd that more attention is n't paid to asking those questions to the religious objectors .
I 'd love to have them on the record as saying that Reform Rabbis are n't " real " Jews , or even better , that what Jews do is n't as good as what their narrow brand of Christianist thinking allows .
It 's just that they have discovered it 's much easier to demonize the gays than it is to admit they find non-christians and liberal christians to be frauds and imperfect and , oh , yeah - not able to enter heaven .

Oh , absolutely , Laura .
That 's why I made the note about gay - accepting belief being a part of true religious freedom .
I did n't want to make it so much about that , because the ancillary nature of religion / religious customs is the main focus .
But yes , there are scores of LGBT people who invoke religion in their ceremonies , and scores of people of faith who are happy to do oblige .
Heck , at my wedding , I had a nun ( in full habit ) watching my husband and I dance the horah !
The far - right evangelicals would n't have known who to condemn first .

As a long time Catholic who believes in Jesus but no longer the catholic church - what was always said and very , very frequently by priests - - -
" You see them when the are baptized when they are married and when they die " - - - that , I 'm sure , is " the way it is " in many of these high - toned christian denominations !
But those are the people who are on the street chanting " Save Marriage " .

I 'm always curious how cross - faith alliances ( e.g. Mormon LDS + pretty much every other pro-Prop 8 group ) do n't get called out everywhere as the ultimate expressions of faith - centric hypocrisy . >
Take one group who profess to have dedicated their lives to the all encompassing truths of their religion . >
Take another group who profess to have dedicated their lives to another set of all encompassing truths .
>
Mix them together and ... hey presto , out pops a universal truth - just please do n't mention religion ( and ignore the little man behind the curtain ) .
They cannot even be seen together behind the same pulpit , share the same communion or bow before the same altar - but give them a picket - line or a press conference and suddenly they are as one ?
It 's so abundantly clear where religion ends and unelected old men wanting to rule the world begin , I do n't know how they get away with it .

Most of the big wigs on the anti-equality side of this debate know enough to avoid using religious arguments , but I 've found that 99.99999 % of laypeople who oppose my right to marry base their arguments on religious dogma , saying that marriage is a " Godly " institution .
Upon which I politely remind them that marriage is a civil institution , and neither is it Christian because an atheist man can be legally married to a barren Satanist woman .
As you said , the main misunderstanding in this debate is the convolution of the concepts of civil marriage and religious marriage .
What if the word " marriage " was struck from law altogether , replacing the institution of marriage with an instutition of universal civil unions for both gay and straight couples ?
Only the name would change , and equality could be had in a much more peaceful fashion .
It 's just a thought , even if an idyllic and unobtainable one .

Morons like this do n't even take into consideration two things :
1 . Civil marriage in this country ( and many like it ) do n't even require religious affiliation .
In California , I know for a fact , you can get married by ANYONE as long as you pay your fee and register them far enough in advance , regardless of their civil or religious status .
Thousands of people are married by judges , politicians , county clerks and justices of the peace every day .
Religion is NOT a requirement for marriage , period .
2 . Why do they keep forgetting that there are other religions out there BESIDES Judeo - Christian religions ?
I , personally , am a Pagan .
We are a valid , recognized Church by all definitions of the United States and the State of California .
16 years ago I asked the official " head " of our church if he would have a problem performing a same sex wedding ceremony withing the Church , and his answer was " Why not ?
Is it your will ?
If so , who could say otherwise ? "
Christians may be the majority in this country but that does n't mean the rest of us have to bow down to their version of what is " correct " in how we live our lives for everything when it comes to civil laws .
Why they can't get it through their heads that their archaic rules of what constitutes " marriage " ( especially when they can't even interpret their own Bible correctly ) do n't apply to everyone , I 'll never figure out .

Well yea , that 's the basic gist of the post , GMT .
Also the argument G - A - Y has been carrying since day one .
We have GOT to teach Americans the difference between civil marriage equality and religious ceremony .
The church - bride image is so ingrained in folks ' heads , it 's sometimes hard for even well - intentioned people to break free from it .
That was a major beef that I had with Obama during the primary .
I felt that his marriage stance was far too willing to hand the word marriage over to churches , a suggestion that I think muddies that waters of the debate much more than other politicians ' " pragmatic " approaches to our equality .
It emboldens the far - right conservatives to say , " See -- even Obama thinks marriage is for churches . "

Why has n't anyone ( yet ) challenged the validity of Prop H8 ( and other same - sex marriage bans ) on the basis that it is a violation of religious freedom .
The constitution clearly states that : " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . "
That should also ensure that no one religion 's religious belief should be implemented as law which arbitrarily impinges on any other religion 's religious belief .
The courts have ruled that some religious exercises not above legal statutes , but only in cases where the the state has a clear interest .
In our case , there is no clear state 's interest in denying marriage to same - sex couples .
Even if that suit was not successful , at least the court would end up ruling that marriage is a civil institution irrespective of religion .

> That was a major beef that I had with Obama during the primary .
Indeed .
Sadly , I have heard very few politicians ( and brave ones at that ) who have stood up and proudly said " I personally do not believe gay marriage is correct according to my religious teachings , HOWEVER the law applies to civil marriages and that 's what we 're talking about here so my beliefs do n't matter . "
Unfortunately , pandering to the conservatives and the weak - minded will garner more votes and support , so they will continue to do so as long as it is popularly acceptable .
Our Constitution may SAY that there are no religious tests , but we all know that reality is much different as evidenced by all the BS rumors about Obama being a Muslim during the election .
The Right will stop at nothing to get their way , whether it is honest and ethical or not , as long as it gets the results they want .

When Adobe released Acrobat 9 last year , the company introduced support for embedding Flash media in PDF files .
This feature is now being used by attackers who are exploiting a new vulnerability in Adobe 's Flash media plugin .
The vulnerability allows remote code execution , making it a potential vector for malware deployment .
Adobe 's security response team issued a statement on Wednesday , confirming the existence of a critical Flash vulnerability that is actively being exploited in the wild .
The attacks are currently targeted against Acrobat Reader on the Windows platform .
Adobe is working to address the problem and says that a fix will be ready by July 30 .
As a temporary measure to eliminate the security risk , Adobe recommends disabling Flash support in Acrobat Reader by renaming or deleting the " authplay.dll " file .
Doing so will cause Acrobat Reader to abort when it attempts to reads a Flash - enabled PDF .
The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( US - CERT ) has published a cybersecurity alert about the vulnerability and warns that it could potentially be exploited by malicious web sites in addition to PDFs .
US - CERT echoes Adobe 's recommendation to disable Flash in Acrobat , but also suggests disabling it in browsers too .
Security vendors McAfee and Symantec have both commented on the issue and provided some technical insight .
According to Symantec , one known exploit of this vulnerability , which they have designated Trojan .
Pidief .G , uses a heap spraying technique .
" Recently we came into possession of an Adobe Acrobat PDF file that upon opening drops and executes a malicious binary .
It was quite clear that this PDF was exploiting some vulnerability in order to drop its payload , " wrote Symantec researcher Patrick Fitzgerald in a blog entry .
" During the analysis it soon became apparent that this vulnerability was not one we had seen in the wild before .
What was even more surprising was that this vulnerability affects Adobe Flash - - not Adobe Reader as we initially suspected . "
Both security companies point out that Flash vulnerabilities are particularly tempting targets for attackers because of its ubiquitous platform support .
It 's worth noting , however , that the known exploits are currently platform - specific and only target Windows .

The commission statement added that the amount of uranium the Dimona staffers drank in the experiment ( 100 mirograms ) was less than the amount Be ’er Sheva residents drink from their taps in one month .
The worker who submitted the lawsuit , Julius Malick , recently retired after he said he was threatened by the former director of the facility , Yitzhak Gurevich , and the director of human resources , Gary Amal , that if he did not retire he would be fired .
Malick is suing the Dimona facility for a total of NIS 1.8 million in compensation .
According to the suit , Malick was “ asked by his superiors to take part in an experiment on five workers .
In the framework of the experiment , Mr. Malick and the other workers drank uranium .
The experiment was conducted without medical supervision and no explanation was given as to the health risks to participants .
Mr. Malick , out of fear for his livelihood and future in the department , agreed to the demand that he participate . ”
Malick , who worked at the Dimona reactor for 15 years before retiring in 2008 , received his bachelor ’s and master ’s degrees in chemistry at Bar - Ilan University .
He has another degree , in industrial engineering and management , from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Be ’er Sheva .
The lawsuit also notes that , while the workers did not receive the results of the experiment , an article about it appeared in the scientific journal Health Physics .
According to the suit , the article , written by a number of researchers – headed by Drs. Zeev Karpas and Avi Lorber , the directors of the Dimona facility ’s analytical chemistry lab – included the subjects ’ names without their permission .
The subjects were given grape or grapefruit juice containing uranium to drink and were then asked for a urine sample , which was then analyzed to determine how uranium is excreted from the body through urine .
The researchers said it was not supposed to be dangerous , Malick told his lawyer , Alexander Spinrad .
“ Lorber and Karpas said that even they took part in the experiment themselves , although to this day it ’s not clear to me whether they actually did .
Afterward co-workers to whom I told this said I was stupid for drinking it and they would n’t have agreed under any circumstances to do it , ” Malick also told his lawyer .
Malick , a chemist , also said that a long time after the experiment , Lorber told him it was his and Karpas ’ private project .
“ That ’s ridiculous , of course , because the article listed other partners , whose names appear under their names and listed as workers of the Dimona facility , ” Malick said .
Malick also said he once complained that no records were being kept and Karpas “ joked with me and said I was making a tempest in a teapot . ”
The suit also states that his superiors never recorded his participation in the experiment in his medical records .
The suit describes a work accident in August of 1998 , in which Malick sustained a burn on his hand as a result of contact with small amounts of uranium and other materials .
Malick said he received poor treatment , and that he discovered by chance that the materials to which he had been exposed in the accident were not identified in the medical report .
Malick told his lawyer he believed this type of maltreatment was systematic , and the suit alludes as much .
The lawsuit also states that Malick , in an internal memo to the safety department at the Dimona reactor , warned that workers who had been exposed in an accident to radioactive materials had not received suitable medical treatment .
His first position at the Dimona reactor was in the analytical chemistry lab , where his job , among other things , was to evaluate possible damage to workers exposed to hazardous materials .
In the early years , Malick ’s superiors highly praised his work .
However , Malick claims that he was later branded as a troublemaker when he tried to improve the level of safety and medical service at the plant .
He was subsequently transferred to other positions where his skills could not be put to good use , the lawsuit states , and finally he resigned under threat of dismissal .
After he resigned , Malick says he was forced to sign an agreement that discriminates against him relative to other pensioners of the facility .
Malick declined to be interviewed for this article out of concern over harassment by his former employers through the plant ’s security officers and the head of the security department in the Defense Ministry , which is responsible for security of information and the reactor .
However , he confirmed to Haaretz that he had filed the lawsuit .

A Russian medical student has confessed that she killed two elderly neighbors with an axe because she wanted to witness an actual death .
“ This is where her blood and brains splashed after I hit her , and they started to pour down right here , like that , ” the slender 24 - year - old calmly tells the police in the crime re-enactment video , available from Life .ru website .
Tatiana B. , resident of Dzerzhinsk city in central Russia and a soon - to - have - been surgeon , chose two old ladies who lived next door for her experiments with life and death .
The first victim was a 85 - year - old whom had known the girl since birth .
The old lady willingly let her neighbor into the apartment , and when she turned her back Tatiana hit her with an axe .
Altogether , she delivered six blows to the victim 's neck and head .
After watching the death , Tatiana washed her weapon and quietly left the apartment , taking none of the victim 's belongings and leaving the police completely puzzled about the murder .
Nobody suspected that Tatiana , the daughter of well - to - do parents and a brilliant student could have had something to do with the murder .
However , when several weeks later another neighbor , an 87 - year - old lady , was killed in a similar manner , the police decided to question the young woman .
Tatiana confessed to the murders , and willingly gave numerous details of the two killings .
“ At the interrogation , she said that she wanted to witness the moment of actual death , ” a police officer said .
She is now awaiting trial .
The report did not say whether she had yet been tested for mental health or not .
A man had his head shaved and was paraded through the streets of an Indian village for dialling a wrong number .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Dalit , or low - caste man , said he was trying to call a friend when he mistakenly dialled the number of another villager in Dani Ramjas , Haryana .
" I inadvertently dialled the number of Dharam Singh .
The moment I realised my mistake , I apologised immediately and disconnected the phone , " the man , known as Suresh , said .
He told the police that a day later that Mr Singh and six of his friends humiliated him when he was on his way to another town .
" They tonsured me ( shaved my head ) after lifting and carrying me away bodily .
That done , they tied me to a motorcycle and paraded me through the streets , thrashing me intermittently , " Indian newspaper the Times of India quoted him saying .
Suresh added that the assailants told him not to report the incident to the police .
Dalits are a group of people traditionally regarded as " untouchables " of low caste .
Although the caste system has been formally abolished in India , their status has often been historically associated with occupations regarded as impure , or polluting to the individual , such as any involving dealing with dead animals or working in the sewers .
As a result , Dalits were commonly segregated and banned from full participation in Hindu social life .
For example , they could not enter a temple or a school , and were required to stay outside village boundaries .

Grint has appeared in all the Harry Potter films to date
Harry Potter actor Rupert Grint is recovering from a " mild bout " of swine flu , his publicist has said .
Grint , who plays Ron Weasley , took a few days off filming but has now returned to the set of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows .
And he is well enough to attend the world premiere of Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince in London on Tuesday .
" He has now recovered and is looking forward to joining his fellow cast members , " his publicist said .
Scenes
She said that Grint 's doctor had confirmed the 20 - year - old actor had recovered and was no longer contagious or at risk of infecting others .
" Other scenes were shot in his absence which did not require his involvement and thus filming was not disrupted , " she added .
Grint , who comes from Watton - at - Stone in Hertfordshire , has starred in all the Harry Potter films as well as British comedy film Thunderpants and the comedy drama Driving Lessons with Julie Walters .
He is currently filming Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - JK Rowling 's final book about the teenage wizard and his friends .
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is released in the UK on 15 July .
Jacqui Smith faces inquiry into botched anti-terror raids
The botched anti-terrorist operation against a group of Pakistani students suspected of a bomb plot was last night threatening to embarrass the Government for years .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is facing an unprecedented inquiry into the raids by Lord Carlile , the independent reviewer of terror laws .
The Home Office is also braced for a lengthy battle to deport the 11 Pakistani students , who were freed without charge .
One of the terrorist arrests in Liverpool - the 11 Pakistani students were freed without charge
And lawyers are planning appeals that could last three years and cost taxpayers £ 1 million , claiming sending the 11 home will breach human rights law .
If successful , they could even claim compensation .
The appeals are likely to expose the Government 's record for deporting foreigners over national security , which is woeful despite Tony Blair 's pledge in 2005 that the ' rules of the game have changed ' .
Meanwhile , relations between the Government and the Muslim Council of Britain plunged after Gordon Brown was accused of ' dishonourable behaviour ' for saying the Pakistanis were suspected of a ' big plot ' .
The operation was brought forward following a security breach by Britain 's top counter - terrorist officer .
Embarrassment : Jacqui Smith faces inquiry into the raids
Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick was photographed outside No10 holding documents clearly marked ' secret ' with details of an ongoing investigation .
He quit over the blunder .
One of 12 suspects seized on April 8 was then released without charge after only a few days and handed to immigration officers .
Despite detailed searches of properties used by the men in Manchester , Merseyside and Lancashire , officers found nothing significant .
On Tuesday , nine of the remainder were also released into the custody of immigration officials .
Yesterday the last two were released , after almost 14 days of questioning .
One , a Briton , was allowed to walk free , while the second was detained with the others .
This leaves 11 Pakistanis - at least ten of whom arrived on legal student visas - in immigration detention , which costs taxpayers around £ 50,000 for each detainee .
The Home Office plans to deport them as a threat to national security .
But a lawyer for at least three of the men , who are all in their 20s and had abided by the terms of their student visas , said they would fight their removal .
Mohammed Ayub , of Chambers Solicitors , Bradford , said : ' Our clients have no criminal history , they were here lawfully on student visas and were pursuing their studies and working .
Our clients are neither extremists nor terrorists .
Their arrest and detention has been a serious breach of human rights . '
Patrick Mercer , chairman of the Commons terrorism sub-committee , said : ' We will be stuck with these people while they appeal against deportation .
I challenge the Government to get rid of them . '
In his first review into an individual operation , Lord Carlile is expected to look at why so many arrests failed to yield any charges .
But Greater Manchester Chief Constable Peter
Fahy , whose officers were involved in the arrests , insisted : ' I do not believe a mistake has been made .
We do n't carry out this sort of operation or make these sorts of arrests on a whim . '
Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : ' This is yet another embarrassment for Jacqui Smith .
Serious questions need to be answered about whether Bob Quick 's blunder distorted this operation and on what grounds these men are being deported . '
Tory security spokesman Baroness Neville - Jones said it was ' very worrying ' that no charges had been brought in a case Mr Brown had called serious terrorist plot .
Inayat Bunglawala , of the Muslim Council of Britain , said that when the men were arrested ' in dramatic circumstances ' the public were told they posed a serious threat .
He said it was unacceptable for the Government to make such prejudicial remarks from the outset and then , having found insufficient evidence to bring charges , try to deport the men anyway .
ANALYSIS : How it will end in a legal circus
By leaving top secret papers flapping for all to see in Downing Street , anti-terror chief Bob Quick ensured the arrest of the Pakistani Al Qaeda suspects began in high farce .
It is now certain to end in a legal circus at huge cost to the taxpayer .
For despite Tony Blair 's 2005 pledge that the rules of the ' game are changing ' , Britain 's record for deporting terror suspects over national security is woeful .
There remains the opportunity to lodge a string of appeals , aided by the Government 's Human Rights Act .
And lawyers for the Pakistani students utilise these to the full .
The first step for the 11 students , who are in immigration removal centres , is to appeal against deportation to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission ( SIAC ) - scene of expensive battles between Government and human rights lawyers .
The Home Office must prove the men threaten national security and face no ill treatment in Pakistan .
The fact that no charges have been brought does not mean SIAC will consider the men innocent .
Much of the evidence it takes is given in secret , and does not have to meet criminal court standards .
But proving the threat to national security is the easy part .
The real test comes in proving there would be no breach of the European Convention on Human Rights - enshrined here in the Human Rights
Act - by deporting them .
Pakistan permits executions and tortures terror suspects , which is how the 11 would be treated .
The most obvious appeal their lawyers can make is to claim removal will breach their human rights because by effectively being labelled terrorists by Gordon Brown - when he said their arrest had foiled a ' very big plot ' - Britain has guaranteed they will be illtreated by Pakistani authorities .
The number of deportations over national security since 2005 is thought to be as low as nine .
Even Abu Qatada - Osama bin Laden 's envoy in Europe - is still here .
If his case is any guide , the Pakistani students will be embarrassing ministers and police for years .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is often hesitant during the health care debate in Washington to express his personal views , but he let down his guard a bit this week in Nevada .
Reid opened a private meeting of health care providers in Las Vegas on Tuesday by saying , according to one attendee who took notes :
“ We have a problem in America and it ’s called the private insurance industry . ”
Reid went on to express support for a public option , the proposed government - run insurance plan that he compared to Medicare , saying any meaningful reform legislation would have to include a public component .
Nevada ’s main progressive group said the majority leader ’s comments during Tuesday ’s meeting of about 20 hospital CEOs , doctors and other health care providers was among the most significant statements they have heard on his thinking .
“ We ’re energized and we ’re also confident that Sen .
Reid is on the right side on this issue , ” said Michael Ginsburg , a community organizer at the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada , who attended the meeting .
“ That ’s something we can take to our supporters and reassure them . ”
Reid has been traveling throughout the state talking to constituents about health care and other issues while Congress is on summer recess .
The senator has declined to host a public town - hall meeting on health care , criticizing as “ Astro Turf ” — a political term for corporate - sponsored campaigns made to appear like spontaneous uprisings — the protests being organized by groups opposed to health care reform .
He has called those who are shouting down elected officials elsewhere across the country “ evil mongers . ”
Instead Reid will host a telephone town - hall meeting this afternoon , hoping to reach as many as 50,000 Nevadans .
The deadline has passed to register for the call .
But in settings with voters over the past few days in Nevada , Reid has shared his thoughts .
“ Clearly he is not enamored of the insurance industry , ” said Dr. John Ellerton , a physician in private practice who attended the meeting .
Tuesday ’s meeting was described by one attendee as a who ’s who of the Nevada medical establishment .
The group held diverse views and engaged in a healthy exchange with the senator for about 75 minutes , attendees said .
Reid spoke about his preference for the public option .
Reid has previously said he personally backs the public option , which supporters believe would drive needed competition among health insurance companies but detractors say would put some of those companies out of business .
But last month , Reid declined to say whether he would push for the public option during a press briefing in Washington where , as majority leader , he traditionally gives great deference to the committee chairmen as legislation is being formed , and often declines to influence their committee debates .
“ It would be really premature for me to lay out for each of you what I think should be in this bill , ” Reid said in July .
Reid also spoke Tuesday of the difficulty of getting the public plan component approved in the Senate , where he hopes to attract Republican support .
With the death of Sen. Edward Kennedy , D - Mass. , Reid has 59 senators in his caucus , not the supermajority of 60 often needed to pass significant legislation .
At both the Tuesday meeting and again during a Wednesday luncheon hosted by the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce , Reid mentioned the possibility of using the procedure known as reconciliation to pass the health care bill in the Senate with just 51 votes .
But he also noted the shortcomings of that approach , explaining to both groups that only part of the bill could be handled with reconciliation , leaving important elements behind .
Reid spoke at both venues about the antitrust exemptions health insurance companies have enjoyed for decades as part of the problem with the industry .
Yet Reid ’s comments became something of a Rorschach test — with listeners reaching different conclusions based on their positions on the issue .
Take medical malpractice reform .
Some health professionals argue that medical costs are driven up by those who practice so - called “ defensive medicine ” — that is , doctors ordering unnecessary tests on patients to cover themselves in the event of lawsuits .
Republicans have seized on this issue , arguing it ’s time to change malpractice law and rein in trial lawyers .
At the Tuesday meeting , Reid told health care providers the story about a surgery he needed some years ago on his left foot .
As he was in the hospital preparing for the operation , he asked what the markings on his right foot signified .
He was told they marked the foot to be operated on .
Reid told the staff they had marked the wrong foot .
Ginsburg took this to mean Reid had no tolerance for the kinds of tort reform being suggested by some of the doctors in the room as a way to rein in medical costs .
However , Dr. Ronald Kline , president - elect of the Nevada State Medical Association , was struck by Reid ’s interest in medical review panels that once functioned in Nevada — panels that would review lawsuits and render nonbinding decisions about the merits of a case that supporters say can reduce the number of lawsuits going forward .
The panels were disbanded a few years ago in Nevada .
“ It was like an evolution of his thought , ” Kline said .
On Wednesday , Reid repeated his interest in the medical review panels as he retold the story about his mismarked foot to the chamber crowd .
Different listeners walked away with different understandings of what they thought would happen next in Washington , a symptom of a bill that remains a work in progress .
Yet several said they understand legislation is coming .
“ I think his intent is to have something , ” Ellerton said .
“ I think come hell or high water there ’s going to be a bill .
That was very clear — that Harry wants something done . ”
Oh Microsoft , just when we were starting to believe in this thing called Bing , you go messing with the search results .
Case in point : a search on Bing for the phrase , " Why is Windows so expensive ? " returned this as the top link ....
" Why are Macs so expensive . "
That 's right .
You 're not hallucinating .
That was the top response on Bing to a question about the price of Windows .
But it 's not just the top link .
The rest of the links on the first search page do n't get much better .
There is one link about the price of vinyl windows ( actual windows that you look out ) , one on why Windows hosting providers are so expensive , and one about fish .
The five other links on page one are about the expensive price of Macs .
The Windows client OS is not even mentioned .
If Microsoft is going to resort to blocking and self - protection with their search engine , they could at least be subtle .
This is about as subtle as a machine gun .
Type in the same phrase over at Google , and Google does its job : returns a long list of links about whether the Windows OS is expensive ( though the link about vinyl windows was on Google too .
Apparently , vinyl windows are all the rage ) .
There is evidence that Microsoft is aware of the Bing results shenanigans and has made adjustments .
An article written two weeks ago on an Internet marketing site called out Bing for censoring search results .
The article highlighted two phrases - " Why is Microsoft Word so expensive ? " and " Is Microsoft Evil ? " - that were bringing up censored results .
The first of the search results about the Microsoft Word question linked to a page about how expensive Manhattan is ( Is Microsoft competing with Manhattan now ? ) .
The top responses to the " Is Microsoft Evil ? " question were , get this , a link to a New York Times story about whether or not Google is considered evil , a link about proxy servers , and a link to a story about Microsoft being charitable .
Wow .
But those results have magically changed .
As of today ( August 5 ) search results for these phrases actually seem uncensored .
The random Manhattan link is still there , but it 's under three links about Microsoft Word .
Not that the links are actually helpful , but open - ended questions are difficult in search engines .
As for the " Is Microsoft Evil ? " search , the Google story is now gone and all the current search results address the question at hand : " Is Microsoft Evil ? "
Is Bing evil ?
Not yet .
So far , I like its organized interface , but I 'm finding its search results to be sloppy .
Sloppy is one thing , but sloppy and censored ?
That 's when evil starts lurking .
Keep it fair , Microsoft .

How is it that a patent this brilliant was filed in 1932 but has yet to become the national sensation that it so deserves to be ?
It fills bananas with ice cream , people !
" The invention relates to an implement for coring bananas and filling the latter through the cored portion with ice cream and more particularly to a banana extractor and ice cream injector .
The primary object of the invention is the provision of an implement of this character , wherein the barrel or cylinder thereof is formed with a knife tip so that the said barrel or cylinder can be readily inserted within a banana to bore or core the same and thereafter a charge of ice cream introduced within the banana so that the same may be consumed , that is , the ice cream , on the eating of the banana , thus effecting a combination of banana and ice cream in a convenient and attractive form . "

This sounds amazing .
And why limit ourselves to ice cream ?
As Blam posits , filling a banana with peanut butter and jelly would also make for a damned near perfect snack .
It 's been over 75 years .
How much longer do we have to wait for this thing ?

Google Books Settlement Con Is Google Book Search the last library ?
Geoff Nunberg , one of America 's leading linguistics researchers , laid this rather ominous tag on Google 's controversial book - scanning project amidst an amusingly - heated debate this afternoon on the campus of the University of California , Berkeley .
" This is likely to be The Last Library , " Nunberg said during a University conference dedicated to Google Book Search and the company 's accompanying $ 125 m settlement with US authors and publishers .
" Nobody is very likely to scan these books again .
The cost of scanning is n't going to come down .
There 's no Moore 's Law for scanning .
" We do n't know who 's going to be running these files 100 years from now .
It may be Google .
It may be News Corp .
It may WalMart .
But we can say with some certainty that 100 years from now , these are the very files scholars will be using . "
Even in the short term , many are worried that Google 's settlement with authors and publishers gives it an undue amount of control of the world 's digital books .
The pact - which still requires court approval - provides a unique license to scan , use and make money from so - called orphan works , titles whose rights holders have yet to come forward .
With its Book Rights Registry , the settlement also gives third parties the opportunity to negotiate access to the books whose rights holders have indeed come forward - and given their approval .
But Google will still control the scanning and the cataloging of the books , and Nunberg questions whether the company is prepared to get things right .
He spent a good 20 minutes questioning the quality of Google 's scans and metatagging , pointing out error after error in its catalog - from books on Jimi Hendrix dated before his birth to a book on copyright categorized under drama .
" I wonder if this is Google 's idea of a joke , " he said , referring to that last snafu .
Predictably , Google Book Search engineering lead Dan Clancy takes issue with The Last Library characterization .
He acknowledges that some of the works Google has scanned will never be scanned again .
But he 's adamant that although Google has a 10 - million - book head start - and a monopoly - building boondoggle of a settlement with authors and publishers - others will compete .
" I do n't view Google Book Search as the one and only library , " he said .
" I do n't think it should be and I do n't think it will be - in part because , remember , a library is about accessing information , not just accessing books .
Libraries were created because books were where information was in the past .
" Libraries are about information , and ... Google is not the only book - scanning activity in existence today .
There will continue to be other activities .
And the internet provides all sorts of information that are linked together in all sorts of ways . "
No , he did not acknowledge that Google is well on its way to controlling the internet as well .
Instead , he argued that if Book Search is The Last Library , then Google was our only hope for a universal digital library in the first place .
" To the extent that Google Book Search is our last shot , if that were really true , then it 's probably also true that if not for Google Book Search , we never would have had a shot - which I do n't think is true either . "
But several minutes later , he said it was true .
" If Google had n't have done it , would someone else have done it ?
I think probably not . "
Google has a head start in part because it had the money needed to scan those 10 million books - and it had the audacity to spend .
But it also had the money - and the blatant disregard for copyright law - needed to endure a lawsuit from authors and publishers and negotiate a $ 125 m settlement .
Though he would n't say how much Google has spent scanning books , Clancy admitted it was n't cheap .
" It 's a lot , " he said .
" If this was just tens of millions of dollars , we would n't all be siting here debating this .
Microsoft would have kept scanning .
And there would be much more incentive to do this . "
But as usual , he did not acknowledge that not everyone can afford to get themselves sued for multi-millions of dollars .
Yes , there are other book scanning operations , including the Internet Archive .
But as the IA 's Peter Brantley told The Reg , the not - for - profit can't afford to wade into that legal territory .
And even if it did , it would likely end up spending far more than Google has spent .
Now that Google has already settled with authors and publishers , could another operation swing the same terms ?
And as Brantley points out , now that Google has already inked deals with the world 's leading research libraries to scan books , are those libraries going to let other operations into their stacks ?
So , to summarize : Google says that if it had n't scanned all those books , no one else would have .
And now there 's less incentive to scan all those books .
But Google insists it 's not The Last Library . ®
" Some of the old values have gone out of cricket , but it 's still a fantastic game " Kristian Dowling / © Getty Images
How differently do you see this game at 60 from the way you saw it at 20 ?
It is different in the sense that there is a much wider following than in the 1960s , when I was growing up .
Then it was a majority male following , but now I think it 's fairly mixed .
You 've got women of all ages interested in the game , thanks to the Twenty20 mainly .
Would you have been happier playing today than when you played ?
With far more money , and fame .
Maybe not , for the simple reason that there was an innocence about the game when I was kid , which is perhaps not quite there now .
I think I would prefer the innocence of the game that was there when I was a teenager .
Earlier , cricket was not just a sport .
It was also about the great qualities of life it represented .
Has there been a fundamental shift in the way people approach the game today ?
Not to a great extent .
But for instance , when people did n't do the right thing , the saying used was " That 's not cricket " .
Now that does not hold as much water as it did then .
Mainly because , I think , the game has become commercial and therefore some of the old values have gone out of it .
But it 's still a fantastic game .
I think it is a far more attractive game to watch from a spectator 's point of view .
Has the romance of cricket fallen victim to money ?
Well , I guess it 's now a win - at - all - cost system .
The unpleasant things that happen in the game have come to the fore , so therefore I think in a sense the romance is gone .
The appreciation of the game , whether it was by your own team or by the opposition , is not quite so much .
You rarely see fielders go up to applaud somebody getting a half - century any more .
Players are aware that the TV cameras are on them .
So they might have just one clap and that 's it - almost as if to say that if you have more than two or three claps for the opposition , then it 's a kind of weakness .
I do n't think that 's a correct thing .
Has technique become redundant or superfluous ?
Look at Virender Sehwag and Adam Gilchrist and the kind of success they have enjoyed .
Do you think this is the modern approach to cricket ?
I have always believed that technique has never been a huge part of sport .
Temperament is your No. 1 thing .
You could have the best technique in the world , but if your temperament is bad , you 'll be nowhere .
While if the temperament is good and you do n't have great technique , you will be able to do well .
You have the ability inside you which makes you hang in there , makes you go on .
That 's what separates the men from the boys .
So does approach , upbringing and the attitude towards the game .
The difference in the style that you see from the 1950s , 60s or 70s is the upbringing .
In those days [ you were told ] not to hit the ball in the air , not to take risks .
Coaches today encourage youngsters to play aerial shots or unorthodox shots , try different things .
That is what has made the game so attractive .
What is the biggest issue confronting the game today ?
The gap that is developing between some of the Test - playing countries and the others .
A few Test - playing countries have developed fantastic cricket , while others have stagnated or gone down .
Now that is the biggest challenge - to be able to make all the 10 Test - playing countries into pretty much equal cricketing powers .
That is never going to happen .
But even if you have six countries , that will be a big step forward .
" I have always believed that technique has never been a huge part of sport .
Temperament is your No. 1 thing "
In recent times you have been a vehement critic of on - field sledging .
I have never been against banter .
But sledging is nothing really but abuse of the opposition .
Sometimes players get away saying things to the opposition on the field that they would never get away with saying to anybody off the field .
One day this might lead to a physical confrontation on the field .
Why do you want get to that stage ?
Are you trying to tell me the Bradmans , the Benauds , the Cowdreys , the Soberses did that ?
They did n't .
There might be a joke or two , where even the butt of the joke laughs .
A little gamesmanship did not affect us either .
Today it is not that .
I do n't mind the four - letter word thrown into a sentence .
That 's not a problem at all .
It 's when the " you so and so " gets in there that it becomes personal .
That is what I feel is an absolutely unnecessary part of the game .
We never heard the Merchants , Hazares , Amarnaths ever say anything abusive to their mates , so why should it happen here ?
You were like a one - man spearhead , especially against England and Australia , in several matters , as player and even later .
Was this part of some deep - seated anti-colonialism in you ?
Not at all .
I have been vocal about it because I have seen it happening .
It was happening increasingly , so I 've spoken about it .
Those who say that this is a part of the game are talking nonsense .
Banter yes , abuse no .
Do you sense some kind of resentment to India 's rise to power , at least financial power ?
No , I do n't think so .
That 's not a factor at all .
You just want the game to be a good sport at the end of it without people abusing each other .
Let me explain .
The Roger Federer versus Andy Roddick 2009 Wimbledon final was an epic game .
If Roddick serves at 120 miles per hour , Federer trying to hit a backhand gets the top edge of the racket and the ball lands on the baseline , allowing Federer to get an absolutely fluky lucky point .
Would Roddick abuse Federer because of the luck that he has ?
Then why should a bowler stand at his end and abuse a batsman who got an inside edge that went to the boundary , or who played and missed half a dozen times ?
Federer and Roddick are playing for a major title and for millions of pounds , for rankings and stuff like that .
Why should it be different in cricket ?
Why go for wild abuse in a match ?
That 's wrong .
The game will be better off without all this .
It 's also a bad influence on young , upcoming players watching on television .
Did something early in your career provoke these sentiments against sledging ?
It happened to me only once .
I was staggered that a player who was making his debut in Tests - and I was well past 100 Tests at the time - stood at the end of his follow - through after I had cut him over slips for a boundary and swore at me .
I could n't believe it .
That was probably the only occasion .
What do you think about the Twenty20 - versus - Tests debate ?
Is Test cricket under threat ?
I do n't think Test cricket is under threat .
It has been there for more than 100 years .
Test cricket will become far more attractive as it became after the advent of one - day cricket .
We saw more results , less dot - balls , and it became far more result - oriented .
The same thing will happen with the influence of Twenty20 .
There will be a lot more runs scored in a day than earlier , which means plenty of results and more excitement for viewers at the ground and on television .

You do n't see the demise of bowlers , as some players predict ?
Look at the way the bowlers have come back in the Twenty20 game .
They have learnt how to bowl , what fields to set , and suddenly they have got clobbered less .
They will get occasionally clobbered by good batsmen , but they are also striking back .
In the ICC World Twenty20 , bowlers probably got as many players - of - the - match awards as batsmen or allrounders .
You first played Tests for India 40 years ago .
Is there anything you would do differently now ?
There are a couple things I would obviously want to do if given another chance .
Like our World Cup match [ 1975 ] , where I got 36 not out .
I would throw my wicket away now - which I was n't brought up to do .
Earlier on , the mindset was different .
I think today I might feel a little more flexible as far as throwing - a- wicket - type situation is concerned .
Even in the Melbourne incident , where I was provoked into asking Chetan [ Chauhan ] to leave the field , let me clarify that this decision was not taken at first but when I was making my way back to the pavilion and was almost 10 yards down when I was abused by the Australians .
That 's when I came back and took Chetan away .
I would n't come back to do this today , because as a captain , whatever the provocation , I should have kept my cool .
Yes , these are the two things I would have definitely changed .
People feel that SMG is mellowing and then some new controversy comes up .
Have you mellowed or not ?
[ Laughs ] I do n't know …
If I feel strongly about something , I say it .
The problem is I have n't learnt to use my head when I speak or I write , despite doing it for all these years .
I still feel with my heart and say something and then a storm is created .
Using words that cause little or no offence is a creative activity .
But I write or speak from the heart and not the head .
But you can deal with criticism better now ?
Because I no longer feel the pressures of performing .
When is the definitive autobiography coming ?
Maybe I am writing too much .
I have got columns and match reports , so maybe that 's dulled the need to write .
Besides , my first autobiography [ Sunny Days ] created a storm .
Again I used my heart and not my head .
Perhaps the usage of words could have conveyed the same meaning without causing offence .
So if I have to write a definitive book , it would have to be honest .
Some big reputations might get a bit of a dent once again .
So why …
You have never pushed your son Rohan , but do you have any sense of disappointment that he could not go the distance with the India cap ?
Look , I wanted him to be a good human being .
For me that was the most important thing .
Being a cricketer or a doctor , engineer , journalist was his choice .
I just wanted him to be content with what he was .
All the feedback that I get from all those who have interacted with him is nothing but positive , which pleases me no end .
As far as his cricket is concerned , I keep teasing him all the time that his father used up all the luck and that 's why he did n't have much left for him .
You batted perfectly in your career ; you believe in structures and systems and temperament and in the hard logic of batting technique - everything to suggest that you are a very rational person .
How do you explain your strong faith and trust in Sai Baba ?
If I tried to go deep into that , I do n't think people would understand .
For me , he is everything .
He is the ultimate .
Just thinking of him gives me such a sense of completeness , such a sense of well - being .
And the knowledge that he is looking after me is such a great sense of comfort , not just for me but also my whole family .
It is hard to really describe it .
" There are a couple of things I would do different , if I had the chance - the 36 not out and the Melbourne incident in 1981 .
These are the two things I would have definitely changed . "
You have been pretty much identified as a loner , a man who lived in his own world as a player , even though cricket is a team game .
But you do have a lot of friends .
If you meet my buddies or friends whom I hang out with , they 'll give you a different picture .
Even during my playing days .
It is an image .
if you play serious and risk - free cricket , the image you get is different .
Even when I played , due to my prankster habits , I really got into trouble with some of my seniors .
That 's a part which was n't seen by anybody .
There was no media explosion like now .
I thank God for it .
You have said in your book that the Indian dressing room was n't the best place to be in .
Yes , maybe on an occasion or during an odd Test match or a series .
But 99.9 % of the time it was an absolute honour to share the room with my team - mates and play for the country .
For all those guys who went out and gave it their best - it was a great honour to play with them .
The happiest moments have been off the field .
When I went to Hyderabad in the 1980s and saw Shivlal Yadav 's house .
To see Roger 's [ Binny ] or Gundappa 's [ Viswanath ] house gave me a lot of pleasure .
They gave it everything , just like everyone else in the team , but they did n't get the endorsements or rewards that Kapil [ Dev ] or I got , or to an extent Ravi [ Shastri ] and Dilip [ Vengsarkar ] got .
But believe you me , their contribution is no less than ours .
If they had n't been in the Indian dressing room and on the field then we would n't have been able to do half of what we did .
So when you look back at the 70s and 80s , some of the old enmities have been sandpapered and smoothed out ?
Yes they are .
To a great extent this was perception or speculation , not anything serious .
People were n't that close to the scene and just got bits and pieces and jumped to their own conclusions .
This does n't happen only in cricket .
We are all always waiting for a good story about something bad about others .
I would look at it like that .
At one point of time you were considered to be a mercenary , yet you had the great ability to completely separate your mental processes when you went out to bat .
Was this difficult ?
I do n't accept to being a mercenary .
I did n't play for people simply because they paid me money .
Yes , I spoke on behalf of the players , for what the players ' body or the fraternity felt .
For a better deal .
I expressed myself maybe because they made me the spokesperson and then when I became the captain I was automatically the spokesperson of the team .
I did take up their issues .
Even today , you speak to cricket officials and explain to them , you will be surprised how much they will do it for you .
You have to be completely articulate .
The administrators were happy to listen to us .
We also learnt that having told them to do something , we had to be patient about it , so I do n't think there was a too much of a problem .
Who would you pick as the all - time greats who came after your retirement who you would have loved to play against ?
Tendulkar and Lara are the first who come to mind .
Then of course Shane Warne , Muttiah Muralitharan , and Wasim Akram are some who also would be right up there .
Another one would be Anil Kumble .
He is such an unassuming player , with 600 - plus wickets and the records that he has .
He is a fantastic cricketer .
Once , you were seen as anti-establishment .
Now you 're on the governing council of the IPL and close to the BCCI , though now out of the ICC …
Cricket is my life .
It is heaven , therefore , to be a part of it or do something for the game .
[ To be with the ] ICC was a huge honour and privilege .
Despite all that , if I do feel something strongly , I still say it .
See , here I go again with my heart leading my head .

The famous “ Naked Cowboy ” , Robert Burck , from New York that entertains tourists in his underwear , wants to run for mayor .
” No one knows how to do more with less than yours truly ” is his kind of thinking that he wants to share with the New York citizens if they elect him .

Robotic Freedom [ Part 3 of the Robotic Nation series ]
by Marshall Brain
In 2003 we are seeing the deployment of automated checkout lines in stores all across the U.S.
This is the leading edge of the robotic revolution in retail .
By 2015 we will start to see voice - recognizing robots helping customers in these stores , inventory - shelving robots putting the products out , cleaning robots sweeping the floors and the parking lots , cart robots bringing the shopping carts back into the store ....
Robots will be moving in to make the completely automated retail store a reality in a 2020 time frame .
[ See Evidence for details . ]
Companies like Wal- mart , K - Mart , Target , Home Depot , Lowes , BJ's , Sam's Club , Toys R Us , Sears , J.C. Penny's , Barnes and Noble , Borders , Best Buy , Circuit City , Office Max , Staples , Office Depot , Kroger 's , Winn - Dixie , Pet Depot , etc. will all switch to robots at approximately the same time .
They will dump 10 million or so workers onto the unemployment rolls at approximately the same time .
Other industries like fast food , construction , transportation , warehousing , etc. will be automating as well , dumping millions more .
The unemployment rate during this period of time could be remarkable .
Even if you assume that the economy reconfigures rapidly and creates new jobs for all of these displaced workers , it will not do so instantaneously .
There will be a year or more of turmoil for each employee as the economy invents the job and the employee retrains to fill it .
More likely , the economy will not be able to absorb all of these displaced workers .
The economy has been creating millions and millions of low - paying , no - benefits , service - sector jobs for the last 40 years .
These jobs are perfect for robotic replacement .
There is no reason to expect that the economy will suddenly figure out a way to create high - paying , exciting , fulfilling jobs for these tens of millions of people displaced by robots .
If the economy could do that , it would be doing it now .
The Jobless Recovery The " Jobless Recovery " that we are currently experiencing in the U.S. is big news .
See for example The Mystery of the ' jobless recovery ' : " Consider these facts : Employment growth at the moment is the lowest for any recovery since the government started keeping such statistics in 1939 .
The labor force shrank in July as discouraged workers stopped seeking employment .
The number of people employed has fallen by more than 1 million since the " recovery " began in the fall of 2001 . " [ ref ]
The Washington Post notes that we are now witnessing , " the longest hiring downturn since the Depression " .
[ ref ]
The article also notes , " The vast majority of the 2.7 million job losses since the 2001 recession began were the result of permanent changes in the U.S. economy and are not coming back . "
There is no mystery -- the jobless recovery is exactly what you would expect in a robotic nation .
When automation and robots eliminate jobs , they are gone for good .
The economy then has to invent new jobs .
But it is much harder to do that now because robots can quickly fill the new jobs that get invented .
See the FAQ for additional information .
The question that I would like to pose in this article is a simple one :
How are we , as a society , going to respond to this robotic revolution ?
If we handle it properly , the arrival of robots could be an incredibly beneficial event for human beings .
If we do not handle it properly , we will end up with millions of unemployed people and a severe economic downturn that will benefit no one .
Can we modify the American economy now to prevent this downturn ?
Are there things that we can do today to smooth the transition to the robotic nation ?
The Concentration of Wealth
If you look at our economy as a whole , you can understand why robots have the potential to be so disruptive if we do not handle their arrival properly .
Here is a highly simplified view of a typical business , be it a fast food restaurant , a retail chain , etc. :
This diagram shows that a corporation takes in raw materials from suppliers on the left .
Using its own assets ( factories , stores , offices , equipment , etc. ) , its employees and its executives , the corporation produces a product or a service .
The corporation sells its products and services either to retail customers ( people ) , or it acts as a supplier for other corporations .
It then pays its employees for the work they do and sends the profit to the shareholders .
The thing that you notice in this diagram is how important people are to this system .
People are where all the money comes from and where all the money goes .
When money comes into a corporation , its original source ( even if it has passed through several corporations along the way ) is a person who spent money .
When money leaves a corporation , eventually it pays a person in the form of a wage , a dividend or a benefit .

One thing that has been happening in the economy for quite some time is a concentration of wealth .
To put the concentration of wealth into perspective , you can look at a report like the Census Bureau 's Money Income in the United States . [ ref ]
This report shows that :
80 percent of the households in America make 50.6 percent of all the income in America .
The richest 20 percent of the households , on the other hand , make 49.4 % of the income .
In the 1960s , the split was closer to 60 / 40 , with 80 % of the population making 60 % of the income , and the richest 20 % of the population making 40 % . [ ref ]
Between 1960 and 2000 , the income split has gone from 60 / 40 to 50/50 .
In 1960 , the wealthiest 20 percent of the U.S. population took home 40 percent of the nation 's income .
By 2000 the wealthiest 20 percent took home 50 percent .
In the future the process accelerates .
We see the reason for this trend regularly in the news .
CEO and executive salaries are rising at a startling pace .
The average CEO of a large corporation now makes between $ 10 million and $ 20 million per year .
Since 1980 , CEO salaries have risen by a factor of 10 , and that same trend is increasing all executive compensation .
William McDonough , president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , notes :
" I find nothing in economic theory that justifies this development ...
I can assure you that we CEOs of today are not 10 times better than those of 20 years ago . " [ ref , ref , ref ]
At the same time , employee wages are stagnant .
The minimum wage has not risen since 1997 .
Since the minimum wage acts as a foundation on which most other wage scales are based , we are all affected .
As a result , sixty percent of Americans make less than $ 14 per hour today .
[ ref ]
In her book The Divine Right of Capital , Marjorie Kelly describes the situation this way :
The wealthiest 10 percent of households own about half of all stock -- so that minority has a virtual economic majority ....
Because corporate revenues represent a bulk of GDP , and the wealthiest own the bulk of corporate equity , running corporations to serve stockholders means running the economy to benefit the wealthy .
[ ref ]
You can see the level of economic power held by the wealthy in today 's society , and the reasons for wage stagnation for workers , in this brief excerpt from the book Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser :
The fast food industry pays the minimum wage to a higher proportion of its workers than any other American industry .
Consequently , a low minimum wage has long been a crucial part the fast food industry 's business plan .
Between 1968 and 1990 , the years when the fast food chains expanded at their fastest rate , the real value of the U.S. minimum wage fell by almost 40 percent .
In the late 1990s , the real value of the U.S. minimum wage still remained about 27 percent lower than it was in the late 1960s .
Nevertheless , the National Restaurant Association ( NRA ) has vehemently opposed any rise in the minimum wage at the federal , state or local level [ minimum wage has been $ 5.15 since 1997 ] .
About 60 large fast food companies -- including Jack in the Box , Wendy's , Chevy's , and Red Lobster -- have backed Congressional legislation that would essentially eliminate the federal minimum wage by allowing states to disregard it .
Pete Meersman , the president of the Colorado Restaurant Association , advocates creating a federal guest worker program to import low - wage foodservice workers from overseas .
While the real value of the wages paid to restaurant workers has declined for the past three decades , the earnings of restaurant company executives have risen considerably .
According to a 1997 survey in Nation 's Restaurant News , the average corporate executive bonus was $ 131,000 , an increase of 20 percent over the previous year .

For dozens of articles demonstrating the
Concentration of Wealth
in America today ,
Click Here and here .
Robots will turbocharge the concentration of wealth .
Let 's take America 's largest corporation -- Wal - Mart -- as an example .
Wal - Mart currently employs over 1.3 million people .
Imagine that Wal - Mart is able to deploy robots over a relatively short period of time and eliminate one million of those employees .
With most of the rank and file employees replaced by robots and eliminated from the payroll , all of the money flowing into a large corporation has only one place to go -- upward toward the executives and shareholders .
The concentration of wealth will be dramatic when robots arrive .
How Concentrated ?
In the August 18 , 2003 issue of Time magazine , the article They 're Getting Richer notes that , since the dividend tax cut in June , 2003 , more than 200 firms have raised their dividends .
Since executives generally own lots of stock , this means a huge pay increase for them .
How big are the increases ?
Here are several examples : Robert Glickman of Corus Bankshares saw his dividend income rise from $ 1.3 million to $ 5.8 million .
Sandy Weill of Citigroup saw his dividend income rise from $ 11 million to $ 27 million .
Henry Paulson of Goldman Sachs saw his dividend income rise from $ 1.2 million to $ 3.4 million .
James Cayne of Bear Sterns saw his dividend income rise from $ 1.8 million to $ 3.3 million .
Bill Gates of Microsoft saw his dividend income rise from $ 0 to $ 82 million .
Sumner Redstone of Viacom saw his dividend income rise from $ 0 to $ 41 million .
This is just the dividend income of these executives , and does not include their salaries , annual bonuses , stock options , restricted shares , forgivable loans , free trips on corporate jets , benefit packages , etc .
All of the money for these dividends comes either from consumers in the form of higher prices or from rank and file workers in the form of lower wages .
The concentration of wealth accelerates .
See also the CW gallery .
Meanwhile , the one million displaced employees will flow into a job market that is flooded by robotically - displaced workers .
Since all major corporations with large numbers of employees will be doing the same thing , it is difficult to imagine the economy suddenly creating enough jobs to absorb all of the displaced workers .
If the economy does not create new jobs for them , they will be living in government welfare dormitories .
A Question of Freedom
While discussing these questions of unemployment and wealth concentration , we should ask a second type of question as well .
The arrival of robots should be an amazing time in human history .
With robots doing all the work , we should in theory be able to enter an era of incredible human freedom and creativity .
Instead of turmoil and massive unemployment , robots could theoretically release us from work .
A significant portion of the population should be able to go on perpetual vacation and achieve true freedom for the first time in human history .
This freedom would enable a period of creativity unlike anything that we have seen in the past .
Is there a way to design the economy so that this level of creativity is possible ?
Think about the era we are about to enter .
Within 50 years in the likely case , and without question within 100 years , robots will perform every task essential to human survival .
Robots will grow , package , transport and sell all of the food we eat .
Robots will build all of the housing we live in .
Robots will make , transport and sell all of the clothes we wear .
Robots will manufacture all consumer products , put them on the shelves and take the money that we pay for them .
And so on .
Robots will displace the tens of millions of employees who are doing all of this work now .
In our current economic system , all of these displaced workers will become unemployed .
If they are not able to find new employment quickly , they will burn off their savings and they will become homeless .
" If you do n't work , you do n't eat " is a core philosophy of today 's economy , and this rule could make a rapid robotic takeover extremely uncomfortable for our society .
See Robotic Nation for details .
The question to ask here is simple but profound .
Does the economy have to work that way in a robotic nation ?
Is there a way to eliminate this dependence on a job ?
With the robots doing all of the work , can we actually eliminate our economy 's requirement of employment ?
Can human beings , in other words , actually achieve true freedom as the robots make this freedom a possibility ?
Harry Potter and the Economy
Chances are that you have heard of J. K. Rowling .
Even if you have not , you have heard of her work .
J. K. Rowling is the author of the Harry Potter books .
Her story is fascinating .
At the time she was writing the first Harry Potter book , Rowling was a single mother .
In a Publishers Weekly article published on December 21 , 1998 , there are two important pieces of information about Rowling :
" Lacking child care and unable to take a job without it , she [ Rowling ] went on public assistance .
In many ways , she says , it was one of the lowest points of her life . "
" She found Christopher Little in 1995 , in the Writers ' & Artists ' Yearbook ( the UK equivalent of Literary Market Place ) .
He was the second agent to see her book -- the first had sent it back " virtually by return of post , " with a form letter .
In the year that followed , three publishers declined the book on the grounds that it was too long for children . "
When you think about it , it is a miracle that any of us ever got to read Harry Potter .
Consider the fact that a book with this much potential was written by a person on welfare .
Think about how many other works -- music , art , literature , engineering , science , invention -- have never seen the light of day because of the same sorts of social problems ( or because the potential author / artist / inventor is working 12 hours a day scrubbing toilets in two minimum wage jobs to make ends meet ) .
Think about the arrogance of the first three publishers who rejected the manuscript .
Think about how many valuable works have never seen the light of day because of that same arrogance .
Society as it is designed today wastes an unbelievable amount of human potential through mechanisms just like these .
At the very least , Rowling 's story shows us that the economic theory underpinning our world contains an element of dysfunction .
It should not be the case that highly creative people sitting on top of billion dollar ideas have to go on welfare ( and reach " one of the lowest points " in their lives by doing so ) in order to express themselves .
By removing this dysfunction , we could discover millions of Rowlings .
The Linux phenomenon specifically , and the open source phenomenon in general , point in the same direction .
Linux is one of the best operating systems on the planet , and it is free .
It has been created by thousands of programmers who have donated their time and skills to the creation of Linux .
What if we create an economy that encourages the creation of things like Linux ?
If people could make a living without being employees , we could unlock an unimaginable ocean of human creativity and human potential .
Other parts of our economy are showing similar levels of dysfunction .
For example , in the U.S. today a growing number of baby boomers are headed toward retirement age .
They will all stop working and make the transition to the social security system .
However , the social security system is known to be in big trouble .
Estimates vary , but as early as a decade from now , social security and its partner , Medicare , could collapse due to lack of funds .
We will find ourselves in a situation where we have no way to support the growing elderly population .
As medical science finds ways for people to live longer and longer , we as a society find ourselves wishing that the elderly would actually die sooner .
That is dysfunctional .
The working poor represent another area of dysfunction .
We have a large segment of the American population -- tens of millions of people -- who are playing by the rules .
They are working hard .
Many of them are working two or three jobs -- they are some of the hardest working people in our economy .
Yet they cannot make ends meet because wages are so low .
We have been unable to raise the minimum wage since 1997 largely because of the fear of an economic downturn .
The fear is that an increase in the minimum wage will force employers to cut their payrolls , or put even more pressure on corporations to automate and shift jobs overseas .
So we have tens of millions of minimum wage ( or near minimum wage ) workers employed by an economy which cannot raise their wages even though productivity is rising .
At the same time , that same economy is increasing executive pay dramatically .
That is dysfunctional .
As discussed above , robots will only increase the level of dysfunction in this area .
As a society , and as a nation , robots give us a choice .
We are entering an historic era that has the potential to completely change the human condition .
Yet we enter it with an economic system that is unable to spread those robotic benefits to a large portion of the population .
Our economic system as it stands today stifles a great deal of creativity , has no way to deal with the elderly and is unable to significantly raise wages for the majority of its citizens .
Robots allow us to remove these dysfunctional elements from the capitalistic system .
Stating the Goals
Economic Goals Goal # 1 -
For the strongest possible economy , we need to create the largest possible pool of consumers , and those consumers need to have money to spend .
Goal # 2 -
For the strongest possible economy , we need maximum economic stability .
Every economic downturn has occurred when people stop spending money , either because they do n't have money to spend through unemployment , or because they are afraid to let go of their money for fear of future unemployment .
Consumers need to have confidence in the economy , both on the spending and the receiving ends of the equation .
Goal # 3 -
For the strongest possible economy , we need to create the largest possible pool of innovators -- people who create innovative new businesses , new inventions , new products , new art ( films , music , etc. ) and new intellectual property .
Capitalism is strongest when new ideas are maximized .
Goal # 4 -
For the strongest possible economy , we need for people to invest in these new ideas , both individually and in groups .
An idea is nothing unless it is put into action .
Without the money provided by investment , there can be no new businesses and no new products .
Goal # 5 -
For the strongest possible economy , we need for people to have maximum freedom .
People need the freedom to choose the products they want from an open marketplace of maximum size .
They need to be free to start businesses of their own .
They need to be free to work on their ideas and carry them as far as possible .
At the same time , people need to be free to take time off and relax as they so choose .
The notion that you have to work 60 hours a week to make ends meet is the antithesis of freedom .
Should we ban robots from the workplace ?
Probably not .
Banning technology from the workplace is the path to economic stagnation .
It also means that people rather than robots will be scrubbing toilets for the next millenium .
Should we significantly increase the minimum wage so that people working in minimum wage jobs can actually make a living ?
Probably , but it is unlikely to happen .
And most minimum wage workers will still become unemployed as robots arrive .
Should we reduce the work week , say to 30 hours per week ( then 20 , then 10 ) , to decrease unemployment and increase leisure time ?
It would be outstanding if we could make this decision as a society , but all indicators today point in the opposite direction .
The working poor are making so little money that they are having to work 60 hours a week in two or three jobs .
Many salaried employees are compelled to work far more than 40 hours per week .
We would have to reverse a number of trends to move our society to a 30 hour work week , and corporations will resist these changes every step of the way .
Should we dramatically increase the welfare and unemployment systems to accommodate all of the workers displaced by robots ?
That is unlikely to happen .
Besides , who wants to be on welfare ?
Should the government hire all displaced workers in make - work jobs ?
Probably not .
Do we really want tens of millions of people employed in meaningless jobs run by the government ?
Should we tax robotic labor ?
We have never taxed any other form of automation , so it is difficult to imagine this happening .
For example , a burglar alarm is a robot that replaces a security guard .
Should we tax all burglar alarms ?
And a traditional tax would go to the government , which would then have to distribute the money through something like the traditional welfare system -- a system that has proven extremely uncomfortable to society in the past .
We start by stating our goals for the economy and then attempting to find a solution that helps us to reach them .
Five important goals are listed in the sidebar on the right .
If we can achieve these goals , in a context where robots are dramatically increasing productivity and doing more and more of the mindless work that wastes human potential , we will have an economy whose strength and growth defies imagination .
How do we achieve these goals ?
Capitalism Supersized
The following suggestion at first seems impractical because it is so simple :
What if we , as a society , simply give consumers money to spend in the economy ?
In other words :
What if the way to achieve the strongest possible economy is to give every citizen more money to spend ?
For example , what if we gave every citizen of the United States $ 25,000 to spend ?
$ 25,000 sounds impossible the first time you hear it , but consider the possibility .
Would this simple step -- giving money to every consumer -- accomplish the five economic goals set forth in the previous section ?
Yes .
It would be a huge boost to the American economy :
The economy would be strong because of all of the consumer spending .
The economy would be stable because income ( and therefore spending ) would be guaranteed .
With $ 25,000 per year to spend , innovators would no longer be forced to work -- they could focus their energy on innovation , living off of the $ 25 K per year they receive .
Inventors would have time to invent , writers to write , entrepreneurs to breed new companies , etc .
They could devote all of their time to innovation .
There would be billions of dollars for people to invest , especially in their own businesses .
And investors would have a stable marketplace into which to introduce new products .
Sources for the $ 25,000
The obvious question involves the $ 25,000 .
Where will it come from ?
That is what is so interesting about this idea .
We have never thought of our economy in this way before .
Once we start thinking in this way it is easy to imagine numerous sources for the money .
If we start today , we can begin ramping up to reach the goal .
Here are several examples to help you understand the possibilities .
Example # 1 - public advertising
There are approximately seven billion $ 1 bills circulating in the economy at any given moment .
What if we sold the backs of all these $ 1 bills as ad space ?
Assume each $ 1 bill passes between 100 people before it becomes so tattered that it gets shredded by the treasury .
According to this page , " The average life of a dollar bill is eighteen months . "
That means that every year , there are something like 500 billion ad impressions available on the backs of $ 1 bills .
What if we sold the ad space on all these $ 1 bills to companies like Coke , Disney , Home Depot and Wal - Mart ?
If we sold that ad space ( along with all the ad space on the backs of $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 and $ 50 bills ) at the going rate for advertising , it could generate something like $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion per year in revenue .
That 's a lot of money .
There are nearly 300 million people in America .
Since this ad space belongs to " We , The People " , the ad revenue would get divided equally among all the citizens of the United States and everyone would get a check for something like $ 25 per year .
How would we distribute the money ?
It is easy to imagine a central account .
The billions of dollars in ad revenue would flow into this central account , and the money in the account would get distributed on an equal basis to every American citizen .
We would all get our $ 25 dollar checks from the central account , and what would we do ?
We would spend the money .
It would be just like getting a tax rebate .
The $ 25 that we each spend would stimulate the economy , and the economy would grow .
$ 25 is a far cry from the $ 25,000 suggested above -- it 's only 0.1 % of the goal .
But it is a start .
What you can see from this example is that :
It is easy to imagine a system where every person in the country gets a check .
It is easy to imagine a source of money for those checks that does not necessarily involve taxation .
It is easy to imagine that , once everyone gets their checks , they will spend the money and in so doing stimulate the economy .
Each time you drive on an interstate highway you pass underneath bridges .
We could sell the natural advertising space on those bridge overpasses .
We could sell signage space along the side of the road .
For that matter , we could sell advertising space on the interstate highways themselves .
What if we painted ads right onto the asphalt ?
If we want to be extreme about it , we could put ads on the side of the Washington monument .
There are many other ways to generate revenue that can flow through the central account to every American citizen , and every source of revenue moves us closer to the goal of $ 25,000 per citizen per year .
I have listed several ideas below .
I am not suggesting that these are all perfect ideas , or that I agree with all of them .
I am simply listing them to spark discussion and get all of us thinking about the possibilities .
Example # 2 - Natural resources
In Alaska , there is a central account like the one we are discussing here already in operation .
It is called The Alaska Permanent Fund .
In 2002 , each man , woman and child in Alaska received a check for $ 1,500 from this fund .
The money came from oil reserves in Alaska -- a natural resource that is the property of " We , The People " .
$ 1,500 per man , woman and child per year is real money .
There are all sorts of natural resources in the U.S. that could provide money to the central account in the same way : oil , natural gas , timber , precious metals , water , etc .
Instead of the revenue from the sale of these natural resources going to " the government " , the revenue would go to the central account and be paid equally to every citizen of the United States .
Alaska shows that such a system will actually work and will provide real economic benefit to the citizens of the United States .
Example # 3 - Fines
What would you do with $ 25,000 per year ?
Should we enact a $ 25,000 per year stipend for every citizen of the United States ?
The easiest way to answer that question is to make it personal .
Ask yourself this question -- what would you do if you , personally , received a $ 25,000 stipend per year ?
There are a million things you would likely do if you had the freedom provided by $ 25,000 per year .
If you have children or grandchildren , you would spend more time with them .
If you have always wanted to start your own business or go back to college , you would do that .
If you have been wanting to write your novel , start a new career or research an invention , you would do that .
You would use the freedom provided by a $ 25,000 stipend to make your life better .
That is why we should enact the $ 25,000 per year stipend .
See the FAQ for more information .
Instead of going to " the government " , the revenue from all of these fines would go into the central account , to be distributed to every American citizen .
American citizens would get a check and they would spend the money .
In the process they would stimulate the economy and the economy would grow .
[ In recent news there is this article : Microsoft Fine Is $ 613 Million .
That would work out to about $ 200 per person in the United States .
There is also this : FCC Proposes $ 9 Million Fine Against Qwest .
If you type the word " fine " into Goolgle News , you realize that just this example alone could yield billions of dollars for the central account . ]
Example # 4 - Auctions
With all of the wireless devices now in use ( wireless phones , wireless networks , etc. ) , it is quite common for governments to auction off pieces of the radio spectrum .
There was an auction in the U.K. not so long ago that brought in $ 35 billion ( $ 35 billion represents about $ 100 per U.S. citizen ) .
The radio spectrum is the property of " We , The People " , so the money from spectrum auctions would flow to the central account to be distributed to every American citizen .
Each citizen would get a check from every spectrum auction , each citizen would spend the money , and in the process each citizen would stimulate the economy .
Example # 5 - National Lottery
Most states in the U.S. now have state lotteries that flush money into state treasuries .
If we create a national lottery , the proceeds would go into the central account and get distributed to every citizen of the United States .
Example # 6 - Copyright Licensing
This is an esoteric idea , but still interesting to consider .
Congress has recently been granting copyright extensions so that companies like Disney can maintain control of copyrighted works , including characters like Mickey Mouse .
This article discusses the case if you would like some background .
If congress had not acted , Mickey Mouse and many other works would now be in the public domain .
An alternative to these blanket extensions would be to let copyrights expire , but then allow companies like Disney to pay for an exclusive license to continue using a property .
The revenue from the license would flow into the central account and be distributed to every citizen of the United States .
Each citizen would spend the money , and in the process each citizen would stimulate the economy .
Example # 7 - " Extreme Income " Taxes
As mentioned earlier in this article , executives in the U.S. are making more and more money every year .
Executive salaries have risen by a factor of 10 in the last 20 years .
The average CEO now makes tens of millions of dollars every year , and that trend pushes up all executive salaries as well .
Meanwhile , the wages of rank and file workers are stagnant .
What if " We , The People " vote for an " extreme income " tax , on these excessive salaries ?
The President of the United States , after all , only makes $ 400,000 per year .
Someone making $ 10 million per year is clearly overpaid .
So we pick a number -- say $ 500,000 or $ 1 million -- and we heavily tax income over that level .
What is the justification for doing that ?
This diagram explains it :
When an executive makes $ 20 million per year , the money does not materialize out of thin air .
It comes from consumers in the form of higher prices that they pay for everything that they purchase .
For an executive to make $ 20 million per year , a company has to overcharge consumers for the products they purchase from the company .
It is not as though the $ 20 million paid to the executive appears out of thin air -- it comes from consumers in the form of higher prices .
An " extreme income " tax simply takes that excess compensation and returns it back to consumers , where the money originally came from .
The same logic could apply to inheritance taxes .
Imagine that an executive who makes $ 20 million per year dies with $ 1 billion in assets .
We heavily tax " extreme assets " like that when the executive dies and return the money back to the American people , where the money originally came from .
The money is distributed to each American citizen equally through the central account , and the money stimulates the economy .
Example # 8 - National Mutual Fund
The idea of a national mutual fund owned by all of the citizens of the United States has been proposed by a number of different people .
Such a mutual fund would own shares of stock in every corporation in the United States and give every citizen of the United States equal ownership in the mutual fund .
The shares for this national mutual fund could come from a variety of sources .
Two possibilities include :
Whenever any corporation is formed , some percentage of the corporation 's shares ( e.g. 20 % ) would automatically become the property of the national mutual fund .
Existsing corporations would contribute the same percentage of their shares as well .
Whenever a corporation declares retained earnings , the percentage of shares represented by those retained earnings would become the property of the national mutual fund .
The logic :
For the corporation to have retained earnings , it had to overcharge consumers .
Since the money came from consumers , it is given back to consumers in the form of shares .
Like the The Alaska Permanent Fund , this national mutual fund would pay dividends every year , and these dividends would flow into the central account for distribution .
Example # 9 - Other Taxes
There are a wide variety of new taxes that we might create to pump money into the central account .
The difference between these new taxes and " regular " taxes is that the revenue from the new taxes goes directly to every citizen of the United States , rather than going to " the government " and being subjected to the whims of the political system .
American citizens have the freedom to decide how they will spend the money , rather than politicians .
New taxes that we might consider include :
A value added tax .
A national property tax .
A national sales tax .
A robotic income tax .
" Extreme income " taxes and inheritance taxes as described above .
And so on .
Example # 10 - Punitive Damages
When a person sues a company and wins , there are normally two components to the award : part is compensation for the damage done , and part is punitive .
For example , a person suing a cigarette company might receive $ 5 million as compensation for injuries , as well as $ 3 billion to punish the cigarette company and send a message . [ ref ]
That punitive damage award is uncomfortable .
Millions of people have been damaged by cigarettes -- why should one person get all of the money for all of that damage ?
Instead , we should send all punitive damage awards from lawsuits to the central account for distribution to everyone .
Example # 11 - Naming rights
This article discusses Los Angeles ' plan to sell naming rights for the city , and naming " official " beverages , cars , etc. like the Olympics does .
We could do the same thing for each state and the nation , and pour billions of dollars into the central account .
Example # 12 - Sin taxes
The government regularly taxes things like cigarettes and alcohol in order to deter their consumption with higher prices .
All sin taxes could go into the central account instead of to the government .
Example # 13 - Luxury Taxes
Luxury taxes have been applied to things like expensive cars and boats .
These taxes could be made permanent , and the revenue from them could flow into the central account .
Example # 14 - " Extreme Profit " taxes
There are a number of companies in the U.S. that now operate without any real form of competition .
In these cases , the checks and balances of the market system break down , and the companies are able to take in incredible amounts of profit at the expense of consumers .
Microsoft is one example of the phenomenon .
If you look at Microsoft 's financial statements for 2003 , you can see that the company took in $ 32 billion in total revenue and made a gross profit of $ 26 billion .
Net income is $ 10 billion ( 31 % of revenue ) , or approximately $ 100 for every American household .
How does Microsoft compare to a " normal company " ?
Wal - Mart is no slouch as a company , and Wal - Mart concentrates wealth as fast as it can , but it makes an interesting comparison to Microsoft .
Wal - Mart takes in $ 246 billion in total revenue per year -- more than seven times as much revenue as Microsoft .
Yet Wal - Mart 's gross profit is only twice that of Microsoft , and Wal - Mart makes less in net income than Microsoft does ( $ 8 billion , or 3 % of revenue ) .
In cases like Microsoft ( as well as other examples like pharmaceutical companies ) , where gross profit and net income are clearly out - of - bounds because of a breakdown in a market system , these windfall profits can be taxed away and returned to the place they came from -- consumers -- through the central account .
Any other example of windfall profit ( e.g. oil companies when gasoline prices spike upward ) can be taxed and depositied in the central account in the same way .
As these unfair profits are returned to people through the central account , the recipients will spend the money and the economy will grow .
Example # 15 - Lexus Lanes
Many large cities have installed special traffic lanes on major thoroughfares called HOV ( High Occupancy Vehicle ) lanes .
The idea is to reward people who carpool by giving them a way around congestion .
Lately , however , the trend is toward turning these lanes into toll lanes , so that wealthy people can bypass traffic .
This article discusses the trend .
If laws like this pass , the money that these new toll roads generate should go into the central account for distribution .
As pointed out by Rep. John Douglas , R - Covington , in the article : " People already paid to build these roads , and they pay to keep ' em up . "
Since that is the case , the people should get the money generated by the tolls -- through the central account .
They will then spend that money and the economy will grow .
Example # 16 - Email postage
In March of 2004 , Bill Gates of Microsoft proposed a postage system for email to deter spam .
Email would no longer be free -- instead , everyone would pay a few cents per email .
Trillions of emails are sent every year in the United States .
If you assume 10 trillion emails per year at a penny per email , then email postage would produce approximately $ 100 billion per year .
All of the money generated by this email postage fee should flow into the central account .
As people receive their checks from the central account , they will spend the money and stimulate the economy .
The Advantages of Economic Security
Why do we give tax rebates in the United States ?
The idea behind a rebate is to stimulate our capitalistic economy by giving consumers more money to spend .
The proposal presented in this article is a simple extension of the tax rebate concept .
The idea is to stimulate the economy continuously through monthly rebate checks to every citizen from a central account .
We could call this approach Turbo Capitalism .
We will turbocharge the capitalistic system by continuously giving consumers more money to spend in the economy .
Or we could call it an Economic Security System .
We will give every citizen the money he or she needs to be independently financially secure .
In a robotic nation , economic security is perhaps the most valuable thing a human being can have .
Money flows into the central account from a variety of sources and then flows equally to every American citizen .
They spend the money and in the process stimulate the economy -- turbo capitalism
The money that flows into this central account can come from a variety of sources , several of which are mentioned above .
The proceeds then get distributed equally to every American citizen on a monthly basis .
The advantages of a system like this would be significant :
Most importantly , an economic security system eliminates many of the problems that will otherwise appear with the arrival of robots and the robotic nation .
As people become unemployed by robots , the payments from the central account offer people an independent and secure stream of income .
Unlike welfare , there is no stigma attached to the payments from the central account .
Everyone gets an equal payment , so the central account is completely fair to everyone .
The payments are not subject to the whims of politics , as they are with welfare payments .
An economic security system solves the social security problem .
Since every citizen receives a check , we can dismantle social security .
Existing social security taxes can be redirected into the central account .
An economic security system eliminates poverty .
Under this system , every citizen in the United States receives the money needed to live a middle class existence , regardless of whether or not they are working .
All of the money currently spent on poverty can be redirected to the central account .
An economic security system provides a tremendous level of economic stability .
Since everyone has guaranteed income , they also have guaranteed spending and this will largely eliminate significant economic downturns .
An economic security system increases opportunity .
For example : A person who wants to go to college will have the opportunity to go at any point in life .
This will help people retrain for new careers , and also unlock people from life - long economic strata .
A person who wants to start a business , large or small , knows that the business is being started in a stable economy .
The person also has income to fall back on during the critical first years when the business is working to become cashflow positive .
An economic security system maximizes the economic freedom of every citizen , and in the process maximizes the creativity of inventors , authors , entrepreneurs , etc .
If creative people have the freedom to live their lives without being employees , we will unlock an unimaginable ocean of human creativity and human potential .
This system gives the American people true economic freedom for the first time in American history .
You , Personally , and the Robots
What about you , personally ?
Think about your situation .
It does not matter who you are or what you do for a living -- you are vulnerable :
If you are working anywhere in the service sector -- fast food , retail sales , hotels , airlines , delivery , transportation , etc. -- your job has the potential to be replaced by a robot .
If you are in the upper middle class -- engineers , programmers , airline pilots , teachers , professors , insurance adjusters , etc. -- your job is vulnerable ( either to robotic takeover or offshore outsourcing ) .
If you are in middle management , your job is vulnerable .
Even if you are in a position that today seems untouchable -- doctors , lawyers , etc. -- your job is vulnerable .
Do you , personally , want to continue to live with that level of personal economic vulnerability ?
Do we , as a society , want to continue to create an economy and a society that is poised at any moment to swing drastically downward based on a huge variety of rather tiny and uncontrollable perturbances such as terrorist attacks , oil supply variations , stock market bubbles , weather , etc . ?
Or would you like to see us begin putting in place a system that provides each of us with some measure of personal economic security ?
Robots have the potential to do so much good for the world , because they will finally free people from the requirement of human labor .
The only way for all of us to experience these benefits , however , is to create an economic system that maximizes freedom and choice for everyone in the economy .
The proposal presented in this article shows that there are ways to enhance the capitalistic system and in the process make life better for everyone .
My hope is that we begin discussing and then implementing systems that will let our society and our economy get the most benefit from the new robotic nation .
We should use robots to give every citizen true economic freedom for the first time in human history .
Lying With Statistics
How to Lie with Statistics
Just for interest , we looked at some ways to deceive using statistics .
The little book , " How to Lie With Statistics " was written about 1954 .
You can still get it today !
It may be 50 years old , but the funny business that Darrell Huff described in the 50's is still going on today .
The book is just as useful now as it was in 1954 .
Everyone ought to read it .
It 's listed in the auxiliary reading page .
As part of your life education , read this neat little book .
Keep it in your library .
A number of class members write their first book reviews about it .
Deceptive Presentation
You are used to seeing graphs illustrating numbers .
Done right , they are VERY helpful in interpreting data .
Done in a fishy fashion , they can deceive .
The first basic trick is to have the Y axis ( vertical ) start at some value above zero .
This allows you to magnify ( vertically ) the display .
Very small variations ( with time , for example ) can be made to look very large .
The plot is legitimate as long as the axes are correctly labeled , although the reader who does not catch the labeling will be misled by the visual appearance even if the axes are labeled correctly !
There 's even one example in the book that has no labeling on the Y axis at all !
Your guess is as good as anyone else 's what it means .
There 's another neat trick - displaying a one - dimensional value in two dimensions .
Huff uses the example of moneybags , one twice as tall as the other .
The picture is ostensibly representing one person having twice as much moola as another .
The deception is visual ; although the larger bag is correctly twice as tall as the smaller one , the AREA you see in the picture is 4 times larger !
And if you think about the volume it is 8 times larger !
Your eye will pick up the area or volume and deliver a misleading impression .
Semiattached Numbers
A semiattached number is a number which looks really interesting but actually is not as relevant as it appears .
It looks good but means very little ( or nothing ) .
Consider the claim that some product is " 25 % better . "
You ask " 25 % better than what ? "
Aaahh - you do n't know that ; the ad does n't tell you .
Some digging will be required to sort it out .
Now consider profit percentage .
Would you rather run a business that turns a profit of 20 % or one that returns 1 % ?
You would , of course , choose the 20 % return - unless you looked very closely at the claims .
Suppose that the 20 % return is an annual ROI ( Return on Investment ) and the 1 % is a Return on Sales .
they are not the same .
Suppose you are an enterprising kid selling newspapers .
You buy the newspapers for 98 cents each , pay your selling costs and keep 1 cent per paper .
That 's the 1 % return on sales .
Sounds lousy ?
Imagine that you start a year with $ 98 ; that buys you 100 newspapers , which you sell for $ 1 each .
With 100 newspapers you make 1 cent times 100 , or $ 1 for the day .
Does n't sound good till you realize that you can do this 365 days per year .
You make $ 365 per year .
That 's a total annual return of 372 % !!!
This is a result of inventory turnover .
Digression About Elections
Recall the difficulties with the election in 2000 .
This is a different problem .
It is acknowledged that all vote - counting systems will lose some votes .
Not many , but some .
This means that any vote count has a small amount of uncertainty in it .
This is not normally a problem , as the uncertainty amounts to a fraction of a percent .
If the margin for some race is 55 % to 45 % , a fraction of a percent is of no consequence .
What happened in Florida was that the margin between Bush and Gore was smaller than the uncertainty !
The only thing to do was take the numbers from the official count and go with them .
Three recounts could produce three different results .
This was , fortunately , a rare occurrence .
The only way to deal with it is to use vote counting systems that lose or confuse the smallest number of votes .
Distributions : Mean , Median , Mode
When talking about a group of values you hear of the " average " value .
You might assume one thing but , on occasion , someone with an ulterior motive will use something different .
The natural assumption is the arithmetic mean , which is the sum of the numbers divided by the count .
There is another " average " that is sometimes used , namely the median .
If you take all the values and arrange them in ascending order , then take the middle one , you have the median .
It means that half of the values were lower and half were higher .
Example : Suppose you want to buy a home in a area where the average income is high ( you might make some good connections among your neighbors ) .
Your agent shows you a development in which the average income is over $ 1,000,000 annually .
That sounds really good , so you buy .
However , over time , your notice that few of your neighbors actually seem very wealthy .
In fact , you can't seem to find anyone with an income over $ 100,000 .
Did the real estate agent deceive you ?
Yes , in a way .
It turns out that there is a tiny little cul - de- sac where 4 or 5 really highly paid executives live .
They pull down $ 10,000,000 or more .
The rest of the residents are in the $ 60,000 to $ 100,000 range .
The few VERY LARGE incomes pulled the average WAY UP .
You'd get a better picture of the income distribution by using the median , which might be $ 75,000 or so .
A few large values skewing the distribution will drag the arithmetic average up but will not have much effect on the median .
This dynamic plays out globally , as well .
For instance , the " average " ( mean ) household net worth in America is around $ 500,000 -- one of the highest levels of average wealth in the world .
However , because America suffers from such high levels of wealth inequality , our * median * household net worth is only around $ 50,000 -- one of the lowest levels in the developed world !
In fact , the ratio of mean to median net worth is one measure of wealth inequality , and by this metric the United States is one of the most unequal countries in the world .
There 's one other parameter of a distribution worth mentioning - the mode .
The mode is the peak of the distribution , or the value that occurs most often .
If the number are distributed truly randomly ( the classic bell curve ) , the average , median and mode will coincide .
If the distribution is NOT bell - shaped , the three will separate .
Post Hoc Thinking
Darrell Huff , in his neat little book , notes the results of a survey of Cornell graduates ( in the 1950's ) .
The survey showed that 93 % of the middle - aged male graduates were married but only 65 percent of the women were .
One popular magazine writer quickly concluded that going to college seriously reduced a woman 's chances of marriage .
Or did it ??
The correlation is real - the women did indeed marry at a lower rate .
But - implying a causation is risky .
Remember - correlation does not necessarily mean causation .
Consider the following alternative explanation : the young women who go to Cornell are those who are more likely to delay marriage in favor of a career .
A career - oriented woman would be more likely to attend a university and then head into a career than a marriage - oriented woman .
The obvious correlation is a result of a single factor that is producing BOTH results .
Extrapolation
Extrapolation is an attempt to predict some phenomenon that lies outside the basis of experience .
We looked at a table of record times for running the mile .
Since 1913 there has been a steady downward trend .
Prof .
Scalise has plotted the times against the year , and from that we can see a roughly linear function .
Now for the fun .
We extrapolate and extend this linear function into the future and see that , in about 2050 , someone will run the mile in zero seconds !
Obviously , the extrapolation is not valid .
An extrapolation figured into analysis of the foam strike that resulted in the destruction of the shuttle Columbia in 2003 .
Data about the piece of foam that was observed to strike Columbia were fed into the " crater " model that NASA engineers used to evaluate the effect of foam strikes .
Given the size of the piece and the impact velocity , the model would return a damage value .
When parameters for the observed foam strike were fed to crater , it indicated that , while the damage would be significant , it was not a real hazard .
This was an extrapolation , as the piece that hit Columbia was 400 times larger than any piece ever seen .
Operating outside of the experience base , the model returned an incorrect estimate .
Simpson's Paradox
Sometimes two or more studies can individually support one conclusion , but the combined statistics support the opposite conclusion .
Non-transitive Paradox
If A is better than B and B is better than C , then how is A related to C ?
Surprisingly , A is not always better than C !
Remember the kid 's game Rock - Paper - Scissors : Rock breaks Scissors , Scissors cut Paper , but Paper covers Rock .
The Geometric Mean
Although Huff did n't mention this one , we added it for completeness .
A good example of the use of a geometric mean is in figuring average return on investment .
Suppose that , over a period of years , an investment returned 5 % , 8 % , 12 % , 8 % , - 3 % , 1 % and 4 % .
What was the average annual return ??
Here , you must MULTIPLY the returns , not add them .
1.05 * 1.08 * 1.12 * 1.08 * 0.97 * 1.01 * 1.04
and then take the 7th root of the resulting product .

In a long - awaited move designed to protect people from cancer , California on Thursday proposed a new health goal for chromium 6 in drinking water that is thousands of times lower than the amount contaminating some water supplies .
The recommendation culminates a decade of debate among scientists trying to decide what concentration is safe to drink .
The controversial water contaminant was made famous by Erin Brockovich and a small Mojave Desert town that won the largest tort injury settlement in U.S. history .
The proposal “ is the first in the nation that identified a health - protective level of chromium 6 in drinking water , ” said Joan Denton , director of the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment .
The office ’s new recommendation , called a “ public health goal , ” is 0.06 parts per billion .
The state ’s current standard for total chromium compounds in drinking water is 50 ppb—about 800 times higher .
The national standard is 100 ppb .
The health guideline is not enforceable at this point , but it will prompt a more stringent state regulation for water supplies throughout California .
Under state law , that regulation must be as close to the public health goal as possible , taking into account what is technically and financially feasible for water suppliers .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is reevaluating the national standard but has not yet issued a proposal .
Renee Sharp , director of the California office of the Environmental Working Group , an environmental health advocacy organization , said it is “ definitely a good health guideline ” that was “ too long in coming . ”
“ We really want to see the state act very quickly to set a drinking water standard .
It ’s so clear that there are so many Californians being exposed , ” she said , adding that “ this is a significant public health issue that needs to be addressed not just in California , but nationally . ”
California proposed the new goal because a recent federal study resolved a decade - long debate by concluding that chromium 6 can cause cancer when ingested .
The 0.06 ppb was calculated by determining the amount , based on the new animal data , that might cause no more than one cancer among every one million people exposed for a lifetime .
The small town of Hinkley in San Bernardino County has the highest levels of chromium 6 , also known as hexavalent chromium , ever reported in U.S. water .
Its ground water contained as much as 580 parts per billion -- nearly 10,000 times higher than the new proposed goal .
Based on the state ’s new recommendation , Hinkley residents who drank that level in water over their lifetime faced an extremely high cancer risk — an estimated one cancer for every 100 people exposed .
The compound seeped into the water from a Pacific Gas and Electric facility where it was used to coat cooling towers and discharged into holding ponds in the 1950s and 1960s .
PG&E paid a $ 333 million settlement to about 600 residents of Hinkley in 1996 , after Brockovich , a law clerk , investigated the contamination and found high rates of cancer and other diseases .
A 2000 film was based on Brockovich 's legal crusade .
Cleanup of Hinkley 's contaminated water -- an underground plume that is two miles long and one mile wide -- began in the late 1980s and is continuing .
Denton ’s office will accept public comments on its proposal until Oct. 19 .
Then , another agency , the California Department of Public Health , will adopt a regulation setting a maximum allowable level for water supplies based on the health goal but also considering economic and technological complications .
The potential cost to water suppliers is unknown .
The new recommendation ranks among the lowest health goals among nearly 90 toxic water pollutants regulated in the state .
Chromium 6 is found in ground water in large urban areas as well as rural areas .
Used in metal plating , stainless steel production and other manufacturing , it has been detected in 30 % of drinking water sources in California , according to state officials .
The Environmental Working Group compiled data showing that 519 water systems in California serving 33.4 million people contain chromium 6 .
No other state tests water for the substance , Sharp said .
“ We do n’t even know how big of a problem it is nationally , ” she said .
Scientists have known for two decades that people can contract lung cancer when inhaling it .
But until recently , the science was uncertain about whether it causes cancer when swallowed .
Other goals have been set , then rescinded over the past decade .
In 1999 , after the Hinkley case , California set a goal of 2.5 ppb based on a 1968 study that found stomach tumors in animals that drank the substance .
However , the U.S. EPA rejected that study and concluded there was no evidence chromium 6 was carcinogenic in water .
California ’s scientific advisors agreed , so the state rescinded its goal in 2001 and reverted to the old 50 ppb standard , which was based on the risks of skin irritation , not cancer .
A study in China found high rates of stomach cancers in people whose water was contaminated with so much chromium from a smelter that it had turned yellow .
That study , however , was controversial because industry consultants intervened and republished the findings , making the science debatable .
The California environmental health office then asked federal scientists to resolve the quandary .
Last year , the National Toxicology Program concluded that the chromium compound caused intestinal cancers , which are relatively rare in animals , as well as mouth cancers , and that it infiltrated the cells of many organs .
EPA officials said earlier this year that they plan to release results of their evaluation of the national standard this fall .
The agency is required by federal law to review water standards every six years .

Grameen Foundation ’s AppLab has released a new suite of mobile phone applications developed in Uganda , using Google SMS Search and in partnership with MTN Uganda as the mobile operator .
The services include :
Farmerâ€™s Friend : a searchable database with both agricultural advice and targeted weather forecasts
: a searchable database with both agricultural advice and targeted weather forecasts Health Tips : provides sexual and reproductive health information
: provides sexual and reproductive health information Clinic Finder : helps locate nearby health clinics and their services
: helps locate nearby health clinics and their services Google Trader : matches buyers and sellers of agricultural produce and commodities as well as other products .
Local buyers and sellers , such as small - holder farmers , are able to broaden their trading networks and reduce their transaction costs .
( known locally as “ Akatale SMS ” )
Back in 2004 Grameen started to replicate in Uganda what they had done in Bangladesh with their Village Phone Operators .
That is , they would go 20 km beyond the best phone signal and provide a loan to a lady in the village that would let her buy a phone and an antenna that would extend the range of the network .
The lady would then resell services to local individuals who did n’t have access , or the ability to buy their own phone .
I ’m actually quite impressed with this initiative , as it fits in perfectly with Grameen ’s mission : providing opportunity through the most basic of mobile phones .
All of these services work on SMS - only phones , so anyone with a single bar of coverage and a phone has access to a lot of knowledge in their hands .
Here is a promo video from Uganda , explaining why these services are needed :
High - powered Partnerships
Beyond the applications themselves , what I find most compelling is how the Grameen Foundation collected such a high - powered group of partners .
The list reads like a who ’s - who of innovative mobile services and development in Africa with Google , MTN Uganda , Technoserve , Kiwanja.net , and BRODSI to name a few .
It ’s a mixture of for - profit businesses , local NGOs and non-profit tech organizations .
I remember a conversation a couple months back with Sian Townsend ( Google ) and Ken Banks ( FrontlineSMS ) about how they did the field studies for this project .
Sian shared with us some of her research on mobile user experience while in Uganda – it was extensive .
Through a month of rapid prototyping and studying how users were actually using the new services , the team quickly learned what was important and how to better serve information up to the end -user .
Though I have n’t been able to personally test the services yet , with this group , I would expect the results to be better than average .
For instance , Google does n’t tend to get involved with ideas that do n’t scale .
I imagine that they see replicability with both SMS Search and Google Trader in many other countries as well .
Rachel Payne , the country manager for Google in Uganda , has a blog post here , but not much more information on the long - term plans for Google Trader .
I ’d be interested in seeing how this compares to Esoko out of Ghana .
In politics , nothing happens by accident .
If it happens , you can bet it was planned that way .

North Korea consistently denied that it was pursuing a uranium enrichment program since the U.S. first made the allegation in 2002 .
Yet on Saturday , North Korea 's Foreign Ministry announced that it had already begun testing its uranium enrichment technology .
The allegation surfaced in October of 2002 , during a visit to Pyongyang by James Kelly , then Assistant U.S. Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs .
Kelly said there were suspicions that North Korea was trying to produce weapons - grade highly enriched uranium , citing evidence gathered by U.S. sources .
The U.S. then halted the supply of heavy oil to the Stalinist country .
North Korea retaliated by withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , nullifying the Geneva Agreement that had been in effect for more than eight years .
Since then , North Korea had insisted it had never had a uranium enrichment program .
This triggered a tedious process of accusations and counter - accusations between the two sides .
During the six - country talks , which began in 2003 , the U.S. government pressured North Korea by producing evidence that the communist country imported equipment to produce highly enriched uranium from Pakistan , but the North simply denied everything .
With the Sept. 19 , 2005 statement of principles in which North Korea pledged to scrap its nuclear facilities in Yongbyon , the uranium program slipped beneath the surface for a while , resurfacing last year when the North declared its nuclear inventory .
North Korea again denied it needed to declare the uranium program under the agreement , saying it could not declare something it did not have .
In the end , the U.S. and North Korea swept t he issue under the carpet , with the chief negotiators to the six - party talks for the two countries agreeing that it would be solved in a separate , secret agreement between the two sides .
The U.S. believed further verification attempts would shed light on suspicions over the program , but Washington ended up being played like a fiddle by North Korea .

American taxpayers have made a $ 1.418bn profit on the $ 10bn federal loan handed to Goldman Sachs when the financial system was at risk last October .
The investment bank yesterday finalised its exit from the government bailout , saying it would pay $ 1.1 bn to buy back warrants issued to the US Treasury as part of the loan agreement .
Goldman and eight other major banks were told to accept bailout money last October in order to restore confidence in the US banking system , and hundreds of smaller banks followed suit .
The government has received dividends on the loans and will also receive cash for the warrants if banks decide to repay the money early .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Goldman paid back its bailout money last month but it has taken several weeks to negotiate a price for the warrants , which give US taxpayers a stake in any future increase in the Goldman Sachs share price .
In contrast to Goldman , JPMorgan Chase has decided not to continue negotiating with the Treasury and plans instead to have its warrants auctioned on the open market .
Jamie Dimon , the JP Morgan chief executive , said the government was asking for too much .
The US Treasury said yesterday that the $ 1.1bn and $ 318 m in dividends paid by Goldman Sachs meant that taxpayers ' emergency investment in the company had earned them an annualised return of 23 per cent .
How about a bottle of the ’02 Chateau Plastique ?
The ubiquitous 750 - milliliter glass wine bottle is starting to get competition from a plastic upstart , both on retail shelves and at a few restaurants .
The bottles carry a “ use by ” date -- plastic does n’t provide quite the same seal as glass -- and as such are n’t likely to find their way into the cellars of serious wine enthusiasts .
For those who are n’t as picky , however , the wine is likely to cost less .
And oenophiles say that for wine that has n’t , err , expired , the taste will be the same .

“ The wine does n’t know what package it is in , ” said W.R .
Tish , a wine educator who writes a blog called Wine Skewer .
“ It tastes the same whether it is in a plastic bottle , a plastic bladder inside a box , or a glass . ”
At AKA a Bistro in St. Helena , in California ’s Napa Valley wine country , owner Robert Simon will begin pouring a Cabernet Sauvignon out of plastic bottles this month for wine - by - the - glass customers .
Peralta Winery will sell him 1 - liter plastic bottles for the same price as a 750 - milliliter glass bottle .
That means he can sell two extra glasses for about $ 7 to $ 8 each .
And he wo n’t have to worry about the help breaking bottles .
“ My decision will be based on the same factor as any wine -- taste , ” said Simon , who also owns Bistro 45 in Pasadena .
Simon plans to sell the wine there too .
“ Consumers only care about what ’s in the glass . ”

A small test in Northern California ’s Nugget supermarket chain last year “ did great , ” said Jason Taormino , president of New Leaf .
He would like to launch it in a broader selection of retailers and is looking for “ a large distributor who is willing to work with us on this . ”
Fred Franzia , owner of Bronco Wine Co. , is n’t ready to go plastic just yet .
He needs high - speed bottling for his $ 1.99 Charles Shaw wine -- also known as Two Buck Chuck -- and for now that means he needs heavier glass bottles .

“ Plastic would just blow off the line .
But it will come .
They will figure it out , ” Franzia said .
Ed Masciana , the Torrance businessman who owns Peralta Winery , plans to use plastic bottles for about a third of the 10,000 cases he sells annually , starting with Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay .
But restaurants are his main target ; he does n’t think consumers are ready to buy wine in plastic bottles at stores .
At a restaurant , however , most people probably wo n’t even be aware that the glass of wine they ordered came from a plastic container .

“ Unless I toss the bottle in your direction , you would never know it is is n’t glass , especially from across a darkened dining room , ” Masciana said .
The bottles have a special layer designed to keep oxygen from permeating the container and destroying the wine .
But it ’s not the iron - tight seal that glass provides , so bottles will come with “ use by ” dates .
Spencer Collins , a Glendale graphic designer , said he would consider buying wine in a plastic bottle as long as it was modestly priced and he planned to drink it quickly .
“ It depends on whether it was a $ 5 glass or $ 60 Cabernet , ” he said .

Plastic containers are also used for the 187 - milliliter single - serving wine bottles sold on commercial airlines and available at many supermarkets .
But cost pressures are expected to accelerate the trend .
Boisset Family Estates , a Sausalito , Calif. , wine company , started selling 1 - liter plastic bottles of Fog Mountain Merlot to JW Marriott hotels for sale by the glass last month .
“ The packaging was interesting , but what sold us on the wine was the quality and the taste , ” said Laurie Goldstein , spokeswoman for Marriott ’s food and beverage operations .
The wine was holding its own with the hotel chain ’s other offerings .
“ If it did n’t taste good no one would buy it , ” Goldstein said .
Company President Jean - Charles
Boisset notes that more than half the wine sold in America is consumed within months , if not weeks or even hours .
Most wine sells for under $ 12 a bottle , making the added expense of handling and shipping glass bottles less defensible , he said .

The plastic bottles also cost less , but not as much as winemakers would like .
Manufacturers are charging a little under $ 5 for a case of plastic wine bottles .
That compares with $ 5 to $ 7 for glass .
The industry expects the price for plastic to fall as the wine bottle production increases .
“ Plastic will become the future of a big portion of wine packaging , ” Boisset said .
“ The economics are amazing .
It maintains the quality of wine and it is environmentally friendly . ”
Still there ’s no guarantee that this will be a success .
Trader Joe ’s tried selling a private label wine from Boisset -- a French Pont du Rhone -- earlier this year for $ 5.99 for a 1 - liter bottle at its California stores but discontinued it after what it said was disappointing sales .
It was n’t clear if the problem was the plastic bottle or the wine .
Although the wine industry is steeped in tradition , plastic bottles are n’t the only change affecting consumers .
Screw - top bottles -- once associated with cheap , sweet wines -- are finding their way onto more higher - end vintages .

The industry is adapting screw tops for wine that ’s expected to be drunk within a short time frame , rather than stored in cellars for years .
What ’s more , the caps protect from TCA , or trichloroanisole , contamination .
TCA is a pesky chemical byproduct of mold and chlorine that can destroy bottled wine .
Screw caps are frequently used now on German Rieslings , New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs and many California red and blush wines .
Given that consumers have already adapted to screw tops and sales of boxed wine are growing , many in the industry believe plastic will catch on .
Fog Mountain recently went on the shelves at Henry ’s Farmers Market , the Irvine - based chain of natural and organic foods stores .
It plans to feature the wine in the coming weeks , advertising it for $ 9.99 in its fliers and giving it a prominent floor position in its Southern California stores .

“ Our consumers tend to care about the environment and want to be green , so we think it is going to be a hit , ” said Janet Little , the chain ’s spokeswoman .
But she acknowledged that it may take some “ education ” to get shoppers comfortable with drinking wine packaged in a plastic bottle .
“ We would really like to have a tasting in our stores , ” Little said , “ but we do n’t have a license for that . ”

Matt Wieters is showing signs of turning things around .
Mark Reynolds continues his tremendous home run pace .
It was a painful ninth inning for Chad Billingsley owners .
Let ’s look at these stories and all the rest from yesterday ’s games :
New York ( AL ) 10 , Toronto 8
Aaron
Hill went 2 - 5 with 1 HR , 3 RBI and 2 R . He continues to show that , even for those who were high on him heading into the season , he was sorely underestimated entering 2009 .
He ’s now hitting .299 with 20 HR and 59 RBI on the season and has entrenched himself among the best 2B in the game this season .
Amazingly , he has already exceeded the number of home runs I projected him for prior to the season ( 18 ) .
He ’s been impressive to say the least .
Granted , a lot of them were unearned runs , but Joba Chamberlain simply did not get the job done .
He allowed 8 runs ( 3 earned ) on 9 hits and 1 walk , striking out 1 , over 3.2 innings .
His ERA is up to 4.04 and he just has not been the dominant starting pitcher that people hoped he would be this season .
Usable , yes , but far from an ace at this point .
Derek Jeter ( 4 - 5 , 1 HR , 2 RBI , 3 R ) , Jorge Posada ( 4 - 5 , 3 RBI and 2 R ) and Hideki Matsui ( 2 - 4 , 1 HR , 4 RBI , 1 R ) were the big offensive contributors for the Yankees .
Posada now has gone 6 - 11 with 1 HR , 5 RBI and 3 R over the past two games .
It really goes without saying that he ’s a must use catcher in all formats .
Oakland 5 , Cleveland 2
Nice start for Gio Gonzalez , giving up 2 runs on 6 hits and 1 walk , striking out 8 , over 6 innings .
Does anyone trust him enough to use him , however ?
He entered the game with a 7.27 ERA and 2.25 WHIP over 4 starts .
He could prove usable , but it ’s going to take a whole lot more than this .
Jhonny Peratla went 1 - 4 with 1 HR , 1 RBI and 1 R . He was drafted for his power , but he has just five on the season , with this being his first in 10 games .
He is a player to look at as a solid buy low candidate for the second half , assuming he can get putting the ball in the air more ( he entered with a 28.2 % fly ball rate ) .
Boston 8 , Seattle 4
Brandon Morrow took his next step in his conversion back to a starting pitcher , allowing 3 runs on 6 hits and 2 walks , striking out 7 , over 6 innings ( 98 pitches ) .
His achilles heel was the home run , allowing 3 solo shots .
While it was not a great line , keep in mind that it was against the high - powered Red Sox .
He has the potential to be a useful option in all formats , so definitely keep your eye on him .
In deeper formats , he ’s worth stashing immediately , though he ’s better left on the bench for now with his next start coming against the Rangers .
David Ortiz went 2 - 4 with 1 HR , 2 RBI and 2 R . While he ’s still hitting just .225 , he now has 9 HR and 38 RBI .
Is he the prototypical Big Papi ?
Not yet , but he could emerge in the second half .
Jon Lester continues to pitch well , though he took a no decision , in part due to his defense .
He allowed 4 runs ( 1 earned ) on 8 hits and 3 walks , striking out 9 , over 6.2 innings .
He has allowed 3 earned runs or less in each of his last 7 starts , lowering his ERA from 6.07 to 4.16 .
See what you get with a little patience ?
Kansas City 6 , Chicago ( AL ) 3 Jermaine
Dye went 1 - 3 with 1 HR , 1 RBI and 1 R . He ’s now homered in back - to - back games and has a 3 - game hitting streak , going 3 - 10 .
He has played like a top OF option this season , hitting .291 with 20 HR and 51 RBI on the season .
While I would n’t expect him to duplicate the power over the second half , I easily could see him finishing with 35 HR and 100 RBI on the season .
Brian Bannister allowed 2 runs on 5 hits and 2 walks , striking out 2 , over 6 innings of work .
Great start .
His 3.87 ERA is also nice .
Those who read the site , however , know that I will continue to strongly recommend staying as far away from him as possible .
He ’s very inconsistent and you run the risk of taking one of those beatings if you try to spot start him .
Minnesota 6 , Detroit 2 Rick Porcello struggled for the second consecutive start , giving up 6 runs ( 4 earned ) on 7 hits and 2 walks , striking out 3 , over 4 innings .
He ’s now 8 - 6 with a 4.14 ERA .
As I always say , no matter how good a rookie pitcher looks , they generally are an inconsistent group , making it tough to depend on them .
There are going to be highs and lows , and right now Porcello is clearly struggling .
Do not write him off , however , as he is likely to right the ship again .
His next start comes against Cleveland , and it would definitely depend on your other options as to what to do with him .
Justin Morneau went 2 - 4 with 1 HR , 2 RBI and 1 R . He ’s now homered in back - to - back games , and five of his last seven .
Nick Blackburn went the distance , allowing 2 runs ( 1 earned ) on 7 hits and 1 walk , striking out 6 .
He ’s now 7 - 4 with a 2.94 ERA , having not allowed more than 3 earned runs in a start since 5/16 ( a span of 9 starts ) .
He ’s proven to be a solid option in all formats , though a well below average strikeout pitcher ( 51 over 116.1 innings ) .
If you have pitchers who can pick up that slack , then I would n’t hesitate to use him right now .
Los Angeles ( AL ) 9 , Baltimore 6 Matt Wieters went 3 - 3 with 1 HR , 1 RBI and 2 R . He now has a 5 - game hitting streak , going 8 - 17 with 1 HR , 3 RBI and 2 R. Slowly but surely , he ’s starting to come around and develop into the top - notch catcher we all had hoped for .
Is he there yet ?
Not even close , but he ’s progressing nicely .
Stay patient .
Vladimir Guerrero went 1 - 3 with 1 HR , 2 RBI and 2 R . He now has a 3 - game hitting streak and has homered in back - to - back games .
He has 7 RBI in the past three games and is coming around into the top player he always has been .
Do not sell low on him if approached , you ’re going to regret it .
It was another lousy start for Joe Saunders , giving up 6 runs ( 5 earned ) on 7 hits and 3 walks , striking out 2 , over 5.1 innings .
He ’s been terrible in 5 of his last 7 starts , giving up four earned runs or more .
Consider that he had an ERA of 3.17 on 5/21 , it has been quite a fall , now at 4.44 .
Do n’t give up on him , but depending on your other options he is far from a must use option .
Texas 5 , Tampa Bay 2
Matt Garza simply did n’t have it , giving up 5 runs on 7 hits and 2 walks , striking out 7 , over 5 innings .
It happens .
That is the most runs he ’s allowed in a game since 4/19 ( his third start of the season ) , so it is nothing to worry about .
His next start comes against the A’s , so it ’s a good situation to get things back on track .
Ian Kinsler went 0 - 4 with 2 R , leaving him at 0 - 17 with 4 R over his last four games .
At least he ’s scoring , right ?
He ’ll turn things back around , I would n’t worry about him .
Chris Davis went 1 - 4 , then came word that he ’s being sent down to Triple - A .
Is anyone really surprised at this point ?
Scott Feldman pitched well again , giving up 2 runs ( 1 earned ) on 3 hits and 4 walks , striking out 2 , over 6 innings of work .
He ’s now 7 - 2 with a 3.91 ERA .
A 1.18 WHIP is tremendous , making him a good play , though he does not strikeout many ( 45 K in 89.2 innings ) .
Just keep that in mind .
Florida 5 , Pittsburgh 0
Ricky Nolasco was unbelievable , tossing eight shutout innings giving up 3 hits and 2 walks , striking out 12 .
Was this the same guy who was just awful early on this season ?
He ’s now won four consecutive starts .
Over the six starts since returning from the minor leagues he ’s posted a 1.54 ERA and 45 K over 41 innings of work .
Needless to say , he ’s returned to being a must start option in all formats .
A win is going to be tough to come by in his next start , as he takes on Dan Haren and the Arizona Diamondbacks , in what should be a tremendous match - up .
Andrew McCutchen went 2 - 4 with 1 SB , though he was the only Pirate that was impressive on this day .
He ’s on a 5 - game hitting streak , going 8 - 21 with 2 RBI , 4 R and 2 SB .
As a rookie , he just continue to produce and certainly is a must use in most formats .
St. Louis 10 , Cincinnati 1
The middle - aged stewardess Jackie Brown smuggles money from Mexico to Los Angeles for the arms dealer Ordell Robbie .
When she gets caught by the agents Ray Nicolet and Mark Dargus with ten thousand dollars and cocaine in her purse , they propose a deal to her to help them to arrest Ordell in exchange of her freedom .
Meanwhile Ordell asks the 56 - year - old Max Cherry , who runs a bail bond business , to release Jackie Brown with the intention of eliminating her .
Jackie suspects of Ordell 's intention and plots a complicated confidence game with Max to steal half a million dollars from Ordell .

Response to the " Market Failure " Drones
“ The time to worry about depressions , ” F.A .
Hayek once wrote , “ is , unfortunately , when they are furthest from the minds of most people . ”
He ’s right , of course : imagine trying to tell a house flipper in 2004 that the housing market was a giant bubble that was going to burst .
At best he ’d smile politely , and then roll around in his fresh pile of Federal Reserve Notes .
It ’s during an artificial , unsustainable boom like the one we ’ve just lived through that , unbeknownst to most people , the real damage is done to the economy .
But that ’s when they ’re least likely to listen or care .
Now that we ’re living through the bust , on the other hand , many people are listening .
That ’s why it ’s so important for economists of the Austrian School to redouble their efforts , whether in terms of writing , public speaking , media , or indeed whatever platform they can get , to promote a sound , free - market interpretation of what ’s happening .
The drones who exist to repeat clichés about market failure need a robust and energetic reply from people who know what they ’re talking about .
Robert P. Murphy has done exactly this .
His article archive at Mises.org has grown substantially during the crisis , and his blog is always a valuable read .
In addition to all this , he managed to find time to write the recently released book The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Great Depression and the New Deal .
Murphy and I corresponded regularly late last year as we worked on our respective books .
He got a kick out of the realization that he , the economist , was writing a work of history , and I , the historian , was writing a book ( Meltdown ) that gave the Austrian perspective on the current economic crisis .
But he is a perfect fit for a study like this .
Although many economists know little history , historians ’ knowledge of economics is confined , with few exceptions , to a catalogue of primitive fallacies .
This episode in American history has needed the careful , book - length attention of a good economist — that phrase , sadly , is practically an oxymoron in the Age of Krugman , is it not ? — for a long time now .
And it is n’t just the court historians or the left - wing economists who need straightening out , either .
Even otherwise free - market scholars of the Great Depression and the New Deal have a fatal soft spot for the Fed — whose failing , they tell us , was its failure to pump enough money into the system .
Murphy will have none of this .
Thus , for example , the Chicago School has been critical of the Fed , but for the wrong reasons : the Fed supposedly failed to create enough money when the money supply began falling .
This is not exactly a free - market criticism , but ( surprise ! ) it ’s the only one the mainstream has bothered to acknowledge .
As a matter of fact , in the nearly two years following the 1929 stock - market crash the Fed engaged in what were at that time the most aggressive rate cuts in its history .
( This is in contrast to the Fed ’s rate increases during the 1920 – 1921 downturn , which was over quickly but which by Chicago ’s reasoning ought to have been more severe and persistent . )
Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz , Murphy concludes , gave birth to ,
“ a myth , namely that the Federal Reserve sat idly back and allowed the economy to implode .
That myth — like the myth that Herbert Hoover sat idly back and watched the Depression unfold — is continuing to drive misguided policies today . ”
Murphy also includes in this chapter a very useful section on deflation , a subject nearly impossible to find treated without breathless hysteria .
To blame the Depression on a decrease in the supply of money is to get the relationship exactly backward .
Moreover , the money supply fell by the same percentage between 1839 and 1843 that it did between 1929 and 1933 , but robust increases in real consumption and real GNP followed .
Under the heat of Murphy ’s magnifying glass throughout this much - needed chapter , the arguments of the deflationphobes melt away .
Naturally , Murphy devotes considerable attention to the interventionist program of Herbert Hoover , the president whom most Americans , if they have heard of him at all , associate with laissez - faire .
According to Paul Krugman , for example , “ the federal government tried to balance its budget in the face of a severe recession . ”
Murphy , in response , says “ it would be difficult to render a more misleading account of Hoover ’s policies without actually lying . ”
In Fiscal Year ( FY ) 1933 , which ran from mid-1932 to mid-1933 , the federal government ran a $ 2.6 billion deficit — at a time when it took in only $ 2 billion in tax receipts .
So the deficit that Krugman represents as wild slash - and - burn budget cutting was in fact greater than the federal government ’s entire tax haul that year .
That would be equivalent , Murphy observes , to a $ 3.3 trillion deficit in FY 2007 , as opposed to the actual figure of $ 162 billion .
Now it is true that the FY 1933 budget included some minor budget cuts , but these relatively trivial cuts came only after Hoover ’s dramatic spending increases of the previous several years had failed to show any results other than a deepening of the Depression .
Murphy ’s book has all the figures .
By the time Hoover pulled back from what would later become standard Keynesian fiscal policy — a pullback that came in the form of minor spending cuts and major tax - rate increases — unemployment had already gone higher than 20 percent .
In a 1926 speech while secretary of commerce , Hoover had observed that Americans enjoyed both higher real wages and a higher standard of living than did people elsewhere .
Like all too many others , though , Hoover drew the fallacious conclusion that the prosperity was the result of the high wages rather than the other way around .
( This was the fallacy , exploded by Henry Hazlitt , that high wages promoted prosperity by providing workers with “ enough to buy back the product . ” )
The high purchasing power of American wages reflected American workers ’ productivity : because they were able to produce so much physical stuff , thanks to the amount of capital per worker in the United States , the resulting abundance made their paychecks stretch farther .
“ Unless workers have first physically produced the goods ( and services ) , ” Murphy writes ,
“ there will be nothing on the store shelves for them to buy when they attempt to spend their fat paychecks … .
If more stuff is produced within America than within Mexico , obviously Americans are going to have a higher standard of living , regardless of ‘ wages policy . ' ”
It was this fallacy that later informed Hoover ’s disastrous high - wage policy , a policy FDR later codified with the National Industrial Recovery Act and that served to deprive countless Americans of employment .
On the New Deal itself , Murphy is just devastating .
It ’s been amusing to watch the likes of Brad DeLong tell us how super the government ’s economic recovery efforts were .
Let ’s see : cartelizing American industry , restricting production , imposing extremely high minimum wages via the National Recovery Administration , destroying crops to prop up prices , paying farmers to reduce their acreage , blowing billions on arbitrary projects in the name of “ creating jobs , ” raising taxes — and that ’s only a bit of it .
That combination was supposed to make Americans rich — and do n’t you try to say otherwise , you incorrigible extremist .
Bob discusses all of this and much more ( including Social Security and labor legislation ) , and raises evidence and arguments that , if the standard treatment of these subjects in every single American - history textbook is any indication , your delicate ears are not supposed to hear .
In addition to his merciless evisceration of the propaganda surrounding specific New Deal programs , Murphy assembles some suggestive evidence , in addition to the clear testimony of economic theory , regarding the destructive , growth - inhibiting nature of the New Deal in general .
In particular , he lays to rest ( to put it gently ) the recent claim that FDR did make headway against the Depression , as indicated in the unemployment statistics , and that this progress resulted from his willingness to suck resources from the private sector and squander them on arbitrary things .
Readers will also enjoy Murphy ’s treatment of the banking industry during the Depression , since we ’re usually told that FDR ’s alleged cure for that distressed sector was just super .
It was no cure at all ; it addressed none of the underlying problems , which continued to fester for decades thereafter .
The state governments , for their part , had contributed to banks ’ vulnerability by yielding to small institutions ’ demands for “ unit - banking ” laws prohibiting branch banking .
These laws made it more difficult for banks to manage risk by diversifying their portfolios .
Most of the thousands of banks that failed during the Depression were in states with unit - banking laws .
The number of bank failures during the same years in Canada , on the other hand , which had no unit - banking laws , was zero .
Although many readers will be able to name at least several important titles on the Depression and the New Deal , I cannot insist strongly enough that there is no book quite like this one .
I am not aware of any other book on this subject that both carries the story from the 1920s through World War II and is economically sound throughout .
Murray Rothbard ’s America ’s Great Depression , still indispensable , covers only through 1932 ; and books critical of the New Deal typically adopt , probably thoughtlessly , the Chicago position on the Fed .
In the midst of an economic crisis that ought to be causing people to rethink much of what they thought they knew about the economy ( e.g. , the Fed is a great stabilizing agent ! ) , Bob Murphy has written an accessible and persuasive Austrian account of an essential period of American history that most people know only in propaganda form .
He deserves to be richly rewarded .
Read this book and promote it wherever you can .

Carlo Ancelotti tends to squirm at comparisons with Jose Mourinho , a manager with whom he endured a tempestuous relationship in Serie A , though he does at least now have something in common with the Portuguese .
Some five years after the self - styled Special One began his reign as Chelsea manager with a victory over Celtic in this arena , the Italian followed suit here with a win over the local Major League Soccer franchise .
The Londoners will hope this is a portent of glorious things to come .
The Seattle Sounders were brushed aside here , their initial frantic enthusiasm punctured by two wonderfully crafted goals from the visitors before the interval in front of 65,289 supporters .
Daniel Sturridge , whose transfer fee from Manchester City has still to be determined by a tribunal , excelled in each , rolling off the hapless Jhon Kennedy Hurtado early on before curling a delicious shot beyond Kasey Keller and into the far corner to set the tone .
The 19 - year - old 's pass inside Hurtado for Nicolas Anelka to collect and pull back for Frank Lampard to tuck away was just as impressive .
The Sounders , undermined by a ponderous defence , were generous opponents yet , even in this early season stroll in the sunshine , Sturridge offered plenty of positives for Ancelotti to consider .
The teenager might have scored another himself , steering a low shot across Keller but beyond the far post , before departing as one of nine substitutes at half - time .
Thereafter , it was left for Andriy Shevchenko's highlights – his hair , rather than his performance – to catch the eye against a side second in the west standings of Major League Soccer , a point clear of David Beckham 's Los Angeles Galaxy .
The hosts ' best moments were generally inspired by Freddie Ljungberg , the former Arsenal and West Ham midfielder seeing his best efforts scrambled away by Alex and Petr Cech , with John Terry comfortable and composed at the heart of the visitors defence .
The England captain had mustered an astute intervention on Fredy Montero in the first minute to suggest his focus was very much on Chelsea despite Manchester City 's recent pursuit of his signature .
The centre - half was on the sidelines wincing as Hilario almost gifted Sébastien le Toux a second - half consolation , but this was a gentle and impressive start to the Londoners ' pre-season preparations .
Franco di Santo struck a post and was denied by Terry Boss from close range , with the Premier League team continuing to create the clearest chances .
Lampard was their only player to feature for the full 90 minutes .
Mourinho , whose Internazionale will confront his former club in Pasadena on Tuesday , had led Chelsea to a 4 - 2 win against Celtic here in 2004 .
Ancelotti will hope similar successes to those enjoyed by the Portuguese lie ahead .
Participants were recruited to undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging , a non-invasive form of brain mapping used to determine how the brain recognizes different characteristics in musical instruments Credit : Marc Schönwiesner , Université de Montréal
Sounds and images share a similar neural code in the human brain , according to a new Canadian study .
In the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , scientists from the Université de Montréal and the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University explain how the same neural code in the brain allows people to distinguish between different types of sounds , such as speech and music , or different images .
Participants were recruited to undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging ( FMRI ) , a non-invasive form of brain mapping used to determine how the brain recognizes different characteristics in musical instruments , words from conversations or environmental sounds .
Subjects underwent an exhaustive three hours of FMRI exams to provide precise information about how the brain reacts when different sounds are played .
" It turns out that the brain uses the same strategy to encode sounds than it uses to encode different images , " explains lead author Marc Schönwiesner , a Université de Montréal psychology professor .
" This may make it easier for people to combine sounds and images that belong to the same object , such as the dribbling of a basketball . "
The next step for the researchers is to determine exactly how the brain distinguishes between rock drum beats to the strings of a symphony or from a French conversation to an English one .
" Our goal is to disentangle exactly how the brain extracts these different types of sounds .
This is a step may eventually let us reconstruct a song that a person has heard from according to the activity pattern in their brain , " explains Dr. Schönwiesner , who is also a member of the International Laboratory for Brain , Music and Sound Research ( BRAMS ) , a joint Université de Montréal and McGill University think - tank on music and the mind .
As scientists advance in decoding brain activation patterns , says Dr. Schönwiesner , mind - boggling applications can be envisaged .
" If researchers can reconstruct a song a person has heard according to an fMRI reading , we 're not far off to being able to record brain patterns during sleep and reconstruct dreams , " he predicts .
" That would be really cool , although this possibility is decades of research away . "

Deal talks between Kirin Holdings Co. and Suntory Holdings Ltd. promise to test Japan 's antitrust laws .
Kirin confirmed Tuesday that it is in merger talks with Suntory , but said nothing has yet been decided and discussions are at an early stage .
A combination of the two would create a company with $ 40.9 billion in revenue that would be better ...
President Obama and the rest of the Group of 8 leaders decreed last month that the planet ’s average temperature shall not rise more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit above today ’s level .
But what if Mother Earth did n’t get the memo ?
How do we stay cool in the future ?
Two options :
Plan A. Keep talking about the weather .
This has been the preferred approach for the past two decades in Western Europe , where leaders like to promise one another that they will keep the globe cool by drastically reducing carbon emissions .
Then , when their countries ’ emissions keep rising anyway , they convene to make new promises and swear that they really , really mean it this time .
Plan B .
Do something about the weather .
Originally called geoengineering , this approach used to be dismissed as science fiction fantasies : cooling the planet with sun-blocking particles or shades ; tinkering with clouds to make them more reflective ; removing vast quantities of carbon from the atmosphere .
Today this approach goes by the slightly less grandiose name of climate engineering , and it is looking more practical .
Several recent reviews of these ideas conclude that cooling the planet would be technically feasible and economically affordable .
There are still plenty of skeptics , but even they have started calling for more research into climate engineering .
The skeptics understandably fear the unintended consequences of tampering with the planet ’s thermostat , but they also fear the possibility  which I ’d call a near certainty  that political leaders will not seriously reduce carbon emissions anytime soon .
Google is not the first company to offer an operating system to rival Microsoft and Apple .
In fact , there 's a long history of defunct or ignored operating systems for Google to pick through .
We 've collected just a few here .
Many of these operating systems were plenty innovative in their time .
Where they each ran into trouble was either struggling to sell to anybody other than a few early adopters , or failing to evolve as their businesses changed .
The scary thing for Google is that it has had that same problem with almost all of its products beyond search .

All humans are gone , and it is only by chance that 9 discovers a small community of others like him taking refuge from fearsome machines that roam the earth intent on their extinction .

As anyone following this guide to cl- perec has undoubtedly noticed , while I 've spent considerable time exploring how to put data in the database , I 've not spent any on getting all that precious data back out .
Today , I shall remedy that .
Let us suppose your PHB wanders by and asks you what the title is of the report located in the file " / share/tps-reports / Testing " .
Not to worry , you can select a single instance using cl- perec:select - instance . ¹
select - instance has a fairly simple calling syntax .
( select - instance ( / var-name / / class - of - instance / ) ( where [ condition - form ] ) )
For example , we can select our tps report by file name with :
( cl - perec : with - transaction ( cl - perec: select - instance ( report tps-report ) ( cl - perec : where ( equal ( report - path - of report ) # p " / share/tps-reports / Testing " ) ) ) )
Note that accessor methods on the instance variable are used to pick the SQL column , and an instance of the object to which we want to compare that column is used for our value .
This is because the value - to - be - compared goes through all the lisp→sql conversion machinery . ²
Of particular interest is the where clause , which is proper CL³ .
The upshot to this is that it 's very easy to select based upon an arbitrary predicate .
The downside is that , if cl - perec can't figure out how to translate your where clause , it will filter the parts it does n't understand in Lisp .
Failure to remember that may result in accidentally hosing your performance .
#'cl - perec : start - sql - recording is very useful here for checking if things are being converted to SQL in the way you expect .
Simple , standard functions , such as 'equal , get translated to the obvious SQL , as do boolean expressions involving AND , NOT , and OR .
Notably excepted , however , string= and string - equal are not translated into SQL .
As you might expect , user - defined equality predicates are not converted to SQL .
As usual , however , cl- perec offers unexported functionality to extend itself .
Say , for instance , you want to be able to query report - path using wild pathnames , to fetch all the tps-reports in a certain directory , like so :
( cl - perec : with - transaction ( cl - perec: select - instances ( r tps-report ) ( cl - perec : where ( pathname - match - p ( report - path - of r ) # p " / share/tps-reports / * " ) ) ) )
A legitimate use case if I ever saw one !
To make this work in SQL , we need to convert it to use the LIKE operator , or possibly a regular expression .
Rummaging around in query / mapping .lisp , we find the definer for like which points us in a direction .
Awesome !
A little trial and error gets us to a very rough start .
( cl - def : def ( cl - perec : : query - function : lisp - args t ) pathname - match - p ( path wild ) " Convert a comparison to a : wild pathname into SQL .
Does not support all possible : wild pathnames . " ( declare ( cl - perec : : persistent - type ( cl - perec : : forall ( a ) ( function ( a a ) boolean ) ) ) ) ( let* ( ( wild ( cl - perec : : value - of wild ) ) ( root ( make - pathname : name nil : type nil : defaults wild ) ) ( name ( if ( wild - pathname - p wild : name ) " % " ( pathname - name wild ) ) ) ( type ( if ( wild - pathname - p wild : type ) " % " ( pathname - type wild ) ) ) ) ( cl - perec : : sql - like : string ( cl - perec : : syntax - to - sql path ) : pattern ( format nil " ~a~a~@ [ .~a~ ] " root name type ) : case- sensitive -p t ) ) )
path and wild are passed in as cl- perec ' syntax nodes ' .
syntax - to - sql converts a syntax node to SQL , and value - of , assuming a literal value was used , gets that literal value .
Then it 's just a matter of converting : wilds into SQL LIKE 's wildcard , the percent sign ( % ) .
Regrettably , this is pretty fragile .
It only works if the wild pathname is passed in as a literal value ; neither let - bound variables , special variables , nor #'make - pathname will work .
( Not to mention the flaws in the matching itself ! )
Let 's see what we can do about that .
( cl - def : def ( cl - perec : : query - function : lisp - args t ) pathname - match - p ( path wild ) " Convert a comparison to a : wild pathname into SQL .
Does not support all possible : wild pathnames . " ( declare ( cl - perec : : persistent - type ( cl - perec : : forall ( a ) ( function ( a a ) boolean ) ) ) ) ( cl - perec : : sql - like : string ( cl - perec : : syntax - to - sql path ) : pattern ( cl - perec : : syntax - to - sql ( cl - perec : : make - special - form : operator ' let * : operands `( ( ( wild , wild ) ( root ( make - pathname : name nil : type nil : defaults wild ) ) ( name ( if ( wild - pathname - p wild : name ) " % " ( pathname - name wild ) ) ) ( type ( if ( wild - pathname - p wild : type ) " % " ( pathname - type wild ) ) ) ) ( format nil " ~a~a~@ [ .~a~ ] " root name type ) ) ) ) : case- sensitive -p t ) )
This is a bit messy — because the arguments we 're given have already been converted into an abstract syntax tree , what would otherwise be fairly straightforward code must be converted into an AST as well ⁴— but it works .
make - special - form creates an object that eventually gets evaluated , and it somehow all magically works out .
The in - sql matching still is n't perfect , but it 's pretty useable .
Give it a try !
( cl - perec : with - transaction ( cl - perec: select - instances ( r tps-report ) ( cl - perec : where ( pathname - match - p ( report - path - of r ) # p " / share/tps-reports / * " ) ) ) )
( cl - perec : with - transaction ( cl - perec: select - instances ( r tps-report ) ( cl - perec : where ( pathname - match - p ( report - path - of r ) ( make - pathname : directory '( : absolute " share " " tps-reports " ) : name : wild ) ) ) ) )
( let ( ( w ( make - pathname : directory '( : absolute " share " " tps-reports " ) : name : wild ) ) ) ( cl - perec : with - transaction ( cl - perec: select - instances ( r tps-report ) ( cl - perec : where ( pathname - match - p ( report - path - of r ) w ) ) ) ) )
( defvar * wild * ( make - pathname : directory '( : absolute " share " " tps-reports " ) : name : wild ) ) ( cl - perec: select - instances ( r tps-report ) ( cl - perec : where ( pathname - match - p ( report - path - of r ) * wild * ) ) )
All should produce SQL that looks something like this :
BEGIN $ 1 = / share / tps-reports / % as TEXT SELECT r._oid , r.report_title , r.report_text , r.report_path FROM tps_report_ap r WHERE (( r.report_path LIKE $ 1:: TEXT ) ) COMMIT
Pathname matching that handles directories with : wild and : wild - inferiors properly is left as an exercise to the reader , but I 'll leave you with a few hints : look into the re-like query - function , which provides you with access to the database server 's regular expression engine ; and ignore the fact you can't portably rely on the format of namestrings .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Let me let you in on a little secret : the Swiss banking ruse is over -- and it 's about time .
Historically , Switzerland 's neutrality has been an esteemed philosophical island in a world full of bitter cultural animosity and politics .
But its banking rules , which were liberalized to help Jews hide assets from the Nazis , emphasize secrecy over law and have become less - than admired and more controversial around the world .
That 's about to change with the culmination of an aggressive U.S. Internal Revenue Service effort , led by attorney John McDougal to gain the identities on 52,000 Swiss bank accounts held by UBS AG .
UBS , +1.31 % See full story .
IRS attorney John McDougal , who is leading efforts to identify Swiss bank account holders .
Service to America Medals
Switzerland 's seven - member cabinet met Monday to discuss the IRS 's demand , and several analysts believe the meeting is the first step in what ultimately will be capitulation by the Swiss to allow access to banking records in tax - evasion cases .
The fight between the IRS and the Swiss government is complicated , but it ultimately comes down to two sovereign laws at odds in the international realm .
The Swiss have offered legal banking secrecy to anyone and for the last 75 years , unveiling account holders ' identities has been a criminal offense .
The IRS , in its pursuit of tax dodgers who have used overseas accounts to hide funds , is seeking the names as part of a sweeping probe .
Swiss movement
The U.S. effort has put a lot of its goodwill with Switzerland , not to mention a treaty protecting secret bank accounts , at risk with the move .
The Swiss sometimes reveal account holders ' identities when there 's strong evidence accounts are being used to hide proceeds from activities including drug trafficking , organized crime and more recently , terrorism .
Some argue that the U.S. is violating its own search - and - seizure protections by aiming to reveal account holders ' identities without specific evidence .
Probable cause is a nifty argument , except that in this case it 's a fallacy .
Probable cause does not mean that someone has to be guilty ; it means there 's a likelihood that evidence of a crime exists in the place to be searched .
Take a look at the nature of Swiss bank accounts and , though it may not fit a tidy legal definition , it 's fairly obvious that the only reason an American would want to deposit their funds there and maintain secrecy is to hide something .
The Swiss tax all interest earned on the accounts at a rate of about 35 % .
That penalty can be waived if you can prove you 're not a Swiss citizen and to do that you must agree to reveal your identity .
Americans with Swiss accounts do so for many reasons that are n't necessarily nefarious .
UBS and Credit Suisse CS , +1.37 % have substantial holdings in the U.S. banking market .
Having a Swiss account gives international travelers options that their small local banks may not offer .
The Swiss franc is a relatively stable currency .
But there are other reasons -- if not illegal then questionable -- for having a Swiss account .
Hiding assets in a divorce is one ; tax evasion is another .
And even though the Swiss will lift secrecy when there 's evidence of illegal activity , it does n't happen very often .
Not that there has been a shortage of corrupt officials opening up accounts in Switzerland .
Former Phillipine president Ferdinand Marcos , ex-Nigerian president Sani Abacha and Vladimir Montesinos , the one - time head of Peru 's intelligence agency , all had numbered accounts with Swiss banks .
A slippery slope
The so - called benefits of banking secrecy have made Swiss banks the top holders of offshore accounts globally -- with 35 % of all assets -- and created supersized wealth for the nation .
The tiny country ranks among the top 40 in gross domestic product , per capita income is 17th in the world and a 3 % unemployment rate as of December , according to the U.S. State Department .
With so much of Switzerland 's wealth at stake , it 's no surprise the banks and Swiss government want to retain their competitive edge .
But that 's true with anyone who serves people or entities shunned by the rest of the world .
Switzerland is , in a financial sense , an arms dealer with a secret client list , legal but unsavory .
The Swiss may have a perfectly legal right to offer such services .
The U.S. also has a right to chase down tax dodgers and criminals .
If that means barring U.S. citizens from opening secret accounts or renegotiating a treaty to force more openness , then our government can play hardball , too .
So far , U.S. pressure has already paid off .
In January , UBS closed 19,000 accounts believed to have been used for evading taxes .
And the IRS said it has received a record response to a clemency program for tax evaders using offshore accounts .
The squeeze is the reason true banking secrecy is on its way out , whether it's the Swiss providing more information about its banking clients or our government taking those clients away .

The first temperature map ( centered at the south pole ) of the planet 's southern hemisphere at infrared wavelengths , charted with Venus Express 's Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer , VIRTIS .
Higher temperatures ( red ) correspond to lower altitudes , while lower temperatures ( blue ) correspond to higher altitudes .
Venus mayonce have been more Earth - like , with volcanic activity and an ocean of water , anew map of the toasty planet 's southern hemisphere suggests .
The mapcomprises over a thousand individual images , recorded between May 2006 and December 2007 by the European Space Agency 's VenusExpress spacecraft .
It gives astronomers another tool in their quest to understandwhy Venus is so similar in size to Earth and yet has evolvedso differently .
Because Venusis coveredin clouds , normal cameras cannot see the surface , but Venus Express used aparticular infrared wavelength to see through them .
Althoughradar systems have been used in the past to provide high - resolution maps of Venus ?s surface , Venus Express is the first orbiting spacecraft to produce amap that hints at the chemical composition of the rocks .
Rockyclues
The new datais consistent with suspicions that the highland plateaus of Venus are ancientcontinents , once surrounded by ocean that might have evaporated away into spaceand produced by past volcanic activity .
" Thisis not proof , but it is consistent .
All we can really say at the moment is thatthe plateau rocks look different from elsewhere , " said Nils M?ller of thethe University M?nster and DLR Berlin , who headed the mapping efforts .
Water is akey to life as we know it .
And though there are no signs of past or presentbiology on the suffocating surface Venus , someastronomers have speculated that the its cloudscould harbor life .
The rockslook different because of the amount of infrared light they radiate into space .
Different surfaces radiate different amounts of heat at infrared wavelengthsdue to a material characteristic known as emissivity , which varies in differentmaterials .
The eightRussian landers of the 1970s and 1980s touched down away from the highlands andfound only basalt - like rock beneath their landing pads .
The new mapshows that the rocks on the Phoebe and Alpha Regio plateaus are lighter in colorand look old compared to the majority of the planet .
On Earth , suchlight - colored rocks are usually granite and form continents .
Granite isformed when ancient rocks , made of basalt , are driven down into the planet byshifting continents , a process known as plate tectonics .
The water combineswith the basalt to form granite and the mixture is reborn through volcaniceruptions .
" Ifthere is granite on Venus , there must have been an ocean and plate tectonics inthe past , " M?ller said .
Let 's gosee
M?llerpoints out that the only way to know for sure whether the highland plateaus arecontinents is to send a lander there .
Over time , Venus ? swaterhas been lost to space , but there might still be volcanic activity .
Theinfrared observations are very sensitive to temperature .
But in all images theysaw only variations of between 3 - 20 ? C , instead of the kind of temperaturedifference they would expect from active lava flows .
Still , M?llerdoes not rule out the existence of volcanic activity on present - day Venus .
" Venusis a big planet , being heated by radioactive elements in its interior .
Itshould have as much volcanic activity as Earth , " he said .
Some areas doappear to be composed of darker rock , which hints at relatively recent volcanicflows .
Scientistsalso debate whether past or present volcanic activity is the sourceof the sulfur dioxide clogging Venus ' atmosphere .
10 Baby Steps to Help You “ Get Primal ”
For this month ?s 30 - day challenge , we realize that everyone is starting from a different place .
As much as we learn from our hardcore Grokkers , we welcome Primal newcomers with open arms and eager ears .
We want to know their stories , their challenges , and the strategies that finally make it work for them .
Some of us are the type to jump in the deep end of the pool and figure it out when we get to the bottom .
Others of us dip our toes , scan the ladder placements , and study the grade of floor depth .
Different strokes , we say .
Even as we accept that our own Primal journey will be different from the next person ?s , it can be a little awkward or discouraging to be the one feeling out the shallow end while others are doing flips and belly flops in the deep side of the pool .
We thought a post on baby - stepping , breaking down the transition into small and very manageable steps , might come in handy for many of our readers ?
newcomers , renewers , or even old - timers who are coaching friends and family in a Primal direction .
Kick back and get brainstorming for your next baby step !
Re-make a meal
Not that a single meal doesn?t count for something , but we actually mean a meal category ( or maybe snack ) each day .
Maybe you want to tackle your least Primal serving of the day first ( if you ?re still stuck in a carb rut at breakfast , say ) .
On the other hand , perhaps you ?re more inclined to take on the simplest meal and work your way up .
( Morning snack first ?
Meat and salad for dinner ? )
Setting a consistent pattern for a meal each day not only gets you on a solid track ; it offers the mental boost of daily accomplishment .
Furthermore , it can serve as a template for tackling further food overhauls .
Remaking one meal a day gets you in the mode of delving into Primal variety , trying new recipes and eating for health rather than habit .
Drop or swap a vice
Perhaps there ?s a particular offender , a persevering and pesky element of your diet that will take special time and energy to ditch .
We ?re not talking here about an occasional indulgence item but a regular player in the lineup .
Whether it ? s your favorite creamy stout , morning danish or afternoon microwave popcorn fix , you might find it easier to isolate and conquer before expanding the battle .
Some readers have shared stories of choosing ?
better ?
but not totally Primal alternatives for their old favorites first and then going back to phase out these ?
lesser evils ?
once they had the rest of diet more fully Primalized .
Give up a grain at a time
Those vexing little granules that litter the dinner plates of unsuspecting diners everywhere ?
We ?re only half kidding of course .
( You know our shtick on this subject . )
Sure , not all grains are created equal .
Some , like brown rice , don?t seem to do quite the same number on the intestines as others .
Yet , at the end of the day they ?re still the same insulin and inflammation inciters .
As we ?ve said time and again , they add little to a healthy diet and generally fill the space of more nutritious fare .
Tick them off the list based on preference or prevalence in your diet .
Or work your way through the grain chain with more of a mind to gluten , bidding adieu to wheat and its various derivatives first , then continuing onward through the inventory .
Sample a new vegetable ( or other Primal ingredient ) each week
Out with the old , in with the new as they say .
Your Primal conversion should n?t be a story of the incredibly shrinking menu .
Take a hint from those middle school food science / home ec journals and explore a veggie a week .
Remember the color illustrations , origin histories and recipe lists ?
Of course , adding more than one new item a week is ideal ( especially with the best of summer ?s bounty ) .
And there ?s nothing wrong with mixing it up either with other new - to - you Primal fare like almond butter or less appreciated cuts of meat .
Don?t worry if you have to do some less than ideal adaptations at first like hiding the new item in the midst of other ingredients or incorporating favorite dips or sauces .
The idea here is to add , not limit .
Your taste buds will adapt with time , and you ?ll find yourself with less need for the camouflage or accompaniment strategies .
Ditch the deadbeat drinks
Now more than ever Americans get an enormous amount of their calories and sugar from drinks , an easily overlooked food category .
( Too many people delude themselves into thinking liquids somehow don ?t count ! )
With the likes of mega sodas , energy drinks , syrup loaded coffee beverages and alcohol , it ? s not hard at all to drink your dinner : carbs and calories through the roof , nutrients generally nonexistent .
Nixing deadbeat drinks and replacing them with water , tea ( and a single cup of regular joe for a morning pick - me - up ) can mean a major difference in your carb count for the day , not to mention your insulin response and ?real ?
( as opposed to jacked - up ) energy level .
Change one workout a week
Whether you ?re stuck in the chronic cardio circuit , the heavy lifting mode or a plateau of the same low level activity , consider mixing things up .
Exercise outside your comfort zone by venturing into a different part of the gym ( yoga studio , free weights ? ) , hitting a different venue ( the trails , the pool ? ) or just slowing it down ( you cardio addicts out there ) .
Get up the gumption to try one of Mark ?s sprints , join a casual sports league or let your hair down and initiate a game of flag football or Ultimate ( Frisbee ) with the family .
Add a workout a week
A logical permutation of the previous tip of course ?
If your situation is n?t characterized so much by too much cardio or an imbalance of lifting and low level activity , you might be looking at the need for simply adding workouts period .
( No worries here : everyone starts somewhere . )
The idea might be to just get moving .
Low level workouts are generally easiest to incorporate .
We ?d definitely recommend trying to add more than one a week if you find yourself in this boat .
If you ?re already exercising a few times a week but know you ?re capable of or ready for more , throw in a weight training or sprint session .
Even adding an additional day of low level work can make a difference and can help up your game later with the time you ?ve learned to set aside .
Start a supplement
Mark has said unequivocally that no supplement can be a stand in for a truly healthy diet and lifestyle .
That said , a quality supplement can kickstart and continually enhance the biochemical balance that characterizes good health .
As you begin your own efforts in the realms of exercise and nutrition , why not give yourself a leg up ?
Another benefit ?
A supplement can help mitigate the disadvantages of less than fully Primal living as you make your transition .
Make the mental ?
and logistical ?
commitment
Of course we all have a million excuses for not getting Primal even though we know it makes sense .
We care about our health .
We want to eat right and be in good shape .
Right ?
But there are all those hours of low level cardio , the sweaty sprints and all that vegetable cutting ?.
Hmmm .
How can I possibly fit in anything extra right now ?
Living Primally doesn?t require more time than any other active lifestyle .
When you consider the lack of chronic cardio prescriptions and the short investments of sprints and targeted weight training sessions , you ?ll likely be looking at less time expenditure .
As for food , food shopping is generally food shopping .
( And if you do the CSA / cowpooling / etc. , it ? s actually less weekly outlay of time . )
Cutting , chopping and cooking might add a few extra minutes , but they ?re well worth the extra energy healthy food will give you .
Get more done in less time and sleep better when your head hits the pillow .
There are few moments in our lives when we can truly say we don?t have the time to take care of ourselves .
The weeks following a death or serious illness of a loved one , the birth of a child maybe .
Even in the most difficult times , however , we can make progress even as we give up the ideal of perfection ( who ever said anything about being perfect anyway ? ) .
In other busy but regular circumstances , we are able to consider what we want to bring into our lives ( e.g. healthy living ) and earnestly examine what we ?re willing to give up to achieve this .
T.V.?
Wii ?
Getting through the whole newspaper in the morning ?
Ditching the car commute for a daily walk to the bus or a bike ride ?
Relocating nightly discussions to the kitchen while you put together lunch for the next day ?
Making family outings or time with the kids more active ?
It ?s generally not an issue of giving up valuable activities or interactions in our lives but instead a challenge / opportunity to remake them into equally fulfilling and life balancing Primal adaptations .
Develop a personal Primal diversion
By all means , remake everyday responsibilities into time - saving Primal activities , but also find a bit of time and energy to initiate something new for yourself .
Figure out what will ? feed ?
your spirit in a necessary and vital way .
For some it might be a meditation practice .
For others it might be a new commitment to play ?
the enjoyment of a favorite sport or a relaxing , rejuvenating activity that fulfills a need for space , solitude or nature .
Whatever your Primal diversion of choice is , enjoy it as a gift to yourself .
Use it to recenter and rediscover self - care .
The small bit of investment / indulgence will make the rest of your Primal commitment come more naturally .
When you believe your overall well - being is worth the time and effort , you ?re ready to embrace the steps toward Primal vitality .
Got enough to get you going ?

The UN estimates 3,500 women have been raped since the start of the year US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has demanded an end to widespread sexual abuse in war - ravaged eastern DR Congo , during a visit to the country .
Mrs Clinton spoke out during a tour of a crowded refugee camp in the eastern city of Goma .
Earlier , following talks with Congolese President Joseph Kabila , she said there should be no impunity for the perpetrators of sexual violence .
The UN estimates 3,500 women have been raped in DR Congo so far this year .
And in a report released to coincide with Mrs Clinton 's visit , the aid agency Oxfam said it had monitored 20 communities and found that children , some as young as four , had been raped in half of them .
Men have also been the victims of rape , Oxfam said .
' Arrest , prosecute , punish '
The BBC's Will Ross , in Nairobi , says perpetrators go unpunished and that sexual attacks have increased since January , when a government offensive was launched against rebels linked to Rwanda 's genocide .
She begged the rebels to rape her children first and finish with her because she had HIV / Aids
Anti-rape activist Leah Chishugi
Clinton appeal on Congo conflict
The UN says sexual crimes have been carried out by both militia fighters and government troops .
Mrs Clinton , who is on a seven- nation African tour , said she had " a very frank discussion " with President Kabila on sexual violence .
" We believe there can be more done to protect civilians while you are trying to kill and capture insurgents , " she said .
" We believe there should be no impunity for the sexual and gender - based violence committed by so many and that there must be arrests , prosecutions and punishments . "
She said that Mr Kabila had agreed to allow a team of US legal and technical experts to make " specific " recommendations on how to combat sexual violence .
HIV concern
More than four million people were killed in DR Congo between 1998 and 2003 , when armies from several countries fought each other on Congolese territory .

Rape was widespread during that war , and troops and rebels have continued to abuse women and children as violence has resurfaced over the past six years .
Leah Chishugi , a campaigner on behalf of rape victims in DR Congo , says Mrs Clinton should urge UN troops already in the country to do more to protect women .
She says sexual violence is helping to spread HIV .
" I came across a woman who said she was with her children in her house - they were 12 and 14 , " she told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
" She begged the rebels to rape her children first and finish with her because she had HIV / Aids .
But she was crying because they did n't listen . "
After DR Congo , Mrs Clinton will travel to Nigeria .
Her final stops are Liberia and Cape Verde before returning to Washington on 14 August .

The software claims to have users searching in seconds A company that provides " instant - on " computing will bring " instant search " to the PC for the first time .
Splashtop , made by DeviceVM , already lets consumers access email , chat with friends , share photos or surf the web seconds after turning on their PC .
The deal involves three search leaders including Yahoo in the US and Japan , Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia .
DeviceVM's Dave Bottoms said the deals make sense because web searching is fundamental to computer users .
" Search is the tip of the iceberg in being able to offer a lot of different web services , but when you think about where people spend their time online , it 's in search , " Mr Bottoms , senior director of product management , told BBC News .
" I think this is the next new start experience frontier we are witnessing at the device level . "
A web analytics firm , Comscore , found that in June alone Americans conducted more than 14 billion core searches , up from 10.8 billion in 2008 .
" A lot of people use search as a basic navigation tool , " said DeviceVM 's marketing director Sergey Krupenin .
" Instead of typing in Facebook.com in the address bar , users are typing it into the search box . "
' Accessible '
Depending on what part of the world users are in , as soon as they switch on their computer , they will be greeted by a front page that offers a free Yahoo branded search box or one that says Yandex or Baidu .
Earlier this week Yahoo rolled out a new front page make - over " Web search has emerged as the dominant and universal navigation tool ... and providing instant search will further expand our search leadership in China , the largest and fastest growing internet search market in the world , " said Haoyu Shen , vice president of operations for Baidu .
" The search distribution landscape is changing , and instant search is one of the ways Yahoo provides our users with a convenient and highly accessible Yahoo search experience , " said Tim Mayer , vice president of North America search and social experiences for Yahoo .
In America analysts are not so sure this " instant - search " feature will make a big difference in driving more users to Yahoo , which has 20 % of the US market versus Google 's 65 % share .
" I do n't think these deals have a dramatic impact on market share , " said Greg Sterling of search news site SearchEngineLand .
" People 's habits are fairly well established now when they go online .
However some people will undoubtedly use Yahoo for their search because they are lazy and it's right in front of them , " said Mr Sterling .
" That might mean Yahoo will get an incremental bump , but it wo n't be significant . "
' Instant internet revolution ' Splashtop comes pre-installed on computers .
At the moment it is on over 10 million PCs across 200 models made by Asus , HP , Lenovo , Sony , Acer and LG .
Mr Bottoms said the company estimated that by the end of this year , Splashtop - and the " instant internet revolution " that it heralds - will be on 40 million devices .
By the end of 2010 , he believes , that number will be up to 100 million computers .
The new search feature will be on devices from September onwards DeviceVM said the growing popularity of netbooks is key to this success and that this new instant search feature plays nicely into how people use these low - cost mini laptops .
" Users generally use netbooks on the go for chunks of a half an hour or so compared to notebooks or laptops where they will spend around three hours at home or in an office .
" With the emergence of netbooks , we are definitely seeing a lot of consumer demand for always being connected , always on and being able , at the press of a button , to get searching on the web quickly , " explained Mr Bottoms .
A report by DisplaySearch said that demand for netbooks has been hot and looks to get hotter .
They are projected to grab a 20 % share of the worldwide market for this year with consumers expected to buy almost 33 million netbooks - a doubling of last year 's 16 million .
" The culture of ' on - the - go ' means that speed is important to these users , " said SearchEngineLand 's Mr Sterling .
" I think that will be a benefit to the netbook experience and this is where that quick search box will have its appeal . "
Windows 7 Splashtop and other " instant - on " offerings from other companies bypasses Microsoft Windows , the dominant operating system on PCs .
But software giant Microsoft has said Windows 7 promises to be a leaner , lighter propositsion that can compete in this space .
Windows 7 is Microsoft 's replacement for the much reviled Windows Vista
The company has just released Windows 7 into the hands of computer makers in a process known as " release to manufacturers " .
This is the last big step before the product reaches users in late October .
Microsoft claims that Windows 7 test results showed PCs have gone from a " cold boot " - from switched completely off - to a ready desktop at speeds comparable to the instant - on environments .
But DeviceVM's
Mr Krupenin said that still does not solve the basic problem of speed .
" It is not about how fast an operating system is but how much is loaded onto it .
Six months after people have bought their computer , it works at least two times slower because of all the applications that have been added on .
" Splashtop is an optimised environment around the browser and you are not installing anything there , " he explained .
The company said it expects to see their ' instant - search ' page on devices from September onwards .

China ’s Health Ministry said it is starting the government ’s first nationwide organ donation system in an attempt to move away from the practice of harvesting organs from executed prisoners .
The program , which will be operated jointly with the Red Cross Society of China , will have a database in which people can stipulate that their organs be donated after death , according to Wednesday ’s China Daily .
In a rare acknowledgment of a practice that has until recently been shrouded in secrecy , the state - run newspaper said 65 % of organ donors were executed prisoners .
Huang Jiefu , vice minister of health , was quoted as saying that prisoners “ are definitely not a proper source for organ transplant . ”
Nicholas Bequelin , a researcher for Human Rights Watch , was skeptical that China would stop the practice .

“ Certainly , it is a step in the right direction to set up an national organ donation system , but there are powerful vested interests that will constrain reform , ” he said from Hong Kong .
China is believed to conduct more judicial executions than all other countries combined ; Amnesty International put the 2008 tally at 1,718 .
Prisoners sentenced to death undergo extensive blood tests for matching with potential organ recipients and are given injections to inhibit blood clotting and other treatments to improve the chances of successful transplants .
After execution , the bodies are usually stripped of corneas , livers , kidneys and other organs .
Though in theory prisoners give their consent , Bequelin said , “ we do n’t believe those who sign are in a position to give free and informed consent . ”

Before the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , the Chinese government was chagrined by widespread publicity about buyers coming from abroad in search of organs .
China tightened laws governing the private sale of organs and shut down websites advertising services as middlemen .
This year , the government opened an investigation into 17 Japanese who obtained livers or kidneys in China for an average price of $ 87,000 each .
Huang , the vice minister , was quoted as saying that the new database was designed to make organs available to the approximately 1 million Chinese waiting for transplants .
The database is to begin as a pilot project in some areas , including Shanghai .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
Thousands of defiant protesters swept again Saturday into the streets of the Iranian capital , where they clashed with police armed with batons , tear gas and water cannons .
Demonstrators run past a burning barricade Saturday on a street in Tehran , Iran .

A stream of videos posted on social networking Web sites depicted scenes of chaos -- the sound of gunshots and helicopters whirring overhead and graphic images of wounded men and women being carried away .
Unconfirmed reports put the death toll as high as 150 on the seventh day of post- election protests .
Sources at one Tehran hospital confirmed 19 deaths Saturday .
The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said numerous protesters who had been beaten and injured by security forces were arrested and detained when they sought medical treatment in hospitals .
It said fear of arrest had reportedly driven injured protesters , some in serious condition , to seek care at foreign embassies .
One woman , Shahnaz , said riot police used batons and water hoses to keep her and about 300 other people from reaching Revolution Square in central Tehran .
She said she saw helicopters hovering and then she saw tear gas .
Shahnaz is being identified only by her first name for safety reasons .
Verifiable information was hard to come by .
The Ministry of Culture on Saturday banned international media from reporting on the demonstrations unless they receive permission from Iranian authorities .
A freelance journalist said it was " very dangerous " to take pictures .
Watch police and protesters clash »
At midnight , a stretch of a main avenue near Revolution Square was littered with rocks , street signs and burned tires and trash , witnesses said .
Windows were shattered and hundreds of uniformed riot police lined the streets .
In wealthy neighborhoods , reports surfaced late Saturday of raids by the Basiji militia , a paramilitary security force loyal to the government .
The demonstrations unfolded as opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi reportedly declared he was ready for " martyrdom . "
That was the message posted on Moussavi 's page on Facebook , the social networking Web site that has proved to be a key source of information in the absence of international media coverage .
iReport.com : Share images from Iran
The message urged Moussavi 's supporters to " protest " and " not go to work . "
" Today you are the media , " said one message .
" It is your duty to report and keep the hope alive . "
Iran 's ruling system is " going to the slaughterhouse , " a post on the site said .
The post , attributed to Moussavi , reasserted his call for a new election to be overseen by an independent council .
The authenticity of the information could not immediately be established , but its posting coincided with growing unrest by demonstrators , who complain that hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's election victory was rigged .
The protests were held in open defiance of warnings issued Friday by Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and the country 's Security Council .
Those authorities had said that protest organizers -- specifically Moussavi -- would be held accountable if the protests led to bloodshed .

One video showed a woman trying to protect a man being beaten and kicked by protesters near a motorcycle in flames .
Another showed that the unrest had spread beyond the capital -- police clad in riot gear dispersing a crowd at a university in the southern city of Shiraz , beating screaming women with their batons .
Witnesses in Tehran said crowd members were chanting " Death to Khamenei ! " and " I will kill whoever killed my brother ! "
The latter phrase dates to Iran 's 1979 Islamic revolution that brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power .
Watch how protesters ' tone has changed »
The chants from rooftops of " Allahu Akbar " ( God is great ) grew longer and louder .
In a story posted Saturday on the Web site of the government - run Press TV , Iran 's deputy police commander said 400 police personnel had been wounded since the opposition rallies began last weekend .
" Families of those killed or injured in the events since June 12 have filed 2,000 complaints so far , " acting Police Chief Brigadier Gen. Ahmad - Reza Radan told Iran 's Fars news agency .
Radan said 10,000 complaints had been filed by people asserting that their daily lives had been disrupted , adding , " They have called on the police to deal with rallies firmly . "
Demonstrators gathered in major cities in France , the United States and Germany to condemn the crackdown .

In Washington , President Obama urged the Iranian government to stop the violence .
" The Iranian government must understand that the world is watching , " Obama said in a written statement .
" We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people . "
" If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community , it must respect the dignity of its own people and govern through consent , not coercion , " the statement said .
On Saturday night , the Iranian state - run news agency IRINN said an attacker had been killed earlier in the day outside Tehran at the entrance to the mausoleum that holds the body of Ayatollah Khomeini .
The agency said the man " carrying the bomb " was killed , and there were no other casualties .
Press TV was reporting that the bomber was the sole fatality , and that three other people were wounded at the shrine to Khomeini , the father of the Islamic Revolution that swept the shah of Iran from power in 1979 .
Khomeini is regarded as the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
With international journalists restricted from covering events in the capital , Iranians were again using cell phones and social networking sites to get news out .
CNN was told that many protesters removed the SIM card , or memory chip , from their cell phones to prevent the government from tracing their calls .

Witnesses reported that cell phone service was cut off in the area after 5:30 p.m .
Meanwhile , the Iranian government said Saturday it is ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of " ballot boxes . "
The government agency that oversees elections , the Guardian Council , said it had received more than 600 complaints of irregularities from the three candidates .

The Best of Ron Paul
— A fit of anger landed a Wayne County golfer in the hospital Saturday and taught his foursome a lesson they will never forget .
Clark Rose said the round at Walnut Creek Country Club started off as normal .
He was playing with Taylor Gardner , a friend and teammate on the Wayne Christian golf team .
Rose said everyone was playing well until they made their approach on to the fourth green .
" Taylor hits a bad shot , he gets mad , slams his club against the cart , the club breaks in half and stabs him in the stomach , " Rose described .
The broken club went about 6 inches into Taylor Gardner 's stomach , then pierced his intestine .
Hayden Gardner , Taylor 's brother , saw what happened .
" It kind of , like , wrapped around and just shot straight at him , " he said .
" When he fell down and said he was bleeding , we actually did n't believe him at all and we went over and it was bleeding pretty bad , " Hayden Gardner said .
The foursome put Taylor Gardner in the golf cart and rushed him to the clubhouse , where they called an ambulance .
" His face was turning white , his lips were turning white , " Rose said .
" It was just bad . "
Taylor Gardner lost a lot of blood and had emergency surgery .
By Monday , he was on a ventilator , but was expected to recover fully .
" They 've all been saying he 's lucky , " Hayden Gardner said of his brother .
His injury has served as a lesson for his golf buddies .
" You do n't want to be throwing clubs or anything cause something like that could happen again , " Rose said .

For Sure Championship : Stunning Button effort , Massa leads
By Phil Huff
May 10 2009
It 's all change in the RealBrawnGP.com For Sure Championship 2009 , although it 's still Felipe Massa leading the charge .
Brawn GP 's Rubens Barrichello has dropped from seventh to 10th overall , saying ' for sure ' an average of just 0.4 times per press conference .
However , team mate Jenson Button has overtaken Lewis Hamilton to take second place , following an incredible effort in Spain - he managed to not only utter ' for sure ' five times in one press conference , but a stunning three times in a single answer .
Lewis Hamilton attempted to improve his position by inventing a new phrase of ' for course ' , but did not realise that only comments in official FIA press conferences count towards the championship .
You can view is attempt here , at around the 1m55s mark .
Mark Webber continues to disappoint , failing to mention ' for sure ' at all , despite having five opportunities to do so .
He clearly fails to recognise the importance of the championship , and is doing nothing but disappointing his legions of fans with his frankly lamentable performance .
Elsewhere , all is not a pleasant as it should be , with some parties suggesting that Massa 's continued dominance of the championship is bad for the sport .
" This is clearly further evidence that the FIA are trying to rig the competition in favour of a Ferrari driver , " commented F1 language consultant Elaine Conedoff .
" It 's also quite clear that , with Kimi Raikkonen managing just half Massa 's average , Ferrari are n't ensuring Kimi remains competitive . "
It 's understood that Ferrari are organising immediate press conference simulations at Fiorano , while Luca di Montezemolo has instructed the team to work on multiple strategies to allow Raikkonen to deploy an optimum number of ' for sure 's ' at each GP weekend .
F1's language standards adjudicator , Major Nameup , remains displeased with developments thus far .
" Despite a crackdown on the use of ' for sure ' , we are concerned that each driver is still insisting on using the phrase .
Jenson Button , with his latest effort , is getting perilously close to a ban , or at least a copy of a thesaurus .
This cannot continue as it is but , at the end of the day , I turn off the lights . "

As if his financial issues could n't get any worse , the CEO of Global Gaming Factory suffered yet another humiliating setback yesterday .
After a tax debt of more of $ 110,000 went unpaid , enforcement officers swooped last night , repossessing Hans Pandeya 's car and a motorcycle .
The proposed sale of The Pirate Bay is looking less like a business deal and increasingly like some kind of soap opera – and an unbelievable one at that .
Despite Global Gaming Factory ’s investors getting cold feet and aborting their financial support for the purchase of the world ’s largest tracker , on Thursday the company ’s shareholders ( well , at least the four who attended the meeting ) all agreed that the purchase could go ahead .
Less optimistically , Peerialism , GGF ’s technology partner , said there would be no business between the companies .
Where the money will come from in the end is anyone ’s guess , but CEO Hans Pandeya says he will cover the purchase with his own shares , but right now , it appears he does n’t even have cash to cover his business or personal debts .
Recently , former GGF board member Johan Sellström said that Pandeya owed him in excess of 6 million kronor ( $ 840,000 ) and said he was suing to get the money back .
Now , according to a new report , last night Pandeya suffered a serious humiliation , one that he ’ll find difficult to put down to the “ smear campaign ” he said had been orchestrated against him recently .
Having failed to pay a debt of some 780,000 kronor ( $ 110,400 ) owed to the Swedish tax authorities , yesterday enforcement officers ran out of patience and swooped to seize his assets .
Last night a tow truck took away Pandeya ’s car and , as you can see from the screenshot from the Aftonbladet site , what appears to be a pretty nice motorcycle .
We have n’t got a comment from Hans Pandeya , but if we did he would probably say , “ Everything is fine and the purchase of Pirate Bay is going ahead as planned . ”
" You can only eat the nettles we supply , " said judge Richard Hooper , who grows them in his field outside the village .
" Also you have to keep them down .
If you spit them out , or anything worse , it does n't count .
Anyone who goes to the toilet is automatically disqualified . "
Which brings us to the delicate problem of what seasoned stinger scoffers know as " green bearding " .
This tends to occur with the onset of facial paralysis and judges must pay close attention to the amount of emerald - hued drool being emitted .

The US military is moving ahead with plans to create its first “ cyber command ” designed to bolster America ’s potential to wage digital warfare as well as defend against mounting cyber threats , officials said on Friday .
After President Barack Obama announced Friday his plans to overhaul cyber security policy , Defense Secretary Robert Gates was expected to soon formally propose the new cyber command that will be overseen by a four - star officer , Pentagon officials told AFP .
The move reflects a shift in military strategy with “ cyber dominance ” now part of US war doctrine and growing alarm over the perceived threat posed by digital espionage coming from China , Russia and elsewhere .
US officials say China has built up a sophisticated cyber warfare program and that a spate of intrusions in the United States and elsewhere can be traced back to Chinese sources .
Defense officials say the cyber command would focus on security efforts for US networks along with offensive capabilities to ensure “ freedom of action in cyberspace ” to protect America ’s interests .
The precise details of US cyber military power remain secret , but it includes technology capable of penetrating and jamming networks , including the classified Suter airborne system , analysts say .

Steve Donnelly writes :
Just a little something I whipped up to solve the age - old problem of separate hot and cold water taps in a rented apartment where you ca n’t start replacing the plumbing .
Cheap and works well .
At first , Kristen Stewart thought it was just bad timing when several apartments she was hoping to rent were no longer available when she showed up to view them .
But when a landlord looked her in the eye and coldly said he did n't rent to teens with babies , the truth hit like a slap in the face .
As a young , black , single mom on welfare , nobody wanted to rent to her .
And she is not alone .
A groundbreaking study , to be released today , estimates that about one in four black , single parents and households on social assistance face moderate to severe discrimination in Toronto 's tight rental market .
The same is true for South Asians .
For those with a mental illness , more than one - third face discrimination when they inquire about available apartments , the study found .
" Even when rental housing is available , thousands of marginalized individuals and families cannot make it through the door , " says the report by the Centre for Equality Rights in Accommodation .
" Any strategies to address homelessness and housing insecurity must address this reality . "
The study , one of the largest and most comprehensive of its kind in Canada , was funded through a $ 90,000 grant from the Atkinson Charitable Foundation , established by former Toronto Star publisher Joseph E. Atkinson .
Ontario's Human Rights
Code protects renters from discrimination on a variety of grounds , including family status , age , disability , colour , ethnic background and reliance on social assistance .
To test landlord compliance , the centre created five " renter profiles " – a single mother with one child ; a black single mother with one child ; a single South Asian man , a single man with a mental illness and a married woman on provincial disability benefits .
Volunteers posing as these vulnerable renters made telephone inquires about 982 apartments listed for rent across Toronto last summer .
Each call was followed up within 1 1/ 2 hours by another volunteer with no discernable grounds for discrimination .
Each pair asked the same 12 questions and the landlords ' responses were recorded and analyzed for mild , moderate or severe differential treatment .
For example , to gauge discrimination against the South Asian man , one caller used a distinct South Asian accent and name , while the second caller had no accent and used a Western European name .
Discrimination against the South Asian man ranged from not having his call returned to being told the unit was already rented when it was still available .
The South Asian man also faced extra application requirements such as being asked for postdated cheques .
And 31 per cent of the time , he was offered fewer move - in incentives such as free cable TV , the study found .
" In some cases , the landlord makes the unit so unappealing that he does n't have to turn the person down , " said John Fraser , the centre 's program director .
The centre 's results are similar to those from studies in the United States , where community - based organizations regularly monitor discrimination in rental housing , Fraser said .

He hopes Queen 's Park will fund local groups to use the centre 's model to track the situation .
The centre is also calling on the province to fund more human - rights cases based on housing discrimination and to beef up support for local agencies that help households facing these barriers .
Education is also key , says Barbara Hall , chief of Ontario 's Human Rights Commission , which held consultations on housing discrimination last year and will release a related policy document this summer .
" I think it 's fair to say most people are not aware there is a human rights component to housing , " Hall said in an interview .
" The commission has never focused on this issue and it's something we and other commissions in Canada are just beginning to investigate . "
The study 's findings translate into tens of thousands of Torontonians potentially facing discrimination , including about 6,000 single parents , 2,000 of whom are single black parents like Stewart .
About 10,000 South Asians and nearly 15,000 Torontonians receiving Ontario Works or Ontario Disability Support Program benefits and more than 8,000 people with schizophrenia in Toronto experience significant discriminatory barriers every year , the study says .
And the numbers likely are low because those who do n't face discrimination during the initial phone call could be treated unfairly when they view the apartment or fill out an application , it adds .
That was Stewart 's experience , and the incident two years ago left her hurt and confused .
" I was stunned .
I could n't believe someone would say something like that . "
Stewart , now 18 and living with her 2 - year - old daughter in a subsidized apartment in the city 's east end , has just completed high school and is about to start college .
" I hope this study makes people more aware so this sort of thing stops , " she said .

We have been pleasantly surprised by the interest in Prokudin - Gorsky 's work .
At the opening of the exhibition , we had over 200 guests .
Dr. Victor Minachin , of the Russian Academy of Sciences , prepared two great posters describing the technique of color photography used by Prokudin - Gorsky .
Dr Minachin intended to be with us for the opening of the exhibition , but sadly , due to illness , this was not possible .
As a very pleasant surprise to us , the Orthodox Church in Tábor has loaned us an icon for the exhibition .
At ground level are photographs mostly from European Russia .
On basement level are photographs from Siberia , Daghestan , Georgia and Central Asia .
It was an honor for us to invite the following important guests to the opening of our exhibition on 28 th February , 2006 :
( napsal Dr. Viktor Minachin , Ruská akademie věd ) Prokudin - Gorsky and his Place in the History of Three - Color Photography .
( written by Dr. Viktor Minachin , Russian Academy of Sciences and Restavrator - M Restoration Center , Moscow ) Louis Ducos du Hauron ( 1837–1920 ) .
The technique of three - color photography was historically the first practical method to capture color photographic images .
It was first used for practical photography by Louis Ducos du Hauron ( 1837 –1920 ) who patented his technique in 1868 in France .
The idea proposed and tested earlier by James Clark Maxwell was to make three separate black and white negatives through three colored filters .
The result was a triple black and white imagecalled color separations .
Ducos du Hauron made his first color separations on three separate sheets of paper .
The sensitivity of emulsion to the red part of the spectrum was so low that he had to expose the scene through the red ( or rather orange ) filter for hours .
Three - color camera designed by A. Miethe and produced by Bermpohl Company .
Prokudin - Gorsky used camera of this type .
Glass negative taken by Prokudin - Gorsky with this type of camera .
Around the turn of the 20th century an important advance was made by Professors Vogel ( 1834–1898 ) and Miethe ( 1862 –1927 ) in Germany who significantly improved the sensibility of the emulsion to the red light .
Miethe also developed a very practical design of the triple - color camera which used a negative glass plate 8 by 24 cm. Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin- Gorsky ( 1863 –1944 )
In 1902 –1904 a Russian scientist and photographer Sergei Prokudin - Gorsky ( 1863 –1944 ) worked at Miethe 's laboratory and fully mastered the technique of Dreifarbenphotographie nach der Natur .
After this he devoted his life to further developing this technology as well as to creating the collection of the Splendors of Russia in Natural Colors .
Most of his color photographs were taken between 1904 and 1916 .
Prokudin - Gorsky emigrated from Russia in 1918 and later his family was able to bring the major part of the collection of glass negatives to France .
In 1948 the collection was purchased by the U.S. Library of Congress .
Since then 1902 glass plates are preserved in perfect order and constitute the largest surviving collection of triple black and white negatives in the world .
Prokudin - Gorsky - What Kind of Color Images Was He Able to See at His Time .
( written by Dr. Viktor Minachin , Russian Academy of Sciences )
The sad irony of the technique of the Three - Color Photography was that Prokudin - Gorsky himself never saw the entire collection of his images in color .
Most of the surviving images are preserved in the form of triple black and white negatives and only rarely as historic color prints or slides which in any case are no match to present day color photographs .
At Prokudin - Gorsky 's time several techniques were used to create a color image from triple black and white negatives .
Triple - Color Projection .
Illustration by Dr. Victor Minachin Goertz Triple - Color Projector .
Prokudin Gorsky probably used a similar type of projector for his color demonstrations to the Russian Tsar .
Triple - color projection : A contact triple black and white positive was printed on a glass plate and then projected through a special triple projector .
Each of the three positives was projected on the screen through a different filter .
Prokudin - Gorsky Carbro ( carbon - bromide ) print .
Carbro Process :
Three bromide paper enlargments were produced from the three separation negatives .
Each of the prints was passed through a chemical solution with gelatin pigment .
The silver bromide image produced corresponding fixed image in the gelatin pigment , and after rinsing off the non-fixed gelatin , three images were obtained in the three colors .
These three images were combined on a paper mounting , carefully aligned , and the result was a color photograph in natural colors .
This was a very painstaking , complex work , which demanded absolute accuracy at every step .
Each copy took Prokudin - Gorsky two to three days of work time , and it was , of course , expensive .
But the results were very durable .
Prokudin - Gorsky also published color inserts in each issue of the Fotograf - Liubitel ( An Amateur Photographer ) , a monthly journal he was Editor - in - Chief of in 1906 – 1909 .
The printing cliches were produced by Prokudin - Gorsky himself .
In September 1908 issue of Fotograf - Liubitel Prokudin - Gorsky published his famous photograph of Leo Tolstoy .

Leo Tolstoy , 1908 , color litographic print by Prokudin - Gorsky Dear Lev Nikolaevich ,
Not long ago I had the occasion to develop a color photographic plate which someone had taken of you ( I forget the person 's name ) .
The result was extremely bad , since , apparently , the photographer was not well acquainted with his task .
Photography in natural colors is my specialty , and it is possible that you might have come across my name by chance in print .
At the present time , after many years of work , I have been able to achieve an excellent reproduction of images in true colors .
My color slide projections are as well known in Europe as they are in Russia .
At this time , now that the process of taking photographs using my method and my plates requires from one to three seconds , I permit myself to ask your permission for me to visit for one or two days ( keeping in mind the state of your health and the weather ) , thereby in order to take several color pictures of you and your spouse ...
It seems to me that , by reproducing your image in true color and its surroundings , I will perform a service to the whole world .
These images are everlasting - they do not change .
No painted reproduction can achieve such results .
Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin- Gorsky
Modern reproductions of photographs by Prokudin - Gorskij ( written by Jan Hubička in cooperation with Lynn E. Brooks , Walter Frankhauser , Victor Minachin and John Titchener ) Classical methods of reproducing three color photography are demanding and require a lot of skill , time and expense .
These factors kept the world from seeing Prokudin - Gorsky images in color .
In 1980 , the first book of his photographs Photographs for the Tsar : The Pioneering Color Photography of Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin - Gorskii by Robert Allshouse was published by Dial Press , New York .
A small collection of images from the collection of Prokudin - Gorsky was exhibited for only the first time in 1986 by the US Library of Congress .
Producing color images was greatly simplified with the advent of digital technology .
The color images can be composed from scanned negatives in the computer and then printed as color digital photographs .
However , as a result of movement by the subject during the time of the three exposures precise registration is also necessary .
A new stage of the research on the collection was started in the early 1990s by the U. S. Library of Congress , Dr. Victor Minachin ( Russian Academy of Sciences ) and others .
For the first exhibition prepared using modern methods , professional photographer Walter Frankhauser , contracted by the Library of Congress , developed a method called digichromatography , to produce 122 photographs .
In his method , performed in Photoshop* , the digital scan of the original negative with photos made through blue , red and green filters ( left ) is split into three separate layers from which the final color composite will be generated .
After overlaying and properly coloring the layers , the color photograph appears .
The composite is cropped to eliminate all but the photographic area shared in common by all three layers .
The cropped color composite is adjusted overall to create the proper contrast , appropriate highlight and shadow detail , and optimal color balance .
Final adjustments and retouching may be applied to specific , localized areas of the composite color image .
This will minimize defects associated with incorrect exposure , aging of the emulsion , or damage of the original glass plate .
The Library of Congress exhibiton , " The Empire That Was Russia " , was revolutionary not only in the quality of the color reproduction , but also in making the whole archive of 1,902 negatives available on the internet in high resolution .
This little known collection of Prokudin - Gorsky 's work has quickly gained popularity , and a number of new projects have been started , to create new color composites .
One of these is our exhibition here .
The full collection was exhibited in Moscow in 2003 .
The color renderings were produced automatically by software developed by the Russian Academy of Sciences and Restavrator - M Restoration Center in Moscow ( Dr. Victor Minachin ) .
This was historically the first complete exhibition of the collection .
In 2004 , the US Library of Congress further extended the archive , by automatically generating color composites , using software developed by Blaise Agüera y Arcas , Princeton University .

Famous three - color photograph made by James Clerk Maxwell from year 1861 was really just demonstration of his theory .
In 1868 Luis Ducos du Hauron reached practical results .
Additive method of combining colors Subtractive method of combining colors
Most subsequent techniques still produce color either additively , by combining red , green and blue light , or subtractively , by eliminating individual colors from white light via pigments of complementary colors ( cyan , magenta and yellow ) .
Recording different wavelengths of light in Lippmann photography into ( greatly enlarged ) ultrafine grainded photographic emulsion by reflection from high quality mirror ( on the right ) .
Latent image is shown as black dots .
In 1891 , the physicist Gabriel Lippmann invented an entirely new method of so - called direct color photography , where a glass plate was coated with a transparent and ultrafinegrainded silver emulsion .
The uncoated side was exposed to the light , with the emulsion in contact with a reflecting surface such as mercury .
The incident light was reflected back on itself , causing interference .
This established a standing wave in the emulsion , at half the wavelength of the incident light , which reacted with the photosensitive emulsion .
Viewing Lippmann photograh must be done from right place .
The deposited silver then reflected light at various multiples of the original wavelength , giving rise to bright colors ; similar in principle to the way colors appear on a soap - bubble .
Unfortunately the technique was very complex , and required special equipment for viewing , so it never came into general use .
RGB photography won because it was adequate for most purposes .
Gabriel Lippman however did win a Nobel prize for color photography in 1908 and his method became the basis for modern holography .
John Joly : Lilie a anthurium , 1877 , Kodak Museum , Harrow ) Color patterns used for Joly process .
A different method is to expose black and white photographic emulsion through a filter with colored mosaic .
When the resulting black and white diapositive is viewed through the same filter , the resulting picture is in color , in the same way as in the three color projection .
This method was first patented by Joly in 1893 .
His method however led to photographs with a clearly visible color grid ( roughly 200 lines per inch ) .

The Lumiere brothers introduced the first commercially successful process of color photography .
Their Autochrome process was patented in 1903 , and dominated the market for the next 30 years .
The basic principle was identical to the Joly process , except that the mosaic was constructed by using microscopic colored starch grains , in a layer of bees - wax , directly onto the photographic plate .
At the same time , there were interesting developments in color movie film .
While projecting a movie , it is easy to project color separations , by using alternating color filters in the front of the projector .
Such a method had been used since 1908 ( Kinemacolor ) .
Prokudin - Gorsky is known to have experimented with color film in 1912 , and his methods were probably similar .
In 1922 , Technicolor introduced a photo - mechanical process of printing color film , ( similar to the color Carbro prints used by Prokudin - Gorsky ) , using dyes from separate black - and - white films , recorded through red , green and blue filters .
This was the dominant technique for producing color film in Hollywood , until the 1950's .

The photograph , on negative Orwo ( one of numerous clones of Agfacolor ) , is also a good example of the limited life of the material .
Today , the most popular color films are based on Agfacolor - Neu , introduced in 1936 .
In Agfacolor - Neu , the dyes are directly present in the emulsion , which significantly simplifies the development process as well as the “ reinvention ” of negative .
Agfa also introduced the concept of minilabs , which made the development of films faster .
The main problem of Agfacolor is however the limited life of the material .

Emergent Game Play
Exploitation and Evasion
Primal Instincts
There have been a number of intriguing articles written over the last few weeks about one of the key concepts , and most criticised features , of roguelikes : permanent death , often shortened to permadeath .
This is the notion that should the game avatar die , the player should start from the beginning of the game .
Permadeath is the reason why it can take years to beat certain roguelikes - in my case , I have never won a game of Angband or any variant of it in over ten years of playing - and why so many people initially turn away from the genre .
But in a world of quick saves and regenerating health , permadeath is the one compelling design feature that you need to appreciate to understand the genre .
The challenge of playing Far Cry 2 with one life made by Ben Abraham of Sometimes Life Requires Consequence has been picked up and commented on by lead designer Clint Hocking .
He goes on to explore the conflict between what Ben is attempting and the narrative losses that Clint designed into the game .
( As an aside : the immediacy of playing the game and being responded to by the designer of that game plays to the strengths of the blogging medium , the dialog between auteur and audience .
This was a triumph - I 'm making a note here etc. - for the rise of the game critic / blogger . )
In Infinite Caves , Infinite Stories , Anthony Burch explores what makes Spelunky so compelling - a freeware mix of platformer and roguelike , one of the nascent roguelike - likes if you will - and identifies a mix of three elements : ' randomized [...] levels , emergent gameplay and permanent death ' .
Think of these as three legs of the roguelike game design triangle - each of which cannot stand unsupported without the others .
Randomized levels , built from procedural techniques or randomly chosen pre-assembled components , is what you immediately think of when talking about roguelikes .
But randomized levels feature in the RTS genre without permadeath - but on reflection , the RTS genre does intra-level permadeath : it is possible to lose and restart on a single map while keeping progress between maps .
It turns out that many genres have permanent death and restart as a core component of the game - arcade fighters , horizontal and vertical scrolling shooters , strategy games - in fact , permanent death is only seen as a negative in narrative based games , especially those like RPGs that feature accumulation of resource over time , and it is roguelikes that are unique out of these types of games in continuing what started as an arcade tradition .
What almost all other genres featuring permanent death have in common is that there is a resource accumulated from game to game : player skill .
Improved twitch resources required to dodge an ever increasing swarm of bullets or rote memorisation of the patterns of enemy waves , increased understanding or yomi of the opponent 's mind - all of these attributes can be improved and reused in repeated play .
But with roguelikes , it 's not obvious what skills are being developed .
Certainly not reflexes , and with a single player game , no understanding of an opponent is required .
Puzzle solving is closer to the process , but puzzle solving in an environment where the board is reset differently every time , and the pieces are sometimes unfairly tipped against you .
I 'd argue that there are two important but distinct phases of skill development that in roguelikes : discovery of emergent game play and the trade off between exploitation of resources against evasion of risk .
Emergent game play in most roguelikes rests on a foundation of the combinatorial explosion caused by designing verbs and objects to maximise the number of verbs which can interact with each object ( and implicitly , through throwing , falling , collisions and other game ' physics ' , maximising the number of ways objects which can interact with each other ) .
From Spelunky , it is possible to rescue a maiden by picking her up and carrying her to the exit , but also , by noticing carried objects can be thrown , a thrown maiden can be used to interact with targets in a number of different ways .
Nethack and other roguelikes do this by expanding the number of verbs and ways those verbs can be used - which leads to that Nethack saying ' They thought of everything !
'
The process of learning the emergent rules of a game with permadeath and randomized levels transforms the game play from a fixed author led narrative into a meta narrative about the experience of the player learning through repeated and hopefully interesting and unique failure .
As the developer of Dwarf Fortress puts it ' failing is fun ' - provided you do n't have to repeat the same sequence of narrative events each time you do .
But why does this ' failing is fun ' approach to learning not work in a game where the player 's progress can be saved at any point ?
The problem with save games is they capture the wrong sort of progress .
The player may have made a critical error of judgement , and failed to acquire a necessary resource or game play skill , somewhere in playing the game prior to saving the game state - and neither the player nor the game designer has any way of knowing this .
This is why so many games are designed with gated progression : discrete levels over which a player has to demonstrate supposed mastery of a particular skill .
But if a skill is only significant for a subset of the total game , then why have that skill at all ?
Why not release a series of mini - games instead ?
The only guaranteed point at which the player is open to all lessons is at a complete reset of the game state .
This does not necessarily have to be a complete restart of the game : it is possible to save player progression provided that all players will end up in exactly the same game state at some point during play .
This could be the start of a or new level in a puzzle game which resets all the pieces in play or a new map in an RTS which does not allow units to be kept from previous successes or failures .
Without randomized levels , it is possible for a player to progress simply through rote learning , without having improved the necessary skills .
More importantly , repeating the same sequence of actions and narrative sequences is frustrating and ultimately unfulfilling .
Think of each play through of a game as being set an exam with a pass or fail mark .
If the levels are not randomized , it is possible to sit the same exam over and over , memorising the answers to fixed questions as a method of passing , but not an indication of underlying ability .
The process of quick saving and reloading is akin to being able to guess every answer to each question and trying again if you get the wrong result .
Varying the rarity of objects , seen in genres such as MMOs and collectable card games as a callous way of manipulating players to endless grind , instead becomes a useful way of extending the player enjoyment of this learning process , ensuring that some learning situations occur less frequently than others and consequently remembered more vividly .
The requirement to identify items through using them common to many roguelikes also helps extend learning , in that the player is not necessarily aware of what resources they hold at any time .
But - even despite my best efforts in Unangband - it is possible to discover all possible emergent properties in most games ( not quite true in all cases : self - evolving systems like Galatic Arms Race will prevent this in the future , and the pimpest plays in Starcraft have continued to evolve over that game 's lifespan ) - and once learned , an emergent property is just another line in a FAQ .
In an information complete game , where the player has complete knowledge of the rules , the processes of exploitation and evasion become primary .
Take a typical game of Rogue .
The player travels through a number of rooms spread across multiple dungeon levels , accumulating resources as they do so .
But as the player descends in the dungeon , the level of threat from monsters increases , exponentially so , without a consequent increase in the rewards for defeating them , so that in the last few levels it is better for the player to evade encounters with monsters and conserve the resources he has accumulated earlier in the game , than attempt to stand his ground and fight .
This process can be modelled as follows , where the horizontal axis is the playing time , P indicates the overall accumulated power and R is the risk at any point :
The exploitation phase of the game occurs when the player has more power than the risks they can encounter - the evasion phase of the game occurs when the opposite is true .
In reality , the both player power and risk change in step wise increments , and because resources can be lost as well as gained , it is not necessarily a consistently upwards progression .
And most roguelikes have a combination of attacks by monsters which can only be avoided by the player having specific resources to resist these attacks .
This complicates the picture , because at any point there is a multi-variable level of risk depending on the player 's location , and known and unknown threats in the region the player is located .
The key player skill then becomes recognising when the player is in an exploitable situation and taking advantage of the opportunity to collect useful resources , versus an evasion situation , where the player should continue moving and avoid any imminent threats .
This reaches a logical conclusion through the what is known in Angband as diving , where a player descends as quickly as possible through the dungeon , stopping only when exploits obviously present themselves - a technique very similar to speed running non-procedurally generated games .
This works in Angband because the rewards deeper in the dungeon are progressively more valuable than earlier in the game and so it is always worthwhile going deeper even as the risks escalate .
Similar behaviour occurs in Left4Dead , where quickly running through a level is almost always a more effective technique than going out of the way to find the limited additional resources hidden on the map .
On the face of it , exploiting is grinding like behaviour : techniques from Angband such as worm farming to quickly gain experience through killing a self - replicating monster strongly resemble grinding monsters for experience in MMORPGs .
But what distinguishes exploiting from grinding is two - fold : limitation of exploitable resources and permadeath .
Grinding in a game with permadeath still has an element of risk - that of dying through boredom or statistical happenstance .
At any point in time , there should be a non-zero chance that the player will die , and lose all the effort accumulated through relatively safe resource accumulation .
More importantly , any time spent grinding at an early phase of the game , is time wasted not playing at the maximum level of reward vs. risk later in the game .
This is a design balancing act : the player must be made aware that progression escalates reward as well as risk , as well as ensuring that the player is never able to accumulate all the necessary resources required to win the game through grinding .
The balance in Angband is maintained by preventing the player from grinding unlimited resources for equipment , and ensuring that a player with maximum experience but no equipment will quickly die .
( This is not quite true : the technique of stair scumming allows equipment grinding , but an honour system encourages the Angband community not to take advantage of this . )
The use of explicit timers , such as food in Rogue , and the ghost in Spelunky , can also ensure that the player is pushed onwards instead of grinding any exploitable situation they find .
Permadeath adds another interesting facet of the exploitation vs. evasion and progression vs. grinding balance .
Provided progression through the game brings greater rewards , and the player is able to evade threats at the current level of risk , there is no incentive not to progress to a higher risk area .
The rewards are comparatively higher for same the time investment in the game , and the increased risk will either be successfully evaded or result in permadeath , which is the most time efficient way of highlighting the player has judged the level of risk incorrectly .
So the design incentive appears to be to be to allow the player to progress through the game relatively easily , stopping off at points determined by the player to acquire the resources needed to survive at all in the next region of escalated risk .
In Angband , this is summarised ironically as : 1. Visit general store2 .
Buy Lantern3 .
Kill Morgothbecause of the lack of fix requirements to complete the game .
Randomized levels require some form of grinding be present in order to guarantee the game is winnable .
This is because the player may experience either a resource poor series of levels or a string of bad luck which depletes a high level of resource , through no fault of their own .
The extent to which grinding allows the player to alleviate this bad luck is another design decision .
It may be that some games are unwinnable is a viable choice here .
At the same time , emergent game play through object interaction maximises the chance the player will have some resource available to counter any randomized situation that they find themselves in .
At any point in time , the player is faced with the decision of fight or run .
This is answered by a careful weighing of the odds , what resources does the player currently have , what is known about those resources , and what threats are known and unknown .
Information becomes a precious commodity in a game with randomized levels , and permadeath is used during the learning phase of the game to provide a final lesson in determining if the player understands all the variables of every situation they find themselves in .
Once the player understands the game well enough to win it , permadeath is a final backstop to the ever tightening vice between progression and risk , one technique of ensuring that the player does not endlessly loop in a grind .
The question becomes , is this process of learning worthwhile ?
Is an intuitive understanding of multivariate analysis over a complex risk topology subsumed into a flight or fight instinct something worth playing ?
Whether this is true is beyond the scope of this article , but I would argue that this skill is something that makes us human .

An amino acid called glycine has been found in dust collected by the Stardust spacecraft , which flew by Comet Wild 2 in 2004 ( Illustration : NASA / JPL )
An amino acid has been found on a comet for the first time , a new analysis of samples from NASA ’s Stardust mission reveals .
The discovery confirms that some of the building blocks of life were delivered to the early Earth from space .
Amino acids are crucial to life because they form the basis of proteins , the molecules that run cells .
The acids form when organic , carbon - containing compounds and water are zapped with a source of energy , such as photons – a process that can take place on Earth or in space .
Previously , researchers have found amino acids in space rocks that fell to Earth as meteorites , and tentative evidence for the compounds has been detected in interstellar space .
Now , an amino acid called glycine has been definitively traced to an icy comet for the first time .
“ It ’s not necessarily surprising , but it ’s very satisfying to find it there because it has n’t been observed before , ” says Jamie Elsila of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center , lead author of the new study .
“ It ’s been looked for [ on comets ] spectroscopically with telescopes but the content seems so low you ca n’t see it that way . ”

Raw materials
Comets and asteroids are thought to have bombarded the Earth early in its history , and the new discovery suggests they carried amino acids with them .
“ We are interested in understanding what was on the early Earth when life got started , ” Elsila told New Scientist .
“ We do n’t know how life got started … but this adds to our knowledge of the ingredient pool . ”
Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona agrees .
“ Life had to get started with raw materials , ” he told New Scientist .
“ This provides another source [ of those materials ] . ”
The amino acid was found in samples returned to Earth by NASA ’s Stardust mission , which flew by Comet Wild 2 in 2004 to capture particles shed by the 5 - kilometre object .
Tiny sample size
The samples in Elsila ’s study came from four squares of aluminium foil , each about 1 centimetre across , that sat next to a lightweight sponge - like “ aerogel ” that was designed to capture dust from the comet ’s atmosphere , or coma .
The researchers reported finding several amino acids , as well as nitrogen - containing organic compounds called amines , on the foil in 2008 .
But it was not clear whether the discoveries originated in the comet or whether they were simply contamination from Earth .
The researchers spent two years trying to find out – a painstaking task since there was so little of the comet dust to study .
In fact , there was not enough material to trace the source of any compound except for glycine , the simplest amino acid .
With only about 100 billionths of a gram of glycine to study , the researchers were able to measure the relative abundance of its carbon isotopes .
It contained more carbon - 13 than that found in glycine that forms on Earth , proving that Stardust ’s glycine originated in space .
Close study
“ It ’s a great piece of laboratory work , ” says Lunine .
“ It ’s probably something that could n’t have been done remotely with a robotic instrument – it points to the value of returning samples . ”
Elsila says she would like to see samples returned not just from a comet ’s coma but from its main body , or nucleus .
“ There might be more complex mixtures [ of amino acids ] and higher levels of them in a comet nucleus , ” she told New Scientist .
Europe ’s Rosetta spacecraft should help shed light on the issue .
The first mission designed to orbit and land on a comet ’s nucleus , it will reach the Comet 67P / Churyumov - Gerasimenko in 2014 after a 10 - year journey from Earth .

I have been hearing a lot of pundits and politicians bemoan “ socialized medicine ” and its supposed inefficiencies and inequities .
These horror stories are never accompanied by data , just hearsay and anecdotes from “ a friend of a friend ” in Canada or the United Kingdom .
Rarely have I heard from people who have themselves experienced a universal public health care system .
As one of those people , I thought I should speak up .
While living in Finland for three years , I experienced socialized medicine up close and personal .
I gave birth to my son there .
Finland ’s public health care system is run by a government agency called KELA , and the doctors , nurses , dentists , and other health care workers are government employees .
KELA usually covers 100 % of the cost of most services at public clinics , with small copayments for prescriptions and hospital stays that are scaled to a patient ’s income .
Finland also has many private clinics that are available to those who want to use them , where patients pay the extra cost of the private service ( KELA will pay up to what the service would cost at a public clinic ) .
When you visit a clinic or hospital you present your KELA card at the reception desk , and if a payment is necessary you can pay at the clinic , or a bill can be sent to your home .
All Finnish citizens and permanent residents are eligible for KELA benefits , as are immigrants on work and political asylum visas .
I was eligible for the KELA system because I was in Finland on a work visa , and I paid income and social services taxes from my paychecks .
Yes the taxes were high , about 40 % of my gross pay .
However , it is comparable to my take - home pay here in the US once I factor in my health insurance premiums , deductibles , and copayments , along with my income and social security taxes .
The care that I received in Finland throughout my pregnancy and childbirth , and for the first 9 months of my son ’s life , was simply amazing .
I saw the same nurse and doctor for monthly pregnancy checks ( and later they were my son ’s primary medical caregivers ) ; their offices were in the same hallway .
Both women knew us by name and by sight , and always remembered what we had discussed for the previous visit .
Routine ultrasounds were performed at the maternity hospital ; my nurse made each appointment for me and I simply showed up at the hospital for the procedure .
When my labor started I headed to the maternity hospital , and the hospital ’s nurses and doctors knew exactly who I was , as my medical files were available to them through KELA ’s computerized filing system .
( Patients must sign a form that allows their medical files to be accessible by other medical facilities , so a patient ’s privacy rights are protected . )
Every nurse coming on duty reviewed my file before seeing me , and so my discussions with them were focused on what my son and I needed at the moment , not what had been done during the previous shifts .
After my emergency Cesarean operation and a four day stay in the hospital , only one bill was waiting for us when we got home , for a total of 260 Euros .

I never had to wait to see a medical professional , nor was any necessary procedure delayed or denied .
Every nurse and doctor I saw was caring and knowledgeable , and spent whatever time was necessary to make sure that I received the care I needed .
I have now been living and working back in the US for 6 months , and already I have had problems with my health insurance plan through my employer .
I found out the hard way ( that is , at the doctor ’s office after my son ’s vaccination visit ) that my son had been arbitrarily dropped from my plan months before , even though I had been paying the premiums for the family plan all along .
It took almost a week of phone calls to get him reinstated .
All the while , I privately wondered if the two ear infections he had had in the spring had prompted some computer at the health insurance company to calculate that he was “ overusing ” the system , and automatically drop his coverage .
That may seem like paranoid thinking , but I have seen it all before .
In 2001 , my mother was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer .
Instead of focusing her strength and attention on recovering from a double mastectomy , chemotherapy , and radiation , she spent much of her time arguing with the health insurance company and the hospital over bills she had already paid , and routine treatments that should have been covered by her insurance plan .
Ultimately she lost her insurance altogether when she lost her job , and she has since been living in remission , uninsured .
When these pundits and politicians go onto national television and spew all sorts of false rhetoric about the evils of socialized medicine , it makes my blood boil .
They are doing an incredible disservice to their fellow Americans , both those with and without health insurance .
For every anecdote they have about a Canadian waiting six months for necessary open heart surgery , I can find twenty Americans for whom that equally necessary surgery is completely out of reach .
Now is the time for an honest assessment about what ( if anything ) can be salvaged from our current system , and to put a system in place that does what it is supposed to do : provide health care .
From WikiLeaks
August 3 , 2009
By Iris Erlingsdottir ( Huffington Post ) [ 1 ]
Any doubts as to whether Iceland 's elite has declared war on its people were dispelled this weekend .
First , on Friday Björgólfur Guðmundsson filed for bankruptcy .
Guðmundsson made several hundred million dollars in St. Petersburg in an astonishingly short time after being convicted of fraud in Iceland .
He returned to Iceland with his son to amass billion dollar fortunes after some insider deals , creative bookkeeping , and the alleged assistance of the Russian mafia .
Guðmundsson was a major owner of Landsbanki and a major debtor to Kaupthing Bank , two of Iceland 's failed banks .
Strangely , his son's fortune does not appear to have been affected by the economic downturn ; the suspicion is that all of the family 's debts were transferred to the father , and all of the assets to the son .
Next , on Saturday Eva Joly , the French - Norwegian magistrate appointed earlier this year to investigate fraud in connection with Iceland 's " economic miracle , " published an essay in several major European newspapers harshly criticizing the European governments -- Great Britain and the Netherlands in particular - - for insisting that the Icelandic people pay in full for the fraud perpetrated by the country 's financial , business , and political elite .
She noted that the unfairly proposed IceSave agreement , under which the British and Dutch depositors in Landsbanki 's internet savings accounts would receive full compensation from the Icelandic government , would lead to an outflow of talent from Iceland , creating a downward spiral that makes it even more unlikely that the nation will ever recover .
Then , secret documents detailing massive loans to Kaupthing Bank 's biggest shareholders were leaked to WikiLeaks .
Although it was widely understood that the powers - that - be received large loans , the size of the loans was astounding .
Plus , there is something visceral in pairing up the names and the loans .
It is for the sake of these unscrupulous characters that the next generation faces massive deprivation ?!?
Icelandic cartoonist Halldór Baldursson 's take on Van Gogh 's The Potato Eaters : The Fish Eaters : " Hopefully we 'll be able to afford potatoes with the fish when we 're done paying for IceSave . "
The attorneys for New Kaupthing Bank ( now owned by the Icelandic government ) first threatened WikiLeaks with legal action , then successfully obtained from the Reykjavík Magistrate , who is a relative and good friend of Kaupthing insiders , an injunction barring the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service News from revealing the details of these widely - available documents .
Astonishingly , the INBS News complied with this obviously illegal and ineffective order .
These developments are , of course , just the latest in a long series of events in which a small group of individuals have treated the Icelandic people as fools and suckers .
The financiers and businessmen bought the media , the politicians , and everything else of real value .
The professional political class presented the voters with no real choices .
Laws were enacted , agreements were reached , all to the ultimate benefit of a few .
Enough tidbits were doled out to the masses to keep them in line , but no real power ever left the hands of the leading criminals / leaders .
Our recent colonial past ( Iceland was a colony of Denmark until 1944 ) has perhaps left us more passive as a people than any other European nation .
We have no tradition whatsoever of rebellion or revolution .
Iceland 's greatest modern author , Halldór Laxness astutely described our collective national soul in 1933 in his novel The Seven Magicians :
" Few nations are believed to have tolerated oppression and brutality with more affability than Icelanders .
For ages , up to this day , they existed in tolerant passivity with their oppression , without ever making an attempt to revolt .
To no other nation was the revolutionary concept so foreign .
Icelanders were always willing and content to kiss the rod that roughest beat and believe that the most brutal executioner was their sincerest support and safest refuge . "
The so - called " Pot and Pan " revolution this January was the only instance in modern history of Icelanders standing up to their rulers .
Unfortunately , although the ruling coalition resigned and new elections were held , no fundamental changes have been instituted .
Essentially , the same individuals and political parties that for decades have ruled the country have remained in power , the same businessmen run the bankrupt companies , the same financial wizards run the nationalized banks , all guided by the twin philosophies of cronyism and nepotism .
Thomas Jefferson wrote in the American Declaration of Independence that " when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce [ the People ] under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security . "
The government has lost its legitimacy due to its inability to protect the Icelandic people from long - term penury and its unwillingness to swiftly bring the criminals responsible for this travesty to justice .
Only by completely purging the system can we restart .
The stolen assets must be returned now , the responsible parties must be held personally responsible now .
If the government is n't willing to deliver that justice , it 's time to instate a government that is .
I cannot conceive of why the countries defrauded by Icelandic businessmen would help us , as long as these traitors remain at large .
Until we clean our own house , our complaints about the unfairness of being held liable for the transgressions of a few will fall on deaf ears .
Until we stand up for ourselves as a people , we are in no position to beg forgiveness and assistance .
For the first time in our history , we must stand up against our oppressors and reclaim our independence .

Google has joined the list of companies facing criticism over tax avoidance after public accounts showed it paid only £ 600,000 in UK corporation tax despite local revenues of more than £ 1.25 bn .
A review of Google 's British operations suggests the web search engine could have faced taxes of more than £ 100 m in this country , but that it avoided this by channelling revenues through Ireland .
Google 's activities were condemned as unacceptable by politicians amid promises from the prime minister , Gordon Brown , to crack down on tax evasion in this week 's budget .
More than 90 % of Google 's UK revenues are channelled through Ireland , where corporation tax is levied at 12.5 % compared with 28 % in Britain , according to Richard Murphy , an accountant who investigated Google 's British , Irish and American accounts for The Sunday Times .
Murphy suggested that Google had avoided a further € 135 m ( now £ 119 m ) in tax from Ireland during 2007 while the Irish subsidiary was owned by one of two companies Google has set up in the tax haven of Bermuda .
The records suggest several sets of Google 's UK accounts were filed late , with one set of accounts outstanding by more than five months .
" Google seems to be one of a number of companies that are based here , have UK employees and use local services and infrastructure but try to pay their taxes elsewhere when they think they can get away with paying less tax .
The government needs to be much firmer in stopping it , " said Vince Cable , the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats .
" The reality is , the more tax that companies like Google avoid , the more the tax burden falls on the rest of the public .
It is clear that while Labour and the Tories have been embracing Google as the paragon of a 21st - century company , it has been running away from the taxman , " he added .
The US - based internet company said it could not respond to the attacks by British politicians " at this time " nor comment on individual financial figures , but it insisted it had always acted appropriately .
" Google complies fully with the tax requirements in all the countries in which we operate .
In the UK and elsewhere we make a very substantial contribution to local and national taxation .
In addition , we provide employment for hundreds of people in the UK and many more across Europe , " said a company spokesman .
Google has previously been praised as a model of innovation by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic .
In a speech at a Google conference last year , Brown said : " Can I begin by congratulating Google , 10 years ago a research organisation , now a $ 180 bn company , an expert in social innovation ... making great strides in putting services to the people of this country . "
Brown has recently led a crusade against tax havens , saying they should be more transparent in future .
Tax evaders who deprive the exchequer of more than £ 25,000 are to be named and shamed in a crackdown to be unveiled by Alistair Darling in the budget on Wednesday .
The Study
Why Does This Happen
My Thoughts
( OrganicJar ) Drinking beetroot juice boosts stamina and could help people exercise for up to 16 % longer , a UK study suggests .
A University of Exeter team found that the nitrate contained in the vegetable leads to a reduction in oxygen uptake , making exercise less tiring .
The study suggests the effect is greater than that which can be achieved by regular training .
Beetroot juice has previously been shown to reduce blood pressure .
The researchers believe their findings could help people with cardiovascular , respiratory or metabolic diseases and endurance athletes .
They focused on eight men aged 19 - 38 , who were given 500 ml per day of organic beetroot juice for six consecutive days before completing a series of tests , involving cycling on an exercise bike .
On another occasion , they were given a placebo of blackcurrant cordial for six consecutive days before completing the same cycling tests .
After drinking beetroot juice the group was able to cycle for an average of 11.25 minutes - 92 seconds longer than when they were given the placebo .
This would translate into an approximate 2 % reduction in the time taken to cover a set distance .
The group that had consumed the beetroot juice also had lower resting blood pressure .
The researchers are not yet sure of the exact mechanism that causes the nitrate in the beetroot juice to boost stamina .
However , they suspect it could be a result of the nitrate turning into nitric oxide in the body , reducing how much oxygen is burned up by exercise .
Study researcher Professor Andy Jones - an adviser to top UK athlete Paula Radcliffe - said : " We were amazed by the effects of beetroot juice on oxygen uptake because these effects cannot be achieved by any other known means , including training .
" Certainly , a diet high in nitrate - rich fruits and vegetables is good for your heart health and this study provides further evidence of this .
" I love beet juice !!
If you follow me on twitter ( @ OrganicJar ) you know I am always juicing beets .
My favorite recipe : beets , carrots , cucumbers with a splash of coconut water !
Also , do n’t forget to juice the ‘ stem and leaves ’ of the beets as they are full of nutrition , some studies I ’ve read say they are more nutrient dense than the beets themselves .

This is the kind of trolling we can get behind .
Over the past month , a dancing bear has been unexpectedly popping up in the video chatrooms on Stickam , a video chat service that competes with uStream and Justin.tv .
On July 12th , the " dancing bear " , Stickam user Ryan Perera , posted a compilation of his antics to YouTube ( below ) .
The result is unexpectedly hilarious , although we caution that it does contain a few curse words .
Perera writes of his escapades :
My name is Ryan Perera and I had some fun this month raiding random people 's webcam chatrooms on Stickam .
I wanna clear some things up as well ... 1 . I 'm not a Furry ( I made this costume for a college video project ) 2 . I had 150 + different chatroom raids , I 'll post some full segments next week 3 .
I had about 3 hours of footage to sift through :(
The bear is welcome to raid our Mashable chatroom , the Mashable Lounge , any time he likes .
The new head of the Army is warning that Britain 's mission in Afghanistan could last in some form for up to 40 years .
General Sir David Richards , who becomes Chief of the General Staff later this month , said in a newspaper interview : " I believe that the UK will be committed to Afghanistan in some manner - development , governance , security sector reform - for the next 30 to 40 years . "
He also played down the issue of equipment shortages as he prepares to take office , in direct contrast with the man he will be replacing as Chief of the General Staff ( CGS ) , saying he would not be presenting the Government with a " shopping list " of kit .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Current army chief General Sir Richard Dannatt vowed to do just that amid mounting British casualties and controversy over the adequacy of equipment such as armoured trucks and helicopters last month .
In an interview with The Times , General Richards said : " It is impossible to say whether having more equipment of a particular kind would lead to less casualties , and pretty fruitless speculating about it .
" The enemy 's tactics will always reflect , and try to exploit , how we operate - my American comrades first taught me the adage , ' The enemy has a vote ' - and our own tactics must reflect the equipment and troop numbers we have .
" It is a truism to state that the more we have , the more we can do . "
Asked if he would be presenting a " shopping list " for military equipment on his first day in office , the general answered : " I will not . "
But he said the Army and the Government needed to ensure " we continue to respond flexibly and quickly to the evolving requirements of our campaign in Afghanistan . "
The 57 - year - old , who calls himself a " seat - of - the - pants soldier " , was commander of Nato 's International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) in Afghan capital Kabul in 2006 .

That made him the first British officer to command American forces since the Second World War .
He takes over as CGS on August 28 , and he will hold the post for three years .
The general told The Times that " nation - building " in Afghanistan would take time , and that " there is absolutely no chance of Nato pulling out " .
" It is not just reconstruction ; jobs and simple governance that works are key , and there has to be a strong reconciliation element to the latter , " he said .
" The Army 's role will evolve , but the whole process might take as long as 30 to 40 years . "
Gen Richards also said he believed strongly that the mission in the country was " winnable " .
" Demanding , certainly , but winnable , " he said .
" And when people say , ' How can you use the term " win " ? '
I retort , ' Well , I will certainly know if we have lost ' .
" Can you imagine the intoxicating effect on militants if we were defeated ?
Can you be certain there would not be an export of terrorism to the streets of London ?
It 's a risk we should be very wary of taking .
" As I have said many times , everyone involved needs to realise it will take a long time and considerable investment .
We must remember , though , that we are not trying to turn Afghanistan into Switzerland . "
Despite the recent spate of British casualties in the theatre - a record 22 in July and four so far this month - he stressed that morale was high among the troops .
" I 'm in regular contact with our troops in Afghanistan .
Knowing them well , I am not surprised , but their morale is high .
What they want to do is succeed in their mission .
Firstly , because they believe in it .
Secondly , to ensure those who have made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our nation have not done so in vain .
The last thing they want is for us all to go wobbly on them . "
Gen Richards added : " Nor should you think the Taliban are finding it easy .
We know they are not .
We can and are outfighting them . "
John Boehner and Thaddeus McCotter issued a statement last week saying the provision ' may start us down a treacherous path toward government - encouraged euthanasia . '
Will proposal promote euthanasia ?
Sean Hannity believes it .
So does House Minority Leader John Boehner .
Talk show host Fred Thompson calls it “ the dirty little secret ” of the health care reform debate .
The focus of their ire is a provision tucked deep inside the House bill that would provide Medicare coverage for an end - of - life consultation once every five years .
If a person falls ill with a life - threatening disease , more frequent sessions would be allowed .

Republicans are now using this language as a wedge between senior citizens and Democrats .
Boehner and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Thaddeus McCotter ( R - Mich . ) issued a statement last week saying it “ may start us down a treacherous path toward government - encouraged euthanasia ” — even though the concept behind the provision has been embodied in federal law since 1990 and has been promoted by Republicans and Democrats for years .
The House Republican leadership statement capped days of chatter on talk radio and in the blogosphere — serving notice to AARP , Democratic lawmakers and other supporters of the health care reform bill that an under - the - radar distortion , in their view , was building steam .
“ Can you imagine the response of the American people when they find this out ? ”
Thompson said of the provision during an interview July 16 with Betsy McCaughey , a former New York lieutenant governor and conservative health expert who first wrote about it .
She is also behind some of the most scathing — and irresponsible , critics say — assessments of the health reform efforts of President Barack Obama and President Bill Clinton and then - first lady Hillary Clinton in 1993 - 94 .
On Thompson ’s radio show , as well as in a New York Post op - ed and other interviews during the past week , McCaughey has said the provision requires senior citizens to submit to end - of - life consultations .
Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity touted the New York Post article on their shows .
“ Congress would make it mandatory , absolutely require , that every five years , people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner , ” McCaughey said to Thompson .
“ The bill expressly says if you get sick somewhere in that five - year period , you have to go through that session again — all to do what is in society ’s best interest or your family ’s best interest and cut your life short .
These are such sacred issues of life and death .
Government should have nothing to do with it . ”
But proponents of the end - of - life care measure say it does nothing close to what McCaughey , Thompson , Boehner and others assert .
The provision would require Medicare to cover advanced care consultations for the first time , but it does not mandate individuals to take advantage of the benefit , proponents say .
The consultations would take place between the patient and a doctor or nurse practitioner , not a government bureaucrat .
And there would be no requirement for the individual to sign a directive or living will at the end of the discussion .
“ This measure would not only help people make the best decisions for themselves but also better ensure that their wishes are followed , ” AARP Executive Vice President John Rother said in a statement .
“ To suggest otherwise is a gross , and even cruel , distortion — especially for any family that has been forced to make the difficult decisions on care for loved ones approaching the end of their lives . ”
Jon Keyserling , vice president for public policy and counsel at the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization , said : “ I was surprised that any responsible legislative analyst would indicate this is a mandatory provision .
That is just a misreading of the language and , certainly , of the intent . ”
Asked to respond to the criticism of her statements , McCaughey told POLITICO she stands by her interpretation that the consultations are mandatory .
“ In so many words , it is — because although it is presented in the bill as a Medicare service , when a doctor or a nurse approaches an elderly person who is in poor health , facing a decline in health , and raises these issues , it is not offering a service .
It is pressuring them , ” McCaughey said Monday .
“ I would not want that to occur when I am not at my parents ’ bedside . ”
The provision states that as part of an advanced care consultation , an individual and practitioner shall have a consultation that includes “ an explanation by the practitioner of the continuum of end - of - life services and supports available , including palliative care and hospice , and benefits for such services and supports that are available under this title . ”
The government has long encouraged medical providers to discuss such life and death issues with patients .
Congress passed the Patient Self - Determination
Act in 1990 , requiring health care agencies , including hospitals and long - term care facilities to give patients information on state laws regarding advance directives such as a living will .
It also requires those agencies to ask whether patients have an advance directive and to follow what they stipulate , according to the American Cancer Society .
In 2003 , under the Bush administration , the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality issued a 20 - page report outlining a five - part process for physicians to discuss end - of - life care with their patients .
Rep. Earl Blumenauer ( D - Ore. ) teamed up with Rep. Charles Boustany ( R - La. ) , a physician , to introduce a stand - alone bill this year that is replicated in the House health reform bill .
Sen. John Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . ) worked with Sen. Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) on similar language in the Senate , Keyserling said .
Blumenauer went to the House floor Friday to challenge Boehner ’s statement that the provision “ could create a slippery slope for a more permissive environment for euthanasia , mercy - killing and physician - assisted suicide , because it does not clearly exclude counseling about the supposed benefits of killing oneself . ”
“ I can not tell you how disappointed I was to see this type of reaction to a carefully crafted piece of legislation we have been working on for more than six months that is bipartisan and that speaks to the needs of American families , ” Blumenauer said .
“ The American public , especially our senior citizens , deserve our best efforts to meet their needs — not treat them like political footballs . ”
Rick Curtsinger , a Boustany spokesman , said the congressman supports the measure he co-sponsored but he now believes it should include language stating that taxpayer money would not be used to counsel patients on physician - assisted suicide .
But Keyserling said such a stipulation may not be necessary .
“ I ca n’t imagine that you need a prohibition on conversations about assisted suicide when it is not allowed or is illegal in 48 states , ” Keyserling said .
In addition to Oregon and Washington , the Montana Supreme Court is reviewing a lower court ruling from December that said physician - assisted suicide is a right protected under the state constitution .
An earlier version of this story misidentified the person who issued the statement with John Boehner critical of the end - of - life consultation provision .
It was Republican Policy Committee Chairman Thaddeus McCotter ( R - Mich . ) .
San Francisco conceptual artist and journalist Jonathon Keats is trying to rejuvenate literature in the age of hyperspeed media by writing a story that will take a millennium to tell .
The catch ?
The story , printed on the cover of the recently released Infinity issue of Opium Magazine , is only nine words long .
" I 'm interested in exploring deep time , " the thought experimentalist and Wired contributor explained in an e-mail to Wired.com during a visit to Europe , where he is probably concocting a scheme to wormhole Paris or something .
" Like most people , I live my life in a rush , consuming media on the run , " said Keats , who has copyrighted his mind , tried to pass a Law of Identity and attempted to genetically engineer God .
" That may be fine for reading the average blog , " he said , " but something essential is lost when ingesting words is all about speed .
My thousand - year story is an antidote .
Given the printing process I 've used , you can't take in more than one word per century .
That 's even slower than reading Proust . "
The printing process in question is a simple but , as usual with Keats , pretty clever idea .
The cover is printed in a double layer of standard black ink , with an incrementally screened overlay masking the nine words .
Exposed over time to ultraviolet light , the words will be appear at different rates , supposedly one per century .
" The precise quantity of ink covering each word is different , so that the words will appear one at a time , " Keats said .
" Provided that your copy of Opium is kept out in the open , and regularly exposed to sunlight over 1,000 years to be read progressively by the next dozen or so generations .
Or very , very slowly if you happen to be Ray Kurzweil . "
The odds are very good that Keats ' brainy game will outlive print itself , at least as far as magazines are concerned .
But will the pages of Opium last long enough for his story to be told ?
" The high - quality acid - free paper on which Opium is printed will certainly last that long , " Keats answered .
" Whether humankind will , of course , remains an open question . "

" This is our archaeological handbook , " says Chris Wild , brandishing The Condition of the Working - Class in England in 1844 , a muddy , thumbed paperback .
" Engels . "
This , though , is far from being the only contemporary account of late 19th - century living conditions in this part of inner-city Manchester .
In 1870 , the Manchester Guardian – as this paper was then known – published a series of articles on the city 's slums , opening with a scene of 18 adults and several babies squeezed round a single fireplace .
Along with Engels ' account , the newspaper 's archive reports proved influential in the decision to investigate this site .
And , not one to leave an investigation unfinished , the Guardian has today returned to the same streets ( Miller , Dantzic and Angel ) near the city 's Victoria Station .
Soon I 'm kneeling on the ground in an area where Engels described " cattle - sheds for human beings " .
Archaeologists are uncovering some of the worst of these slums , the subdivided cellars where people shared beds or slept in doorways while pigs ate human waste in alleys above .
A collection of rubbish – bottles , a woman 's shoe , broken crockery – lies on the dirt before me .
Little more than a century ago , this part of Manchester , then the powerhouse of the industrial revolution , was as near to hell on earth as you are likely to get in peacetime .
The poor , including thousands who fled the Irish potato famine around 1850 , came here for the work .
Many of them would have had jobs in a large Arkwright mill on the edge of this site .
They suffered industrial injury , cholera , TB and typhus ; consumed adulterated food and contaminated water ; and lived in a maze of wet , filthy , light - deprived rooms and passages .
At the end of Dantzic street was a stone - flagged area that became a playground in the 1880s ( LS Lowry painted it as Britain at Play in 1943 ) .
The stone flags were to stop illegal excavation and sale of the soil for fertiliser : it contained the mass graves of some 40,000 paupers .
By the 1950s the houses had gone , through a combination of slum clearance and wartime bombing .
Today , it 's a car park .
Meanwhile , in 1863 the newly founded Co-operative Society opened its offices a couple of blocks away .
It stayed put , so now a collection of listed buildings , one of them as recent as 1962 , fills 20 acres .
It is , says the Co-op , the largest regeneration site in Manchester .
In 2012 its huge new HQ will rise over the Angel Meadow car park .
Wild , an archaeologist specialising in industrial remains , has taken me and the Co-op 's head of planning and property strategy , Ruairidh Jackson , to a heap of soil and rubble from which a bright orange mechanical excavator scoops at the ground .
Wild works for Oxford Archaeology , an educational charity that assessed the site for the Co-op to support its planning application .
It is now August , and day three of a nine - week excavation .
Even within the profession , industrial archaeology remains a controversial area ; some academics , especially , perhaps , historians , still question the need for digging the remains of such recent times .
" They say we 've got all the information , " says Wild .
" But we 're testing the texts . "
The historic maps , for example , are proving inconsistent .
Wild hopes they will be able to show the actual house plans , and he is convinced his work will reveal details overlooked by contemporary accounts .
We stop at the foot of a ceramic toilet , dating from the late 19th century and cemented into a small , square floor .
Beneath , explains
Wild , lies the earth of an earlier pail closet – just a bucket under a plank .
Broken drains protrude from the side of the trench , and cellar walls made from poor - quality bricks bow under pressure .
These were once homes .
Just one cubic metre of inner-city Manchester would be expected to generate more artefacts than found in a century of excavation at Stonehenge .
" There were more people living in this part of Manchester than in the whole of Britain in the bronze age , " he says .
" This is the archaeology of the masses . "
The thimbles and toys , the bits of clothes and china , have a poignant association with known events , and , potentially , named individuals .
With such objects Jackson anticipates links with Manchester 's People 's History Museum , due to re-open soon with a new extension – and with the Co-op 's own archive .
" I want the younger generation to see this , " says Wild , looking across a row of Victorian lodging - house cellars .
" We should help the rest of the world not to make the mistakes we made . "

The controversial first scheduled Sunday ferry sailing from Stornoway on Lewis to mainland Scotland has gone ahead as planned .
There has been strong opposition on the island , where the Sabbath day has traditionally been strictly observed .
A small group of protesters prayed and sang a psalm as cars boarded the boat , but several hundred people clapped .
Supporters said it would boost the economy of the Hebridean island and offer local people freedom to travel .
A small group of about a dozen protesters gathered in Stornoway ahead of the sailing to Ullapool , which left at 1430 BST .
Equality laws
As cars lined up in the ferry terminal car park , protesters gathered in silence behind a banner .
It read : " Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy " .
They sang Psalm 46 - God is our refuge and our strength - and prayed for the nation to " turn its back from sin and wickedness " .
A number of women wiped away tears as they prayed for a return to the Lord 's commandments .
The crossing was undertaken by the route 's usual ferry , the MV Isle of Lewis , after a fault in the exhaust on Friday was repaired sooner than expected .
A spokesman for ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne said : " We 're pleased to get under way after the difficulties over the last couple of days .
" It 's all gone as planned . "
The MV Isle of Arran was drafted in after the Isle of Lewis broke down .
A small group of protesters gathered ahead of the sailing
The former boat ran a number of emergency crossings to clear the backlog of passengers .
CalMac said it could be breaking equality laws if it did not run ferries seven days a week .
It said religion or beliefs were not valid reasons to refuse to run the ferry .
Supporters of the service said it would be good for tourism .
They said it would offer more flexibility to travellers .
As the ferry left Stornoway a crowd of several hundred gathered to applaud , and wave to those on board .
A leaflet handed out by a group of local churches said that the peace and tranquillity of the islands was enjoyed by residents and visitors alike .
It said : " By and large we like it like this .
" We are not oppressed by a quiet Sunday . "
It wished tourists who came to Lewis by ferry a " happy and blessed trip to the islands " .
Texas billionaire Allen Stanford gives members of the media a thumbs up as he leaves the Bob Casey Federal courthouse in the custody of U.S. Marshals in Houston June 29 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Steve Campbell
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. politicians have returned $ 87,800 in donations from accused swindler Allen Stanford so far , according to the receiver trying to recover assets for the Texas financier ’s investors .
When Stanford , 59 , was first charged in February with running a Ponzi scheme out of his offshore bank in Antigua , several lawmakers including President Barack Obama said they would donate to charity the contributions they had received from Stanford .
Ralph Janvey , the Dallas - based receiver in the case , had urged politicians to give the money back so it could be returned to Stanford investors .
Some are doing that .
Among the cash returned include $ 8,000 from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , $ 27,500 from Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd and $ 14,000 from Richard Shelby , the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , Janvey ’s said on his website .
Over the past decade , Stanford ’s firm , Stanford Financial Group , spent $ 4.8 million in lobbying Washington politicians , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks money and politics in Washington .
Stanford , his political action committee , employees and members of their families also made $ 2.4 million in campaign contributions to federal candidates since 2000 , the center said .
Stanford , who also faces criminal charges , has been in jail since June awaiting trail .
He has denied any wrongdoing .
The list of returned political donations can be found on Janvey 's websitehere .

Adam Bender , the Child Baseball Star with One Leg
8 - year - old Adam Bender lost his leg to cancer as a baby , but his disability has n't stopped him from becoming a star player in baseball and several other sports .
As far as most kids are concerned , playing baseball for a local Little League team is just a bit of summer fun .
But for 8 - year - old Adam Bender of Lexington , Kentucky , baseball is n’t just a game .
Adam lost his left leg to cancer at the age of one , and now hops around without a prosthetic limb .
Baseball and other sports provide the young boy with the opportunity to show everyone else what he ’s capable of in spite of his disability — which , as it turns out , is far more than anyone would have guessed .
When Adam told his parents he wanted to play baseball , they were n’t sure if it was a good idea .
They feared that their son would be teased and mocked over his missing leg , and that he would n’t be able to hit the ball or run from base to base .
“ I thought his spirit might be crushed if he got out every time , ” his mother , Michelle Bender , told the Lexington Herald - Leader .
“ Then I thought , who am I to micromanage his feelings ?
He ’s going to have to learn how to deal with this stuff . ”
Although Adam ’s had some minor mishaps on the baseball diamond , he ’s become extremely adept as a catcher on the field .
He ’s also a pro at getting around the bases after hitting the ball , hopping over to first base before using his crutches to run around the rest of the diamond .
While that sounds challenging enough , Adam is n’t content to sit out the rest of the seasons .
Last fall , he participated in flag football at his YMCA , and quickly became one of the team ’s star players .
“ We put him at quarterback ( using no crutches ) and used a shotgun snap , ” said his football coach , Bruce Rector .
“ He threw a lot of touchdown passes . ”
He also plays soccer for a local kids ’ team , using crutches when it comes time to kick the ball .
Although Adam will never be the fastest player in any sport , he ’s always a valuable asset to his teammates .
“ Adam has helped other kids see that a person with a disability can be fun to hang out with , and play with , and they can still be a part of a community or part of a team .
It ’s developed the kids ’ compassion , ” said Michelle Bender .
“ And if he can inspire even one family to allow their kid to try something they normally might not try , that ’s great . ”

The second wave of the world economic depression is coming soon .
Larry Summers , the economics czar of the Wall Street puppet regime currently in power in Washington , recently confessed to thein an unguarded moment : “ I do n’t think the worst is over …. ”
A few weeks earlier , Jacques Attali , who served in the 1980s as the main economics adviser to French President Mitterrand , told an audience at the International Economic and Financial Forum ( FIEF ) in Paris that the world might well soon face a planetary Weimar “ in the form of a hyperinflationary depression similar to the German events of 1922 - 1923 .
During the last world economic depression , the first wave came in the form of the famous New York Stock market crash of October 1929 .
But this was only the beginning , and hardly the main event .
The world depression of the 1930s was made irreversible by the British bankruptcy of September 1931 , when the Bank of England ceased gold payment .
At that time , the vast majority of international trade was financed by pounds sterling bills of exchange drawn on London .
When the British Pound began to float through a series of competitive devaluations , the lack of a stable reserve currency — and not the US Hawley - Smoot tariff — strangled world trade , thus making that depression as severe as it was .
British default in turn undermined the US banking system , setting the stage for the banking panic which ravaged the United States in 1932 and 1933 , to the point that not a single bank in the country was still operating by the time Franklin D. Roosevelt assumed the presidency in March of 1933 .
The United States would almost certainly have been lashed by additional waves of depression had it not been for the banking triage implemented by the Roosevelt administration during the bank holiday , and for other New Deal measures which succeeded in mitigating the Depression .
Other countries , notably Germany , went into a permanent depression which was expressed in a series of military campaigns which aimed at the economic looting of the other countries of Europe .
Whatever the ideological fanatics of the discredited Austria and Chicago schools of economic analysis may claim , there is no automatic business cycle capable of lifting the modern world out of serious economic disintegration .
The depression will end when adequate New Deal style policies are implemented , and not before , as I show in my new book , the second edition of Surviving the Cataclysm .
Today , therefore , we are , so to speak , in the trough between the October 1929 wave ( which corresponds to the derivatives crisis and banking panic of 2008 ) and the September 1931 wave , which this time around is highly likely to take the form of a hyperinflationary dollar crisis , or in other words a hyper stagflation and depression of the world economy radiating out from Wall Street and the City of London .
What then might be the leading characteristics of the next wave of the current world economic breakdown crisis ?
The next wave is likely to involve a worldwide dollar panic .
Using ballpark figures , we can say that there are about $ 4 to $ 5 trillion sloshing around the world in the form of hot money , US Treasury securities , Euro dollars , and various forms of zeno - dollars .
Japan has about a trillion , China almost $ 2 trillion , and so forth .
It is naturally very unwise for a developing country like China to hold so many dollars rather than using them to purchase needed infrastructure and capital goods , and the Chinese leaders are now very uncomfortable with their own foolish decision , which was of course taken under heavy US pressure .
But the point is that this $ 4.5 trillion overhang is by its very nature exceedingly unstable .
Every country that holds large sums of dollars or US Treasury bonds is nervously eyeing every other such country to see if they show signs of bolting for the exit .
Up to now , so far as we know , no large holder of dollars has attempted to reduce its exposure to the battered greenback by dumping these dollars on the international market .
If anyone did so , it would cause a true universal financial panic which would create chaos and mayhem not just in the United States and Great Britain , but in the vast areas of the rest of the world as well .
This is concretely how hyperinflation could now very well arise : if one or more US creditor nations attempts to abruptly lighten up on dollars , the value of the US currency could undergo a catastrophic collapse , and that would spell runaway hyperinflation on the US domestic front .
We need to recall that the value of a modern currency is not determined inside the country , but rather on the international foreign exchange markets .
This is where the fatal vulnerability of the US dollar is located .
In the ruined form of the Bretton Woods system which has prevailed for almost 40 years since Nixon ‘s colossal historical vandalism of August 15 , 1971 , the US has emerged as the only country with a permanent license to finance imports by simply printing more of its own currency and sending those banknotes overseas .
Every other country has to manufacture and export something that others want to buy in order to earn the necessary foreign exchange to pay for its own imports .
The US license to print has made this country the buyer of last resort and the dumping ground for the unsold junk of the world , leading in the process to high permanent unemployment here .
There are many signs that this inherently unworkable arrangement has now reached the breaking point .
Ms. Ellen Brown , who apparently supports the doctrines of the social credit movement of the 1930s , has recently argued that deflation is now on the agenda , and that hyperinflation can be ruled out .
She bases this analysis on the fact that the private credit markets in this country have largely collapsed , and on the contention that the M1 and M2 money parameters have either declined or increased only slightly .
But all of this is beside the point .
The Federal Reserve and the Treasury have so far provided almost $ 13 trillion of new loans to banks , insurance companies , credit card companies , and other purely financial institutions .
This is being done in an effort to bailout the $ 1.5 quadrillion world derivatives bubble , of which something like two - thirds or more , meaning one quadrillion dollars , can be located inside the dollar zone .
The world depression started when this derivatives bubble went into reverse leverage , meaning that super losses instead of super profits were generated at the apex of the speculative pyramid , as seen in the case of the $ 3 trillion AIG hedge fund located in London .
The Obama regime is engaged in an hysterical attempt to restart derivatives production in the form of securitization , i.e. the creation of more and better asset backed securities derivatives .
At the same time , the Obama regime has cynically and deliberately driven the Detroit automakers into bankruptcy , destroying hundreds of thousands of the few remaining industrial jobs here in the United States .
This means that US industrial production continues in drastic decline .
The mere mention of production reminds us that the assorted Austrian , Chicago , and social credit schools are predominantly or exclusively concerned with money and banking , and pay little or no attention to industrial , agricultural , and infrastructural production , meaning of course that they neglect the creation of those tangible physical use values , capital goods , and related forms of real wealth upon which human existence depends .
With bailouts increasing and all forms of commodity production declining , we have the classic situation of far too much money chasing too few goods .
Internal pressure towards hyperinflation comes from the fact that the bailout and public debt lending , on top of the bloated , fictitious , and exponentially growing mass of kited derivatives , are all charges which must be added to the prices of commodity production .
Add this to the more important factor of looming dollar panic in the international exchanges , and the preponderance of the evidence points towards hyperinflation .
“ Helicopter Ben “ Bernanke got his name from his famous recipe of throwing bales of dollars out of helicopters onto the lawns of bankers to stimulate the economy out of a depression , and this reminds us that the profile of the Anglo - American financial leadership from Gordon Brown , Alistair Darling , and Mervyn King to Summers , Geithner , and Bernanke is decidedly hyperinflationary .
Ms. Brown ’s belief that hyperinflation is impossible is therefore mistaken .
The German 1923 hyperinflation was generated internationally , not within Germany , as a campaign of economic warfare by Britain and France against their defeated rival .
Germany had signed the Rapallo agreements with Soviet Russia , creating an economic combination which was more than a match for the Anglo - French .
To abort the potential of Rapallo by creating chaos in the German economy , the Anglo - French systematically destroyed the value of the German Reichsmark on the international exchanges , taking advantage of the Versailles reparations system and the French occupation of the industrialized Ruhr area .
The mark went down every day when the London exchange rate was announced .
Today , it is the enormous international dollar overhang which threatens to annihilate the US greenback .
The one way deflation might actually come about is if someone like the self - professed Austrian school ideologue Ron Paul were to take power .
Ron Pauls “ libertarianism “ alternative to Obama ‘s continued bailouts of Wall Street is evidently an immediate deflationary crash , which he asserts will be followed by an automatic recovery .
Ron Paul is a modern representative of the so - called liquidationist school to which 1920s Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon belonged .
Mellon demanded the liquidation of stocks , bonds , real estate , and labor .
German Chancellor Heinrich Brüning , another liquidationist , savagely cut German unemployment benefits ( Ron Paul ’s “ nanny state “ ) at the height of the Depression , helping to bring on the debacle of January 1933 .
Liquidationists tend to be people who have money and who believe they will continue to have money even after an all - out crash , when they will be able to buy up distressed assets and desperate unemployed workers for rock - bottom prices and cash in .
But liquidationism obviously cannot be a solution to depression of the entire society .
The recent meetings of the leaders of the expanded G - 8 countries in L’Aquila , Italy were marked by a growing awareness that the US dollar , because of the criminally irresponsible policies of the Wall Street financiers who have dominated the Bush and Obama administrations , can no longer play the role of the single world reserve currency .
Russian President Medvedev showed off a sort of future world coin to try to prod the Obama regime in the direction of serious world monetary reform , which is of course the urgent task before everyone .
Naturally , finance oligarchs like Summers , Geithner , and Bernanke want to continue to play the role of world currency dictators , and not be forced to negotiate the end of Anglo - American hegemonism .
The world needs to go toward a new pro-growth world monetary system in which the euro , the yen , the dollar , the ruble , the Chinese yuan , a possible Latin American monetary unit , and a possible Arab monetary unit would all be included .
It will be important to make the transition toward such a new system as orderly as possible , since a catastrophic collapse of the dollar in the short term would be to no one ‘s advantage , and would rather represent a sure path to universal ruin .
World economic growth rates under the 1944 to 1971 Bretton Woods system were the highest in recorded history before or since .
This was accomplished through statism and dirigism in the form of narrow bands of isolation among the currencies , combined with gold settlements of surpluses and deficits among the nations , which provided an indispensable reality principle to restrain the hyperinflationary tendencies of the Anglo - Americans .
The new world monetary system should include the abolition of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in their current forms , since these institutions have strangled the economic progress of the developing sector .
Rather , the goal of the new monetary system should be to restart the export of high technology capital goods of the most modern type from Europe , Japan , and the United States toward the impoverished countries of Africa , South Asia , and certain parts of Latin America .
Here in the United States , we need to wipe out the derivatives bubble with the help of a 1 % Tobin tax or securities transfer tax , on all speculative financial transactions , including futures , options , stocks , bonds , commodities , foreign exchange , and so forth .
A California Tobin tax would solve the state budget crisis .
The top 16 Wall Street banks are zombie institutions that need to be seized and liquidated under Chapter 7 bankruptcy at once , with all of their derivatives going into the shredder .
Foreclosures on homes , farms , and businesses should be banned outright for five years or for the duration of the depression , which ever lasts longer .
To provide a credit supply , the Federal Reserve should be seized and nationalized , and used as a vehicle to issue 0 % Federal credit for productive activities only , not for speculation .
To revive credit demand , state and local governments could then take out 0 % Federal loans for such long overdue projects as the construction of 1,000 hospitals , the building of 50,000 miles of modern maglev rail systems , and 100 fourth - generation , high temperature , pebble bed nuclear reactors , plus the rebuilding of water systems and the interstate highway network .
Idled auto plants should be reconverted for these purposes .
Science drivers in the fields of space exploration and colonization , high energy physics , and biomedical research should also be fully funded in this way to provide technological modernization .
The social safety net needs to be expanded and developed , with larger Social Security pensions for a generation whose 401 ( k ) s and IRAs have been largely destroyed , along with increased Medicare and Medicaid benefits for those whose insurance companies are insolvent , like AIG and The Hartford , which have been devastated by derivatives speculation .
These are quite simply the requirements for the maintenance of human civilization in this part of the world .
Until measures like these are carried out , the United States and the world will continue to sink deeper into the bottomless pit of economic depression .

Evolution of the Unhealthy American , Part 3 : A comprehensive solution
Furci Home / Fitness Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
All calories are not created equal , as discussed in Part II of this series .
Most dieticians , nutritionists and doctors will disagree .
If a calorie is a calorie , why does n't the percent of increased caloric intake match the percent of increase in overweight or obese individuals ?
The calorie consumption in men and women has increased 7 percent and 9 percent respectively , since the ‘ 70s .
The increase in the percentage of individuals who are overweight or obese has increased almost 20 percent in each category .
And remember , this increase literally occurred in less than 30 years , which is less than a generation .
Why such a discrepancy between calories consumed and weight gained ?
Because there 's more to this epidemic than the amount of calories people are consuming .
The problem we Americans face is that most of the foods we eat are not only lacking any nutritional value , they are made with ingredients that can have serious health consequences .
So let 's get right down to business .
You want to get healthier and leaner ?
The following are some of the worst foods and ingredients we consume , and we need to stay away from them ( listed in no particular order ) .
When it comes to the following , there is no moderation .
If these foods are eaten regularly -- you will pay the price .
Fructose
Sources :
This garbage is found in everything from soda to cereal .
It 's literally in thousands of products .
Read your labels .
The " fat carb " has been in our food supply for more than 35 years .
We 've been led to believe that fructose from high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) is akin to naturally occurring sugar , the same that 's found in fruit .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
The fructose from HFCS is not the same as the molecule from sucrose ( table sugar ) , or fruit leveulose ( 1 ) .
Is it any wonder they have worked so hard to link HFCS to something natural and healthy like fruit ?
The problem is our bodies metabolize HFCS differently than sucrose ( table sugar ) or fruit leveulose .
When we consume sucrose , our bodies convert it into glucose , which raises our blood glucose levels .
We then get an insulin spike to shuttle the glucose where it 's needed .
When we consume HFCS , unlike natural sugar , it is metabolized in the liver and produces high triglyceride levels , which are linked to heart disease .
In addition , HFCS does not induce insulin secretion , nor does it boost leptin production , both of which are key signals for decreasing hunger .
Hence , the name " fat carb . "
Eat it , get fat ; eat more , get fatter .
Russ Bianchi , a pharmacologist and toxicologist , explains : " there is no safe form of fructose available from any source , unless already existing in an unprocessed apple or other piece of fruit .
The science is known and epidemiologically proven " ( 2 ) .
If you follow the obesity epidemic in the U.S. , you 'll find that Americans are eating less fat .
In 1965 men ate an average of 139 grams and women 83 grams of fat per day .
In 1995 men ate 101 grams and women ate 65 grams of fat per day ( 3 ) .
With the way fat has been demonized over the last four decades , you 'd expect an increase in fat consumption to be the main cause of the obesity epidemic , yet it 's not .
What does mirror the increase in fat Americans is the consumption pattern of HFCS .
Between the years of 1970 and 1990 , HFCS consumption increased 1,000 percent , and today represents 40 percent of the sweeteners added to foods and beverages .
It is the sole caloric sweetener in soft drinks in the United States .
Is it any wonder why obesity is an epidemic ?
One of the main ingredients in our food supply not only converts to fat when we consume it , it facilitates fat storage .
And Americans as a whole are eating more and more and more .
Polyunsaturated fats
Sources : Corn oil , soy oil , safflower oil , sunflower oil , cotton seed oil , walnuts , flax oil , hemp oil , herring , salmon , sardines and mackerel .
Technically called lipids , fats and oils are made up of many different types of fatty acids .
Fatty acids are the same whether they come from plants or animals .
Oleic acid that is found in olive oil is exactly the same as the oleic acid found in lard ( pig fat ) .
It 's the proportions of fatty acids that will vary from plant to plant , from animal to animal , and from plant to animal .
Safflower , corn , sunflower , soybean and cottonseed oils all contain more than 50 percent of the highly unstable fatty acid Omega – 6 and should never be used in cooking , frying or baking .
Heating these oils causes oxidation and produces large amounts of free radicals .
We have been , and are still , being force - fed a load of crap concerning the virtues of polyunsaturated fats .
We 've been told relentlessly that polyunsaturated fats are good for our health and to increase our consumption .
Unfortunately , polyunsaturated fats cause many health problems .
One of the biggest reasons polyunsaturated fats are so unhealthy is that they are very susceptible to becoming oxidized , or rancid , when exposed to heat and light .
The polyunsaturated oils you buy in grocery stores are already rancid .
The extraction process is the problem :
Throughout the entire process these oils are exposed to oxygen .
The oil is extracted with mechanical pressing and heated to 230 degrees .
A chemical solvent is used to get what oils is left .
The solvent is then boiled off , again exposing the oils to heat .
Because these oils become rancid , they are treated with deodorizers to get rid of the horrible smell .
Finally , most oils are then bleached to give them " eye appeal . "
Americans love the light golden color .
Now , you go to the store to purchase soy , canola oil , or a host of other vegetable oils , which have been touted as healthy , not knowing that you 're actually purchasing a free radical cocktail that , over time , causes serious health problems .
Free radicals , or " chemical marauders " as some scientists refer to them , wreak havoc on our bodies .
They have been linked to problems ranging from wrinkles to premature aging to cancer .
Trans Fats
Sources :
Any foods containing " shortening , " " partially hydrogenated vegetable oil " or " hydrogenated vegetable oil " in the ingredients list .
These manmade fats , like fructose , are in thousands of products .
I cannot stress enough the importance of reading food labels .
However , do not be fooled by products that claim " zero trans fat . "
Showing the power of the edible oil and processed food industries , the FDA agreed to allow food labels to list trans fats as " zero " if it contains a half a gram or less .
And yes , small amounts of trans fats will yield negative consequences over time .
Decades of research show the consumption of trans fats to be detrimental to health .
As early as the 1940s , researchers found a strong correlation between cancer , heart disease and the consumption of hydrogenated fats ( 4 ) .
What are trans fats ?
They are poison in our food supply .
" The latest government study confirms that trans fat is directly related with heart disease and increases LDL cholesterol .
Because of that , the Institute of Medicine , a branch of the National Academy of Sciences , declared there is no safe amount of trans fat in the diet " ( 5 ) .
" There should be a warning on food made with this stuff like there is on nicotine products .
It 's that bad for you , says Dr. Jeffery Aron , a University of California at San Francisco professor of medicine and one of the nation 's leading experts on fatty acids and their effect on the body ( 6 ) .
Poison is the most appropriate description of trans fat I can think of .
These manmade fats are literally toxins in our bodies .
Trans fat is produced through the process of hydrogenation .
This process turns polyunsaturated oils into fats that are solid at room temperature , which are used to make products like margarine and shortening .
Soda Pop
I know to many this is an obvious choice when discussing what to eliminate from your diet .
However , it has had such a profound effect on the ill health of this country it needs to be mentioned .
As stated earlier , fructose is the sole sweetener of soft drinks in this country .
Children and adolescents in the U.S. are increasingly choosing soft drinks rather than milk or juice .
The USDA 's Economic Research Service found that the consumption of soft drinks increases as a child becomes older .
On average , for every one - ounce reduction in milk consumption , a child consumes 4.2 ounces of soft drinks ( 7 ) .
Just what a growing child needs .
Between the years 1970 and 2001 , per capita consumption of carbonated soft drinks more than doubled .
By 2001 per capita milk consumption had dropped to 22 gallons , while soft drink consumption soared to 49 gallons ( 8 ) .
Should we be worried about this shift in drink consumption ?
You bet .
One can of soda has 10 teaspoons of sugar , in the form of manmade fructose .
And if this was n't bad enough , soft drinks also contain high levels of phosphates .
These higher phosphate levels have been alleged to cause osteoporosis in adults , and impaired the calcification of the growing bones of children .
" Soft drinks have long been suspected of leading to lower calcium levels and higher phosphate levels in the blood .
When phosphate levels are high and calcium levels are low , calcium is pulled out of the bones .
The phosphate content of soft drinks like Coca - Cola and Pepsi is very high and they contain virtually no calcium " ( 9 ) .
They contain no nutritive value what - so - ever .
Soy
We have been led to believe that soy is a health food .
However , contained in the United States Food and Drug Administrations Poisonous Plant Database , which contains references to the scientific literature describing studies of the toxic properties and effects of plants and plant parts , under soy there are 288 records ( 10 ) .
The deleterious effects soy has on our bodies are caused by several different substances ; we 're going to go over just a few .
One of the substances contained in soybeans is goitrogens .
These are naturally occurring and interfere with the function of the thyroid gland .
Goitrogens get their name from the term " goiter , " which means enlargement of the thyroid gland ( 11 ) .
Other foods that contain goitrgens include : broccoli , cabbage , mustard , peanuts , turnips , brussel sprouts and others .
However , unlike soy , the goitrogens in these foods are easily neutralized by cooking or fermentation .
Heat , pressure or alkaline solutions will neither deactivate nor remove goitrogens from soy ( 12 ) .
They are virtually in all soy foods , with the highest concentration being in products that are not fermented like tofu and soy sauce .
Another nasty class of substance in soy that can inflict damage upon your body are called phytoestrogens .
Isoflavones are examples of phytoestrogens , and are in many plants , with the highest concentration being in soy beans .
Phytoestrgens , although not hormones , are very similar and can bind to estrogen receptor sites and have been shown to cause negative effects .
The ability of phytoestrogens to decrease testosterone has been shown in several studies ( 13 - 15 ) .
In fact , as long ago as 164 B.C. , monks included tofu in their diet as an aid to spiritual enlightenment and abstinence .
They found the more tofu they consumed the lower their libido .
The following is a list of myths and truths about soy , taken from westonaprice.org .
Myth : Asians consume large amounts of soy foods .
Fact : Average consumption of soy foods in Japan and China is about 10 grams ( about 2 teaspoons ) per day .
Asians consume soy foods in small amounts as a condiment , and not as a replacement for animal foods .
Myth : Soy foods provide complete protein .
Fact :
Like all legumes , soy beans are deficient in the sulfur - containing amino acids methionine and cystine .
In addition , the extreme processing used to make soy edible denatures fragile amino acids like lysine .
Myth : Fermented soy foods can provide vitamin B12 in vegetarian diets .
Fact :
The compound that resembles vitamin B12 in soy is an analog and cannot be used by the human body ; in fact , soy foods cause the body to require more B12 .
Myth : Soy estrogens ( isoflavones ) are good for you .
Fact :
Soy isoflavones are phyto - endocrine disrupters .
At dietary levels , they can prevent ovulation and stimulate the growth of cancer cells .
Eating as little as 30 grams ( about 4 tablespoons ) of soy per day can result in hypothyroidism with symptoms of lethargy , constipation , weight gain and fatigue .
Myth : Soy isoflavones and soy protein isolate have GRAS ( Generally Recognized as Safe ) status .
Truth : Archer Daniels Midland ( ADM ) recently withdrew its application to the FDA for GRAS status for soy isoflavones following an outpouring of protest from the scientific community .
The FDA never approved GRAS status for soy protein isolate because of concern regarding the presence of toxins and carcinogens in processed soy .
Nutritional Principles
Avoiding the above substances is a big step toward becoming healthy and lean , and will make a huge difference .
However , this is just the first step .
You also need to eat correctly .
The following is a list of principles that are essential , not only for those looking to get into better shape , but for serious athletes looking to get an edge .
Prepare your food in advance .
This is perhaps the single biggest contributor to consistent healthy eating .
You 're less likely to fall off the wagon if there is quality food already made .
People are just inherently lazy .
To combat this , always have an array of food that is ready to eat .
Foods like chicken , beef , cottage cheese , hard boiled eggs , salads , sliced veggies , etc. , should always be in your fridge .
Avoid processed foods .
Does this really need an explanation ?
If it does , you 're a moron .
These foods are void of any nutritive value and contain ingredients that should be avoided at all costs .
Do not starve yourself .
When you go without eating for too long , you 're setting yourself up for failure .
The hungrier you are , the more you tend to cheat .
Eat when you 're hungry , and stop when you 're full .
Eat at least four meals per day .
Your goal should be to eat six times per day , once every 2 to 3 hours .
Make sure to eat a portion of protein with every meal .
A portion of protein is 4 to 8 ounces .
Or a portion ( of meat ) is about the size of the palm of your hand or a clenched fist .
If your meal consists of a starchy carb , always consume a bit of your protein first .
This ensures a lower glycemic index for the meal , and will curb eating too many carbs .
Choose carbohydrates that are on the lower end of the glycemic index .
Whenever time is of the essence , use meal replacement packs , protein powders and drinks .
This takes the guesswork out of meal planning during a busy day .
Use natural unprocessed fats and oils that are labeled " cold pressed , " " expeller pressed , " or " extra virgin " for cooking and salad dressings .
Avoid the use of , or strictly limit your consumption of , polyunsaturated fats ( vegetable oils ) and never cook with them .
Use peanut oil , sesame oil or olive oil for cooking if you do not want to use animal fats .
These oils can also be used for one - time frying .
Coconut and palm oil are best for frying and cooking because they 're stable and have strong anti-microbial properties .
Use butter , not margarine , and never use fat - free spreads .
Supplement your diet with vitamins and other nutrients : A , D , E and C , CoQ10 , fish oil ( omega - 3 ) , selenium .
Make it a family affair .
Do n't feed your children a low fat diet and stop letting them eat fast food .
Think of their health , not your convenience .
If they 're fat , it 's because they 're mirroring you -- sitting on your ass and eating too much junk .
Once per week eat whatever you want .
However , avoid foods that contain trans fats , soy products and fructose .
At least keep them to a minimum .
Use the following lists to help you make healthy choices :
Approved foods list
Banned foods list
It 's up to you .
You must decide if getting lean and healthy is something you truly want , and whether or not you are willing to make a firm commitment to yourself .
Achieving goals does n't happen overnight .
You have to be patient and put in your time .
The more time you put in and the harder you work , the more in tune with your body you become .
The more in tune with your body you become , the more progress you 'll make .
The more progress you make , the more motivated you 'll be .
The more motivated you become , the longer and harder you 'll work .
Soon it will become second nature and a part of your lifestyle .
Make no mistake , it 's not easy .
There is no magic diet and certainly no magic pill .
There is no special herb or chemical to make this an easy task .
Anyone who says that a product can make it simple and easy is full of it .
If it were easy , everyone would be lean and healthy .
The most difficult part will be having the mental determination to keep pressing forward over the long haul .
Making a change is always easy in the beginning because it 's new , and the motivation is high , but this is short term .
You must become self - determined and motivated .
Consistency is the name of the game .
The greatest impediment to your goal is the mind .
Your body , if the mind leads it , will do whatever you ask of it .
Staying focused and determined is essential , and impossible without the right mental attitude .
It is astonishing in any endeavor , what one can accomplish when a strong , positive mind is guiding it .
Good luck .

How to Install Debian From Scratch
How to Install Debian From Scratch
Introduction
Debian From Scratch ( DFS ) is a unique distribution that allows you to install a Debian system with almost the same level of control as what you would get with a Linux From Scratch installation but with the Debian advantages ( easy to update and maintain ) .
Installing DFS enables you to really understand how the linux installation process works and allows you to control what is installed where in the new system .
This level of control makes it really suited for servers because there is no unwanted service installed on the system which makes it easier to harden the system .
I decided to try DFS after reading about it in an article by Bruce Byfield in Newsforge .
This article is an expansion of the original article ' cause even though I managed to install DFS by following the directions in the article I had to jump through a few hoops to get it fully working .
So
In this article I am trying to document what I did so that others can benefit from my experience and hopefully have an easier time installing DFS than I did .

Credits
In this section I have the pleasure of acknowledging the following people without whose input this would have never seen the light of the day :
John Goerzen for creating the DFS project and writing a brief installation guide
Bruce Byfield for writing about DFS and introducing me to it via his article
Matt Hoskins and Kevin Walsh , for getting me interested in linux in the first place .
My friends and family , for bearing with me when I was compiling this document
Downloading DFS
Debian From Scratch ( DFS ) is available for download from John Goerzen 's website as a 401 MB ISO image for the i386 platform or a 338 MB ISO image for the Alpha platform .
At the time of this article the latest version for the i386 platform is dfs-0.6.19
Download the appropriate ISO from the site above and burn it to a CD using an appropriate CD burning software .
Check out this article on how to burn ISO images using Nero Express in case you havn't done this before .
You should also check out this site for instructions on how to burn iso images using various programs on Linux and Windows platforms .
Pre-Installation Steps
Before we start the installation of DFS we need to do a little bit of reconnaissance on your system to get the required information on your hardware and network setup .
Having this information handy will make life a lot easier for us when we are installing DFS .
First thing we need to do is find out the details on all the hardware installed on the system we are installing DFS on .
In the beginning you can leave out the more fancy equipment like soundcard , TV tuner card etc and just concentrate on the hardware you need to get the system up and running , this includes : the video card , Network card , USB devices ( Keyboard , mouse ) etc .
You might also want to note down details on your monitor including the scan rate and the max screen resolution supported etc .
Now that you have collected the information on your hardware , we need some basic information on your network setup also .
This step is not required if you do n't have a network and are not going to be installing any updates using apt - get from the Debian mirror's .
If your network has a dhcp server then all you need to note down is the DHCP server 's IP address and you are set .
On the other hand if you do n't have a DHCP server on the network or if you are planning on giving a static IP to the new box you need to find out what your Gateway IP , Subnet mask and DNS server IP 's are .
If you have an existing linux server on the same network you can get this information from the /etc / resolv.conf file and the /etc / network / interfaces file .
Once we have the network information we need to decide what mirror we will be using to download packages from when we use apt - get to install new software .
Debian 's server mirror list has a listing of all the debian mirrors world wide .
You can either choose a mirror from this list or copy the /etc / apt / sources .
list file from an existing debian installation .
Once you have collected this information we can proceed with the DFS installation .
Starting the DFS install
Starting the DFS install is pretty easy , all you have to do is insert the CD you created from the ISO image in your CD - ROM and tell your computer to boot from it .
If your computer does n't boot from the CD - ROM when your restart it , you may need to change your boot sequence in the BIOS to let the computer boot from the CD - ROM first .
Check out this site for instructions on how to change the boot order on your computer .
You could also contact your local sysadmin to walk you through this process .
Keep in mind that you should always carry some peace offering for the sysadmin before you bother them to prevent them from turning into the BOFH . :)
Once you have configured your system to boot from the CD - ROM and managed to get the system to boot from the CD - ROM you will see a menu where you can choose the kernel you want to use in the new system .
I choose 2.6.11 but you can choose whatever version you like and press enter ( see Figure 1.1 ) .
Once you make a selection you will see the normal linux boot messages scroll by on the screen .
Figure 1.0 Grub Boot screen for DFS
Once the boot process is completed you will be prompted for a username , enter ' root ' ( Without the quotes ) as the username and press enter , if you are prompted for a password just hit enter .
This will log you in as the root user
Figure 1.1 Login prompt for DFS
Once we are logged in , we need to make sure that all our devices have been properly detected by DFS ( esp the USB devices ) .
First we perform a general hardware detection by running the following command :
invoke - rc.d discover start
and then we run the following command to detect the USB devices present on the system .
invoke - rc.d hotplug start
Keep in mind that you will probably see some error messages stating that the USB modules are already loaded but thats ok .
This step was taken just to make sure that we did n't miss anything while discovering hardware in the previous step .
Enable Ethernet
This step is only needed if you have a network card and are going to use it .
If you have a dhcp server running on your LAN all you need to do is run the following command and your network connection will be activated :
ifup eth0
If you are not using a DHCP server or are planning to give the new system a static IP you need to edit the /etc / networking / interfaces file and add the following lines to it :
iface eth0 inet static address 192.168.0.4 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.0.1
Replace the IP's in the above example with the correct values for your network ( You should have collected this information for Step 3.0 above )
You also need to edit the /etc / resolv.conf file and add the following line to it :
nameserver 192.168.0.1
Make sure you replace the IP address in the example above to the correct one for your network .
Now save the changes and activate the network by running the following command :
ifup eth0
Run / sbin / ifconfig to make sure that the network card came up properly .
If everything looks ok we can proceed to the next step of the installation process
Partitioning , formating and mounting the hard drive
The next step we have to do is partition the drive for Linux .
DFS includes both fdisk and cfdisk for this process .
cfdisk is a lot simpler than fdisk so we will be using it to partition the drive .
If you decide to use fdisk instead and need help check out this site for help .
To start cfdisk run the following command :
cfdisk / dev/hdx
Where / dev/hdx is the drive you are parititioning .
Check out this article if you are feeling lost for more information on Linux device naming conventions .
So if you are partitioning hda ( The master drive on IDE0 ) we would run the following command :
cfdisk / dev/hda
Once cfdisk starts you will see an interface where the current partition table is listed with the names and some data about each partition , and some command buttons on the bottom of the screen ( See Figure 2.0 ) .
Figure 2.0 cfdisk user interface
Now you should create your partitions using cfdisk .
At a minimum a swap and a ' /' ( Root ) partitions are required .
Check out this article if you need help in partitioning the drives .
Once you have created your partitions , save the changes and exit from cfdisk
Now we need to format the / partition to ext3 ( I like ext3 but you can use whatever filesystem you like ) using the following command ( Where / dev / hd a 2 is your root partition .
Replace this with the appropriate device id for your system ) :
mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda2
and once the partition is formated we mount it for read - write access by issuing the following command :
mount / dev/hda2 / mnt
Next we need to initialize the swap partition by issuing the following command ( Where / dev/hda1 is your swap partition ) :
mkswap -f /dev/hda1
and mount the swap partition using :
swapon / dev/hda1
If you do n't get any errors , proceed to the next step of the install .
Install the basic system
Now we install a very basic Debian install by issuing the following command :
cdebootstrap sid / mnt file:///opt/packages
This command install 's Debian sid in the / mnt directory without using any package tools like apt or dpkg .
This step will take some time so you might want to go read a book while it finishes .
Configure DFS
Once the basic debian system finishes installing we need to configure it for our use and the first step in this process is to copy the /etc/resolv.conf to /mnt/etc/resolv.conf and /etc/network / interfaces to /mnt/etc/network/interfaces .
Next we need to edit the / mnt/etc/apt/sources.list and add some Debian mirror addresses to it .
These mirror locations will be used to download packages we will be needing later in the guide .
Try to choose mirrors that are closest to you so that you get a good download speed .
A complete list of Debian mirror 's is available at : http://www.debian.org/mirror/list.
On my system the sources .
list looks like :
deb http://security.debian.org/
sarge / updates main contrib non-free deb
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free deb-src
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free deb http://mirrors.kernel.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free deb
http://security.debian.org/
testing / updates main contrib non-free
The kernel on the DFS cd is a good one to start off with so we will install it on our new system by issuing the following commands :
cd / mnt / root dpkg - repack kernel - image - 2.6.11
This creates a kernel - image - 2.6.11_dfs.1.0_i386.deb file in the / mnt / root directory .
Now we chroot to the new install by issuing the following command :
chroot / mnt
The we can install our new kernel by issuing the following command :
dpkg - i root / kernel - image - 2.6.11_dfs.1.0_i386.deb
Activate the Network Card
Before we do anything we need to activate the network card and make sure that we have a working connection to the net .
Run the following command to start the network card and get an IP :
ifup eth0
If you are trying to get a DHCP address you might get an error message complaining that / proc / net / dev does n't exit .
If thats the case then create the directory by running the following commands :
mkdir / proc/net / mkdir / proc/net/dev
then try to start the network again using :
ifup eth0
Create a /etc / fstab file
/ etc / fstab tells the kernel what partitions to mount and what locations they should be mounted at .
On my system the /etc / fstab looks like this :
# filesystem mountpoint type options dump pass / dev/hda2 / ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 1 / dev/hd a1 none swap defaults 0 0 proc / proc proc defaults 0 0 usbfs / proc / bus / usb usbfs devmode=0666 0 0 / dev/ cdrom / cdrom iso9660 defaults , ro, users , noexec , noauto 0 0
You should modify the above example to point to the correct partitions for your install .
Install Essential Packages
The DFS install is a very basic install so we need to install a couple of packages in order to make the system usable .
But before we can begin installing packages via apt - get install we need to get a list of the latest packages available from the debian mirrors listed in /etc/apt/sources.list .
We do this by running the following command :
apt - get update
Once the update is complete we can begin installing packages .
The first package we need to install is makedev which creates device files in / dev .
The following command will install makedev on our system :
apt - get install makedev
Then we need to install procps which installs the / proc file system utilities by issuing the following command :
apt - get install procps
Once both packages are installed we need to install a bootloader so that we can boot into the new system .
In our case we are going to install GRUB .
You can install lilo instead of grub if you prefer but in my opinion GRUB is more powerful and stable .
To install GRUB we need to run the following command :
apt - get install module - init - tools grub
Now we configure GRUB by following these steps :
Create a directory in the / boot folder to store grub files in by issuing the following command
mkdir / boot / grub Copy the GRUB files to this directory using the following command :
cp /lib/ grub/i386-pc/* /boot/grub / -R
Start the GRUB command line interface by issuing the following command :
grub Tell GRUB where the root of our install is located by running the following command ( This command tells GRUB that the root partition is on the 2nd partition on the 1st harddisk ( hd a2 ) ) :
root ( hd0,1 ) Install the bootloader to the MBR ( Master Boot Record ) by running the following command :
setup ( hd0 ) Exit from the GRUB command line interface by issuing the following command :
quit Force GRUB to update itself by running the following command :
update - grub
When asked if you want to Let the system generate the menu.lst file for you answer ' Y ' .
Edit the menu.list file to make sure it points to the correct kernel and partition .
If any of these locations are invalid the system will halt with a kernel panic when re-booted .
On my system the menu . list looks like this : default 0 ## timeout sec timeout 5 # Pretty colours color cyan / blue white / blue title Debian GNU / Linux , kernel 2.6.6 root ( hd0,1 ) kernel / vmlinuz root= / dev/hd a2 boot
/ vmlinuz is a symlink that points to / boot / vmlinuz - 2.6.6 and ( hd0,1 ) is where the / partition of my system is installed .
You should modify these values to point to the correct partitions for your install , double check the values put in by the autoconfiguration because it might have generated an incorrect file ( as it did on my system ) .
Finishing Installation
Now all we need to do is exit from the chroot environment and reboot the system .
We do it by typing :
exit
at the command prompt followed by
reboot
Once the system reboots you should remove the DFS disk and boot into the new system .
Keep in mind that this is a very minimal install so you will need to install a lot of packages .
I suggest installing openssh to allow you to access the system remotely .
Other than that you are free to install any packages you feel like .
Please remember to change the root password on the new system from the default value of blank to something more secure .
Conclusion
By now I have hopefully saved you a lot of trouble by telling you how to install DFS quickly and easily .
If you think this document helped you or you have some comments or questions about this please feel free to Contact Me and let me know .
However I must warn you that I am a somewhat lazy person who might take a little while before replying to your emails .
Thanks for your time .

So old McNamara has gone to his reward .
I was rather surprised listening to the radio on the way in that they did n't say the words " war " and " criminal , " since it 's long been not a fringe but a legitimate mainstream question as to whether McNamara was such during the Vietnam years .
He all but acknowledged it himself .
He did acknowledge it , in fact , in Errol Morris 's amazing documentary " The Fog of War , " but the admission there had to do with World War II and the civilian conventional bombing of Tokyo , of which he was an architect .
The key reflection :
I do n't fault Truman for dropping the nuclear bomb .
The US - Japanese War was one of the most brutal wars in all of human history – kamikaze pilots , suicide , unbelievable .
What one can criticize is that the human race prior to that time – and today – has not really grappled with what are , I 'll call it , " the rules of war . "
Was there a rule then that said you should n't bomb , should n't kill , should n't burn to death 100,000 civilians in one night ?
LeMay said , " If we 'd lost the war , we 'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals . "
And I think he 's right .
He , and I 'd say I , were behaving as war criminals .
LeMay recognized that what he was doing would be thought immoral if his side had lost .
But what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win ?
Well , the difference is that the winners make the rules , that 's all .
It 's been several years since I 've seen the film , but as I recall ( correct me if I 'm wrong ) , he did n't quite cop to the charge re Vietnam .
He drifted off into reflective silence .
Is it possible to think that someone was probably a war criminal and yet also is in some regards a sympathetic or at least complex figure ?
McNamara did show some public remorse for his actions and was pretty clearly tortured on some level in his later years .
I would n't put him in Kissinger 's class , quite .
Vietnam had many fathers , and life is complicated .
The Vietnam " problem " dates back , if you really want to dig into it , to 1947 , when Ho Chi Minh wrote at least two letters to then - Secretary of State Dean Acheson basically saying : Look , I 'm in Paris now , but one of these days I 'm going back to Saigon and I 'm going to lead this nationalist movement for independence , and we 'd like your support .
Acheson never so much as wrote him back .
That was the crucial error - America could have placed itself on the side of nationalist liberation movements rather than against them , and those movements ( or many of them anyway ) would not have been drawn to Moscow , possibly .
And Acheson was normally more far - sighted - he was steadfastly against the CIA - led coups in Guatemala and Iran that the successor Eisenhower administration undertook .
But he was n't going to cross the French on Indochina for some reason .
It 's been a while since I 've read all this , but it 's likely the case that he needed French backing on some other matter , I guess .
All this is fascinating history that 's not often told .
We think " Cold War " and we tend to think of hardened belligerence , but in fact there was - for a time - an intense debate in the US establishment about how that war should be prosecuted .
Things might have been different , although it was probably inevitable that the hard - liners won .

From Walter Cronkite to Katie Couric : the Kingdom of Signal is swallowed by the Empire of Noise
The recent death of Walter Cronkite spurred the predictable outpouring of tributes , each reverencing in its own way a man who was the face and voice of journalism in America for a generation or more .
The irony of all these accolades is that we live in an age where “ broadcast journalist ” is such a cruel oxymoron , and we seem to speeding headlong into an era where the word “ journalist ” itself threatens to become a freestanding joke .
Why , against this backdrop , would so many people who are so involved in the daily repudiation of everything that Cronkite stood for make such a show memorializing the standard by which they so abjectly fail ?
As I read what people had to say about Cronkite , I realized that something I studied and wrote about over a decade ago helps explain why our contemporary media has gone so deeply , tragically wrong .
First , let ’s state the simple part : Cronkite was about signal .
Contemporary media is about noise .
When you flipped on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite , you were engaged by a program where every attempt was made to sift through the static , to filter away the disinformation , and to present in a direct , clear , calm voice the essence of what was happening .
More importantly , what was happening mattered , tangibly , in the lives of the audience .
The emphasis was on the substance of what was needed instead of the shallow style of what was wanted .
At the end of the broadcast he ’d close with his trademark signoff : “ And that ’s the way it is . ”
When he did , the assertion was credible because the news had n’t relied on smoke and mirrors , dog and pony shows , cynically choreographed screaming matches ( in order to assure “ balance ” ) or artful PR - mongering .
It was , instead , the proud product of professionals whose ethics stressed getting at the facts of the day .
To be sure , other luminaries like Hunter Thompson warned us about confusing fact with truth , but what Cronkite and his colleagues wrought in 30 minutes was , on the whole , pretty useful at maximizing clarity and minimizing clutter .
The next question follows logically : why have media operations ( sorry , but when people like Katie Couric are at the helm , I just ca n’t make myself use terms like “ press ” and “ journalism ” ) abandoned the sacred quest for signal in favor of a decadent wallow in noise ?
How did this happen ?
The answer , I fear , gets a little wonkish .
If you ’ll bear with me , though , I think I can lead us to some signal about noise .
Shannon vs. Barthes
In 1990 , UCLA professor and scholar Katherine Hayles published Chaos Bound : Orderly Disorder in Contemporary Literature and Science . *
One chapter of the book , in particular , fascinated me .
It looked at two of the 20th Century ’s more prominent intellectual figures ( prominent within their respective research communities , anyway ) and contrasted them on how their work dealt with signal and noise .
The first luminary was engineer and mathematician Claude Shannon , the father of information theory , and the other was Roland Barthes , the French post - structuralist “ theorist , philosopher , critic and semiotician . ”
Dr. Hayles parallels the development of Shannon ’s information theory ** with the radical post - structuralism of Barthes , explaining that both were concerned with the same issues in their respective communications systems .
Varying institutional dynamics , however , led them to widely divergent approaches in addressing “ noise ” in the system .
Shannon , working at Bell Labs , was directly concerned with message clarity – it was his job to minimize noise in the system , thereby enabling as high a degree of communication between points as possible .
In Shannon ’s formulation , unwanted noise was defined as the “ equivocation , ” and one of his most important theorems posits that equivocation is reducible to zero if the proper code is employed ( Hayles 188 ) .
Barthes , on the other hand , argued that “ literatures are in fact arts of ‘ noise ’ , ” and that this equivocation is what readers “ consume . ”
As such , noise in the system is to be encouraged and maximized as much as possible ( Hayles 188 ) .
In other words , what Barthes suggests as the optimal goal of criticism is the absolute negation of what most would see as the essence of communication .
In a very real sense , it is the role of criticism not to facilitate communication , but to actively prevent it .
With equivocation thus maximized , the reader is encouraged to partake of this massive new body of noise which , Barthes suggests , is more interesting than the original intent anyway .
This position , while stated “ in a risqué fashion , ” nonetheless represents the mainstream belief of the critical community ( Hayles 189 ) .
So far , so good .
But why would anyone – even a French intellectual – want to destroy the possibility of communication ( and in doing so , annihilate the possibility of shared meaning ) ?
Noise as the Servant of Institutional Demand
Here we get to the part that ’s so important to understanding the sorry state of 21st Century media .
As Hayles explains , Shannon ’s attempts to decrease noise in the system were spurred by the well - defined institutional needs of the country ’s growing telephone industry .
Those of us old enough to remember the static in the average long distance call will immediately appreciate the value of Shannon ’s work .
The deconstructionist desire to increase noise in the field of literary criticism , Hayles argues , was also driven by institutional demands .
Before post - structuralism , she says , literary critics were relatively limited in the number of acceptable texts available for analysis .
Aside from the new texts introduced by living writers , this body of subject texts remained relatively constant for decades .
At the same time , however , the literary establishment experienced enormous growth , resulting in a comparative shortage of canonized texts for scholars to critique .
“ Too many critics , too few texts ” ( Hayles 189 ) :
Post - structuralism , especially deconstruction , overcomes this scarcity by showing how each text can be made into an infinite number of texts .
Moreover , it actually converts scarcity to excess by proclaiming that theory ’s proper subject is not only literature , but theory itself .
…
Thus the increasing number of theoretical texts in literary criticism , as well as their tendency to organize themselves in increasingly complex ways , can be understood as responses to the discipline ’s systemic economy ( 189-190 ) .
In other words , post - structuralism ’s war on communication and meaning do not serve society ’s need to better understand art or what art can reveal about the nature of culture ; it is not driven by any evolution towards greater enlightenment in society ; it is not about helping society overcome its “ false consciousness ” or moving us toward a more equitable form of self - governance ; it is not even , as its proponents often suggest , designed to give voice to previously unempowered demographics : these are merely rationalizations .
Instead , the rage for noise was quite simply a response to the research university ’s need to find tenure - track assistant professors something to do .
It is , in the terminology of Complexity Theory , an adaptive response aimed at enabling the survival and growth of an evolving system .
It is not about students , communities , meaning , authenticity , art , knowledge , or any of the other things scholars might use to justify their work .
Those who knew me in grad school can probably recall my indignation at what I termed the “ DeMeaning Project . ”
As I put it in a paper I once presented at a conference ( to a room full of Barthes devotées , I should note ) :
The De-meaning Project is , purely and simply , about the value - free perpetuation of academia ’s ideology of research .
It is about the exaltation and empowerment of the scholar , and if this comes at the expense of those the university is alleged to serve , so far nobody seems much concerned .
From the systemic demands fueling deconstruction , it is a small step to further envision the need the academy has for self - validation in a world increasingly obsessed with celebrity .
Each step of the project I have here outlined finds the academic engaged in the deprivileging of someone or something non-academic .
We must ask ourselves – once the individual is gone , once the artist is discredited , once the text is infinitely imprisoned within a bottomless pit of signification , once literary texts are replaced at the center of scholarship by critical texts – once this project is completed , what remains ?
What remains , and more particularly , who benefits ?
The academy has sought in the insecurity of the De-meaning Project to discredit all except for itself , and if it should succeed , then its stars become the only stars .
To sum it up : once upon a time scholars and critics were engaged in what we might call a process of signal , where they studied canonized literary texts and sought a communication and meaning - making connection with both the original text , the author and the audience .
In time , the canon ran out of accepted books and things to say about them , which was a problem for all the young scholars who needed something to establish their records and justify their cases for tenure .
The result was a new kind of scholarship that dynamited the canon , the idea of the great author , and even the very possibility of communication or meaning .
The institution had given up on discovering or cultivating signal , and so it shifted its focus to noise – which is exactly what happened to the American press .

Six thousand chess players took part in a beauty contest !
By Christoph Bühren and Björn Frank , University of Kassel
During the past few weeks , over 6000 chess players took part in our online experiment announced on the ChessBase newspages .
In the first round the participants guessed a number between 0 and 100 .
In order to win , this number had to be nearest to 2/3 of the average of all guesses .
Why is this game called Beauty Contest ?
The name of this game and its basic idea go back to John Maynard Keynes ( picture right , 1883 - 1946 ) , one of the most influential economists who ever lived .
Keynes is currently en vogue again , as he stands for an active , stabilizing role of the state .
In his famous book " The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money " ( 1936 ) , he explains why investors ' and speculators ' behaviour is hard to predict .
The reason is that these people do not just face the task of picking the most promising projects or shares .
Often their success depends on the number of other people thinking that a particular project will be successful , and those people think that the project will be successful if they believe many others to believe that ...
You see the point ?
In case you are not sure , Keynes offers the following metaphor :
" [ P ] rofessional investment may be likened to those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs , the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole ; so that each competitor has to pick , not those faces which he himself finds prettiest , but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors , all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point of view .
It is not a case of choosing those which , to the best of one 's judgment , are really the prettiest , nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest .
We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be .
And there are some , I believe , who practise the fourth , fifth and higher degrees . "
This game has no rational solution , a fact that reflects Keynes ' intentions well .
The modern " Beauty Contest "
However , in 1993 , the German economist Rosemarie Nagel ( picture left ) based her experiments on a nice variant of the game that Keynes ' newspaper readers play ; it has a rational solution , yet still it offers the chance to investigate levels – or degrees – of thinking .
This is the game we had invited chess players to play .
We want you to give us a number between 0 and 100 inclusively .
The number need not be an integer .
You have won if your number is closest to 2/3 of the average of the numbers given by all participants .
There are two ways to see that a unique solution exists .
First , one can easily see that no one should submit a number higher than 66 , because whatever the others do , a guess higher than 66 cannot be better than 66 .
However , if no one guesses more than 66 , then all numbers between 44 ( that is , two third of 66 ) and 66 are inferior to 44 .
Hence no one would guess more than 44 .
That , however , should eliminate any number higher than 2/3 of 44 , etc. , until only 0 is remaining as a reasonable guess .
( Note that a second solution besides 0 is 1 if only integers are allowed ) .
A second method would be to just try out : Presume you guess a certain number x , and anyone else guesses the same number x , would you still wish to stick to your initial guess x ?
If so , you have found what game theorists call a Nash equilibrium ( named after John Nash – yes , the one played by Russell Crowe in Beautiful Mind ) .
Now the only x to which you would want to stick is 0 .
However , as Reinhard Selten ( who received the Nobel Prize together with Nash ) has said : " game theory is for proving theorems , not for playing games " .
Guessing 0 only leads to success if you think that everyone is rational and fully understands the solution of the game .
Empirically , this is not the case .
Previous results
The first round of Rosemarie Nagel 's first Beauty contest experiment resulted in a target number ( i.e. , 2/3 of the average guess between 0 - 100 ) of 24.49 .
Playing the Beauty Contest over the Internet produces very similar results ( 24.13 in Rubinstein , Economic Journal 2007 ) , while playing the game as a newspaper or magazine contest gives participants more time , and they think one step further ahead .
( The target number of a magazine experiment by Selten and Nagel , Spektrum der Wissenschaft , February 1998 , was 14.72 ; Richard Thaler in the Financial Times , June 16th , 1997 got 12.61 ) .
Are chess players different from other humans ?
Why would one think that good chess players are any better in the Beauty Contest than others ?
Psychological research has found that excellent chess players neither calculate markedly deeper than amateurs , nor do they calculate a larger number of moves .
However , they make the more relevant calculations .
They have stored a large number of patterns or " chunks " that allow them to focus on the moves that are really relevant .
This ability is chess - specific , and one would not expect it to help much in the Beauty Contest .
Yet Palacios - Huerta and Volij ( 2007 ) tested the rationality of chess players in an experiment that shares one particular feature of ours : it has a game - theoretic equilibrium that is usually never reached by “ normal ” people .
In their experiment all grandmasters chose this equilibrium !
Our results
The target number of the ChessBase experiment turned out to be 21.4769 – two third of 32.21539 .
As pointed out above , the online environment might have played a role .
Yet , a first impression is that chess players ' guesses are within the range of other humans .
The winning guesses came from Nick Burns , UK ( 21.473 ) , Jarred Jason Neubronner , Singapore ( 21.463 ) and Tanner McNamara , USA ( 21.46 ) .
The latter two argued that they anticipated most of the participants to choose a number near 2/3 of the average of 0 and 100 , that is 2/3*50=33.33 .
Therefore , they choose a number near 2/3*33.33 .
Nick Burns has asked various groups of people ( e.g. mathematics classes ) before answering our survey .
But what is the role of chess expertise ?
Indeed , guesses of better chess players are significantly lower .
However , this relation is rather minuscule with regard to its extent :
On average , chess players guess one integer lower if they have a rating that is 200 points higher according to our very preliminary results .
And what about the grandmasters , of whom we have 28 in our sample ?
While the average guess in our complete sample was 32.21539 , the grandmasters ' average was slightly higher : 32.96482 !
One of us is a chess player ( Elo 2220 ) while the other is not , hence we do not quite agree whether chess players are particularly clever .
Did our experiment decide the issue ?
Only seemingly so .
It might be that the strong chess players in our sample " saw " the theoretical solution , but that they presumed that the average participant makes a less sophisticated guess .
Strong chess players might be particularly good in guessing other people 's guesses , though this sounds more like poker than like chess .
To take an example , if half of the untitled chess players would have guessed 0 and the other half 64 , and if the grandmaster all would have guessed 33 , then the average deviation from the winning number would be much lower for the grandmasters .
However , this turned out not to be the case for our sample .
And as far as the Elo rating is concerned , you are one integer nearer to the winning number if you have a rating that is 333 points higher – better chess players are closer to the winning number , but only by a tiny amount ( note : this is a very preliminary result again ) .
Some further results
For round one , we also calculated the target numbers for different groups of chess players separated by their Elo rating .
In our second round , we asked our participants to estimate these target numbers of round one ( we wrote an email to every first round participant .
If it did not reach you , argue with your spam filter ) :
Our initial hypothesis had been that Elo rating and Beauty Contest guess might be related .
Now that we rubbed this hypothesis under the participants ' noses , they presume that such a relationship exists , but not very strongly .
The winning guesses for this task came from the Netherlands , Denmark , USA and India : Martijn Pauw , Torill Skytte , Jonathan Tayar and Manish Kashyap .
In two categories the winners did not react to our emails so far – these days it is no easy task to convince people and their spam filters that they have really won something ; a ChessBase voucher in our case .
And finally there was a second round , in which everyone played against players of his own rating group only .
Everyone was informed about the target number of round 1 ( 21.4769 ) .
Hence , in the next round one should see a declining average guess , like in all other multiperiod Beauty Contests before .
But how large is the decline ?
Do stronger chess players react stronger ?
No , quite the opposite is true .
Comparing the first and the second round number , here is the size of what might be called a learning effect :
And the winners of this second round are ...
Reiner Odendahl , Uwe Stein , and Thomas Seelen from Germany , Mark Huizer and Regis Huc from the Netherlands , Matthew Tapp , UK , Michel de Vathaire , France , Mark Ryan , USA , Alexis Murillo Tsijli , Costa Rica and one chess player who has not replied to our emails yet .
Of course this is not the whole story , there is a lot more to do with the data .
But now you know at least why we conducted this experiment .
We thank all participants for giving us a lot of useful feedback about this experiment and the way they calculated their numbers .
Many thanks also to ChessBase for support and cooperation , and to Alain Ledoux who turned out to be the predecessor of this game ; click here if you are interested in details ( in PDF ) .

Technology.am ( Apr. 4 , 2009 ) — Forrester Research suggests that we ’re at the front end of a long cycle of open - source infrastructure and application adoption .
Forrester Research found that 45 percent of all companies using open - source software for mission - critical applications , the adoption seems to be slightly thin , leaving a great deal of room for even more adoption .
Huge swaths have adopted open - source infrastructure like the Linux operating system , JBoss application server , MySQL and PostgreSQL databases .
But the bigger and longer - term opportunity appears to be in open - source applications , which have only lightly been adopted , according to the survey .
Red Hat has built a $ 650 million business by selling support for Linux and JBoss , a business that continues to grow and thrive .
This , however , is a tiny tip of an enormous $ 222 billion enterprise software iceberg , with enterprise applications making up a huge chunk of that iceberg .
Jesus of Siberia : The Russian ex-traffic policeman who claims he is the son of God
The beard and long hair are both present and correct .
And with his flowing linen robes and beatific smile he certainly does a fine impression of a holy man .
But to his believers in this remote corner of Siberia , Sergei Torop , a former traffic policeman , is the literal reincarnation of none other than Jesus Christ .
Russian ex-traffic cop Sergei Torop sits on his wooden throne during a meeting with his followers in the remote village of Petropavlovka
Torop , 48 , is the spiritual leader of at least 5,000 devoted followers , among them intellectuals , artists and professionals who flock to worship him in the small isolated village of Petropavlovka - more than 2000 miles from Moscow .
Torop was ‘ reborn ’ as ‘ Vissarion ’ in 1991 just as Russia was facing a crisis of confidence following the collapse of the iron curtain .
He is just the latest example of Russia ’s predilection for ' personality cults ' - a national obsession that leads back all the way to the days of Rasputin .
Both Lenin and Stalin tapped into the Russian people ’s eagerness to embrace powerful figures and actively fostered the almost religious fervour with which they were worshipped .
After time spent in the Army , Torop had been working as a traffic policeman on the night shift in the small Siberia town of Minusinsk until he was made unemployed .
Suddenly something ‘ awoke ’ inside him , he says , and he instantly knew that he was the second coming of Christ - 2,000 years after he was first crucified .
Russian ex-traffic policeman Sergei Torop , now known as Viassarion , meets with his followers in the remote village of Petropavlovka
For thousands of followers , Vissarion is no less than the second coming of Jesus of Nazareth , reincarnated 2,000 years after his crucifixion , deep in the Siberian wilderness
He says he realised that God had sent him to Earth to teach mankind about the evils of war and the havoc we were wreaking on the environment .
With Christmas abolished his followers mark the day of his first sermon on August 18 as their special feast day .
Time in the community is measured by Vissarion ’s life and so as he is 48 years old his Church is now living in year 49 .
His followers , who have given up their lives to follow him , are strict vegans and are banned from smoking and drinking or handling money .
Around 300 of them live in wooden huts in the village that has grown up around his church and which does not appear on any maps .
Many thousands more have made their homes in the small villages that surround Petropavlovka and survive the vicious Siberian winters so that they can be close to their Messiah .
An elderly woman places a candle under a picture of ' Vissarion the Teacher ' , in the village 's church
On a mountain close by their village a large bell tolls three times a day so the followers know when they should break off from their back - breaking work to kneel and pray .
Vissarion himself whiles away his days painting in his chalet where he lives with his wife and six children - one of whom he adopted from a single mother in the commune .
But critics in Russia have accused him of fleecing his loyal community of followers for personal gain .
In recent years he has travelled to France , Italy and Holland to ' convert ' new followers although he claims that his visits were sponsored by his hosts and that his Church makes no money .

The number of people out of work in the UK has risen to its highest level since 1995 , official figures have shown .
Unemployment increased by 220,000 to 2,435,000 in the three months to June , taking the jobless rate to 7.8 % .
Claims for unemployment benefit were the highest in 12 years , increasing by 24,900 in July to 1.58 million .
Average earnings , excluding bonuses , grew at their slowest rate since records began in 2001 , the Office for National Statistics said .
Earnings excluding bonuses rose at an annual rate of 2.5 % in the three months to June , down from 2.6 % in the three months to May .
Those in manufacturing only averaged pay increases of 1.1 % , while the public sector saw an average rise of 3.7 % .
Average earnings including bonuses also rose by 2.5 % , but this was up from the previous rate of 2.3 % .

Unemployment in graphics BBC employment correspondent Martin Shankleman says the figures confirm that unemployment continues to rise remorselessly , with no early respite .
Our correspondent adds that the full impact of joblessness among those who recently left school or college and are now looking for work is not reflected in these figures and has yet to be felt .
' Slow ' recovery
The figures come as the Bank of England 's latest quarterly inflation report warned that the UK economy still had some way to go before it recovered from the effects of the financial crisis .
Bank governor Mervyn King warned that any recovery in 2010 would be " slow and protracted " .
He also hinted that further measures might be needed to stimulate the economy , in addition to the Bank 's programme of quantitative easing ( QE ) to spur growth .
The British Chambers of Commerce warned that unemployment was likely to continue rising at a rapid pace , even if the economy started growing again , and could exceed three million .
And the Institute of Directors said that almost a million people were working part - time because they could not find a full - time job , meaning the impact of the recession on employment was " even greater than the headline figures suggest " .
' Lost to work '
According to BBC calculations based on ONS data , the unemployment rate among 16 - 24 year olds has risen to 19.1 % , with about 928,000 people in that age range classed as unemployed .
There is rising concern about youth unemployment , and Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said the government needed the help of businesses to tackle it .
Work experience , mentoring and internships were needed to avoid a generation " lost to work " , Lord Mandelson told the BBC .
" This is something the whole country has got to rally to .
We need public and private employers , as well as those in the [ charity ] sector , to help us mount this national campaign to back young Britain . "
However , shadow chancellor George Osborne said the government was not doing enough .
How to cope with unemployment
Your personal stories " Unemployment continues to rise , month after month , we are facing a lost generation of young people who can't get work , " he said .
" The government talk about all their unemployment schemes that are supposed to help , but at the moment we 've just got people losing their jobs and getting very little help in trying to find a new one . "
A group called the Youth Fight for Jobs Campaign says there is a lack of training and affordable housing for younger people .
" It 's about highlighting that there 's a problem , and also saying to the government , and local MPs , and councillors , what are you going to do about it ? , " said campaigner Manuel Dominguez .
" Young people do n't get proper training , a lot of working class young people get put off from going to university and being saddled with debt . "
A new crop of school leavers and university graduates will join the jobs market this summer .
' Marked weakening '
The number of new claimants of job seekers allowance had been falling in recent months , but the 24,900 fresh claimants in July compared with 21,500 in June .
Earlier this week , the government said it had launched an investigation into the gap between the number of people out of work and those who were claiming unemployment benefit .
While the latest data shows that the jobless rate , under International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) rules , rose to 7.8 % in the three months to June - the highest rate since the final quarter of 1996 , the rate of people claiming unemployment benefit in July was just 4.9 % .
One possible explanation for this discrepancy could be that some people who have recently lost their jobs are relying on their partner 's income , their own savings or redundancy payments rather than drawing on benefits .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The best thing young people can do if they are unemployed is to use the time to gain skills that will make them more attractive to employers Rachel " Recently the broader ILO measure of joblessness has indicated a more marked weakening in the labour market , and that trend has continued , " said Colin Ellis , European economist at Daiwa Securities .
Meanwhile , an investigation by Radio 4 's
Face the Facts has found that some frontline staff at Jobcentre Plus , the government agency tasked with getting people back to work , are cutting interview times to cope with the increase in claimants .
However , Employment Minister Angela Eagle dismissed the idea that government cuts to the agency before the recession were proving detrimental to those out of work , saying staff had done " a magnificent job in difficult circumstances " .
She added that 9,000 new staff had been recruited and that 80 % of people registering after they had lost their jobs were getting an interview with a personal adviser within three days .
Benefits payments were also being processed " well within targets " , she said .

Yield Prolog lets you embed Prolog programs directly in Python , C# [ 1 ] or Javascript [ 2 ] by using the yield keyword .
For example , here is the classic " uncle " predicate in Prolog :
uncle ( Person , Uncle ) :-
parent ( Person , Parent ) ,
brother ( Parent , Uncle ) .
( This says that a person has an uncle if the person has a parent and that parent has a brother . )
And here it is from the Yield Prolog compiler :
Python
C #
def uncle ( Person , Uncle ) :
Parent = Variable ( )
for l1 in parent ( Person , Parent ) :
for l2 in brother ( Parent , Uncle ) :
yield False
IEnumerable < bool > uncle ( object Person , object Uncle ) {
Variable Parent = new Variable ( ) ;
foreach ( bool l1 in parent ( Person , Parent ) ) {
foreach ( bool l2 in brother ( Parent , Uncle ) )
yield return false ;
}
} Javascript function * uncle( Person , Uncle ) {
var Parent = new Variable ( ) ;
for ( let l1 of parent ( Person , Parent ) ) {
for ( let l2 of brother ( Parent , Uncle ) )
yield false ;
}
}
As you can see , the flow of the code in Yield Prolog is similar to Prolog .
The Tutorial explains how these examples work , without expecting you to know Prolog .
And the benchmarks show that Yield Prolog in C# can be faster than efficient Prolog systems like Yap Prolog and XSB .
Yield Prolog is made possible by the yield keyword , which automatically creates iterators that you can nest , combined with Yield Prolog 's Variable class which can unify a variable with other values ( just like in Prolog ) .
There is no " API " standing between your code and Yield Prolog , because you just use the yield keyword to make " iterator functions " wherever you need them .
Yield Prolog is part of your code , which can mix Prolog - style predicates directly with ordinary arrays , file I/O , GUI calls and all your own classes .
Because it lets you mix these , Yield Prolog unifies the declarative and procedural programming models .
1. Tested with C# .NET 2008 + and Mono 2.0 + .
2. Yield Prolog for Javascript is supported in Firefox and Seamonkey , which fully support the yield keyword in EcmaScript 3.1 .
新型インフルエンザが全世界を席巻しているが、エマージングウイルス（emerging virus：新興感染症）の感染爆発（outbreak : アウトブレイク）の危険性は、熱帯雨林の開発に伴う野生生物との接触拡大、交通機関の発達による感染経路の拡大により日に日に増大している。このあたりの話は山内一也東京大学名誉教授による連続講座
人獣共通感染症が大変充実しており興味深い。
エボラ出血熱などの極めて高い致死率を有する感染症が全世界に広がらず人類が滅亡しないのは、その高い致死率にある。他人に感染させる前に宿主が死亡してしまうので、感染が局所的範囲に抑えられるのだ。万が一、発病までに長い潜伏期間をもつ致命的な感染症が流行すると人類の存続が危うくなる。新型インフルエンザがそうならない保証はない。
基本モデル （SZRモデル） 基本モデルでは次の3つのクラスから構成される。
S : 生者
Z : ゾンビ
R : 死者 出生 率Πで生まれる生者はパラメタδでゾンビとは関係がない要因で死亡し、死者となる。死者はパラメタζによりゾンビとして生まれ変わる。生者は感染パラメタβによってゾンビと接触し新たなゾンビになる。ゾンビは生者によって首をはねるか頭を潰すかしてパラメタαによって殺され死者となる（ゾンビは他のゾンビを襲わない）。このモデルは次の数式で表される。
これは感染症をモデル化するために通常利用されるSIRモデル*4よりも若干複雑になっている。ここで1匹のゾンビから単位時間あたりに感染して生まれる新たなゾンビはβSZ、一人の生者が単位時間あたりに殺すゾンビの数はαSZとなる。 この常微分方程式は
を満たすため 、
となる。これは、生者とゾンビと死者の数の合計が無限大に発散するということを意味するが、t→∞としても生者の数は無限大にはなり得ないので（人はやがて死ぬ）、ゾンビあるいは死者の数が爆発的に増えることになる。
ゾンビ感染症のアウトブレイクが極めて短期間に発生したと仮定すると、出生率およびゾンビと関係がない死亡率を無視することができる。そこで、Π=δ=0を代入し、常微分方程式の零解を求める。
最初の数式か らSないしはZが0になることがわかる。それに従って何れの場合でもRは0となる。S=0とすると、生者が絶滅し、" 終末の日" の解を得る。 一方 、
Z=0 とすると、ゾンビに悩まされることのない" 平和な日々" の解を得る。 つまり、このモデルでは解の安定性に関わらず両者が共存することはないことが導き出される。相手を絶滅させるしか生き延びる道はないのだ。 オイラー法に基づいて微分方程式を解いた結果を次に示す。文末にMATLABコードを掲載しているので、実行環境のある人は試してみると良いだろう。
左のグラフはゾンビが発生しない状況を表しているが、残念ながらこの解はラウス・フルビッツの安定判別法より不安定であることが分かる（詳細割愛）。一方右のグラフは、生者を0とした場合のゾンビ感染症アウトブレイク発生時のシナリオを示している（α=0.005 , β=0.0095 , ζ=0.0001 , δ=0.0001）。生者は早々に絶滅させられ、ゾンビが代わりに感染を広げていく。こちらの平衡点は安定しており、短期間のアウトブレイクではゾンビ感染は易々と広がることを示している。
隔離対策を行った場合 （SIZRQモデル） 人類としても座して滅びを待つわけにはいかない。初期の新型インフルエンザへの対応にも見られたように、感染症への対策のひとつに強制隔離がある。感染者を隔離し感染が広がらないように被害を局所的に封じ込めるのだ。そこで隔離者クラス( Q) を新たに追加する。
隔離エリアには感染者及びゾンビの一部がそれぞれパラメタκ , σに従って隔離される。中には隔離エリアからの逃亡を企てるものも出てくると考えられるが、それらは成功前に銃殺される（パラメタγ）。殺された人々は死者クラス(R)に移動するが、一部はゾンビとして復活する。このSIZRQモデルは次のように図示される。
短期間のアウトブレイク(Π=δ=0)を想定すると、次の2つの平衡解を得る。
やはり食うか食われるかの2つに1つだが、人類が勝利する解が安定するためには次に導かれる感染率R
0 ( 一次感染者から二次感染する患者数の平均値 )
が1未満である必要がある。ちなみに28日に発表されたCDCの報告によれば、新型インフルエンザの感染率は1.5と見積もられている*5。 感染率R 0 を下げるためには、感染者やゾンビを隔離する割合を表すκかσを大きくする必要がある。人口が大きい場合R 0 の近似値は次のようになる。 β>α（人がゾンビを殺すよりも、ゾンビ感染症が人に感染する方が速い）の場合、ゾンビを撲滅できるかどうかは感染拡大の初期段階における隔離にかかっている。しかし実際のところ、感染者を見分けることが困難である場合には、徹底した隔離をすることは困難だろう。大量の感染者を隔離するための施設面を考えても、大規模隔離は非現実的である。そのため、結局κかσは小さくならざるを得ず、R 0 は1よりも大きくなる。やはり今までと同様、人類が勝利する解は安定しない。 次にSIZRQモデルにおける" 終末の日 " シナリオの推移グラフを示す。隔離対策によって若干人類絶滅の日が後ろに延びるが結果は同じだ。
治療法が確立した場合 （SIZR with cureモデル） 今まで苦杯をなめてきた人類だが、人類の叡智を結集させればゾンビ感染症を治療するワクチンなど、早期に治療法を確立できるかもしれない。どのようにゾンビ化したかに関わらずゾンビ感染症を治療し、再び生者とする治療法が確立したと仮定する。ただしこの治療法は免疫を与えるものではなく、一旦ゾンビ感染症から回復しても再び罹患する可能性は残るとする。治療法の確立をもって非実用的な隔離をやめると、モデルは次のように図示される。 短期間のアウトブレイ ク( Π=δ=0 ) を想定し 、Z=0とすると次の2つの平衡解を得る。
こ の2つ目の人類とゾンビが共存する解は安定的である。次に治療法が確立した場合に人類が生き残るシナリオの推移グラフを示す。確かに人類は一定数生存することができるが、自らの何倍もの数のゾンビが跳梁跋扈する世界で、ゾンビに怯えながら生活することを余儀なくされそうだ。
攻性掃討作戦 最後に攻性対応が実現する場合を想定する。人類は準備ができた段階で戦略的にゾンビの掃討作戦を決行する。そのようなリソースの準備や調整は困難を極めることから、作戦は複数回に分けて継続的に遂行される。 ここで再び基本モデルに戻り、掃討作戦の効果を加える。
ここで、kは殺傷率であり、nは根絶までに繰り返される掃討作戦の回数を表す。ゾンビ数の推移は次のグラフに示される（縦軸のオーダーは他のグラフの1/1000であることに注意）。
α=0.0075 , β=0.0055 , ζ=0.09 , δ=0.0001 , k=0.25としている。2.5日後に25%のゾンビが破壊され、5日後に50%、7.5日後に75%、そして10日後に100%のゾンビが破壊される。
まとめ ゾンビ感染症のアウトブレイクは、アンデッドに対して攻性の作戦行動が伴わない限り、絶望的な状況へと陥る可能性が高い。積極的な隔離対策は感染症を撲滅できるかもしれないが、現実的に取り得るオプションとは考えにくい。治療法の確立は一部の人類の存続を可能とするが、地球はゾンビの手に落ちる。早い段階から大規模な掃討作戦を戦略的・継続的に繰り返すことだけが、ゾンビの撲滅を可能とする。 これらの結果は短期間のアウトブレイクを想定しているが、長期にわたると結果は破滅的になる。文明は破壊され、すべての人間は感染するか死亡することになる。生まれる人間も死ぬ人間も、どちらも新たなゾンビの供給源となるからだ。人類存亡の危機に際し、我々が行わなければならないことは、強い覚悟をもって絶滅させられる前に相手を絶滅させることだ。 ゾンビの大量発生が現実に起こるとは考えにくいが、対応において重要なのは、危機管理における基本である、迅速な状況把握、早期の政治決断、戦略的な作戦行動であることは現実も変わらないようだ。
The removal of trans fats from all kinds of foods is certainly good for our health .
But how good ?
That depends on what kind of fat has replaced them .
Three doctors from Gentofte University Hospital in Denmark decided to find out .
They picked 19 popular kinds of fast foods , cookies , cakes and snacks that were known to be heavy on the trans fats , then compared them with 19 similar foods with low trans fats .
Before we get to the results , a quick primer on the relative merits of different kinds of fat .
Trans fats are vegetable oils with added hydrogen to make them more solid .
That makes them useful to food manufacturers , but bad for people – they raise bad cholesterol and reduce good cholesterol .
The more you eat , the more you increase your risk of coronary heart disease .
The same is true of saturated fats , which occur naturally in foods like cheese , ground beef and chocolate .
But monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats ( from fish , avocados and vegetable oils , among other items ) do n’t raise bad cholesterol .
In fact , when used as a substitute for trans fats or saturated fats , unsaturated fats can help reduce your cholesterol .
So if food manufacturers were simply replacing trans fats with saturated fats , they really would n’t be making their products that much better .
And now , drum roll please ….
French fries were a natural candidate for this analysis .
Fries that were low in trans fats had a corresponding increase in polyunsaturated fats , the best kind .
For microwave popcorn , about half the trans fats were replaced with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats , with saturated fat making up the difference .
Cakes and cookies swapped nearly one - quarter of their trans fats for the better unsaturated fats , but most of the substitution was for saturated fat .
The results were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine .
The authors concluded that when trans fats were removed from foods , they really did get healthier .
Here are a few useful backgrounders on dietary fat from the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Assn .

It ’s well known that cash - strapped Americans are trading down and giving up nonessential items like restaurant meals , designer clothes and vacations .
But switching from Budweiser or Heineken to Busch and Natural Light ?
Yes , even that , according to July 4 sales data from Information Resources Inc .
Budweiser may be getting crowded out by discount brands .

The days leading up to Independence Day are usually the biggest - selling period of the year for beer brands , according to Ad Age .
If that ’s any indication , 2009 is n’t shaping up to be a good year for some of the nation ’s biggest brands .
Heineken sales sank 18 % from the previous year in grocery , convenience and drug stores during the two - week period ended July 5 , followed by Budweiser at 14 % .
Corona Extra sales dropped 11 % , while Miller Lite declined 9 % and Bud Light fell 7 % .
Coors
Light sales held up better , falling less than 1 % from a year ago .
Meanwhile , sales of “ subpremium ” beers including Busch , Natural Light and Keystone posted “ substantial gains ” , according to Ad Age , which did n’t provide the specifics .
It ’s a sign that despite the cheap , frat - party image of those brands ( and debatable taste ) , consumers are focused on one thing right now : the bottom line .
We may think we know how best to eradicate the zombie threat , but movies and books give us , at best , an anecdotal account of how to deal with the undead .
A new paper , however , offers mathematical models for human survival .

In a paper published in Infectious Disease Modelling Research Progress , a team of mathematicians from Carleton University and the University of Ottawa have created a series of mathematical models to explore the effects of a zombie outbreak and determine the best course for human survival .
For the purpose of the paper , the team limited their models to the George Romero slow - moving zombies , and created separate models for zombie infections that cause the infected to resurrect immediately after contact with a zombie and for zombie infections with a 24 - hour incubation period .
The paper examines three possible methods of dealing with a zombie outbreak : quarantine of the zombies , treatment of zombies so that they once again become human , and impulsive eradication of the zombies whenever possible .
The models found that quarantine could work , but the end result would be either the eradication of all zombies or the eradication of all humans ; if a cure for being a zombie were found , humans would coexist with zombies , but only in low numbers ; but eradication , if properly coordinated , could wipe out the entire zombie population in a mere ten days .

For Immediate Release , February 26 , 2009 Contact : Randy Serraglio , Center for Biological Diversity , ( 520 ) 784-1504 ( cell ) Center for Biological Diversity Announces Support for
Global Population Speak Out TUCSON , Ariz . —
The Center for Biological Diversity today announced its support for the Global Population Speak Out , a collaborative effort by scientists , activists , and others worldwide to highlight the issue of overpopulation in efforts to restore the planet ’s ecological health .
February 2009 has been declared a month of action and communication on this crucial , but often ignored issue .
“ For many years now the issue of human population size and growth has been the elephant in the room , ” said Randy Serraglio , conservation advocate at the Center .
“ But overpopulation is really at the root of virtually all of the ecological threats facing our planet , and it needs to be addressed .
Species extinction , pollution , resource depletion , and — the biggest threat of all — climate change can all be traced back to unsustainable population growth . ”
The Center has won protection for more than 350 species and hundreds of millions of acres of habitat over the past 20 years .
But that work could be overwhelmed by the ongoing effects of unsustainable population growth , as too many people compete for too few resources and create too many burdens for already stressed ecosystems .
The correlation between human population growth and species extinction has been clearly documented .
Humans now use up to 40 percent of the world ’s Net Primary Productivity , a measure of energy from the sun that is converted into life - sustaining resources by photosynthesis .
“ With one species commanding so much of the available sustenance , it is no wonder so many other species are disappearing , ” said Serraglio .
“ A whole range of extinctions can be tied directly to the energy , housing , food , and other resource demands of our burgeoning population , ” said Serraglio .
“ The Yangtze River dolphin , Atlantic gray whale , West African black rhino , Merriam ’s elk , California grizzly bear , silver trout , blue pike , dusky seaside sparrow , and many others have succumbed to unsustainable human population growth . ”
The extinction crisis threatens to grow exponentially with the onset of climate change , exacerbated by the skyrocketing energy demands of a rapidly growing global populace .
“ Many of us are working hard to reduce our carbon footprints , ” said Serraglio .
“ But in the end , unless we get a handle on runaway population growth , it may simply become a case of too many feet . ”
i pretty much agree with just about anyone before me .
YOU make sure she is ready !
there was this one time that i would have done it but i was not ready and he stopped .
but we did end up doing it years later but anyway , take her out somewhere private like a levee or something like that .
you guys can kiss then .
if she grabs your man part she wants it .
but be genital and do n't brag about it to all of your friends .
just let her know that nothing is going to happen that she do n't want to happen .
then ask her if it would be asking too much if you invited her to your house or hotel .
if she says no then its NO .
just be kind about it , and if she says no call her the next day .
she knows the offer is still on the table for when she is ready .
hope this helps ~ ~~ ~~
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Iraq awarded a lucrative oil contract to BP and China National Petroleum Corp. , government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said Wednesday , while rejecting other companies ' offers for other oil fields .
BP and China National Petroleum Corporation have won a lucrative oil contract in Iraq .
The joint BP - CNPC bid was for the al - Rumeila oil field , one of the largest in the world .
The energy companies are expected to increase production at the oil field by 50 percent , to 285,000 barrels a day , for a service charge of $ 2 for each additional barrel produced , al - Dabbagh said in a statement .
The Iraqi government rejected bids for five other oil fields and a natural gas field because the bidders did not agree to the service charge set by the Ministry of Oil , he said .
The Ministry of Oil rejected the idea that the failure to award more than one contract made the much - anticipated auction a flop .
Iraq did not say how much the BP - CNPC bid was worth .
It runs for 20 years .
Oil Minister Hussein Shahrastani chaired the government - sponsored auction for the oil and natural gas field contracts Tuesday , after a day 's delay due to a sandstorm .
Much of the auction was broadcast live on state television , which Ministry of Oil spokesman Assem Jihad told CNN was a sign of the transparency of the process .
He said the government was satisfied with the auction , even though only one contract was awarded , because the contract was for Iraq 's largest oil field .
Iraq plans to open bidding this year on 10 more oil fields and one natural gas field , all of which are undeveloped , Jihad said .
The companies whose bids were rejected Tuesday have been given time to review their offers , he said .
Iraq has some of the largest oil reserves in the world , with an estimated 115 billion barrels -- tying Iran for second place , behind Saudi Arabia 's 264 billion barrels , according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration in the United States .
CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh in Baghdad contributed to this report .
In the face of a growing number of deaths and cases of HIV linked to drug abuse , the Portuguese government in 2001 tried a new tack to get a handle on the problem — it decriminalized the use and possession of heroin , cocaine , marijuana , LSD and other illicit street drugs .
The theory : focusing on treatment and prevention instead of jailing users would decrease the number of deaths and infections .
Five years later , the number of deaths from street drug overdoses dropped from around 400 to 290 annually , and the number of new HIV cases caused by using dirty needles to inject heroin , cocaine and other illegal substances plummeted from nearly 1,400 in 2000 to about 400 in 2006 , according to a report released recently by the Cato Institute , a Washington , D.C , libertarian think tank .
" Now instead of being put into prison , addicts are going to treatment centers and they 're learning how to control their drug usage or getting off drugs entirely , " report author Glenn Greenwald , a former New York State constitutional litigator , said during a press briefing at Cato last week .
Under the Portuguese plan , penalties for people caught dealing and trafficking drugs are unchanged ; dealers are still jailed and subjected to fines depending on the crime .
But people caught using or possessing small amounts — defined as the amount needed for 10 days of personal use — are brought before what 's known as a " Dissuasion Commission , " an administrative body created by the 2001 law .
Each three - person commission includes at least one lawyer or judge and one health care or social services worker .
The panel has the option of recommending treatment , a small fine , or no sanction .
Peter Reuter , a criminologist at the University of Maryland , College Park , says he 's skeptical decriminalization was the sole reason drug use slid in Portugal , noting that another factor , especially among teens , was a global decline in marijuana use .
By the same token , he notes that critics were wrong in their warnings that decriminalizing drugs would make Lisbon a drug mecca .
" Drug decriminalization did reach its primary goal in Portugal , " of reducing the health consequences of drug use , he says , " and did not lead to Lisbon becoming a drug tourist destination . "
Walter Kemp , a spokesperson for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , says decriminalization in Portugal " appears to be working . "
He adds that his office is putting more emphasis on improving health outcomes , such as reducing needle - borne infections , but that it does not explicitly support decriminalization , " because it smacks of legalization . "
Drug legalization removes all criminal penalties for producing , selling and using drugs ; no country has tried it .
In contrast , decriminalization , as practiced in Portugal , eliminates jail time for drug users but maintains criminal penalties for dealers .
Spain and Italy have also decriminalized personal use of drugs and Mexico 's president has proposed doing the same . .
A spokesperson for the White House 's Office of National Drug Control Policy declined to comment , citing the pending Senate confirmation of the office 's new director , former Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske .
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) and the U.S. Department of State 's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs also declined to comment on the report .
The New York Knicks may be surprise players in this years free agency and not just because they have trade chips .
All season long it was speculated the Knicks would try and do sign - and - trade deals with Nate Robinson and David Lee .
That could still happen but its also looking like both players could still be playing at the Garden .
The Knicks are also rumored to be in the Jason Kidd sweepstakes and of course looking at the big man Marcin Gortat .
I ’m not sure which news today is more surprising .
There have been reports that the Knicks and Kidd are scheduled to meet tomorrow .
There ’s also reports that the Knicks may be willing to offer Lee a six - year contract .
So you see both are eye openers and I can’t decide which caught me more off guard .
First waking up this morning I turned on ESPN , the first story I saw was that the Knicks were meeting with Jason Kidd .
First words out of my mouth were WTF , so I quickly went online to get details .
The NY Post says that the Knicks hope their location is enough to reel in the triple - double machine .
Kidd ’s kids still live in the New York area and there hope is that he wants to be around them more .
They have to lean on that because all they can offer is the teams mid-level exception .
Even with his career winding down its doubtful a player of his talent will sign for just that .
Last season he averaged over 9 points , 6 rebounds and 8 assists a game so he can still produce at a high level .
For a system like Mike D’Antoni ’s which rewards all around players , he ’d be a perfect fit .
The real question would be what happens to Chris Duhon then ?
The other surprise came while I was reading about Kidd .
The articles said the Donnie Walsh would like to keep Lee , but only at a price that does n’t mortgage the teams chances for summer 2010 .
Makes total sense , it ’s something I ’ve thought for a long time .
Lee led the league in double - doubles and is a talent that you ca n’t let just walk away .
BUT at the same time with the upcoming free agent class you have to prioritize .
The same NY Post article indicates that Walsh would be willing to offer around $ 7 million a year over six seasons .
A pretty good deal , especially in this economy but there are plenty of teams who can offer more .
Walsh is willing to bet they wo n’t .
“ He ’ll have to prove it , ” Walsh said .
Walsh has that leverage to say that as the Knicks can match any offer Lee receives .
That leverage could also lead to Walsh calling up a club and saying I ’m keeping him unless you give me so and so ’s expiring contract .
Win -win scenario for the Knicks , even thou I believe the bigger win would be keeping Lee .
Do n’t let the drafting of Jordan Hill and trade for Darko fool you , they ’re back - up plans should the Knicks let Lee walk .
In other Knick news , Nate Robinson might be willing to sign his qualifying one year offer .
This would be outstanding news for the club .
Yes , they drafted Toney Douglas to replace him but who knows if he ’ll be able to provide the same output as Nate in just his rookie year .
The Post says there are sources that Nate feels the summer of 2010 would be better for him financially , and he may be willing to wait a year to hit the market .
That makes total sense in my opinion .
Many teams are tightening up right now with the current economy , and once again because of the next free agent class .
There ’s going to be so much money available next year that Nate could really score a big payday with another solid season .
I ’ll tell you one thing , if the Knicks can sign Kidd , keep Lee and Nate , and add Gortat it could be a special season .
The Knicks would have enough talent to be very competitive in the Eastern Conference , probably playoff worthy again .
The best part would be they ’d make all these moves and still be in a favorable cap situation for 2010 .
A playoff berth this year would put Madison Square Garden back on the map as a tough road game .
The place would be absolutely electric with the Knicks being competitive again .
And even more so when fans consider the future may be a lot brighter then the past decade .

Object Pool
Improve performance and memory use by reusing objects from a fixed pool instead of allocating and freeing them individually .
We ’re working on the visual effects for our game .
When the hero casts a spell , we want a shimmer of sparkles to burst across the screen .
This calls for a particle system , an engine that spawns little sparkly graphics and animates them until they wink out of existence .
Since a single wave of the wand could cause hundreds of particles to be spawned , our system needs to be able to create them very quickly .
More importantly , we need to make sure that creating and destroying these particles does n’t cause memory fragmentation .
Programming for a game console or mobile device is closer to embedded programming than conventional PC programming in many ways .
Memory is scarce , users expect games to be rock solid , and efficient compacting memory managers are rarely available .
In this environment , memory fragmentation is deadly .
Fragmentation means the free space in our heap is broken into smaller pieces of memory instead of one large open block .
The total memory available may be large , but the largest contiguous region might be painfully small .
Say we ’ve got fourteen bytes free , but it ’s fragmented into two seven - byte pieces with a chunk of in - use memory between them .
If we try to allocate a twelve - byte object , we ’ll fail .
No more sparklies on screen .
It ’s like trying to parallel park on a busy street where the already parked cars are spread out a bit too far .
If they ’d bunch up , there would be room , but the free space is fragmented into bits of open curb between half a dozen cars .
Here ’s how a heap becomes fragmented and how it can cause an allocation to fail even where there ’s theoretically enough memory available .
Even if fragmentation is infrequent , it can still gradually reduce the heap to an unusable foam of open holes and filled - in crevices , ultimately hosing the game completely .
Most console makers require games to pass “ soak tests ” where they leave the game running in demo mode for several days .
If the game crashes , they do n’t allow it to ship .
While soak tests sometimes fail because of a rarely occurring bug , it ’s usually creeping fragmentation or memory leakage that brings the game down .
Because of fragmentation and because allocation may be slow , games are very careful about when and how they manage memory .
A simple solution is often best — grab a big chunk of memory when the game starts , and do n’t free it until the game ends .
But this is a pain for systems where we need to create and destroy things while the game is running .
An object pool gives us the best of both worlds .
To the memory manager , we ’re just allocating one big hunk of memory up front and not freeing it while the game is playing .
To the users of the pool , we can freely allocate and deallocate objects to our heart ’s content .
Define a pool class that maintains a collection of reusable objects .
Each object supports an “ in use ” query to tell if it is currently “ alive ” .
When the pool is initialized , it creates the entire collection of objects up front ( usually in a single contiguous allocation ) and initializes them all to the “ not in use ” state .
When you want a new object , ask the pool for one .
It finds an available object , initializes it to “ in use ” , and returns it .
When the object is no longer needed , it is set back to the “ not in use ” state .
This way , objects can be freely created and destroyed without needing to allocate memory or other resources .
This pattern is used widely in games for obvious things like game entities and visual effects , but it is also used for less visible data structures such as currently playing sounds .
Use Object Pool when :
You need to frequently create and destroy objects .
Objects are similar in size .
Allocating objects on the heap is slow or could lead to memory fragmentation .
Each object encapsulates a resource such as a database or network connection that is expensive to acquire and could be reused .
You normally rely on a garbage collector or new and delete to handle memory management for you .
By using an object pool , you ’re saying , “ I know better how these bytes should be handled . ”
That means the onus is on you to deal with this pattern ’s limitations .
The size of an object pool needs to be tuned for the game ’s needs .
When tuning , it ’s usually obvious when the pool is too small ( there ’s nothing like a crash to get your attention ) .
But also take care that the pool is n’t too big .
A smaller pool frees up memory that could be used for other fun stuff .
In some ways , this is a good thing .
Partitioning memory into separate pools for different types of objects ensures that , for example , a huge sequence of explosions wo n’t cause your particle system to eat all of the available memory , preventing something more critical like a new enemy from being created .
Nonetheless , this also means being prepared for the possibility that your attempt to reuse an object from the pool will fail because they are all in use .
There are a few common strategies to handle this :
Prevent it outright .
This is the most common “ fix ” : tune the pool sizes so that they never overflow regardless of what the user does .
For pools of important objects like enemies or gameplay items , this is often the right answer .
There may be no “ right ” way to handle the lack of a free slot to create the big boss when the player reaches the end of the level , so the smart thing to do is make sure that never happens .
The downside is that this can force you to sit on a lot of memory for object slots that are needed only for a couple of rare edge cases .
Because of this , a single fixed pool size may not be the best fit for all game states .
For instance , some levels may feature effects prominently while others focus on sound .
In such cases , consider having pool sizes tuned differently for each scenario .
Just do n’t create the object .
This sounds harsh , but it makes sense for cases like our particle system .
If all particles are in use , the screen is probably full of flashing graphics .
The user wo n’t notice if the next explosion is n’t quite as impressive as the ones currently going off .
Forcibly kill an existing object .
Consider a pool for currently playing sounds , and assume you want to start a new sound but the pool is full .
You do not want to simply ignore the new sound — the user will notice if their magical wand swishes dramatically sometimes and stays stubbornly silent other times .
A better solution is to find the quietest sound already playing and replace that with our new sound .
The new sound will mask the audible cutoff of the previous sound .
In general , if the disappearance of an existing object would be less noticeable than the absence of a new one , this may be the right choice .
Increase the size of the pool .
If your game lets you be a bit more flexible with memory , you may be able to increase the size of the pool at runtime or create a second overflow pool .
If you do grab more memory in either of these ways , consider whether or not the pool should contract to its previous size when the additional capacity is no longer needed .
Most pool implementations store the objects in an array of in - place objects .
If all of your objects are of the same type , this is fine .
However , if you want to store objects of different types in the pool , or instances of subclasses that may add fields , you need to ensure that each slot in the pool has enough memory for the largest possible object .
Otherwise , an unexpectedly large object will stomp over the next one and trash memory .
At the same time , when your objects vary in size , you waste memory .
Each slot needs to be big enough to accommodate the largest object .
If objects are rarely that big , you ’re throwing away memory every time you put a smaller one in that slot .
It ’s like going through airport security and using a huge carry - on - sized luggage tray just for your keys and wallet .
When you find yourself burning a lot of memory this way , consider splitting the pool into separate pools for different sizes of object — big trays for luggage , little trays for pocket stuff .
This is a common pattern for implementing speed - efficient memory managers .
The manager has a number of pools of different block sizes .
When you ask it to allocate a block , it finds in an open slot in the pool of the appropriate size and allocates from that pool .
Most memory managers have a debug feature that will clear freshly allocated or freed memory to some obvious magic value like 0xdeadbeef .
This helps you find painful bugs caused by uninitialized variables or using memory after it ’s freed .
Since our object pool is n’t going through the memory manager any more when it reuses an object , we lose that safety net .
Worse , the memory used for a “ new ” object previously held an object of the exact same type .
This makes it nearly impossible to tell if you forgot to initialize something when you created the new object : the memory where the object is stored may already contain almost correct data from its past life .
Because of this , pay special care that the code that initializes new objects in the pool fully initializes the object .
It may even be worth spending a bit of time adding a debug feature that clears the memory for an object slot when the object is reclaimed .
I ’d be honored if you clear it to 0x1deadb0b .
Object pools are less common in systems that support garbage collection because the memory manager will usually deal with fragmentation for you .
But pools are still useful there to avoid the cost of allocation and deallocation , especially on mobile devices with slower CPUs and simpler garbage collectors .
If you do use an object pool in concert with a garbage collector , beware of a potential conflict .
Since the pool does n’t actually deallocate objects when they ’re no longer in use , they remain in memory .
If they contain references to other objects , it will prevent the collector from reclaiming those too .
To avoid this , when a pooled object is no longer in use , clear any references it has to other objects .
Real - world particle systems will often apply gravity , wind , friction , and other physical effects .
Our much simpler sample will only move particles in a straight line for a certain number of frames and then kill the particle .
Not exactly film caliber , but it should illustrate how to use an object pool .
We ’ll start with the simplest possible implementation .
First up is the little particle class :
class Particle { public : Particle ( ) : framesLeft_ ( 0 ) {} void init ( double x , double y , double xVel , double yVel , int lifetime ) { x_ = x ; y_ = y ; xVel_ = xVel ; yVel_ = yVel ; framesLeft_ = lifetime ; } void animate ( ) { if ( ! inUse ( ) ) return ; framesLeft_ -- ; x_ += xVel_ ; y_ += yVel_ ; } bool inUse ( ) const { return framesLeft_ >
0 ; } private : int framesLeft_ ; double x_ , y_ ; double xVel_ , yVel_ ; } ;
The default constructor initializes the particle to “ not in use ” .
A later call to init ( ) initializes the particle to a live state .
Particles are animated over time using the unsurprisingly named animate ( ) function , which should be called once per frame .
The pool needs to know which particles are available for reuse .
It gets this from the particle ’s inUse ( ) function .
This function takes advantage of the fact that particles have a limited lifetime and uses the _framesLeft variable to discover which particles are in use without having to store a separate flag .
The pool class is also simple :
class ParticlePool { public : void create ( double x , double y , double xVel , double yVel , int lifetime ) ; void animate ( ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < POOL_SIZE ; i ++ ) { particles_ [ i ]. animate ( ) ; } } private : static const int POOL_SIZE = 100 ; Particle particles_ [ POOL_SIZE ] ; } ;
The create ( ) function lets external code create new particles .
The game calls once per frame , which in turn animates each particle in the pool .
The particles themselves are simply stored in a fixed - size array in the class .
In this sample implementation , the pool size is hardcoded in the class declaration , but this could be defined externally by using a dynamic array of a given size or by using a value template parameter .
Creating a new particle is straightforward :
void ParticlePool :: create ( double x , double y , double xVel , double yVel , int lifetime ) { //
Find an available particle .
for ( int i = 0 ; i < POOL_SIZE ; i ++ ) { if ( ! particles_ [ i ]. inUse ( ) ) { particles_ [ i ]. init ( x , y , xVel , yVel , lifetime ) ; return ; } } }
We iterate through the pool looking for the first available particle .
When we find it , we initialize it and we ’re done .
Note that in this implementation , if there are n’t any available particles , we simply do n’t create a new one .
That ’s all there is to a simple particle system , aside from rendering the particles , of course .
We can now create a pool and create some particles using it .
The particles will automatically deactivate themselves when their lifetime has expired .
This is good enough to ship a game , but keen eyes may have noticed that creating a new particle requires iterating through ( potentially ) the entire collection until we find an open slot .
If the pool is very large and mostly full , that can get slow .
Let ’s see how we can improve that .
Creating a particle has O ( n ) complexity , for those of us who remember our algorithms class .
If we do n’t want to waste time finding free particles , the obvious answer is to not lose track of them .
We could store a separate list of pointers to each unused particle .
Then , when we need to create a particle , we remove the first pointer from the list and reuse the particle it points to .
Unfortunately , this would require us to maintain an entire separate array with as many pointers as there are objects in the pool .
After all , when we first create the pool , all particles are unused , so the list would initially have a pointer to every object in the pool .
It would be nice to fix our performance problems without sacrificing any memory .
Conveniently , there is some memory already lying around that we can borrow — the data for the unused particles themselves .
When a particle is n’t in use , most of its state is irrelevant .
Its position and velocity are n’t being used .
The only state it needs is the stuff required to tell if it ’s dead .
In our example , that ’s the _framesLeft member .
All those other bits can be reused .
Here ’s a revised particle :
class Particle { public : // ... Particle * getNext ( ) const { return state_ .
next ; } void setNext ( Particle * next ) { state_ .
next = next ; } private : int framesLeft_ ; union { //
State when it 's in use .
struct { double x , y ; double xVel , yVel ; } live ; //
State when it 's available .
Particle * next ; } state_ ; } ;
We ’ve moved all of the member variables except for framesLeft_ into a live struct inside a state_ union .
This struct holds the particle ’s state when it ’s being animated .
When the particle is unused , the other case of the union , the next member , is used .
It holds a pointer to the next available particle after this one .
Unions do n’t seem to be used that often these days , so the syntax may be unfamiliar to you .
If you ’re on a game team , you ’ve probably got a “ memory guru ” , that beleaguered compatriot whose job it is to come up with a solution when the game has inevitably blown its memory budget .
Ask them about unions .
They ’ll know all about them and other fun bit - packing tricks .
We can use these pointers to build a linked list that chains together every unused particle in the pool .
We have the list of available particles we need , but we did n’t need to use any additional memory .
Instead , we cannibalize the memory of the dead particles themselves to store the list .
This clever technique is called a free list .
For it to work , we need to make sure the pointers are initialized correctly and are maintained when particles are created and destroyed .
And , of course , we need to keep track of the list ’s head :
class ParticlePool { // ... private : Particle * firstAvailable_ ; } ;
When a pool is first created , all of the particles are available , so our free list should thread through the entire pool .
The pool constructor sets that up :
ParticlePool :: ParticlePool ( ) { //
The first one is available .
firstAvailable_ = & particles_ [ 0 ] ; //
Each particle points to the next .
for ( int i = 0 ; i < POOL_SIZE - 1 ; i ++ ) { particles_ [ i ]. setNext ( & particles_ [ i + 1 ] ) ; } //
The last one terminates the list .
particles_ [ POOL_SIZE - 1 ] .
setNext ( NULL ) ; }
Now to create a new particle , we jump directly to the first available one :
O ( 1 ) complexity , baby !
Now we ’re cooking !
void ParticlePool :: create ( double x , double y , double xVel , double yVel , int lifetime ) { //
Make sure the pool is n't full .
assert ( firstAvailable_ != NULL ) ; //
Remove it from the available list .
Particle * newParticle = firstAvailable_ ; firstAvailable_ = newParticle -> getNext ( ) ; newParticle -> init ( x , y , xVel , yVel , lifetime ) ; }
We need to know when a particle dies so we can add it back to the free list , so we ’ll change animate ( ) to return true if the previously live particle gave up the ghost in that frame :
bool Particle :: animate ( ) { if ( ! inUse ( ) ) return false ; framesLeft_ -- ; x_ += xVel_ ; y_ += yVel_ ; return framesLeft_ == 0 ; }
When that happens , we simply thread it back onto the list :
void ParticlePool :: animate ( ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < POOL_SIZE ; i ++ ) { if ( particles_ [ i ]. animate ( ) ) { //
Add this particle to the front of the list .
particles_ [ i ]. setNext ( firstAvailable_ ) ; firstAvailable_ = & particles_ [ i ] ; } } }
There you go , a nice little object pool with constant - time creation and deletion .
As you ’ve seen , the simplest object pool implementation is almost trivial : create an array of objects and reinitialize them as needed .
Production code is rarely that minimal .
There are several ways to expand on that to make the pool more generic , safer to use , or easier to maintain .
As you implement pools in your games , you ’ll need to answer these questions :
The first question you ’ll run into when writing an object pool is whether the objects themselves know they are in a pool .
Most of the time they will , but you wo n’t have that luxury when writing a generic pool class that can hold arbitrary objects .
If objects are coupled to the pool : The implementation is simpler .
You can simply put an “ in use ” flag or function in your pooled object and be done with it .
You can ensure that the objects can only be created by the pool .
In C++ , a simple way to do this is to make the pool class a friend of the object class and then make the object ’s constructor private .
class Particle { friend class ParticlePool ; private : Particle ( ) : inUse_ ( false ) {} bool inUse_ ; } ; class ParticlePool { Particle pool_ [ 100 ] ; } ;
This relationship documents the intended way to use the class and ensures your users do n’t create objects that are n’t tracked by the pool .
You may be able to avoid storing an explicit “ in use ” flag .
Many objects already retain some state that could be used to tell whether it is alive or not .
For example , a particle may be available for reuse if its current position is offscreen .
If the object class knows it may be used in a pool , it can provide an inUse ( ) method to query that state .
This saves the pool from having to burn some extra memory storing a bunch of “ in use ” flags .
If objects are not coupled to the pool : Objects of any type can be pooled .
This is the big advantage .
By decoupling objects from the pool , you may be able to implement a generic reusable pool class .
The “ in use ” state must be tracked outside the objects .
The simplest way to do this is by creating a separate bit field : template < class TObject > class GenericPool { private : static const int POOL_SIZE = 100 ; TObject pool_ [ POOL_SIZE ] ; bool inUse_ [ POOL_SIZE ] ; } ;
In order to reuse an existing object , it must be reinitialized with new state .
A key question here is whether to reinitialize the object inside the pool class or outside .
If the pool reinitializes internally :
The pool can completely encapsulate its objects .
Depending on the other capabilities your objects need , you may be able to keep them completely internal to the pool .
This makes sure that other code does n’t maintain references to objects that could be unexpectedly reused .
The pool is tied to how objects are initialized .
A pooled object may offer multiple functions that initialize it .
If the pool manages initialization , its interface needs to support all of those and forward them to the object .
class Particle { //
Multiple ways to initialize .
void init ( double x , double y ) ; void init ( double x , double y , double angle ) ; void init ( double x , double y , double xVel , double yVel ) ; } ; class ParticlePool { public : void create ( double x , double y ) { // Forward to Particle ... } void create ( double x , double y , double angle ) { // Forward to Particle ... } void create ( double x , double y , double xVel , double yVel ) { // Forward to Particle ... } } ;
If outside code initializes the object :
The pool ’s interface can be simpler .
Instead of offering multiple functions to cover each way an object can be initialized , the pool can simply return a reference to the new object : class Particle { public : // Multiple ways to initialize .
void init ( double x , double y ) ; void init ( double x , double y , double angle ) ; void init ( double x , double y , double xVel , double yVel ) ; } ; class ParticlePool { public : Particle * create ( ) { //
Return reference to available particle ... } private : Particle pool_ [ 100 ] ; } ;
The caller can then initialize the object by calling any method the object exposes : ParticlePool pool ; pool . create ( ) -> init ( 1 , 2 ) ; pool . create ( ) -> init ( 1 , 2 , 0.3 ) ; pool . create ( ) -> init ( 1 , 2 , 3.3 , 4.4 ) ;
Outside code may need to handle the failure to create a new object .
The previous example assumes that create ( ) will always successfully return a pointer to an object .
If the pool is full , though , it may return NULL instead .
To be safe , you ’ll need to check for that before you try to initialize the object : Particle * particle = pool . create ( ) ; if ( particle != NULL ) particle -> init ( 1 , 2 ) ;

I think something has come between us , " my husband jokes from the other side of our bed .
Young children can disrupt more than their parents ' sleep , but one couple finds a way for romance .
Something has .
That thing is now 2 years old and has recently taken to sleeping horizontally across the top of our bed , little feet carelessly mashing a cheek , frantic curls scrunched into an armpit .
Stretched out messily between us , she 's a way - too - obvious symbol of our sex life these days .
That 's supposed to be me there , in that underarm .
It should be me inhaling my husband 's pheromones , soaking up his scent and energy so when I wake I want more of it .
More of him .
Nice idea .
Worth trying .
Yet not very practical when there are three in the bed and one of them is still nursing .
( You see , my daughter hounds me in her sleep ; my breasts have become an all - night diner . )
My husband and I first brought the baby into bed because rushing in to check on a newborn every ten minutes never worked for us .
And because sleep , that elusive drug of parenthood , always worked for us .
We stuck with it because waking up to the two faces you love most in the world is the best thing ever .
And because now , none of us can quite imagine it any other way .
But let 's be honest here .
Sleeping in smell - proof flannel , inches away from baby breath , is n't romantic .
Besides fostering the occasional urge to scream " GIVE ME MY FRIGGIN ' SPACE ! " the Family Bed is also a perfect scapegoat for an ever - waning sex life .
Parenting.com : Baby - proof your love life
Just ask my mom .
I did n't , but she was happy to share just the same : " It ruined their marriage , " she said of a couple she once knew , in her best faux - neutral tone .
" They just stopped having sex . "
The first time we tried having sex after the baby was born , I got one of those horrible , gut - wrenching feelings that come with the possibility that one 's own mother is right .
There we were , awkward and stiff , stuffed into the far corner of the bed , afraid to move , afraid to move the baby and have her wake and make the whole thing moot .
We built a stack of pillows just tall enough to separate us from her , as if we could just do our business like she was n't there .
As if .
From then on we tried just about everything to romanticize the Family Bed .
At one point we even moved the guest bed into our room , putting two queen - size beds together .
The dream was that my husband and I would sleep on one bed , romantically wrapped in each other 's arms , while our daughter peacefully snoozed the night away on the other .
Parenting.com : Dad 's - eye view : Baby in the middle
The reality was a bed with strangely funky feng shui , and -- worse -- it did n't work .
I ended up crammed in the corner of a bed like always , my daughter attached like Velcro , while my husband took over the other bed , sprawled and snoring , alone .
So back went the guest bed to the guest room and in came a brand - new king - size bed and a new strategy for romance : giving up .
With all hope of sex gone , we were free to snuggle and sleep our hearts away .
Who put those two essential acts , sleeping and sex , together in the first place anyway ?
Certainly not a parent .
And with this new separation , I let bed sharing off the hook for our sex life , or lack thereof .
Now I have a new culprit : nighttime .
Pre-kid , the setting of the sun signaled a time for sidling off to bed , full of anticipation , starstruck .
It was a time to prowl each other 's bodies , to light the room with electricity .
Now nighttime means stumbling toward the mattress , dumbstruck with exhaustion .
Prowling is for our 400 - plus cable channels .
Electricity ?
For the remote control and sonic toothbrush .
And sex is for something else altogether .
With nighttime out of the picture , sex is for naptimes and guest rooms .
It 's for the kitchen floor , the couch .
It 's for baby - free zones like showers and hot tubs and , yes , every once in a while , even the bed .
Parenting.com :
What your husband wants you to know about your sex life
The giant , lovely king - size bed on those beautiful mornings when Grandma takes the baby to the zoo , and we can lie stretched out and naked and uncrowded -- except in those long - forgotten " Whoops , we just bumped into each other " and " Whoa , what 's that ?
Wow !
My , it 's getting hot in here " kinds of ways .
In our house , nighttime is the right time for sleeping with the ones you love .
But naptime , now that is the right time for everything else .

Uncelebrating the Fourth by Harry Browne July 4 , 2003 Unfortunately , July 4th has become a day of deceit .
On July 4 , 1776 , the Continental Congress formally declared its independence from Great Britain .
Thirteen years later , after a difficult war to secure that independence , the new country was open for business .
It was truly unique  the first nation in all of history in which the individual was considered more important than the government , and the government was tied down by a written Constitution .
It was the one nation where you could live your life secure in the knowledge that no one would ask for your papers , where you were n't identified by a number , and where the government would n't extort a percentage of your income as the price of holding a job .
And so each year July 4th has been a commemoration of the freest country in history .
False Celebration
But the America that 's celebrated no longer exists .
The holiday oratory deceitfully describes America as though it were the unique land of liberty that once was .
Politicians thank the Almighty for conferring the blessings of liberty on a country that no longer enjoys those blessings .
The original freedom and security have disappeared  even though the oratory lingers on .
What made America unique is now gone , and we are much the same as Germany , France , England , or Spain , with : confiscatory taxes , a Constitution and Bill of Rights that are symbolic only  merely documents used to justify governmental actions that are in fact prohibited by those documents , business regulated by the state in the most minute detail , no limits on what Congress or the President might decide to do .
Yes , there are some freedoms left , but nothing like the America that was  and nothing that you can't find in a few dozen other countries .
The Empire Gone , too , is the sense of peace and security that once reigned throughout the land .
America  bound by two huge oceans and two friendly neighbors  was subject to none of the never - ending wars and destruction that plagued Europe and Asia .
Now , however , everyone 's business is America 's business .
Our Presidents consider themselves the rulers of the world  deciding who may govern any country on earth and sending Americans to die enforcing those decisions .
Whereas America was once an inspiration to the entire world  its very existence was proof that peace and liberty really were possible 
Americans now live in fear of the rest of the world and the rest of the world lives in fear of America .
The Future Because the education of our children was turned over to government in the 19th century , generations of Americans have been taught that freedom means taxes , regulations , civic duty , and responsibility for the whole world .
They have no conception of the better life that could exist in a society in which government does n't manage health care , education , welfare , and business  and in which individuals are free to plot their own destinies .
Human beings are born with the desire to make their own decisions and control their own lives .
But in most countries government and social pressures work to teach people to expect very little autonomy .
Fortunately , in America a remnant has kept alive the ideas of liberty , peace , and self - respect  passing the concepts on from generation to generation .
And so today millions of Americans know that the present system is n't the right system  that human beings are n't born to serve the state and police the world .
Millions more would be receptive upon being shown that it 's possible to have better lives than what they 're living now .
Both groups need encouragement to quit supporting those who are taking freedom away from them .
You and I may not have the money and influence to change America by ourselves , but we can keep spreading the word  describing a better society in which individuals are truly free and government is in chains ( instead of the opposite ) .
And someday we may reach the people who do have the money and influence to persuade tens of millions of Americans to change our country for the better .
I do n't know that it 's going to happen , but I do know it 's possible .
I know that the urge to live one 's own life is as basic in human beings as the will to live and the desire to procreate .
If we keep plugging away , we may eventually tap into that urge and rally the forces necessary to restore the real America .
And then the 4th of July will be worth celebrating again .

Where did everything come from ?
Do n't say , " the Big Bang . "
To say that everything came from the Big Bang is like saying babies come from maternity wards — true in a narrow sense , but it hardly goes back far enough .
Where did the stuff that went " bang " come from ?
What was it ?
Why did it bang ?
Inflationary universes need not be natural , argues Guth ( plotting the curving boundaries of hypothetical artificial universes against a space - time axis ) .
In his view , an advanced race could harness the engines of inflation and create a whole cosmos from scratch .
Indeed , our universe could be such a creation .
Before Alan Guth came along , cosmologists seldom dared to guess .
The Big Bang theory , based on speculations dating back to 1922 and confirmed by astronomers in the 1960s , posited that the universe began as a minuscule fireball of extreme density and temperature and that it has been expanding and cooling ever since .
But the theory said nothing about what came before or even during the split second when everything went bang .
In December 1979 Guth , then 32 and an obscure physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center , emerged as the first scientist to offer a plausible description of the universe when it was less than one - hundredth of a second old .
During an unimaginably explosive period between 10 - 37 second and 10 - 34 second after its birth , Guth said , the universe expanded at a rate that kept doubling before beginning to settle down to the more sedate expansion originally described by the Big Bang theory .
Guth 's theory of inflation — the name he coined for this superfast early - universe expansion — has since vanquished every theoretical challenge and grown stronger with each new cosmological finding , including the latest , largest one : that the universe 's expansion rate , long thought to be slowing , is actually accelerating .
" There 's no competition , but that 's not for lack of trying , " says cosmologist Alexander Vilenkin of Tufts University .
" Many people have tried to develop a model that addresses the same problems , and they have failed . "
Guth 's reputation has ascended with the theory :
He has gone from an underemployed postdoc to cosmology 's leading man .
In April of last year , he received the Benjamin Franklin Medal in physics , often a precursor to the Nobel Prize .
Meanwhile , the time has come to contemplate inflation 's largest implication , one that seemed overreaching for an unproved theory in 1979 but that now must be faced squarely .
The whole universe may be , to use Guth 's phrase , " a free lunch . "
The primordial " stuff " of inflation , he and other cosmologists contend , is very likely a spontaneous creation , a no-strings gift that boiled out of absolutely nowhere by means of an utterly random but nonetheless scientifically possible process .
Now that inflation theory is approaching dogma , it is bringing science to the brink of answering one of the largest questions of all :
Why is there something rather than nothing ?
To find out , I walk across campus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where Guth is the V. F. Weisskopf Professor of Physics .
His office is in building 6 — at aggressively utilitarian MIT , buildings are numbered , not named — at the end of a quarter - mile connector that students call " the infinite hallway . "
I knock .
Guth is n't there .
" He 's always late , " a passing professor says helpfully .
Guth 's assistant unlocks the door for me .
It looks like something went bang in Guth 's office : Even by distracted - genius standards , it is a terrific mess .
A pile of 39 empty soda bottles , mostly Diet Pepsi , leans against the wall .
The litter includes a half - finished grande coffee , empty computer - parts boxes , and other debris .
Covering all the horizontal surfaces is seemingly every paper or book ever written about cosmology , astrophysics , or particle physics .
The piles on Guth 's desk are higher than his computer monitor .
It 's a big office by academic standards , maybe 15 by 20 feet , but one must hop between the few clear spaces on the carpet to get anywhere .
And here comes Guth , apologizing for his lateness , hand extended .
He is shortish at 5 feet 7 inches and energetic , sort of bouncy .
It 's easy to believe he was once the champion long jumper at his high school in Highland Park , New Jersey .
His neck projects forward at about a 45 - degree angle from his shoulders , giving the impression that he is fascinated by everything , which is true .
His graying hair covers his ears .
He wears gold - rimmed glasses , a blue button - down shirt with no tie , khaki pants , casual brown leather shoes , and one of those nerd watches with a numeric keypad .
He talks quickly , with a strong Jersey accent .
He is 55 , the son of a dry cleaner .
He is a family man , with a son in college and a daughter in high school , and he is pleasantly down - to - earth , laughing loudly and often as we discuss the impossible parking situation at MIT .
As Guth talks , he seems naturally to drift back 15 billion years , to the moment when most cosmologists agree the universe began .
Soon we are among the nascent stars .
" It 's not a coincidence that the Bible starts with Genesis , " he says as we leave the building and hustle up Vassar Street , through a chill autumn wind blowing off the Charles River .
" Most people really want to know where we came from and where everything around us came from .
I like to strongly push the scientific answer .
We have evidence .
We no longer have to rely on stories we were told when we were young . "
We enter a small Italian restaurant on MIT 's north side .
There is no such thing as a free lunch here .
Guth 's breaded sole is $ 10.95 — good , he says , and worth the price .
An Inflationary UniverseThe universe according to Guth began in the era of quantum gravity , a time when all four forces of the universe — gravity , electromagnetism , the strong ( nuclear ) and weak forces — may have been unified .
Energy boiling out of this unstable stew grew during the brief inflationary period at an ever - doubling rate , then decayed into an electron - quark soup as those forces began splitting apart .
The soup 's fundamental particles combined into ever - more - complex forms as the universe cooled and expanded .

So if eight ounces of fish costs 11 bucks , and if , in a larger sense , nothing in this universe is ever " purchased " without an exchange of energy , how can the whole universe be free ?
Start , Guth says , by imagining nothing , a pure vacuum .
Be careful .
Do n't imagine outer space without matter in it .
Imagine no space at all and no matter at all .
Good luck .
To the average person it might seem obvious that nothing can happen in nothing .
But to a quantum physicist , nothing is , in fact , something .
Quantum theory holds that probability , not absolutes , rules any physical system .
It is impossible , even in principle , to predict the behavior of any single atom ; all physicists can do is predict the average properties of a large collection of atoms .
Quantum theory also holds that a vacuum , like atoms , is subject to quantum uncertainties .
This means that things can materialize out of the vacuum , although they tend to vanish back into it quickly .
While this phenomenon has never been observed directly , measurements of the electron 's magnetic strength strongly imply that it is real and happening in the vacuum of space even now .
Theoretically , anything — a dog , a house , a planet — can pop into existence by means of this quantum quirk , which physicists call a vacuum fluctuation .
Probability , however , dictates that pairs of subatomic particles — one positive , one negative , so that conservation laws are not violated — are by far the most likely creations and that they will last extremely briefly , typically for only 10 - 21 second .
The spontaneous , persistent creation of something even as large as a molecule is profoundly unlikely .
Nonetheless , in 1973 an assistant professor at Columbia University named Edward Tryon suggested that the entire universe might have come into existence this way .
In a paper titled " Is the Universe a Vacuum Fluctuation ? " he stated , " I offer the modest proposal that our Universe is simply one of those things which happen from time to time . "
Others scoffed at the idea .
If a from - nothing , briefly existing molecule is absurdly unlikely , physicists reasoned , a from - nothing , 15 - billion - year - old universe is vastly less likely .
So the situation remained for about five years .
Then , on November 13 , 1978 , Guth , while doing postdoctoral research in particle physics at Cornell University , chanced to stroll into a lecture on the Big Bang given by Princeton cosmologist Robert Dicke .
At the time , Guth thought the field of cosmology was irritatingly vague , a sandbox of speculative indulgence compared with the mathematically clean world of particle physics .
" If the week had been just a bit more hectic , I would have skipped the lecture , " he says .
But it was n't , and he did n't .
Dicke 's topic was the flatness problem , one of the Big Bang theory 's biggest mysteries .
Dicke explained that somehow the universe seems to be extremely " flat , " which means matter , velocity , and gravity all balance to put space - time precisely on the dividing line between a " closed " and an " open " geometry .
In a closed universe , space - time curves back on itself , such that light beams that start out parallel will actually meet .
In an open universe the beams will diverge .
The value of omega describes the ratio between the average density of matter in space and what that density would need to be to make the universe perfectly flat .
If omega equals one , the universe is flat .
Now back in Guth 's office ( explaining omega took much longer than the summary above suggests ) , he hunches forward on his dorm - issue orange couch , his excitement about this subject palpable .
" According to classic Big Bang theory , as the universe evolves , the value of omega is always driven away from one , " he says .
So if the universe starts out with an omega value of less than one , omega gets rapidly smaller as the universe ages .
If it starts with omega greater than one , omega gets rapidly larger .
The fact that omega is very close to one today — microwave background radiation measurements indicate it is within 10 percent of one — means that , according to classic Big Bang theory , one second after the bang , omega would have had to be between .999999999999999 and 1.000000000000001 .
But why ?
" I was intrigued , " says Guth .
" How could that number start out so finely tuned ? "
On December 6 , 1979 , after more than a full year of mulling over this and other Big Bang mysteries , Guth sat down at his desk and came up with the breakthrough that he called inflation .
He realized that omega did not have to be preposterously fine - tuned from the start .
An exponentially expanding early universe , which he would come to call the inflationary universe , would drive omega toward one , not away from it , making a flat universe inevitable .
Some cosmologists are as remote as their subject matter , but not Guth , who eagerly strides to the podium for a public lecture at MIT .
" It 's fun to see what kind of impact these ideas have on people who have not heard them , " he says .
" It rejuvenates my excitement . "
Huh ?
Return to that primordial vacuum , a boiling stew from which pairs of positive and negative subatomic particles bubble into being for the briefest of instants .
Inflationary theory suggests that what erupted was a " false vacuum , " a peculiar form of matter predicted to exist by many particle theorists , although the real article has never been observed .
A false vacuum is characterized by a repulsive gravitational field , one so strong it can explode into a universe .
Another peculiarity of the false vacuum is that it does not " thin out " during expansion as , say , a gas does — the density of the energy within it remains constant even as it grows .
So the false vacuum 's expansion , accelerating exponentially as its repulsive force compounded , actually created vast quantities of ever - doubling energy , which decayed into a seething plasma of particles such as electrons , positrons , and neutrinos .
As the early universe went along doubling every microsecond , the stuff in it doubled , too — out of nowhere .
The electrons , positrons , and neutrinos became a sort of hot soup , which 300,000 years later neutralized to form simple atoms .
The simple atoms , like hydrogen , helium , and lithium , were ripped apart and crushed together to form more complex , heavier atoms inside stars .
Exploded into space by supernovas , they became the matter we see — and are — today .
The initial bit of false vacuum required by Guth 's calculations turned out to be mind - bendingly small : A patch one - billionth the size of a proton would do .
And the required period of exponential growth was very short .
In perhaps just 10 - 34 second , he suggested , the universe expanded by 25 orders of magnitude , to roughly the size of a marble , an increase equivalent to a pea growing to the size of the Milky Way .
The inflationary process , Guth discovered , would push omega toward one with incredible swiftness .
The reason is best expressed by analogy .
The universe appears to be virtually flat for the same reason that Earth 's surface appears to be virtually flat to a person standing on that surface .
The very fabric of space becomes relatively " stretched " so that in as few as 100 doublings in size , its curvature is effectively canceled .
And what about the conservation of energy ?
According to Einstein 's theory of relativity , the energy of a gravitational field is negative .
The energy of matter , however , is positive .
So the entire universe - creation scenario could unfold without breaking conservation - of - energy laws .
The positive energy of all matter in the universe could be precisely counterbalanced by the negative energy of all the gravity in the universe .
This also is more than theory .
Observations are consistent with the idea , and calculations totaling up all the matter and all the gravity in the observable universe indicate that the two values seem to precisely counterbalance .
All matter plus all gravity equals zero .
So the universe could come from nothing because it is , fundamentally , nothing .
" It is rather fantastic to realize that the laws of physics can describe how everything was created in a random quantum fluctuation out of nothing , and how over the course of 15 billion years , matter could organize in such complex ways that we have human beings sitting here , talking , doing things intentionally , " says Guth , leaning , if possible , even farther forward .
Three weeks later I attend a lecture Guth gives to the New York Academy of Sciences .
It 's an august gathering , sold - out , and Guth handles questions with aplomb , even an off - the - wall query about " negative consciousness waves " stemming from the September 11 terrorist attacks ( Guth suggests that rational thought , such as what cosmology brings to bear on the origin of the universe , could make the world a more peaceful place ) .
But how do we know if any of this is true ?
" There really are tests , " Guth says .
Readings from the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite , launched in 1989 , show that the temperature of the radiation that pervades the universe is astoundingly uniform .
Standard Big Bang cosmology theory without inflation offers no explanation .
Some mechanism would have to transmit energy and information at about 100 times the speed of light for these vastly distant parts of the background radiation to " know " and reflect one another 's temperature .
Inflation , expanding at faster - than - light speed , is the only known way such uniformity could be spread so widely .
( Incidentally , such expansion does not violate the cosmic speed limit .
Einstein correctly asserted that nothing in the universe could exceed light 's speed , but even as the cosmos grew at faster - than - light speeds , no particle within it could ever win a race with a beam of light . )
Inflation theory also predicts what are called density perturbations — small ripples in this uniformity that become seeds for galaxy formation .
The galaxies we observe today are just what inflation theory suggests should have been created .
" The theories we have developed so far seem to be working shockingly well , " Guth says .
Still , cosmologists busily fiddle .
Roughly 50 forms of inflation have been proposed , named , and studied , including double , triple , and hybrid inflation , tilted hybrid inflation , hyperextended inflation , and inflation that is " warm , " " soft , " " tepid , " and " natural . "
In 1997 Guth tallied 3,000 published papers devoted to the subject ; he has since stopped counting .
Guth in particular credits cosmologists , including Stanford 's Andrei Linde and Princeton 's Paul Steinhardt , with refining the theory , but each variation preserves the essential elements of Guth 's original brainstorm :
Some state plays the role of the false vacuum and its repulsive gravity , and some decay of that state leads to the formation of matter .
The details , Guth believes , will tumble out of university labs , particle accelerators , and deep - space satellite readings for decades , if not centuries .
The latest wrinkle is that observations by two teams of astronomers in 1998 show that the rate of cosmic expansion is accelerating , not slowing as had previously been thought .
If these observations are right , Guth says , they offer proof that gravity can act repulsively .
In fact , the same type of repulsive force that originally powered inflation probably drives the universe 's current acceleration .
Since energy and mass are equivalent , this repulsive energy must also exert gravity , and if there were enough of it , it would preserve the original mass - gravity balance required to make the universe flat .
Inflation theory triumphs again .
" Whenever I try to organize the office , I get interrupted , so I never get anywhere , " says Guth , awash in the paper sea .
" I 'm also a saver .
I would rather keep a pile of junk , assuming there is something there I want , than throw the whole thing away and regret it . "
Guth is pursuing this and other cosmic investigations , but I frankly wonder how much headway he can make .
As we speak in his office , constant phone calls , urgent e-mails , and bureaucratic folderol assail the poor guy .
A confused freshman raps on the door , seeking approval for a transfer .
A fellow physics professor returns Guth 's call :
The " right " answer in the freshman physics quiz , Guth contends , is n't right enough , and they debate this for a while .
It 's odd .
If Alan Guth is the man who answered the central question of human existence — the origin of the universe — neither he nor those around him seem terribly awed by the fact .
Or perhaps that should n't be surprising .
Human beings have evolved to survive in this universe , not necessarily to be able to understand it .
A false vacuum , jittering from nothing into actuality and then erupting into a universe — or according to some newer variants of inflationary theory , an infinity of universes — is the kind of knowledge that tends to slide off the brain .
Guth remains obscure among the public at large because the theory itself remains rather inaccessible .
Large sections of his 1997 book , The Inflationary Universe , are very heavy sledding , despite Guth 's earnest efforts to make the underlying physics clear .
Guth admits that some aspects of his work are challenging even for him .
In one of the most charming sections of the book , he describes his first attempt as a particle physicist to explain inflation to a group of astrophysicists .
" I understood very little of what they were saying , so I had no idea why we were disagreeing , " he wrote .
So let 's be clear .
Is Guth saying that cosmology can crack the ultimate mystery ?
That creation can be just another physical process that science has rendered prosaic , like the discovery that germs cause disease or Earth circles the sun ?
Guth smiles and puts his fingertips together .
" I like to be careful how I put that , " he says .
" The way I like to say it is that we are approaching a scenario for the creation of the universe that is compatible with the laws of physics .
That raises the question : ' Where do the laws of physics come from ? ' "
He pauses .
" We are a long way from being able to answer that one . "
WHERE DO RULES COME FROM ?
Alan
Guth 's inflation theory explains the creation of the universe in a way that 's compatible with the laws of physics .
But where did the laws of physics come from ?
" One theory is that there are no laws of physics , that there are only properties of matter , " Guth says .
" According to this view , if there is no matter , then there are no properties . "
If that 's true then Guth 's speculations about how a universe might have started from nothing are absurd .
But Guth argues that quantum theory , the best theory yet for describing the physical world , seems to require independent laws .
" If you bang two electrons together with enough energy , you produce protons .
If there are no independent laws , then all the properties of protons must somehow be ' known ' by the electrons .
By extension every elementary particle must carry around enough information to produce the entire universe .
I find that difficult to believe . "
Guth adds that quantum theory holds that objects can appear and disappear according to specific laws , and the behavior of an absent object is just as predictable as the behavior of a present one .
" If laws are just properties of objects , " he says , " how can those laws continue to operate when the object is not really there ? " — B. L .
INFINITE INFLATING UNIVERSESSo far , what inflation theory predicts , the observable universe has reflected .
But cosmologists Andrei Linde , Alexander Vilenkin , and others have run with inflation 's premises to step beyond the bounds of what we can see or measure .
They speculate that the decay of the false vacuum — which , according to the inflation theory , created the matter of our universe — does not happen all at once .
While some regions decay into universes , other regions keep expanding and creating other universes .
Residual false vacuum from the creation of those universes creates still others , indefinitely .
Linde and Vilenkin call this " the eternally existing , self - reproducing inflationary universe . "
Guth contends that this scenario is not only possible , it seems like a sure thing .
" If a biologist discovered a bacterium that belonged to no known species , she would presumably invent a new species in which to classify it , " Guth wrote in his 1997 book , The Inflationary Universe .
" However , even though only a single specimen of the new species had been found , she would undoubtedly assume that it was the offspring of a bacterial parent cell . "
Guth predicts that " any cosmological theory that does not lead to the eternal reproduction of universes will be considered as unimaginable as a species of bacteria that cannot reproduce . " —

A Spanish woman who deceived a US fertility clinic about her age and become the oldest woman to give birth has died at 69 , leaving behind two - year - old twins , newspapers reported on Wednesday .
Maria del Carmen Bousada gave birth in December 2006 after telling a clinic in Los Angeles that she was 55 , the facility 's maximum age for single women receiving in - vitro fertilisation .
Guinness World Records said the 66 - year - old was the oldest woman on record to give birth and the case ignited fierce debate over how much responsibility fertility clinics have over their patients .
Bousada told an interviewer at the time that the Pacific Fertility Centre did not ask her for identification .
She maintained that , because her mother had died at 101 , she stood a good chance of living long enough to raise her children .
Dr Vicken Sahakian , director and owner of the clinic , said Bousada falsified her birth date on documents from Spain .
the riaa have sued Jammie Thomas - Rasset of minnesota for $ 2,000,000 for illegally downloading music .
argh .
what utter nonsense .
this is how the record companies want to protect themselves ?
suing suburban moms for listening to music ?
charging $ 80,000 per song ?
punishing people for listening to music is exactly the wrong way to protect the music business .
maybe the record companies have adopted the ‘ it ’s better to be feared than respected ’ approach to dealing with music fans .
i do n’t know , but ‘ it ’s better to be feared than respected ’ does n’t seem like such a sustainable business model when it comes to consumer choice .
how about a new model of ‘ it ’s better to be loved for helping artists make good records and giving consumers great records at reasonable prices ’ ?
i’m so sorry that any music fan anywhere is ever made to feel bad for making the effort to listen to music .
the riaa needs to be disbanded .

The National Organization for Marriage — the folks who brought you the much - mocked “ Gathering Storm ” ad — have taken on a real nutcase as the newest member of their board of directors .
Joining the board and representing the LDS church is science fiction author and Mormon Times columnist Orson Scott Card .
He replaces Matthew Holland , who is the son of a member of the LDS church ’s Quorum of the Twelve , who recently stepped down from the board .
Last summer , Orson Scott Card called for the overthrow of civil government if California ’s Proposition 8 had failed .
Writing for the Mormon Times , he said :
Regardless of law , marriage has only one definition , and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy .
I will act to destroy that government and bring it down …
In 2004 , Card tried to address the argument that same - sex marriage would somehow diminish his marriage .
That ’s an argument that many anti-gay activists have had a hard time articulating .
Most would concede , “ Well , of course it would n’t affect my marriage , ” but Card was game to give the argument a go .
Claiming to have “ gay friends ” of his own , this is what he came up with :
But homosexual “ marriage ” is an act of intolerance .
It is an attempt to eliminate any special preference for marriage in society — to erase the protected status of marriage in the constant balancing act between civilization and individual reproduction .
So if my friends insist on calling what they do “ marriage , ” they are not turning their relationship into what my wife and I have created , because no court has the power to change what their relationship actually is .
Instead they are attempting to strike a death blow against the well - earned protected status of our , and every other , real marriage .
They steal from me what I treasure most , and gain for themselves nothing at all .
They wo n’t be married .
They ’ll just be playing dress - up in their parents ’ clothes .
He also thinks he understand why we want same - sex marriage .
Raising the most - gays - are - gay - because - they - were - molested canard , he writes :
The dark secret of homosexual society — the one that dares not speak its name — is how many homosexuals first entered into that world through a disturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse , and how many of them yearn to get out of the homosexual community and live normally .
It ’s that desire for normality , that discontent with perpetual adolescent sexuality , that is at least partly behind this hunger for homosexual “ marriage . ”
So this is just a small glimpse into the psyche of NOM ’s newest board member .
Maybe that explains the “ Gathering Storm ” ad .
Scott may well have provided the script .
Meanwhile , the parodies keep on coming :

It 's obvious - obama works for the same folks , just playing a different roll .
When dur chimpfurher was in the White House , his job was to serve the military - industrial / media complex by yanking the dialog to the right and enabling wholesale theft from the public coffers .
Now we see that obama stands for the same fundamental policies and represents the same folks .
His job was to represent " change " but to deliver little or none .
It is n't about " giving him time " .
He has already shown us that he can't be trusted .
Progressives need to get off this bandwagon - it will be difficult , but by taking strong stands AGAINST this administration , perhaps can build enough of a base to demand real change in 2012 and even have a credible candidate in 2016 .
The hard work to do so , however , needs to start NOW because otherwise we will just have another tweedle - dum / tweedle dee choice in 2012 and beyond .
Meaningful action will demand boycotting the corpocracy that undermines our democracy and that will take some brave bloggers to organize .
The " superblogs " proclaim it is n't there job - most are just obamabots and represent the interests of a few large organizations / wealthy individuals that underwrite them .

Incremental ' change ' is all he promised and will deliver ..
I hope he can sleep at night and is n't taking what powell said ' everybody ' was on during the 1 degree worse than now bush years ..
he could n't possibly ever be nagged by the promises he made he has no intention of keeping .
when he said something like ' I will work tirelessly for YOU the people ' at the camera he was gazing deep into the loving hearts of his benefactors , goldmanattmonsantoisraeliraqquagmire .
things would change , but not much .. you were believed in , and elected mr preznint because you were in fact more commoner than the next white guy .
you HAD to be better than the usual pol .. but you were n't .
you were exactly the same .
it was your hearts desire to be just like the big boys and be accepted .. it always seemed to me black people had to work like twice as hard to achieve the same positions as whites had .
you 'd think they would buckle down and try to do as much radical good for their minority or anyone that 's discriminated against once they were in power for their brief run .. after landing him at least three votes by my nagging people last time not to go with more of the same I feel like a real dupe .
I will totaly vote for mcsame and palin next time around for yuks .
think of the fun we 'll have .
then you 'll see dems with some fire in em .

I 'm one progressive who was never on his bandwagon .
I think there were quite a number of folks like myself that might have been Kucinich democrats and are very disappointed in the turn the party has taken .
I ultimately voted Nader .
I knew what was coming with Obama ...
He 's part of the establishment .
All one needed to do is look at his voting record and his rhetoric to know what he was going to do .
It was very obvious .
Unfortunately , there are tons of people voting lesser of two evils and there are others that projected what they thought he was onto him .
We all need to watch people 's actions , not their words .
We also need to be VERY diligent and do our research .
You might want to pay particular attention to the voices that the mainstream media blocks out .
Why were Kucinich , Gravel , Nader and McKinney blacked out of the media .
They still mostly are , although Kucinich occasionally gets a handout .
At this rate , I may never vote major party again .
Unfortunately , it 's so difficult for anyone else to get on the ballot .

Progressives registered as Democrats should walk out on the party .
We will not get the Democratic Party in shape for either 2012 or 2016 .
We need to get serious about forming a coalition third party and finding a consensus candidate among the various progressive groups , the socialists , the independents and the Greens .
The trouble is we scatter our shot every election .

Lance Armstrong has denied he rode deliberately to gain time on his team - mate Alberto Contador when the bunch split in the closing stages of Monday ’s Tour de France stage .
The 37 - year - old said he used his experience and a little luck to move up the bunch at a crucial time , just as a subtle kink in the road meant a change of wind direction .
Although the wind was not strong , it was enough to spark a fight for wheels further down the line .
” It ’s not rocket science , ” he said .
“ When it ’s flat and even a little bit windy there ’s a chance the bunch will split .
” It was experience , luck .
I saw what was up ahead and I moved up so I was 20 guys back . ”
He said he was unaware of where Contador was in the bunch when the split happened .
Asked if he had been trying to gain time on his team - mate , he said : “ That was n’t the objective . ”
Armstrong and his Astana team - mates Yaroslav Popovych and Haimar Zubeldia were among the 29 - strong front group , which contained the yellow jersey , Fabian Cancellara and the entire Columbia - HTC team .
The break went clear with 31 kilometres to go and the gap stayed around 20 to 25 seconds before stretching out to 41 seconds by the finish .
With 15 kilometres to go , Armstrong moved to the front of the group and made a circling motion with his finger , signalling to Zubeldia and Popovych to start working .
He added : “ We did n’t ride for a long time .
We waited for a long time .
They [ Columbia ] were frustrated we were n’t riding .
” The whole Columbia team was up there , we had three up there .
I ’ve won the Tour de France seven times , it makes no sense why we would n’t ride . ”
Armstrong started the day 22 seconds behind Contador , the fourth best of the Astana team overall .
He ended it third overall behind Cancellara and Tony Martin , but more importantly , 19 seconds ahead of Contador .

Again , like a year ago , people had enough of the fact that the setuptools project is not maintained since 9 months .
Phillip
Eby explained that he does n’t have time to do it unless someone would pay him for that .
But in the meantime , he does n’t bless anyone to do it .
Well , he has blessed some people to do it ( Ian Bicking and Jim Fulton ) , but unfortunately these people are not willing to do it because they have a lot of other projects going on .
Other people that could maintain it , including me , fail in his “ unqualified people ” category 🙂
So we are all locked in a strange situation where tons of patches are ready to be commited in the setuptools tracker but are not making it .
Several non-public forks have started to appear around of course .
So again , I decided with some other people to create a fork called “ Distribute ” .
It ’s a real fork located here : http://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute.
By real I mean that this fork was not created with the purpose of forcing Phillip to do a release like we did last year for the 0.6c9 release , but with the intention to free us from that strange situation where we all depend on his wills and ( lack of ) time .
The plan is to release a first version next week , that corresponds to the setuptools 0.6 branch , with some patches applied .
Next , we are planning to start a 0.7 version where the code will be splitted in several distributions :
a distribution for pkg_resources
a distribution for the setuptools package itself
a distribution for easy_install
A little bit of bikeshedding is going on to pick a name for that fork , and we ended up running a poll .
( vote ! )
Now , right after I have announced this plan on Distutils - SIG , Phillip reacted by annoucing a similar plan , e.g. splitting the setuptools project in several distributions .
But since he previously said that he did n’t have the time to do it , I doubt that it ’ll work out unless he ’s opening its development to a wider range of developers and maintainers .
That ’s the strange world of packaging …

Earlier today we mentioned that Digg.com appears to have changed the behavior of its short URLs so they no longer go to the source of the story for logged - out users : instead they direct visitors to a landing page on Digg.com .
The change has many negative implications for publishers , including the fact that readers who think they are creating a link to your content are actually just pushing traffic to Digg .
Digg support : " This is working as intended "
Now Digg appears to have confirmed this questionable move was intentional .
While we 've yet to receive a response to our email , reader JD Rucker ( who was one of the first to blog about the change ) complained about the issue to Digg support and received a reply confirming the switch has been made deliberately :
JD : Not sure if this is a mistake or something that was planned , but it appears that when people who are n't logged into Digg click on Diggbar links , they are now taken to the Digg page and not the source .
Are you aware of this ?
Is it going to be fixed ?

Digg Support
The move has many implications which are sure to irk Digg 's most valuable source of traffic and content : the publishers .
Not only is Digg diverting traffic away from publisher sites , but many Twitter applications added Digg URL support on the assumption that Digg URLs would always work the same way as Bit.ly , TinyURL and the rest .
For instance , Tweetmeme , the service we use at Mashable to allow people to retweet posts , rotates through multiple URL shorteners including Digg .
In some cases , people trying to share our stories will unknowingly be directing their followers to Digg instead of this site .
Old Links Redirect , Too
There are two further problems .
First , Digg has failed to inform the community of the change - users are still using the shortener to create links to their favorite sites with no idea that they 're actually diverting their Twitter followers to Digg .
Worse : all previously created Digg URLs now appear to redirect to Digg.com .
When I created this Tweet in April and included a Digg URL , I meant to link to a story here on Mashable .
Now Digg has decided it would be better for my followers to visit their site , even though that was n't my intent when creating the link .
It 's the equivalent of opening a highway to Chicago , then diverting it to St. Louis without telling any of the drivers .
In short , Digg has broken the trust relationship with its publishers and users .
They might not be hurting , however , since the use of Diggbar links significantly increased the amount of traffic to their site .
Now that they 're driving a bunch more traffic from thousands of hijacked URLs , they 'll experience a veritable traffic bonanza at the expense of users and publishers .
UPDATE : Digg founder Kevin Rose responds on Twitter saying he was not aware of the change since he has been on a two - week vacation :
I have briefly — or perhaps not so briefly , my interests being unpredictable beasts — shifted the focus of my research to lazy specialization .
This topic was discussed extensively , but not comprehensively , in Michael Jonathan Thyer ’s dissertation , Lazy Specialization , and seems to have received little attention otherwise .
This is unfortunate .
I consider it a very important topic .
Lazy specialization is the idea that a functional program be incrementally optimized during its execution , in tandem with partial application .
For example , consider the code :
let g = f x in ( g y , g y ' )
A lazy specializer would evaluate g as far as it could using only information about x , and then apply the resulting optimized function to y and y’ .
If most of f’s work could be done using x alone , you could save a lot of time this way .
That is the obvious appeal .
The drawback on the other side is that the evaluation machinery of a lazy specializer is more involved than a whnf evaluator , so the whole system takes a speed hit as a result .
But so far as I can tell , the only such machines in existence are in a high - level , symbolic , proof - of - concept form , in which the hit is several orders of magnitude .
Where ’s the research getting down and dirty with this technology , seeing if we can bring it within a factor of 10 or less ?
Let me argue why we would want to pursue this seriously :
Here is a quote by Heinrich Apfelmus on laziness , at the end of his article on lazy sorting :
Well , it ’s highly unlikely that algorithms get faster by introducing laziness .
I mean , lazy evaluation means to evaluate only those things that are really needed and any good algorithm will be formulated in a way such that the unnecessary things have already been stripped off .
But laziness allows to simplify and compose algorithms .
Sometimes , seemingly different algorithms turn out to be two sides of the same coin when formulated with lazy evaluation .
Is n’t it great that finding the k - th minimum is not only an adaption of quicksort but can readily be obtained from it by composing it with (!! k ) ?
I ’d say that data structures are the sink for most of the creativity of lazy functional programmers .
We spend lots of energy getting a data structure to represent exactly the things we need , sharing what needs to be shared .
The key point about data structures is that they can be decomposed ; you can peel off the root of a tree and leave yourself with only one of the branches , and the other branch will be garbage collected .
A lazy specializer promotes full - blown functions to the level of data structures .
Functions can now be decomposed ( by composing ! ) in the same way , sharing important pieces and forgetting unimportant ones .
Observe this stream implementation :
type Stream a = Nat -> a cons x xs z = case z of { Zero -> x ; Succ z' -> xs z' } tail s z = s ( Succ z )
Where Nat is the standard lazy natural type ( constructors Zero and Succ ) .
What happens when we evaluate tail ( cons 1 ( cons 2 R ) ) , for some stream R ( I do n’t want to bother creating an infinite stream ) .
I ’ll use the HNF strategy that I discussed previously .
Let ’s watch :
tail ( cons 1 ( cons 2 R ) ) ( \s z. s ( z+1 ) ) ( cons 1 ( cons 2 R ) ) ( \z. cons 1 ( cons 2 R ) ( Succ z ) ) ( \z. ( \z '. case z ' of { Zero -> 1 ; Succ z ' -> cons 2 R z' } ) ( Succ z ) ) ( \z. case Succ z of { Zero -> 1 ; Succ z ' -> cons 2 R z' } ) ( \z. cons 2 R z ) ...
Where did the 1 go ?
Gone , collected by the garbage collector , just as if we had written Stream in the more conventional way .
GHC would have held on to the 1 forever .
Nat -> a behaves exactly like the Stream data structure .
The structure of Nat has induced a structure for Nat -> a .
That is a beautiful form of data structure composability .
Working in a language that uses a lazy specializer also comes with a very important mental advantage : abstracting a pattern using a higher - order function always has constant - time overhead .
I.e. you will never make your program run faster by unfolding abstractions .
This encourages the more composable higher - order style , providing a snappy comeback to any speed nazi .
It also removes the encouragement to fiddle with the details of a function for more speed : beta-equivalent formulations will all turn into the same code in the end , so clarity is the only remaining variable , and can be maximized .
Ideas like GHC’s {-# RULES #-} are no longer fickle compiler constructions , but can now be made trustworthy optimizations .
If the left side of a rule is in a certain form ( a restricted sort of normal form ) , then its evaluation can be baked into the interpreter and will be applied as aggressively as possible .
It is invariant to fiddling around with higher - order presentations and whatnot ; they will be folded away and the rule can be seen .
( But I ’m not convinced RULES are necessary anymore ; perhaps you can simply express the rules you want as a functional construction ? )
The most convincing property of lazy specializers to me was the primary bench test for Thyer ’s dissertation : the “ tower of interpreters ” test .
This is the property that , if you write an interpreter for a language L , and in language L write an interpreter for M , and in M write an interpreter for N , etc. , all the layers will be squashed away and you will end up with code that runs just as fast as it did in the base language ( with a constant time overhead for eliminating the layers ) .
You can design a language with all the bells and whistles you want , give it a semantics , and you may immediately use without a significant penalty .
This is a huge abstraction win .
But there are a fair number of open problems in lazy specialization , more than just getting faster specialization machines .
The explosion problem is tricky , in which , say , fix gradually becomes specialized to things like \f .
f ( f ( f ( f ( f ( f ( f ( fix f ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ; not useful , just eats up memory .
The leap from complete laziness to optimal evaluation needs to be understood better .
But in particular , I think we need a real LS to program with for a while , just to see what its dynamics are and to bring out its real - world problems .
I leave you with an addendum ( which I snipped from the main argument ) , explaining my perceived connection between LS and FRP , my personal holy grail .
All of my research links back to FRP somehow :
Finally , as if you did n’t know this was coming , there is a connection between lazy specializers and FRP , the holy grail of my functional programming life .
It is a particular manifestation of the first point I made , designing streams as functions .
I figure , all I have to do is design a data structure for time , with the right domain structure , perhaps something like :
data Time = Zero | Next Double Time
And then define our friends :
type Behavior a = Time -> a type Future a = ( Time , a )
The implementation types exactly equal to their desired semantics , the most beautiful implementation I could ask for .
Evaluation for a behavior b has a structure like :
sample0 = b Zero b1 = b .
Next 0.033 sample1 = b1 Zero b2 = b1 .
Next 0.033 sample2 = b2 Zero ...
Each successive b is optimized , the unneeded bits at the front thrown off just as in the Stream example .
The reason this ca n’t be encoded in regular Haskell is because the algebra for FRP includes a value of type Future ( Behavior a ) , and we ca n’t see inside the Future because it is a functor , and thus arbitrary functions separate us from the enclosed Behavior , about which we must selectively forget things .
However , the lazy specializer has no trouble looking through those functions , and will modify the behavior anyway , ridding us of the dreaded space leak .

The Rant
Nuke 'em ' till they glow and then shoot 'em in the dark
By DOUG THOMPSON
Feb 5 , 2003 , 13:23
OK .
Im convinced .
Warm up the B - 52s , fire up the Stealths , unleash the smart bombs .
Time to nuke Iraq until it glows and then shoot Saddam in the dark .
Using the massive snooping capabilities of the National Security Agency , whose recorders could hear a fly fart from 2,000 miles away , Powell laid out the long - awaited evidence that Saddam and his goons are moving his weapons of mass destruction out of sight just before the United Nations weapons inspectors show up .
It s a shell game .
Guess which shell has the nukes , the chemical weapons , the multiple warheads under it ?
Saddam is always at least one step ahead of the boys from the UN .
But he cant escape those pesky satellites , the long - range listening capabilities of the NSA or the various assets the CIA has tucked away in Iraq .
They gave Secretary of State Colin Powell what he needed to prove Iraq still has the weapons , still lies about having the weapons and gets enough advance notice of what the UN is up to so that the weapons can be moved and hidden whenever needed .
Bush laid out the evidence early Wednesday morning at a breakfast briefing of Congressional leaders .
Even perennial Democratic doubter Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware came away a believer , saying if I had this evidence before a jury that was an unbiased jury , I could get a conviction , "
Sure , the Russians and Chinese still say they re not totally convinced , although the Russkies did tell Iraq it ought to come clean , but nobody expected them to come around anyway .
Others may argue the UN weapons inspectors ought to have another shot at finding the weapons but Powells presentation made it clear the Iraqis have a pipeline to the UN and know ahead of time just when and where the inspectors will go .
So lets stop pussyfooting and employ the U.S.s primary tool of diplomacy  bomb them into the Stone Age and then send in the troops to kill whatever is left moving .
We re gonna have to do it sooner or later .
Get it over with .
March right into Baghdad , walk up to Saddam , put a gun to his forehead and blow the lying bastards brains all over the floor of one of his lavishly decorated palaces .
Surprised ?
Dont be .
Like most Americans , I m a savage at heart .
Blood lust pumps through my veins just like all red- blooded patriots .
The only thing that worried me up until this morning was a lack of documentation to justify leveling Baghdad and sending Saddam off to meet Allah .
Powell provided that documentation .
As predicted on this web site on Tuesday , he didnt have hard , fast , proof that Saddam is playing footsies with Osama , but he provided the usual suspected links between Iraq and terrorism at large and that s reason enough to rain down hellfire and damnation .
Powell did document the sad , and scary , fact that the Butcher of Baghdad has weapons of mass destruction and has not intention of getting rid of them .
Will frying Saddam bring more terrorism to the land of the free and the home of the brave ?
Yes , but its coming anyway .
September 11 proved our shores can , and will , be breached and while John Ashcroft and Tom Ridge are busy spying on normal Americans , the real terrorists will slip through and bring more death and destruction .
So let s stop talking and prove to the world that this is America , damnit , and Americans can flex their muscles and pound our enemies into submission whenever we please .
Coalitions ?
We dont need no stinkin coalitions .
Carpet bomb Iraq and get it over with .
But save a bomb or two for North Korea .
Sooner or later , we re going to have to deal with them .
And Osama .
Hes probably still hiding in a cave somewhere , planning more mayhem and proving that anyone can use religion to try and justify murder .
And save a few for the others who are out there who havent shown up on the threat list yet but who are just waiting for their chance to bring the giant , evil Satan to its knees with something even bigger and more spectacular than turning the World Trade Center into a giant coffin .
Maybe we better start building more bombs .
Bigger bombs .
Smarter bombs .
We re gonna need them .

Welcome to Halabja !
I predict the war against Iraq will start on the symbolic date , March 16th 2003 .
Saddam 's Opression of the Kurdish Minority .
A PUBLIC ATTENTION ON THE GENOCIDE OF THE KURDISH PEOPLE IN IRAQ .
Those who are responsible for the chemical massacre of more than 5,000 Kurds in Halabja and the genocides of more than 182,000 Kurds during  Anfal operations in 1988 by the Iraqi regime must be brought to justice as criminals against humanity .
By standing against using chemical weapons , I condemn these crimes and their criminals , and I demand justice .
The halabja and anfal crimes have to be recognized as genocides against humanity by the UN and the world governments .

So What Did Happen On Friday 17th March 1988 ?
The Full Horror of Saddam 's Savagery
A Daylight Massacre without Warning
By : Olga Maithland
It all began somewhat earlier .
The very first attack took place on April 15th 1987 .
Four planes flew very low over seven villages in Northern Iraq dropping very unusual bombs - in the shape of unfamiliar shells .
They did not explode like the bombs they had experienced until then .
The odd - looking shells threw up a soft yellow cloud instead .
All the inhabitants suffered puffy and watery eyes , dry throats and harsh coughs .
Skin burns developed .
Some lost their sight for up to tow weeks depending how close they were to the attack .
Down wind the suffering was greater , hit the full impact of what was likely to have been the powerful poison , mustard gas .
The next day April 16th , six more villages and a whole valley was bombed .
In the village of Sheikh Wassanan with a population of 500 , twelve aircrafts flew in at 7 am while families were breakfasting .
For nearly fifteen minutes both chemical and conventional weapons were dropped .
Everybody was poisoned to some extent .
121 were killed instantly .
The 286 injured hurried to seek medical attention in the nearby town of Arbil .
The Iraqi authorities demanded first their signature on a declaration naming Iran as the " perpetrator " of the attack .
They refused , and were subsequently arrested and ultimately those who had not died through lack of treatment were killed and buried in mass graves .
These attacks were just the beginning .
By mid 1987 chemical attacks had become a daily reality .
Mustard gas first remained the predominant chemical weapon .
Later more toxic gas nerve gases were used .
Wave upon of planes dropped their deadly poisonous gases killing people instantly without leaving any apparent injuries .
Escaping death became more difficult .
The conventional methods of protection were no longer useful as the gases being odourless and lighter than mustard gas , seeped through the wet breathing turbans damaging the respiratory system of the victim .
People were seen gasping and struggling for breath and helplessly lying on the ground jerking with convulsions .
One witness 27 - year - old K.Bakhtiar said : " I knew it was a different gas attack .
People were behaving strangely and so were the animals acting as if they were struggling some were lying on the ground .
I saw birds falling off trees .
I was frightened and I ran away towards the hill .
I felt weak , unable to control my movements .
My mouth was full .
I could not see properly but worst of all I could not breathe properly .
I can not remember any more , I lost conscious . "
Over sixteen months , Saddam dropped his deadly gases on fourty different occasions .
The most spectacular was striking Halabja , but the villages suffered equally .
In the village of Birjinni villagers described how eight planes dropped four bombs each .
The survivors told of clouds of smoke billowing upward ' white , black and then yellow ' , rising as a column about 150 feet in the air ; then the column began to break up and drift .
As it moved people smelt gas .
It was a pleasant smell at first ; 'it smelled of apples and something sweet . '
Others said it reminded them of ' pesticides in fields ' .
Soon however ' It became bitter .
It affected our eyes , mouth and skin .
All of a sudden it was hard to breath .'( ref. Genocide in Iraq , P 270 ) .
In the village of Ruseh the people in the valley were struck .
The survivors were up in the mountain , but just tow hundred meters down , it was a different story .
As one man described how his brother ' began frothing at the mouth , and choking and his skin became dark .
Than he died . ' ( Genocide in Iraq , p 273 ) .
After another attack a woman was found lying on the ground sighing and moving her lips as if she wanted to speak , but no words came out .
She had vomited and her skin was black .
She died three hours later .
a few yards away the grass was blackened and dead farm animals lay all round .
When the family cleaned her body , her dry and blackened skin came off in their hands .
( p. 275 ibid ) .
The climax came on 16th March , 1988 with the attack on Halabja - a wholesale murder taking place in broad day light under the very nose of the world .
It was eleven in the morning when Iraqi Air force helicopter appeared over the city of Halabja with tow men inside taking pictures of down below .
According to Jeffrey Goldberg writing in The New Yorker , a young woman Nasreen Abdl Qadir Muhammed was outside her home preparing rice , bread and beans for the family .
Nusreen was just sixteen , freshly married to her cousin Bakhtiar Abdl Aziz Halabja , 31 .
Close by was her sister Rangeen , 15 .
The bombardment began when the Iraqi Army positioned on the main road fired artillery shells , and the Air force dropping bombs .
The attack ebbed by tow O'clock when the rhythm changed .
As Nasreen told Goldberg : '
At the end of the bombing the sound changed .
It was n't so loud .
It was like pieces of metal just dropping without exploding .
We did n't know why it was so quiet .
In another neighbourhood , middle aged Muhammed saw an unusual sight : ' A helicopter had come to the town , and the soldiers were throwing white pieces of paper out of the side . '
In retrospect , he understood they were measuring wind speed and direction .
Nearby , a man , Awat Omer , 20 , was overwhelmed by the smell of garlic and apples .
Nasreen gathered the food quickly , but she noticed the odd smells .
' At fist it smelled bad like garbage .
And then it was a good smell like sweet apples .
Then like eggs . '
As she went into the house , she noticed the caged partridge that her father kept . '
The bird was dying .
It was lying on its side . '
She looked out of the window . '
It was very quiet but animals were dying .
The sheep and goats were dying . '
Nasreen ran to the cellar where her family had taken shelter . '
I told everybody there was something wrong .
There was something wrong in the air . '
The people in the cellar panicked .
The bombardment made it difficult to abandon the shelter .
Only splinters of light penetrated the basement .
But they a sharp pain in her eyes like ' stabbing needles . '
Her eyes became very red .
Then the children started throwing up . '
They were in such pain and crying so much .
They were crying all the time .
My mother was crying .
Across the city other families were also making the same decision to flee .
But Nouri Hama
Ali recalled : ' The chemical clouds were on the ground .
They were heavy .
We could see them .
People were dying all around .
When a child could not go on , the parents , becoming hysterical with fear .
Abandoned him .
Many children were left on the ground by the side of the road .
Old people as well .
They were running , then they would stop breathing and die . '
They saw powder on the ground , when touched it caused blisters .
New symptoms developed .
Breathing had stopped so quickly that people dropped on the ground ' as if frozen ' said Nasreen .
' There was a small baby on the ground away from her mother .
I thought they were sleeping .
But she had dropped the baby and then died .
And I thing the baby tried to crawl away but it died too .
It looked like everyone was sleeping . '
Nasreen and her family decided to escape to higher ground .
Running proved difficult .
The children could n't walk .
They were so sick .
They were exhausted from throwing up .
We carried them in our arms . '
A truck passed them and stopped . '
They driver said he could n't go on and wandered away .
He left his wife in the back of the truck .
He told us to flee if we could .
They chemicals affected his brain because why else would someone abandon his family ? '
Meanwhile , Bakhtiar , Nasreen 's husband was frantic
He was outside the city when the attack started .
He hunted desperately for her .
He had acquired from a clinic tow syringes of atropine , a drug that counters the effect of nerve agents .
He injected himself with one , the other he saved .
Neighbours finally guided him to a house near a mosque on the hill . '
I called out for Nasreen .
I heard crying and I went inside the house .
When I got there I found that Nasreen was alive but blind .
Everybody was blind . '
Nasreen had lost her sight about an hour or tow before Bakhtiar found her .
She had been searching for food for the children when her eyesight failed .
' I found some milk and I felt my way to them and then I found their mouths and gave them milk . '
She said .
Bakhtair organised the children . '
I wanted to bring them to the well .
I washed their heads .
I took them tow by tow .
Some of them could n't came .
They could n't control their muscles . '
Bakhtair still had one syringe of atropine .
He did not inject his wife .
She was not the worse in the group . '
There was a women named Asme .
She was not able to breathe .
She was yelling and running into the wall crashing her head .
I gave the atropine to the woman .
She died soon afterwards .
I should have given it to Nasreen . '
Nasreen was blind for twenty days .
Nasreen would live , but she kept a secret from Bakhtair . '
I could n't stop menstruating .
It would n't stop .
I kept bleeding .
We do n't talk about this in our society , but eventually a lot of women confessed they were also menstruating and could n't stop . '
Doctors gave Nasreen drugs that stopped the bleeding but they told her she would be unable to have children , as it indeed proved to be the case .
Today , fourteen years on , she is thirty , she is pretty but her face is expressionless .
She does n't seek pity .
But she has one request . '
I would like a doctor to help me with a cough I have had since that attack . '
As heavy clouds of gas smothered the city , people became sick and confused .
Awat Omer was trapped in his cellar with his family .
He recalled that his brother begun laughing uncontrollably and then stripped off his clothes and soon afterwards he died .
As night fell , the family 's children grew sicker , too sick to move .
In another neighbourhood , Muhammed Ahmed Fattah , 20 , was overwhelmed by the oddly sweet odour of sulphur and he too realized he must evacuate his family .
>
There were hundred and sixty people wedged together in the cellar . '
I saw the bomb drop thirty meters from our house .
There was shouting and crying in the cellar .
People became short of breath . '
One of the first was Muhammed 's brother Salah . '
His eyes were pink .
There was something coming out of his eyes .
He was so thirsty .
He was demanding water . '
March 16th was supposed to be Muhammed 's wedding day .
'
Every preparation was done . '
His fiance Bahar Jamal was among the first in the cellar to die . '
She was crying very hard .
I tried to calm her down .
I told her it was just unusual artillery shells , but it did n't smell the usual way weapon smelt .
She was smart .
She knew what was happened .
She died on the stairs . '
Death came quickly to others .
A woman named Hamida Mahmoud tried to save her tow - year - old daughter by allowing her to nurse from her breast .
Hamida thought the baby would n't breath in the gas if she was nursing .
She nursed for a long time .
her mother died while she was nursing but she kept nursing .
But the time Muhammed decided to go outside , most of the people in the basement were unconscious , many were dead , including his parents and three of his siblings .
For those hit by the cyanide vapour death was instantaneous .
The gruesome sight of bodies with discoloured skin , eyes open and staring where they have not disappeared into their socket , a greyish slime oozing from their mouths and fingers grotesquely twisted as if in pain .
Death seemingly caught them unawares in the midst of household chores .
Some had the strength to make it the doorways of their homes only to collapse there or a few feet beyond .
Here a mother seems to claps her children in a last embrace , there an old man shields an infant .
Victims within five hundred meters of a cyanide shell had no chance .
Le Nouvelle Observateur on 1st April , 1988 commented : ' Even the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany despite possessing substantial stocks , did not dare use them . '
The very fact that Saddam Hussein did and could again should keep us on the alert .
The scenes reported are neither from the Hiroshima atomic bombing nor snaps from Hitler 's crime in Dachau .
What has been experienced took place only fourteen years ago in the Kurdish City of Halabja .
The wretched survivors many still suffering with the after effects of lung disease , cancer , genetic disorders , babies born with birth defects are a continuing testimony and reminder that the threat continues .
Who knows where the next " thud " will land ?

200 years from now , I want their children 's children 's children 's children
to cower and cringe in fear whenever they hear the sounds of jet engines overhead
because their legends tell of fire from the sky .
I want them to hide in dark caves and holes in the earth ,
shivering with terror whenever they hear the roar of diesel engines
because the tales of their ancestors talk about metal monsters
crawling over the earth , spitting death and destruction .
I want their mothers to be able to admonish them with
" If you do n't behave , the Pale Destroyers will come for you " ,
and that will be enough to reduce them to quivering obesience .
I want the annihilation to be so complete that their mythology
will tell them of the day of judgment when the stern gods from across the sea
.. the powerful ' Mericans .. destroyed their forefathers ' wickedness .

" Over the Hills and Far Away " - modern version ;
( from SHARPE'S EAGLE )
Four thousand dollars on the drum ,
For those wholl volunteer to come
And enlist to fight the foe today ,
Over the hills and far away .
Oer the hills , we will attack
Afghanistan and then Iraq ;
George Bush commands and we obey ,
Over the hills and far away .
When duty calls me , I must go
To stand and face another foe ;
But part of me will always stray
Over the hills and far away .
Oer the hills , from sea to land ,
Iraq , and then on to Iran ;
George Bush commands and we obey ,
Over the hills and far away .
If I should fall to fight no more ,
As many comrades did before ,
Then ask the pipes and drums to play
" Over the hills and far away " .
Oer the hills , pro patria ,
Iran and then Arabia ;
George Bush commands and we obey ,
Over the hills and far away .
Then fall in , lads , behind the drum ,
With colours blazing like the sun ,
Along the road to come what may ,
Over the hills and far away .
Oer the hills we will advance ,
Through Belgium , Germany , and France ;
George Bush commands and we obey ,
Over the hills and far away . "

It is a measure of how effective Powell 's presentation was that we are seeing this wave of absolutely childish rants from people who feel that ignoring this growing menace will somehow be a Good Thing because it will be " peaceful . "
And so it will , until a crew of Atta Boys shows up in a rented crop duster .
There is nothing particularly noble about sitting around waiting to be sprayed with nerve gas or dusted with anthrax spores .
Responsible adults would not allow such a thing to happen to themselves or their children if they could prevent it .
There is no doubt that the sort of fanatics who would fly airplanes full of people into buildings full of people would spray those people with poisons or disease , if they could .
And now there is no doubt that manufacturing facilities for just such poisons and disease exists under the control of Saddam Hussein , who is not exactly Mr. Sanity .
Nobody wants war , but nobody wants to get sprayed like a bug , and have the same thing happen to the people around them by the tens of thousands .
We can't guarantee that will never happen , but we can sure reduce the odds a whole bunch .
To hear this disappointed child tell it , we will now kill the entire Iraqi population and " nuke 'em until they glow . "
Well , no .
A disappointed child might break all the toys in anger , but we have adults in charge now .
Saddam Hussein will be removed , his weapons caches destroyed , and his manufacturing facilities blown up .
That 's all ; then we 're done .
The Iraqis will still have their country , plus they wo n't have a brutal dictator making their relatives disappear at random all the time .
The Iraqis might even think it 's an improvement .
What would improve Doug Thompson is a dose of emotional maturity .
Somehow I doubt he 'll get it .

Funerals have been held for victims whose remains were identifiable
Kuwaiti police investigating a deadly blaze at a wedding tent that killed 43 women and children say the ex-wife of the groom has confessed to starting it .
The tent was consumed by flames in seconds in the worst civilian disaster in Kuwait 's modern history .
Fire service officials said the tent had only one exit and did not meet fire safety regulations .
Media reports say the woman told police she had wanted to avenge ill - treatment by her husband before their divorce .
Later the Ministry of the Interior , quoted by the official news agency Kuna , announced that one person had been arrested on suspicion of causing Saturday 's fire , but no further details were given .
Bride escaped
Earlier on Monday the Qabas newspaper said the 23 - year - old ex-wife of the groom had told police she used petrol to set fire to the packed and highly inflammable wedding tent .
The victims were all women and children because traditionally wedding celebrations are segregated along gender lines .
The Kuwait Times newspaper reported that the groom 's new bride had escaped injury but that her mother and a sister had died .
Some local newspapers have criticised the government over the blaze , which happened in the town of Jahra , saying its handling revealed failures in disaster response planning .
MPs criticised the lax official reaction to unlicensed tents being erected in residential areas despite the implicit safety risks .
Most of the bodies were burned beyond immediate recognition , police said , and forensic officials were now working to identify the victims .
Ninety guests were injured in the blaze and ensuing stampede , and five burns victims are in a critical condition , medical officials say .
By the Communist Party of India ( Marxist - Leninist ) Liberation
May 21 , 2009 -- According to an announcement by the Sri Lankan government , the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) chief Prabhakaran is dead , killed by the Lankan Army .
The LTTE is yet to confirm the death , and some sections are questioning the veracity of the claim .
The exact manner of Prabhakaran 's death is clouded in suspicion .
The Sri Lankan government claims he was killed when the army opened fire on a van in which he and two top aides were travelling ; initially , Sri Lankan officials said the van caught fire under rocket attack and Prabhakaran 's body was badly burnt .
Subsequently , they claimed to have found his body , dead from a bullet , dressed in fatigues and having identification papers on him , during a combing operation .
There are many unanswered questions about the manner of the death : including the suspicion that he might have been captured alive by the Lankan army , or that he might have taken his life before capture .
The dubious account of the LTTE chief 's death is only the latest in the saga of bloody massacre that the Sri Lankan government has unleashed on the Tamil people .
The CPI ( ML ) Liberation condemns the Sri Lankan government ’s killing of LTTE chief Prabhakaran , who had pursued the cause of Tamils ' national self - determination struggle for over three decades , and the CPI ( ML ) Liberation firmly holds that the politics of repression , elimination and extermination of Tamil people and leaders cannot resolve the issue of Tamil national self - determination in Sri Lanka .
The Sri Lankan government 's “ famous victory ” is not a grand military triumph but a crime against humanity , particularly , against the Tamil masses in Sri Lanka .
Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa is a despot who should be branded as a war criminal and tried for deliberate and ruthless violation of international conventions on war .
Rajapakse is trying to garner international support for his war , by claiming it to be a crusade against terrorism embodied in the LTTE .
But the emergence of the LTTE is mainly a reaction to the Sri Lankan state - sponsored Sinhala chauvinism that has massacred thousands of Tamil people in the island nation .
To miss this point is an injustice to the national self - determination struggle of Tamil people and their history .
We do share the democratic opinion that condemned the killing of Rajiv Gandhi on Indian soil and of other Sinhala and Tamil political leaders in Sri Lanka .
We also have our share of criticism of the LTTE and Prabakaran .
Prabakaran was a leader of the Tamil national self - determination struggle and not a communist or socialist as he claimed on some occasions .
Prabakaran 's excessive reliance on military might and intolerance to dissent without any long - term political strategy and diplomacy that could tilt the balance of forces in favour of his own ideal of Tamil Eelam was a major flaw .
But all these things cannot justify the killings of tens of thousands of innocent Tamil masses by the Sri Lankan military offensive .
If the LTTE could be at the head of decades - old liberation struggle of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka in spite of its autocratic behaviour and intolerance to dissent , it is not merely because of its military might , which was reinforced by none other than the Indian government in ' 80s , but because of the objective aspirations of Tamil masses for emancipation from the clutches of majority Sinhala chauvinism .
Elimination of the LTTE cannot mean elimination of the Tamil people ’s aspirations for liberation in Sri Lanka .
Rhetoric like ``equal rights '' etc. , being peddled by the Sri Lankan president , and also the abstract concept of ``devolution of powers ' ' being advocated by the Indian government and Tamil Nadu state Chief Minister Karunanidhi may not really satisfy the Tamil masses who have undergone the brunt of decades - long chauvinism , brutal oppression and genocide .
Solutions can lie only in thoroughgoing autonomy for the Tamil people , negotiated in the backdrop of a genuine end to the politics of Sinhala chauvinism .
To imagine that a solution would be possible in the backdrop of a bloody massacre and chauvinistic triumphalism ``celebrating '' the decimation of the Tamil movement is delusional .
Civil liberty and Tamil activists protesting against the Indian army convoys suspected of supplying arms to the Lankan army have been arrested and jailed in Coimbatore , thus muzzling dissent even in India .
This incident also disproves the Indian claim of no involvement in the war against Tamils in Sri Lanka .
It is true that there was no India Peace Keeping Force involved in the war this time but supplying arms even from the point of view of promoting business interests is against the Geneva Convention .
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Karunanidhi is in Delhi busy bargaining for ministerial berths for his family in the new central government when the entire state of Tamil Nadu is burning and mourning the death of Prabakaran .
Neither the Karunanidhi ’s election stunt of fasting nor the presence of dozens of Tamil ministers of various parties in the central government could stop the war .
In fact , all bourgeois parties in Tamil Nadu , including DMK , PMK and AIADMK , have only played politics on the corpse of thousands of Tamil masses in Sri Lanka in order to promote their own electoral prospects .
Jayalalitha ’s election promise of ``Separate Tamil Eelam '' when Tamil people were on the run to save their lives was the biggest ever fraud on the people of Tamil Nadu .
As long as the fundamental issues involved with the aspirations of Tamil masses in Sri Lanka are not politically resolved , military elimination of LTTE and Prabakaran may only be a beginning of another round of newer forms of struggle for national self - determination of Tamil people in Sri Lanka .
Everything has not come to an end with the elimination of LTTE , but rather a fresh chapter has only begun .
’ twas a famous victory ...
... “ With fire and sword the country round
Was wasted far and wide ,
And many a childing mother then ,
And new - born baby , died ;
But things like that , you know , must be
At every famous victory .
“ They say it was a shocking sight
After the field was won ;
For many thousand bodies here
Lay rotting in the sun ;
But things like that , you know , must be
After a famous victory .
... “ Great praise the Duke of Marlboro ’ won ,
And our good Prince Eugene . ”
“ Why , ‘ twas a very wicked thing ! ”
Said little Wilhelmine .
“ Nay , nay , my little girl , ” quoth he ;
“ It was a famous victory .
“ And everybody praised the Duke
Who this great fight did win . ”
“ But what good came of it at last ? ”
Quoth little Peterkin .
“ Why , that I cannot tell , ” said he ;
“ But ‘ twas a famous victory . ”

WASHINGTON -- Convicts have no constitutional right to DNA testing , the Supreme Court found , a ruling that left the accessibility of potentially critical evidence to the discretion of individual states .
In a 5 - 4 vote along the court 's ideological divide , the conservative majority acknowledged that " modern DNA testing can provide powerful new evidence unlike anything known before . "
But the opinion , by Chief Justice John Roberts , drew a sharp distinction between defendants , who are presumed innocent at trial , and convicts like ...
Never mind that the film is scripted by Oscar - winning writer Diablo Cody .
According to this trailer , the dialogue plays a distant second fiddle to the physical charms of Megan Fox
I wonder how long it 'll be before a trailer opens with : " In a world where Megan Fox gets naked … "
It might not represent the whole film , but it would make some studio bosses ever so happy .
Just imagine : " In a world where Megan Fox gets naked almost constantly …
Where even the loosest clothes prove strangely restrictive …
And sprinkler systems have a habit of going off at the most inappropriate times … "
Jennifer 's Body - swim .

" … And swimming in the nude is not only an option … it 's compulsory . "
Or , as the trailer - man would pronounce it , " CUMPULSEORORERRY " , because inserting fewer than five extra syllables would be a waste of breath .
And so it would go on , perhaps promising , " One man had to choose whether to love , or whether to die " , or something .
There do seem to be some other things happening in the trailer for Jennifer 's Body , other than the presence of the lovely – and terribly popular – Ms Fox .
It would appear to be a story about the most attractive and popular girl in school , the kind that – say the ominous words on screen – all the girls want to be friends with and all the boys would die for .
That girl is Fox .
Jennifer 's Body - school Photograph : Public Domain
These words are to be taken literally because she also , as coincidence would have it , eats teenage boys .
And girls , when she 's feeling that way inclined .
We 're not entirely sure why , from the trailer .
But just know that to be the case .
Megan Fox : she 's a man-eater .
Official .
Being a teenager now means dicing with death on a daily basis .
It 's a world fraught with danger .
In the heyday of John Hughes – may he rest in peace – it was more a case of debating whether going out with someone meant compromising your social standing .
Jennifer 's Body - breakfast club Photograph : Public Domain
Whereas now the question is , invariably : " Will you go out with this person even if doing so is likely to cause you to die a bloody and painful death on account of their being supernatural ? "
If you can get through your teenage years now without falling in love with – and / or becoming prey to – a vampire , troll , werewolf , warlock , demon or in fact whatever it is that can do this without hurting ,
Jennifer 's Body - hot Photograph : Public Domain
then you 're frankly not trying hard enough .
What with all the promise of spooky love - tangle and bloody murder on display , it 's a surprise to learn that this is the latest from Diablo Cody .
If there 's much whip - crack dialogue of the quality of Juno in Jennifer 's Body , it 's difficult to see where they 're keeping it .
Certainly , this trailer seems to be promising less talk , more action .
More lip - licking , teen - chomping , hot - tongue action .
And explosions , of course .
Jennifer 's Body - splode Photograph : Public Domain
That 's Amanda Seyfried , who plays Jennifer 's best friend , here demonstrating the " cool guys do n't look at explosions " rule , as well as that her world - saving activities will , in no way , interfere with Megan Fox wearing as little as possible , to a rocking soundtrack .
Jennifer 's Body - music by Photograph : Public Domain
Whoever this trailer has been marketed towards , it 's clearly with the key points of :
1 ) Hot Fox
2 ) Horror
3 ) To a mainly emo soundtrack you 'll love !
Is that all there is to Jennifer 's Body ?
Sometimes people end up missing out on some very clever films just because they 've been branded " genre teen flicks " .
Or perhaps not .
Maybe this is just points one , two and three , on a loop .
In which case : great trailer !
Sigh .
New hope for blindness
A surgeon who pioneered laser eye surgery to cure short - sightedness has announced a new technique which could prevent millions of older people from going blind .
Professor John Marshall , a senior ophthalmologist at King ’s College , London , has developed a short pulse laser technique which can delay the onset of age - related macular degeneration ( AMD ) .
AMD is the leading cause of blindness in over 60s in the western world and 200,000 people in the UK are currently registered as blind or partially sighted because of it .
Prof Marshall said the treatment delayed the effect of ageing , a process he calls “ retinal rejuvenation ” , without damaging any other cells .
“ The treatment is really treating ageing , ” he said .
The technique works by stimulating enzymes to remove waste material from a thin membrane behind the retina , called Bruch ’s membrane .
Improvements to sight were reported after the treatment was used in a clinical trial involving more than 100 diabetics .
A new trial will treat patients already suffering from AMD in one eye with the aim of saving the sight in their better eye for as long as possible .
Prof Marshall said once people have advanced AMD in one eye , studies show the condition usually develops in the second eye in 18 months to three years .
“ If you can delay the onset by three , four , six , seven or 10 years , it ’s proof of the principle , ” he said .
He said the aim was to preserve their sight for the rest of their lives .
Prof Marshall said he hoped the treatment would be available within two to five years and one day people in their 40s who have a family history of AMD could choose to have the treatment as a way of preventing the onset of the condition .
Conventional lasers can cause damage to the light sensitive cells in the eye but Prof Marshall said : “ With this laser it ’s been specifically designed so we do n’t cause any damage to the light sensitive cells or to any cells . ”
There is currently no treatment for the most common form of AMD – known as “ dry ” AMD – which the new laser technique could prevent .
The more aggressive “ wet ” form of AMD – where new blood vessels cause bleeding and scarring behind the retina – can be stabilised with drugs .
Prof Marshall said : “ If you look to the age of 80 we all have a 30 % chance probability that we will have some visual loss due to the ageing process even if we do n’t have the AMD gene .
“ All of us will ultimately lose vision if we live long enough .
“ That ’s why the impact of this rejuvenation is profound . ”
Tom Pey , director of external affairs for Guide Dogs for the Blind , which funded the research , said : “ This is potentially a huge breakthrough for millions of people across the world .
“ The science behind this is proven and , although clinical trials are likely to take years , we hope it will be in the low single figures .
“ We must stress though that the work Professor Marshall carried out is primarily going to be a preventative for those who do not yet show signs of AMD .
For those who already are suffering , there is unfortunately unlikely to be major improvements as once the damage is done , as in so many causes of blindness , the effects are irreversible . ”
Prof Marshall has worked in the field since the early 1960s and said he first looked at the effects of lasers on the eye after being given a grant by the RAF to investigate the risks .

More Cash – For Cash For Clunkers
It was only a week ago that we were talking about how the Cash For Clunkers program had only been active for a week , and it was already running out of money .
$ 1 billion dollars had been assigned to the program and after demand for the vouchers was much larger than anticipated , the program had to suspended .
The government did n’t want people trying to get a voucher that was no longer available .
Now , a week after the program was suspended , Congress has decided , that the program was such a rousing success , that they should give it another $ 2 billion dollars .
Last night they approved an extension of the program :
The U.S. Senate approved and sent to the White House on Thursday a $ 2 billion extension of the “ cash for clunkers ” autos sales incentive program .
The measure , approved by 60 to 37 , extends the successful program that has raised sales of the U.S. auto industry .
President Barack Obama was expected to sign it quickly .
The initial $ 1 billion of funding approved in June for “ clunker ” business has generated more than $ 920 million in rebates and more than 220,000 in auto sales .
Supported by the incentive program , U.S. auto sales overall were down about 12 percent in July from a year earlier , but it was their best performance this year .
A poll was done last week asking a sampling of Americans if they thought the program should get more money .
54 % of the respondents said that it should n’t .
Despite a majority of people being against the added expenditure , the program will now be continued .
The swift “ success ” of the program was stunning to a lot of people , and to some degree the government was n’t ready for the deluge of voucher submissions that happened in the first week .
The administration , stunned by the swift success of the initiative and stung by a series of administrative glitches in trying to process rebates , had warned that the “ clunker ” measure would be suspended if more money was not approved by week ’s end .
The House of Representatives passed the $ 2 billion extension on July 31 .
The Senate took a week to affirm that action .
Some senators did introduce amendments to the bill in order to try and kill the measure , but those were soundly defeated – and the program was approved for more money .
So if you had planned on trading in your clunker , you may still have time – but act quick !
Who knows when it will run out this time .
For more details about the program , who is eligible , and what you need to do , check out these articles on our site :
Not Everyone Is Happy With The Program
Some critics argue that while the program was successful in handing out vouchers to thousands of car buyers , that the program is n’t truly as much of a boon to our economy and the environment as is being suggested .
Groups that are n’t as happy with the program as car dealers ?
Mechanics , scrap yard operators and automotive aftermarket parts dealers .
Who does n’t like the government ’s “ cash for clunkers ” program ?
Your mechanic , for one .
Owners of automotive repair shops say the program to help invigorate sales of new cars is succeeding at their expense .
Bill Wiygul , whose family owns four repair shops in Virginia , said he has already had five or six customers decide against repairs .
A man who sits on the board of Mr. Wiygul ’s bank traded in his car rather than repair it .
“ He ’d been a customer at our Reston store since it opened , ” Mr. Wiygul said … .
How do we get on the special interests , special treatment bandwagon ?
How much is it going to cost me and to whom shall I send the check ? ” he said .
“ Who picks the winners in this game ’ cause obviously the game is fixed . ”
So the government is subsidizing one industry ( in which it now holds a large stake ) at the expense of other small business people like mechanics and repair shops .
The automotive aftermarket , a $ 250 billion industry that employs about 4.6 million people , could be among the biggest losers in the clunkers program , said Kathleen Schmatz , head of the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association : “ It ’s everybody from the Fortune 500 parts manufacturer all the way through the supply chain to the independent repair shop . ”
The group that lobbies for independent mechanics in Washington agreed .
“ This package will hurt mechanical repairs without question .
You are taking older vehicles that are still fine to use and removing them , ” said Robert Redding Jr. , the Automotive Service Association ’s Washington representative .
“ If you ’re taking hundreds of thousands of vehicles that you normally service off the road with no consideration , it hurts people . ”
Has The Program Helped The Environment Or Stimulated The Economy ?
Even if you dismiss those who have been hurt as having sour grapes , you still need to consider whether the program will actually succeed in it ’s aims of helping the environment and stimulating the economy .
So , first , did it help the environment ?
Cash for clunkers could have the same effect on global warming pollution as shutting down the entire country — every automobile , every factory , every power plant — for an hour per year .
That could rise to three hours if the program is extended by Congress and remains as popular as it is now .
Climate experts are n’t impressed .
Compared to overall carbon dioxide emissions in the United States , the pollution savings from cash for clunkers do not noticeably move the fuel gauge .
Environmental experts say the program — conceived primarily to stimulate the economy and jump - start the auto industry — is not an effective way to attack climate change .
So it sounds like the program will have a negligible effect on the environment – especially when you take into account the scrapping of all the working cars that could have otherwise been kept running for years to come .
How about stimulating the economy ?
Alan Greenspan says that while he supports the program , he does n’t think that it helped to stimulate the economy .
The former head of the Federal Reserve gave a thumbs - up to the cash for clunkers program but said Sunday it is popular only because the economy was on its way back up and not because it was stimulative .
Alan Greenspan said that the program has worked to get people to buy cars and move stock , but he would n’t necessarily recommend it as an economic fix .
“ It ’s an interesting issue .
I mean , I have qualms about the concept , but there is no doubt that that very extraordinary response is a very important indicator that the state of confidence in the economy is beginning to pick up .
If we had been — the clunker program had been put in place six months ago , it would have probably been a dud , ” Greenspan said on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
So the program has been successful in Greenspan ’s eyes , but only because the economy was already starting on it ’s way to a slow recovery .
Still , the administration and many in congress are hailing the program as a marvelous success , and say that it is one of the main reasons for a rebound that is beginning to happen in our economy .
What do you think about the program ?
Has it been successful in it ’s aims , and was it a good idea ?
Or do you side with the critics of the program and think that the program is just another government money drain ?
( can you tell which side I come down on ? )

When it comes to food , it would be in your best interest to realize that you are being lied to on a daily basis .
If a big company grows it , processes it and sells it , then it 's probably garbage that you'd be better off not consuming .
In some cases , this problem goes far beyond " garbage " into another realm entirely .
This video is a rare glimpse behind - the - scenes of how news is really " made " in America and why corporate and " public " broadcasting - like corporate food - is entirely unreliable .

Would you eat food that was genetically modified ?
You probably already have .
Scientists have been tinkering with the DNA of commercial food for nearly two decades , and they ’ve covered most of the food pyramid .
Modern soybeans , cotton , tomatoes , potatoes , corn , rice , and sugarcane have all had their genomes tweaked to serve the human species .
Most of the genetically modified ( GM ) food in the world sprouts on American soil , but the practice is growing in Argentina , Canada , Brazil , and China , to name just a few .
Maybe the strangest part of GM food is that most people have no idea they eat it .
The majority of Americans do n’t know how it ’s done , why it ’s done , how it ’s regulated , or why they should care .
The Grocery Manufacturers of America estimates that 70 - 75 % of all processed foods in your local grocery store contain ingredients from GM plants .
Genetically modified food : it ’s what ’s for dinner .
Harder , Faster , Better , Stronger
So why remix food genomes ?
It depends .
Some GM food is designed to resist diseases , insect attacks , or herbicides regularly used in modern industrial agriculture .
Plants can be made hardier and more tolerant to environmental stress such as drought or irregular weather .
Crops can be made to mature faster ( decreasing their growing time ) and rot slower ( increasing shelf - life ) .
GM food can also produce higher crop yields , and be engineered to lack unwanted toxins ( such as allergens ) .
But that ’s not all .
Genetic modification is giving a new meaning to the phrase “ super food ” .
Crops are being engineered to produce more nutrients , vitamins , and all that healthy stuff .
Work is also underway to turn plants into little pharmaceutical factories , pumping out desired drugs … is “ Pfizer Farm ” trademarked yet ?
And ( of course ) GM foods are specially tweaked to please your taste buds , engineered to make every edible on your plate that much more appetizing .
The ubiquity of GM foods – that 70 - 75 % statistic – comes from its presence in staple ingredients for processed food .
Soybean oil , cottonseed oil and corn syrup are three cornerstones of the Western diet , and each one is mostly likely GM - derived .
Everything from bread and cereal to frozen pizza gets a dose , not to mention almost every soda on the market .
So now that it ’s already in your body , wanna hear how it ’s done ?
Gene Cuisine
In olden days , farmers had to modify crop genomes the old fashioned way : selective breeding .
At the very least , they had to work with the genes already at their disposal ( in their crops ) .
No longer .
Genetic engineering lets scientists plop totally new genes – ones that would never naturally occur in corn , for example – into the target species to produce a new effect .
Sort of like skinning a cat , there ’s a number of ways to genetically modify a genome .
Still , they all share the same principles : first , isolate a gene that does something interesting .
Next , insert that gene into a vector : a virus , plasmid , or other stretch of DNA capable of invading a cell ’s nucleus .
Introduce the vector to the target organism ’s cells , and allow the new genes to be incorporated into the original genome .
So who does the remixing ?
Most of the GM strains available to farmers have been developed , patented and marketed by the agricultural biotech giant Monsanto .
If you did n’t just wince at your computer screen , you probably have n’t heard of them .
Cue transition to controversy section .
Give Me Spots On My Apples
The heated debates around GM food are tricky to untangle .
Monsanto , a biotech company leading the way in creating new food strains , is sort of your prototypical evil corporation .
Okay , maybe “ evil ” is a strong word …
Let ’s go with “ ethically questionable ” .
In the fine tradition of Chevron and Dow , Monsanto has been accused of every manner of unethical behavior .
From dumping hazardous waste to bullying small farms , the company has a pretty nasty laundry list of unsettling policy and action .
Worse , lots of higher - ups within the company have occupied positions in the EPA , the Department of Agriculture , etc .
One begins to wonder where interests conflict .
As Monsanto is the largest supplier of GM food seeds in the world , criticisms of GM food can be difficult to distinguish from attacks on the corporation itself .
Bananas are n’t evil , but United Fruit was .
Sure , Monsanto made Agent Orange … but is GM food a boon to mankind , innocuous but for the company that weilds it ?
Is it actually safe ?
You might be wondering why you ’ve never seen GM food labeled with a little “ tinkered genome ” sticker ( I ’m thinking a little double - helix would suffice ) .
The FDA has approved all GM foods , and does n’t consider the genetic engineering to pose any major risks to your health .
Critics claim there have n’t been any long - term studies done ( GM food has only been around for 20 years ) , that supportive research was biased or inadequate , and that the FDA rushed the approval .
Others feel that GM foods might impact whole ecosystems in unpredictable ways , disrupting natural food chains in a sort of domino effect .
A few countries – from Hungary to Venezuela – have banned GM foods altogether .
Middle Ground
Unless you ’re technophobic by nature ( in which case , reading this blog amounts to masochism ) , it ’s hard to deny the benefits of GM foods .
In the 90’s , reworking the papaya genome saved Hawaii from having a staple crop wiped out by a virus .
GM foods resistant to insect attack actually require fewer pesticides than their natural counterparts , a seeming win for the environment .
Stress - resistant GM crops can survive droughts and disease , warding off famine in developing countries across the globe .
Frankly , it ’s amazing that we can remix our food to be more nutritious , disease - and pest - resistant , faster - growing , longer - lasting , and tastier to boot .
Like all of genetic engineering ( say , artificial life ) , GM foods show the power of the modern biotech revolution .
They have the potential to make us healthier , improve ag production , make pharmaceuticals , and survive hell and high water .
Maybe future crops could recycle more nutrients back into dirt and help avert the looming topsoil crisis .
What kinds of GM foods would you want to see ?
But the benefits do n’t erase the legitimate concerns over health and the environment .
I would n’t want Chevron running the EPA ; is having Monsanto officials working at the FDA all that different ?
Ecosystems are so intricately complex and interconnected that it ’s difficult to determine the consequences of even small changes ( the most important aspect of endangered species conservation ) .
GM foods are so new and exciting , it ’s possible that our best science is n’t yet capable of understanding its long - term consequences ( making regulation a dicey process ) .
And with Monsanto patenting every crop they remix , it wo n’t be long until they own the genome of every fruit and vegetable you eat .
So that ’s what all the fuss is about .
Given their widespread ( and spreading ) use , it ’s important to keep you , dear consumer , up to date on the food that hits your plate .
So now you know , and knowing is half the battle .
Schoolgirl , 13 , arrested after sub - machine gun found in her wardrobe
A schoolgirl of 13 has been arrested by armed police after an assault rifle was found hidden in her bedroom .
The M16 automatic machine gun , which is believed to have been placed under a wardrobe by her gangster brother , was discovered wrapped in several pieces of clothing .
Fifteen officers armed with sub-machine guns yesterday stormed a block of flats in Croydon , South London , after a tip - off about the weapon .
Grim discovery :
The M16 assault rifle was found in the schoolgirl 's bedroom after police stormed the flat in Croydon , South London
Roads were cordoned off and residents ordered to stay in their homes as police searched the fourth floor flat on Monks Hill Estate in Selsdon .
Although the weapon is thought to be a replica , police were awaiting results of a forensic examination last night .
Detectives believe that the girl 's older brother , who is a known gang member , smuggled the gun into her bedroom to avoid detection shortly after the family moved into the flat a few weeks ago .
Police subsequently arrested a 19 - year - old man last night on suspicion of possession of a firearm .
Neighbours described their shock at the discovery last night .
Jeanette Kendrick , 68 , a retired veterinary assistant , said : ' About 1 pm I looked out of my window and saw dozens of police dressed in riot gear with helmets and shields .
' Some of them were carrying automatic weapons and they had five or six Alsatian dogs with them .
I 've been here since I was 21 and we 've never had anything like this .'
Sergeant Darin Birmingham , who led the raid , said : ' We received information that the young man living here , who is a known gang member , had access to firearms .
' We pieced together the information we had and decided to act immediately in case the firearm was used .
If you mess around with weapons we will be at your front door and you will come face to face with an armed response unit . '
A police spokesman added : ' A girl aged 13 was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and taken to a South London police station .
She has been bailed to return . '
The 5.56 mm M16 assault rifle , which can fire up to 900 rounds a minute at a range of 400 metres , has been the U.S. military 's workhorse weapon for more than 30 years .
Built by handgun specialists Colt , it has featured in a number of Hollywood action films from Platoon to Predator .
Twitter has a reputation as that " new Internet trend " that 's all the rage among kids , but recent data suggests that an older crowd is what 's really driving Twitter 's growth .
Sparked by a very unscientific Morgan Stanley report ( PDF ) about how teens apparently do n't use Twitter , market research powerhouse Nielsen decided to take a look at its own data from a NetRatings panel of over 250,000 US Internet users .
While " teens do n't tweet " is a pretty gross generalization of the data , the young 'uns do n't make up as significant of a group as one might expect .
According to Nielsen 's data , Twitter reached 10.7 percent of all active Internet users in 2009 " despite a lack of widespread adoption by children , teens , and young adults . "
The firm notes that people under the age of 25 make up almost a quarter of all US Internet users and yet only 16 percent of Twitter 's audience in June of 2009 , meaning that Twitter is " under - indexing " the youth market compared to the Internet as a whole .
Conversely , the large majority of Twitter users ( 64 percent ) fell into the 25 to 54 age group , and 20 percent were 55 + .
That 's right : there were more Twitter users who are our parents ' age than those who are in high school or college .
This is n't to say that kids are n't into Twitter — they 're just not as into it as those who are over 25 .
As Nielsen points out , Twitter is largely driven by buzz ( see Michael Jackson 's effect on the service ) , not to mention the fact that numerous marketers , PR people , and journalists use Twitter to push their wares and build connections .
Frankly , it 's no surprise that mass numbers of younger folks would n't be as interested as older adults — who wants to hear about what 's going on in Iran when you 're texting interesting high school gossip around ?
( High school readers : that last sentence was tongue in cheek .
Lay off the hatemail ! )
Of course , this also does n't take into account that most Twitter users do n't tweet or even follow anyone , so this may be a case of adults joining to see what it 's about and later deciding it 's not for them .

It looks like the speculation can finally come to an end ; Blizzard has made it clear that we will in fact see two big releases in 2010 ... and unfortunately one of them is not Diablo 3 .
That 's right , the game will be coming in 2011 , or later .
Shacknews has the scoop .
" Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime has confirmed that just - revealed World of Warcraft expansion Cataclysm and StarCraft II are the two titles the company expects to hit in 2010 , " the site reported .
With StarCraft II coming in 2010 , Blizzard claimed on the Activision Blizzard earnings call that we can expect two big Blizzard releases coming in 2010 , but we were then warned not to make any assumptions about what those two games would be .
While we guessed — incorrectly , it turns out — that Diablo 3 would be the other title , our dreams have been crushed .

Over the last few months , there has been very little showing on industrial robots here at Singularity Hub .
That is truly a terrible circumstance , as some of the best and most innovative robots are being put to task in the industrial setting .
Well , consider this the start of that wrong righted and take a look at ABB Robotics ’ FlexPicker .
As the name suggests , this nimble bot can grab anything that is put in its path ( via conveyer belt ) and gently place it in its proper space .
Now , this might not seem all that revolutionary : even tiny kids can play the Milton - Bradley game Perfection .
Why not just stick them on the assembly line and forego the cost of the robot ?
But the FlexPicker is oh so much more than that .
This thing is even faster than that kid with ADHD who just ca n’t sit still .
For payloads of less than 100 grams , like small plastic pieces or pills , the FlexPicker takes just three tenths of a second to perform its task .
That means that that by the time you can take the fastest Porsche 911 from zero to sixty miles per hour ( about 4 seconds ) , the FlexPicker can pick up and move 13 objects and be well on the way to number 14 .
Do n’t believe it ?
Take a look at the video from BotJunkie :
If lightweight objects are n’t on the conveyer belt , slower models are capable of lifting up to 3 kilograms at a sluggish seven tenths of a second per cycle .
The system works by analyzing images taken from a camera mounted on the robot .
The software is capable of discerning shapes and identifying the position on the conveyer belt , which is then used to control which objects the arm grabs .
Not only can the FlexPicker boast superhuman speed that would make even The Flash sweat , it also gets an A+ in the hygiene department .
The robot is fully washable by current standards , making it ideal for use in clean rooms or food packaging situations .
While that might not sound too interesting , it means that the robot is just as versatile as it is cool .
This is n’t a one - trick pony .
The FlexPicker is already infiltrating our manufacturing lines , picking and flexing its way to faster production methods and more efficient packaging efforts .
And the writing has been on the wall for quite a while : the robot is replacing human hands on the factory floor .
It ’s a sad thought , especially in this economy , that people would be forced out of jobs to make way for a robot that does n’t necessarily have to put food on the table for its family .
That twinge of sympathy for the man who spent a myriad of years on an assembly line , learning every nuance and quirk of the assembly process , makes the FlexPicker and its brethren a bittersweet testimonial to human engineering and shrewd capitalism .
But however the industrial robot is viewed , be it efficient and cost effective or a mechanical embodiment of corporate greed , it is a triumph of accomplishment and a technological marvel .
Robots like the FlexPicker have come and they are here to stay .
And if that stunning realization does n’t cheer you up , perhaps this video would .
Are n’t those little pancakes just adorable ?
I was going to begin this piece by saying that yes , we know , you ’re sick of bacon , and we ’re sick of it , too .
But that would be total bullshit , and I do n’t think Taste Test readers want to be lied to .
If you ’re anything like us , you could eat bacon every day , and in almost any sort of configuration .
By itself .
With some eggs .
On a BLT .
Club sandwich .
Crispy , chewy bacon adds wonderment to almost anything it touches , and we will eat it until we fall down , grasping our chests , sucking wind , and smiling .

That said , some of the ways bacon has been presented to us over the past few years have n’t lived up to the majesty of the pure product .
Some bacon presentations can degrade bacon , and make her feel like a cheap whore , when really she ’s a beautiful princess .
So in the interest of a ) not writing about bacon for a while and b ) clearing a bunch of shit off my desk , we decided to just let our bacon freak - flag fly all at once .
Thus , the following products were tasted , all in one giant orgasm of baconosity : Bacon Freak Maple Bacon Pancakes , Bacon Freak bacon jerky , skillet bacon jam , Spam with bacon , bacon - flavored jellybeans , bacon - flavored gumballs , and bacon - flavored toothpicks .
Because they were still sitting around the kitchen , previous Taste Test stars chocolate - covered bacon and Bacon Salt were also involved .
Not only that , but we went all out in preparing some of these items , particularly the bacon jam , which was served in a variety of ways .
We did this for you , bacon .
Sometimes you make us so mad , but it ’s only because we love you sooo much .

Let ’s start with the most exciting item of the bunch : skillet bacon jam .
A reader named James C. hipped us to its existence .
Made by Skillet Street Food , a mobile restaurant based in the Seattle area , and served there on delicious - sounding burgers ( Oregon natural beef , cambozola , arugula , bacon jam , brioche ) , the bacon jam is prepared thusly : “ we take a big bunch of really really good bacon , and render it down … add a bunch of spices … onions , etc … and let it simmer for about 6 hours … give it a quick puree , and blast chill it … and you have bacon jam … ”
In an e-mail , James swore by its goodness , so we ordered a jar , which turned out to be a can .
In order to give it a fair shake ( rather than , y’know , just eating it out of the can ) , we decided to incorporate bacon jam into some half - assed recipes .
The first , peanut - butter - and - bacon - jam sandwiches on cheap white bread , was an immediate hit .
The bacon jam looks fatty and slimy , but it tastes like pulled pork — hints of barbecue and lots of onion .
Against the sweet peanut butter , it was a winner .
Next up , we made grilled cheese with bacon jam , which was simply more crappy white bread , slices of cheddar , and bacon jam — all prepared to goopy perfection in a George Foreman grill .
Unless there ’s some miraculous treat I ’m not remembering , the grilled cheese with bacon jam was the best - received Taste Test item in the feature ’s storied history .
A couple of people hesitated , but most agreed that it simply tasted like a well - seasoned pulled - pork - and - cheddar sandwich .
And who can argue with that ?

All the while , Chef Koski prepared Bacon Freak ’s Maple Bacon Pancake Mix , which the package describes as “ real buttermilk pancake mix with genuine Bacon Freak bacon bits and creamy maple flavored chunks . ”
Pancake mix is always too good to be true , but we had high hopes for this one , and Bacon Freak has provided us with some solid bacon products so far .
The pancakes were just so - so — a great idea that did n’t ( and maybe could n’t ) execute well .
The bits of bacon were really hard , and the pancakes themselves were n’t sweet enough .
Jun said it best :
You ’d be much better off just cooking some delicious bacon next to a good pancake .
That said , we did make some interesting creations with the pancakes , topping them with bacon jam ( good ) and maple syrup ( even better ) .
But overall , we ’d probably rather just have some Batter Blaster pancakes with a side of Bacon Freak fancy bacon .

No one had any illusions about the Spam “ with real Hormel bacon . ”
Only White Chang ( a.k.a.
Whang , a.k.a. ad ops heartthrob Brett ) claimed to like Spam in any incarnation .
This was mostly just horrendous .
Its gelatinous ick is nearly impossible to get out of the can , and it smells so bad uncooked that I can’t believe people voluntarily eat it .
Cooked , it ’s perhaps slightly better , but after the gourmet vibe of the bacon jam , it just seemed that much worse .
And could you even taste the bacon in it ?
Not at all .
At some point in this orgy of pig flesh , Jesse concocted a special sandwich for Whang to eat , a sandwich someone cleverly named “ the Jesse . ”
It consisted of spam as the bread ( which , it should be noted , is the name that Dinosaur Jr. ’s J. Mascis publishes his songs under , Spam As The Bread Music ) , bacon jam , cheddar cheese , and peanut butter — all grilled by Mr. George Foreman .
It looked like a mess , but if Anthony Bourdain can eat a “ three little pigs ” sandwich at Chicago ’s Silver Palm and live to tell about it , our Brett can give this a shot .
He did n’t hate it , but he and Jesse probably would n’t eat it again .

Next course : bacon jerky , again made by Bacon Freak .
Two things :
Someone pointed out the obvious in saying , “ Is n’t bacon already jerky ? ”
Well no , it really is n’t , but it ’s definitely got some similarities .
More importantly , most jerky we ’ve eaten has been dry .
That ’s a key part of the definition , is n’t it ?
Jerky is smoked , dried meat .
Bacon jerky , though vacuum - sealed , was slightly oily .
( You could n’t put it in your pocket for a camping trip , really . )
We tried two flavors — honey - BBQ rubbed and summer - tomato BLT — neither of which blew anybody away .
It ’s not terrible , but they should definitely trim some of the fat from future batches .
More importantly , it really does n’t do actual bacon justice .
It treats her like a commodity , to be bagged and carted around .
She is n’t that .
She ’s precious .
You do n’t take her camping , you take her to the Ritz - Carlton .
You feed her the finest champagne in a crystal goblet .
You order the finest food in the restaurant , stuffed with the second - finest .
( Lobster stuffed with tacos , for the record . )

And beautiful authentic bacon did n’t even appear in the dessert course for this drawn - out Taste Test , at least not for real .
Some sort of sick joker or bacon - tranny must ’ve invented bacon gumballs and bacon - flavored jellybeans .
These products are for kids or comedians , not for bacon - lovers .
Bacon beans are Jelly Belly sized , but they do n’t even have the balls to be as disgusting as dirt or earwax - flavored JBs .
I spit in their face , throw them their $ 5 , and send them back to the stroll .
Bacon gumballs were only interesting because , like the Bakon vodka we sampled a few weeks ago , they somehow taste like Band - Aids .
To paraphrase the suspicious bass player from “ Heavy Metal Parking Lot ” : “ Bacon - scented toothpicks , I do n’t know about you . ”
( In other words , they were horrible and possibly even gay . )

What did we learn today ?
That we need to treat bacon right , and not take her for granted .
Sure , she might cry sometimes , and she blew 37 other guys , but she brings you lasagna at work and does the dishes every night .
She makes your tastebuds feel all right .
If you try to replace her , you might just end up with artificial - flavored bullshit , and you ’ll never know the real taste of bacon again .
If you work at this relationship — say by cooking her , then puréeing her , then blast - chilling her — she ’ll come up tasty every time .
She might even let you have a threesome with some peanut butter .

Office reactions :
Peanut butter and bacon - jam sandwiches
“ It tastes like it ’s got a ton of bacon in it ! ”
“ It ’s really smoky .
I do n’t think the smoke blends with the peanut butter at all . ”
“ There ’s too much onion in this and it ’s too savory and smoky for my tastes , but I ’m guessing someone who really liked fried onions and bacon would think it was heaven in a can . ”
“ I would never eat this on my own , but the smokiness of the jam pairs relatively well with peanut butter . ”
“ It ’s kind of like a chutney , almost . ”
“ This could be the new lunch paradigm . ”
“ Kind of a Southeast Asian vibe — pork satay , cold peanut noodles — on top of good ol ’ American white bread .
Like a senator with a Bangkok hooker .
You should n’t print that last bit . ”
“ The peanut butter and salt from the bacon match pretty well . ”
“ An overload of salt .
It is an abomination to the sanctity of PBJs everywhere . ”
Grilled cheddar cheese with bacon jam
“ It ’s like a pulled - pork panini with cheese .
Probably really healthy . ”
“ It ’s really delicate . ”
“ It ’s like crunchy pulled pork . ”
“ Totally tasty , though it does n't really taste like bacon .
Like someone else mentioned , it has more of a pulled - pork flavor . ”
“ You know , this stuff tastes good - ish going down , but I suspect if I ate a whole one and allowed it to ferment in my stomach , I would n’t be so happy . ”
“ Darn tasty !
Warm melted cheese really sells the bacon spread . ”
“ Delicious .
I daresay I would actually order this in a restaurant . ”
Bacon jerky
“ They managed to completely dry out the meat , but leave the fat intact .
Very greasy . ”
“ For me , this was the worst .
Felt like it should be used as a dog treat , and the consistency of the fat in the jerky was that of a stick of butter . ”
“ It even tastes unhealthy .
Even I can't justify bacon jerky . ”
Bacon Freak Maple Bacon pancakes
“ The bacon inside is really hard and chewy . ”
“ That ’s a winner right there .
It saves time !
It ’s like a KFC bowl . ”
“ The bacon in these things is better bacon jerky than the official bacon jerky was .
It ’s hard and chewy , but flavorful . ”
“ I ’m a little concerned that I might be eating hickory chips in a pancake . ”
“ It tastes like a campfire to me , for better or for worse .
It tastes not like liquid smoke , but specifically like the pine - wood char that comes off campfires . ”
“ It ’s bizarre , it ’s like eating a smoked pancake . ”
“ It pooped on me , but it ’s totally good . ”
“ I kept getting thrown off of the nice , easy texture of the pancake by the speed bumps of the bits of bacon — not a fun textural experience . ”
“ Also , the batter smelled like sex . ”
“ Not a whole lot like bacon ; more like what would happen if I poured too much syrup on my pancakes and my bacon on my plate was soaked in it . ”
“ The pure batter , however — I ca n’t believe I ’m writing this out — smells like a used condom . ”

SPAM with bacon
“ If you combined all the meat in the world , that ’s what it would taste like . ”
“ The only excuse for eating this much energy is if you ’re hiking across the Arctic or something . ”
“ The main problem is texture .
Pork should n't be fluffy . ”
“ It 's like whipped ham , only smoky . ”
The ' Jesse ' Spamwich
“ It was a palate of confusion .
Think about eating a hotdog only to find out that it 's filled with bananas and peanut butter . ”
“ I felt like I had just bathed in a tub of grease after eating this guy . ”
“ It looked and tasted like something you would eat for breakfast in the 1950s , before health was a concept . ”

Bacon jellybeans
“ There was a definite pairing of fruit with these .
Not sure what fruit would go with bacon , but it ’s in there . ”
“ The jellybean was a total disappointment .
It tasted like a slightly off Jelly Belly , but it was n't unpleasant at all . ”
“ This is bullshit .
There 's no bacon flavor , and it 's too sweet .
It should be savory if it 's going for bacon .
If it were n't labeled bacon , I would have never guessed it .
It 's more like a Jelly Belly Bean Boozled jellybean for Band - Aids . ”
Advertisement
Bacon gumballs
Advertisement
“ Very sterile , almost like sucking on gauze from the dentist ’s office . ”
“ This is slightly closer to bacon flavor than the jellybeans , but it 's also totally gross .
For every one gumball you chew , you need two pieces of Eclipse to kill the taste from your mouth . ”
“ The worst item in this Taste Test .
Like sucking on an antiseptic wipe . ”
Bacon toothpicks
“ Somebody must have pulled these out of an ashtray . ”
“ Now this is just unnecessary .
Enough is enough with the bacon - flavored shit already . ”

For as long as companies have been selling tools to assist the filmmaker , people have been exploring ways to accomplish the same thing better , faster , cheaper ... and in today 's day and age of anybody - can - be - an - indie - filmmaker , they usually focus on ' cheaper ' :)
This page chronicles my humble adaptation of the many DIY designs floating about the internet .
This article is n't intended as a complete building guide ... I really just wanted to chronicle some of the unique aspects of the stabilizer I put together .
If you decide to copy what I 've done here , I just ask that you give a little credit to ' YB2 Normal ' and send them over to my site to check out my other work .
To be clear however , I take no credit for the physics behind why this works , or even the overall design .
Really I only consider three aspects of the design original ... the PVC gimbal , the use of all - thread for the main tube , and the wooden camera x-y plate .
Putting together my own steadicam represented some unique challenges ...
I had seen many references to the ' $ 14 Steadicam ' on the internet , and I have to applaud the grace with which Johnny has dealt with the know - it - alls who feel compelled to point out the limitations of the design ... read his FAQ and you 'll get a small sense of his patience and sense of humor .
( These are links to his college website , please mail me if he graduates and the links get broken )
My budget was a bit higher than $ 14 and I wanted to put something together that emulated , as best as a homebrew project could , the design of the commercial steadicam .
To that end I trolled the internet and discovered a whole community of amateur filmmakers , physics nerds , and cheap folk like myself who just had to see if they could build a camera stabilizer for less than the cost of a compact car .
The successes I found on the internet , and the elegance with which folks have done it , inspired me to do the same .
WASHINGTON – California attorney Orly Taitz , who has filed a number of lawsuits demanding proof of Barack Obama ’s eligibility to serve as president , has released a copy of what purports to be a Kenyan certification of birth and has filed a new motion in U.S. District Court for its authentication .
Just a few problems : the purported birth certificate is dated 1964 , when the president was three years old .
The document states it was made in Mombasa , which was n’t even part of Kenya at the time .
And it ’s just one of a slew of forgeries popping up .
Even the wacknuts at Free Republic call it a fake .
But that wo n’t matter .
The next Obama conspiracy theory will be that he released these fakes to make Orly Taitz look stupid ( as if she needed help ) .
Wingnuts are smart !
With documents !

ADDING : Orly Taitz was invited on MSNBC today , and proved once again that wingnuts are their own worst enemies :
Howie Carr : Obama reminds me of malt liquor
From today 's Herald :
Actually , now that I consider Barack and beer , the first brand that comes to mind is Schlitz Malt Liquor , especially when Obama gets near a microphone : “ Look out for the bull ! ”
See , it 's because Obama 's lame speeches remind Howie of the Schlitz Malt Liquor jingle .
Not because Obama reminds Howie of this -- or because Howie wants you to make the same connection .
UPDATE : Say this for Howie - - he 's a master at knowing just how far he can go .
For a bunch of Herald readers , malt liquor is an " urban " ( read : inner - city black ) drink .
But if anyone accused Carr of deploying racial code , he could respond that , back in the day , Schlitz pitched its malt liquor to white drinkers too .
That 's craftsmanship !
The Next Financial Crisis : Virtual Banks
By now , the financial woes of Lehman , Bear Stearns , Washington Mutual , and the many other troubled banks is old news .
But we may need to start preparing for another round of bank failures … in the virtual world .
If indeed it happens , a character named Ricdic will likely be to blame .
Ricdic is part of Eve Online , which I have never heard of , but according to this BBC news report “ has about 300,000 players all of whom inhabit the same online universe .
The game revolves around trade , mining asteroids , and the efforts of different player - controlled corporations to take control of swathes of virtual space . ”
Ricdic , according to the article , runs a large ebank at the site , and pilfered some virtual funds , traded them to other players for real money , and made a down payment on a house and paid off medical bills .
In response to the news of the scandal , there has been a run on Ricdic ’s bank .
As consumers lose confidence in Ricdic ’s banks , it wo n’t be long before people get the idea that they should take their money out of any bank in Eve Online .
And why should this banking panic not spill over to other virtual
worlds ?
The entire virtual banking system may be brought down by Ricdic .
There is some irony in Eve Online ’s banking crisis :
Eve online is run by an Icelandic company .
The real Icelandic banks were some of the worst casualties in the financial crisis , and as far as I can tell , not through any fault of their own .
Unlike the American banks which crashed because of sub - prime debt
exposure , the Icelandic banks fell prey to an old - fashioned bank run .
Because the Icelandic banks were so big relative to the size of the Icelandic G.D.P. , there was no way for the government to guarantee the banks , and therefore nothing to slow the bank run once it got started .
Again according to the BBC , this is n’t the first time there has been trouble in Eve Online .
Apparently earlier this year one of the game ’s biggest corporations was “ brought down by industrial espionage . ”

Sir Paul McCartney is still laughing off reports he died and was replaced in THE Beatles by a lookalike - 40 years after the rumours first surfaced .
The Fab Four were photographed walking along a pedestrian crossing on the legendary cover of their 1969 album Abbey Road .
MCCartney 's barefoot appearance in the photo sparked wild rumours the rocker had died in a car crash - and the 67 year old admits he still has to reassure some fans he 's not an impostor .
He explains , " The idea was to walk across the crossing , and I showed up that day with sandals , flip - flops .
It was so hot that I kicked them off and walked across barefooted , and this started some rumour that because he 's barefooted , he 's dead .
I could n't see the connection .
" I just laughed .
I knew ( it was ) because of the fame and the craziness ...
But it was a bit strange , because people started to look at me like , ' Is it really him or a very good double ? '
No , this is him ! "
Barry Johnson and Wendy Shobrook 's wedding was described as a " disaster " A newlywed couple who killed a man the morning after their wedding have been jailed for manslaughter .
Wendy Shobrook and Barry Johnson , both 40 , of Plymouth , had denied murder but were found guilty earlier this year of George Auchterlonie 's manslaughter .
Shobrook had had a relationship with the victim and spent her wedding night with him after a row with her new husband following a drinking binge .
At Plymouth Crown Court , Johnson got 12 years in jail and Shobrook five .
On the day of the register office ceremony , 9 June 2008 , Shobrook had a row with Johnson and went to see Mr Auchterlonie , the jury heard .
Your relationship was chaotic , the wedding day was quite clearly a disaster
Judge Francis Gilbert QC
She returned for the reception party at the Waterfront restaurant in Plymouth , but then argued with her husband again .
Later on their wedding night she set fire to him after they had gone to bed , saying " burn in hell " , and fled to spend the night with father - of - four Mr Auchterlonie .
In the morning she rang Johnson and told him Mr Auchterlonie had tried to rape her .
He was so angry he launched an attack which left the victim with 38 different injuries , the court was told .
They then fled together , leaving Mr Auchterlonie dying in a pool of blood .
He was found by a neighbour three days later .
Judge Francis Gilbert , QC , told them : " Your relationship was chaotic , the wedding day was quite clearly a disaster . "

In the garden of my house there 's a tree with lots of randomly grown twigs .
It looks odd and nice at the same time .
One day I asked myself if I could create a piece of music with it .
To tune the tree I picked a fundamental note and tuned the twigs by trimming them with a pencil sharpener .
I used two Røde NT6 and a NTG - 2 as microphones , combined with a customized stethoscope .
I recorded the tracks live on a Pro Tools LE system .
I did n't use any synthesizer or sampler to create or modify the sounds .
All the sounds come from playing the tree , by bowing the twigs , shaking the leaves , playing rhythms on the cortex and so on .
Below you can see the video and some pictures with more detailed descriptions .
I hope you 'll like it .
Acronyms are words formed from a series of initial letters or parts of other words :
Such as :
IBM , BBC , Unesco , WHO , Anzac , laser , radar
Acronyms can make text simpler , easier to read and understand – life would be harder if you had to write light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation every time you refer to a laser .
Spell an acronym out in full the first time you use it unless you are writing for a specialist audience and the term is instantly familiar .
I prefer to write the full term , followed by the acronym thus :
The United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organisation ( Unesco ) .
Others like to write the acronym , followed by its full title in brackets .
Both are equally correct , it is a matter of editorial style .
If an acronym is confusing , do n’t use it .
Some style guides allow acronyms written with full stops ( or periods ) between each letter or segment .
I disagree .
Likewise , there are those who think acronyms should always be written in capital letters .
Again I disagree .
In both cases the result is both inelegant and distracting .
You ’ll notice in the examples above , I ’ve written some acronyms in capitals , some with an initial capital and some in lower case .
Here ’s why :
When you pronounce the acronym as a string of letters , ie eye , bee , emm for IBM the computer company , write the word in capitals .
Some people call this type of acronym initialism .
If the acronym is a word and spoken as a word , then treat it as a normal word with an initial capital if it is a proper noun .
Otherwise with a lower case initial letter .
Some American newspapers automatically use an initial capital followed by lower case if the acronym had more than six letters .
One difficulty is deciding whether to use a or an before an acronym .
The important thing is how it sounds when spoken .
Certain acronyms were deliberately designed from the outset as pronounceable words .
For example , Action on Smoking and Health ( Ash ) .
The Economist Style Guide offers good advice :
… try not to repeat the abbreviation too often ; so write the agency and not the IAEA , the Union and not the EU , to avoid splattering the page with capital letters .
There is no need to give the initials of an organisation if it is not referred to again .

By popular request following the d12 bag , here it is : the d20 bag !
Now you can make your very own icosahedron .
We ’re making a pattern and kit for this project available in two sizes : darling and practical .
The tiny one is just over three inches tall , and holds little things for you .
The larger size is about five inches tall and will fit your phone , wallet and keys along with your dice .
There are a deceptively large number of parts to cut out , which is one of the main reasons that a kit makes sense here .
Our kit includes twenty canvas pieces , twenty iron - on stiffener triangles , twenty cotton liner pieces , a cord for the handle , a zipper , and iron - on numbers 1 - 20 in the lovely font BPreplay .
The iron - on numbers are made from a cotton - poly blend which fuses as it is laser cut so that it wo n’t fray .
Assembly takes a few hours and requires thread , needle , scissors , pins and an iron ( for fabric , not solder ) .
A sewing machine will make some parts go faster .
d20 bag instructions :
If you ’re using your own materials , the small pattern is available here ( 26 kB PDF ) and the large pattern is available here ( 24 kB PDF ) .
The small bag takes a 9 ″ zipper , and the large bag takes a 14 ″ zipper .
Depending on how you lay out your pieces , you ’ll need about two square feet of fabric of each type , with a little less needed for the smaller bag .
There are two sizes of iron - on stiffener panels : little ones ( eight of these ) and bigger ones ( twelve of these ) .
The little ones are to allow clearance for the zipper .
The standard allowance the sides of the triangles is about a quarter inch for the tiny bag and about three - eighths for the handbag .
The smaller stiffeners that go next to the zippers have the same allowance on the two regular sides , and an additional quarter inch on the zipper side .
Place the stiffener with the plasticky side ( may be very smooth like the back of the numbers or may be rough but have a distinctly plastic texture ) against the canvas , and place a hot dry iron on the canvas side for 5 - 8 seconds .
Arrange your numbers and fuse them under the iron for 5 - 8 seconds .
The first set of pieces to sew together are the ten that form the band around the center of the bag .
There will also be five pieces on the bottom and five pieces for the lid .
Lay them out in the order you ’ll want to sew them in , with all of the zipper sides ( smaller stiffeners with wider margin on one side ) aligned .
There will be one triangle in that row of the normal size : that ’s where the lid attaches to the bottom of the bag .
If sewing by machine , your zipper foot will help guide the stiffeners along .
Sew each piece until you ’ve got all ten strung together .
The next thing is to sew the bottom five panels on .
Lay them over the sewn strip ( on the non-zipper edge ) , overlapping the edges and sew straight across the whole batch .
You ’ll also need to make the same shape with the liner material .
Sew the pieces together with a 3/8 ″ allowance .
Follow the same pattern as for the bag body .
Once you have both done , it will be time to pin the zipper in place between the canvas and the liner .
The zipper should be aligned fairly deeply so that the seam goes just below the intersection of the triangles .
Pin across the zipper and sew it in place .
Once the zipper is in place , close it and mark the triangle intersections with pins on the lid side of the zipper .
Pin the zipper edge pieces for the lid to the zipper with four more of the loose liner pieces .
Sew the zipper on and test it to make sure it can freely open and close .
Next , begin sewing the lid together .
Start at the open end and sew toward the intersection at the zipper edge .
Sew the last lid piece in and attach it to the main body of the bag with the cord placed between the pieces .
Piece the canvas together before the liner , as the liner is more flexible and does n’t need to be as exact .
Finish piecing the liner except for the last piece .
Leave it loose so that you can turn the bag right side out .
Check the points of the canvas to see if any of them are loose , and close the gap if there is one by hand stitching .
Turn the lid right - side out .
Feed the canvas through the last opening in the liner to turn it right - side out as well .
Check all of your points to make sure they ’re neat before sewing the liner shut .
Pin the last flap of liner and sew it shut .
And that ’s it !
As always , if you are inspired by our projects , we ’d love to see the results in the Evil Mad Scientist flickr Auxiliary .
Updated August 3 , 2009 to add zipper lengths , yardage and variations in stiffener adhesive texture .

TABRIZ , Iran 
The strongest challenger to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attracted an unusually large and exuberant crowd of supporters on Monday during a campaign speech in this northwest city near the candidate ’s birthplace , with only a few weeks before national elections that the incumbent stands a serious chance of losing .
The crowd for the challenger , Mir Hussein Moussavi , was extraordinary not only for its size  an estimated 30,000  but also because the supporters were not paid , given free food , bused in or ordered by their workplaces to attend , a tactic sometimes used by Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s campaign .
Many traveled here in private cars and learned about the rally despite new government restrictions on Facebook , the social networking site , which Mr. Moussavi ’s campaign had been using to spread word of his candidacy among the country ’s predominantly young electorate .
The supporters gave a rousing welcome to Mr. Moussavi , who was born in Khameneh , a small town in the Azerbaijan area of Iran .
“ Azerbaijan is my home ; Moussavi is my life ! ” they chanted to him in their native dialect , Turkish Azeri .
SAN FRANCISCO 
The alliance between Apple and Google , two Silicon Valley giants with a powerful common enemy in Microsoft , is now clearly fraying .
Apple announced on Monday that Eric E. Schmidt , Google ’s chief executive , was stepping down from its board .
The move comes as the Federal Trade Commission is looking into whether the two companies violated antitrust laws by sharing common board members .
The resignation wo n’t make that investigation disappear .
In a statement Monday afternoon , Richard Feinstein , director of the F.T.C. ’s Bureau of Competition , commended the companies for acknowledging “ that sharing directors raises competitive issues . ”
But he said the agency would continue to investigate the remaining overlap between the companies ’ boards .
Google and Apple still share one board member , Arthur Levinson , the chairman of Genentech .
Mr. Schmidt ’s resignation from Apple ’s board constitutes a stark admission  Apple and Google had previously played down the issue  that the companies are now directly competing in the crucial race to develop the next generation of software for mobile phones and personal computers .
Earlier today , GM officially unveiled the Chevy Volt , a sporty sedan which will reportedly get 40 miles on a single battery charge .
( Read our full report here . )
The car , expected to be priced just under $ 40,000 , will start production either late this year , or early in 2011 .
According to GM , the Volt will get city fuel economy of at least 230 miles - per - gallon , and come packaged with a flex fuel - powered engine - generator .
Sounds pretty good .
But at least one competing automaker is n't convinced .
" Nissan Leaf = 367 mpg , no tailpipe , and no gas required .
Oh yeah , and it 'll be affordable too , " the folks over at Nissan 's electric vehicle Twitter feed wrote today .
About an hour later , they added this statement : " To clarify our previous tweet , the DOE formula estimates 367mpg for Nissan LEAF . "
Team Nissan is referring , of course , to the electric vehicle in the photograph above ( and the video below ) .
The LEAF , which will go into production next year – with a tentative release date of 2012 – is expected to be much cheaper than the Volt .
How much cheaper ?
Nissan is n't saying .
Wired , for one , thinks the cute - as - a - button car could come in at $ 25,000 – some $ 15 K cheaper than the Volt .
But more important :
Is Nissan right when it claims the LEAF will have a better MPG than the Volt ?
Yes and no .
As Daily Tech points out , it 's all a numbers game :
Nissan boasts of the higher mpg rating because its LEAF features a 24 kWh lithium - ion battery , while the Volt makes do with a 16 kWh lithium - ion battery .
This gives the LEAF a battery - only range of 100 miles compared to just 40 miles for the Volt .
However , the Volt has the advantage of being able to rely on its generator to travel an additional 300 miles – something that Nissan cannot say about its LEAF EV .

You tell us : Volt or LEAF ?
Or neither ?

Suspects sought in violent Oakland crime spree OAKLAND
Oakland police are searching for one or more assailants who beat up a man and shot and paralyzed another man who came to his aid early Saturday before brazenly shooting and killing a woman in her car , authorities said Saturday .
The crime spree began at 12:50 a.m. when a man was assaulted during a robbery at a taco truck at the corner of 44th Avenue and International Boulevard , said Officer Jeff Thomason , Oakland police spokesman .
A witness to the robbery placed the injured man in his car , but the assailant or assailants chased the Good Samaritan around the corner and shot him , Thomason said .
That victim , a 38 - year - old man from Oakland , was paralyzed .
Soon after , Adrienne Parker , 37 , was shot and killed in her car nearby , Thomason said .
No arrests have been made .
KABUL , Afghanistan ( CNN ) --
An American soldier captured in southeastern Afghanistan is being held by a notorious militant clan , a senior U.S. military official said .
A soldier mans a weapon at the rear of a U.S. Army helicopter over Afghanistan in May .
The American and three Afghan soldiers were captured by low - level militants and then quickly " sold " to the clan led by warlord Siraj Haqqani -- believed to be deeply involved in the action .
The Haqqanis operate on both sides of the Afghanistan - Pakistan border and are well known to the U.S. military .
They are assembling shuras , or local councils of leaders , to talk and try to " legitimize " what they have done , the official said .
U.S. , Afghan and Pakistani troops are sealing off the area and also are talking to tribal chiefs , village elders and leaders .
They are telling them to " do the right thing and solve this , " the official said .
The U.S. military is telling people not to let Haqqani operatives move through their area and to find the American and return him .
The military wants to make sure there is " no shelter " for the militants holding him .
" We want to make sure there is no place to hide , " the official said .
The Taliban had claimed responsibility for the capture of the four soldiers .
The U.S. soldier visited a military post in the Yousaf Khel district in the Paktika province and got drunk , Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said .
He was ambushed while returning to his car and was taken to a safe place , Sangeen said .
CNN could not independently verify Sangeen 's claims .
A source with the U.S. military denied the claim that the soldier was drunk .
" The Taliban are known for lying and what they are claiming are not true , " the source said .
The soldier 's family has been informed , the military said .
CNN 's Nic Robertson contributed to this report .
All About The Taliban • Afghanistan War
Margaret Morrissey , of the family lobby group Parents Outloud , said : " The fact is that we are changing our society and the nature of child rearing is changing because of it .
If we insist that mothers go out to work when their children are still young - out of the house by 7.30 am , dropping off a baby at nursery , then the two kids at school , working a full day and getting back at 6 pm - things are going to give .
About a month ago , Psystar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , a move which put a temporary “ stay ” on its litigation with Apple .
Shortly thereafter , Apple filed a motion with the court seeking to lift the stay , arguing that Psystar ’s bankruptcy filing was merely a tactic being used to delay litigation , and to avoid handing over , both in paper form and via deposition , important financial information that it seems to be purposefully withholding from Apple .
Late last week , the court granted Apple ’s motion to lift the stay , and the ongoing litigation between Apple and Psystar will continue .
The automatic stay imposed by 11 U.S.C § 362 ( a ) is lifted to allow the Infringement Action to proceed for all purposes through final judgment ; provided that Apple must seek further relief from this Court before executing any money judgment obtained in the Infringement Action against the Debtor ’s estate .
As a reminder of where litigation last left off before Psystar filed for Bankruptcy protection , here ’s a quick recap :
In early May , Apple filed a motion seeking to compel Psystar to divulge pertinent financial information .
In its filing , Apple noted that Psystar had yet to hand over important documents relating to revenues , profits , purchase receipts , and invoices .
Moreover , Apple wrote that Psystar president Rudy Pedrazza was curiously unable to recall even basic information about the company he ’s in charge of running .
Mr. Pedraza , who runs this small company , stated approximately 90 times during the deposition that he did not know or recall answers to basic questions about Psystar ’s sales , its general costs and profits , its costs and profits by product line , how it determined its prices and profit margins …
Psystar ’s response was shady as usual , as it claimed that it did n’t have the documents requested by Apple and that a number of other requested docs had been lost in a move .
Not surprisingly , the Court gave Psystar until May 18 to produce an array of documents , and gave Psystar until June 3 to provide Apple with a Psystar representative capable of speaking about and knowledgeable of Psystar ’s financial info .
A week before that June 3rd deadline , however , Psystar filed for Bankruptcy .
Convenient .
Groklaw has published Psystar President Rudy Pedraza ’s failed opposition to Apple ’s motion to lift the stay .
It reads in part :
11 . Unfortunately , Apple has been busy burying us in discovery in defense of their claim in an attempt to bankrupt us before getting to trial .
This has overwhelmed our resources and prevented us from pushing forward with our declaratory relief claim .
By no means do requests for basic financial information constitute “ burying us in discovery . ”
In fact , handing over financial information is about as straight forward and easy as the discovery process can get .
16 . Several times this court has inquired as to whether or not Apple has gotten injunctive relief and the answer to this is No .
It has been unable to seek such in over eleven ( 11 ) months of litigation .
If their case is so cut and dried we would not be allowed to sell our computers .
This statement shows a clear lack of understanding as to what injunctive relief legally entails and when it ’s applied .
Also , what ’s up with the noticeable grammatical error ?
“ If their case is so cut and dried ” Did n’t an attorney look over Pedrazza ’s statement ?
The bulk of Pedrazza ’s statement essentially accuses Apple of filing needless court motions and discovery requests in an attempt to bankrupt Psystar .
Which is funny , because Psystar seems to have been doing a good job of that themselves .
Down and Dirty : 5 Ways to Go Seriously Green Environmentalists talk of composting toilets , power from poop .
July 1 , 2009  --
There may be something of an " ick " factor to this story -- but some environmental advocates say that 's just fine with them .
Maybe , they say , it will make people think twice about wasteful ways they never thought about at all .
The waste at issue is human waste .
Some environmentalists ask why we go to so much trouble to get rid of it -- when , they say , it 's full of microbes and nutrients that can be put to good use in farmers ' fields as fertilizer .
What 's more they say , why are people driving to gyms , working up a sweat on treadmills or exercise bikes -- and letting all that effort go to waste ?
So here are five ideas they offer , some new and some old , that may strike you either as whacky -- or very clever in the way they conserve resources .
The Composting Toilet
In Austin , Tex. , a group called the Rhizome Collective has built a commode that uses no water .
Instead , when you 're finished , you pour sawdust down the toilet .
" This is a great system for environmentally conscious individuals and families , " said Jennifer Melia , a member of the collective .
She and her cohorts try to live a sustainable , off - the - electric - grid lifestyle -- though the powers that be took four years to give their approval for the system .
" It was just a new thing , " said Jill Mayfield of the Austin Water Utility , which finally gave Rhizome the go - ahead .
" It takes a while to make sure it 's something that would be safe . "
The members of the collective say they may not have a solution that pleases everyone , but they 're doing their part for the environment .
A flush from a conventional toilet , they said , takes 3 - 5 gallons of water -- clean water that could be used for drinking or cooking , and is in short supply in many parts of the world .
Meanwhile , people who checked out the sawdust - powered outhouse said it smelled mostly of sawdust , and not much else .
There are commercially made indoor versions as well .
" They save immense amounts of water , they create healthy soil , and they save energy , " said Melia .
" These are far beyond the latrines of olden times . "
Power from Poop
Sanford , Fla. , and MaxWest Environmental Systems Inc. of Texas have teamed up to convert the city 's stream of wastewater sludge into renewable energy .
The logic , they say :
Why flush stuff down the toilet when it can cut the city 's natural gas bill ?
Top 5 : Going Seriously Green
The city dries 30 tons of sludge daily with a natural gas - powered dryer and then hauls it to a landfill .
But under a new $ 3.5 million gasification system , the sludge will be allowed to sit .
When it does the gases released create heat , which can replace the natural gas to power the dryer .
The new system is not only greener , it could also save the city $ 9 to $ 14 million over 20 years , according to MaxWest .
Pedal Power
The Green Microgym in Portland , Ore. , puts its patrons to work , not just through workouts .
This " human - powered " gym is one of the few fitness centers in the world that uses electricity generated by the people working out there , said Adam Boesel , the owner .
As members pedal on stationary bicycles , they turn a small generator , charging batteries that power the gym 's television and stereo system .
Boesel said the output is relatively small .
But this is just the beginning , he said .
" It 's a little humbling -- a person can make about a penny 's worth of electricity an hour . " said Michael Tagget , president of Henry Works , a firm that makes people - powered generators .
" But if 20 , 30 , 40 people are doing that in a gym , they can do all the electricity for entertainment systems . "
Anaerobic Digesters Turn Waste Into Energy
Do n't stand in the way of an anaerobic digester .
This process uses organisms to break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas .
That biogas is then used to power electric - generation equipment , like fuel cells or micro turbines .
Of about 16,000 public wastewater plants in the country , 544 use anaerobic digesters .
Of those , 106 use the biogas for heating processes or electricity , said Phil Zahreddine , a branch chief with the Environmental Protection Agency .
" What is interesting is that as more projects are coming online and the technology is becoming more efficient , these options are becoming more attractive to facilities , " he said .
Waste ' Electrifies ' Los Angeles
The city of Los Angeles has a giant TIRE .
The city 's Terminal Island Renewable Energy ( or TIRE ) project involves injecting sludge into a well a mile deep .
At that depth , Earth 's high temperature breaks down the organic compounds in the waste to create methane gas .
The process also traps greenhouse gases and prevents them from damaging the atmosphere .
By 2012 , the project is expected to produce about 3,500 kilowatts of renewable power , which could power thousands of homes .
" This renewable energy project is absolutely electrifying , " Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told the Los Angeles Times .
" It will save money and make money . "
Revenge of the Netizens Online Activists Take On Germany 's Political Mainstream
As Germany heads into national elections , established political parties are trying to appeal to Web - savvy voters using Facebook and Twitter .
But their Internet policies are alienating bloggers and activists , who are using the medium to protest against the political mainstream .
All government , in its essence , is organized exploitation , and in virtually all of its existing forms it is the implacable enemy of every industrious and well - disposed man .

The number of wi-fi spots in public places are on the increase
A club DJ , Steve Miller , has revealed he has been forced into exile by a powerful allergy to Wi-Fi internet waves which leaves him feeling dizzy , sick and disorientated .
Mr Miller , better known by his stage name Afterlife , is unable to use trains , stay in hotels or visit his local high street because of his sensitivity to the " electrosmog " caused by wireless internet waves .
He is among around two pc of the population who suffer from Electromagnetic Hypersensetivity , while the number of people and businesses pumping out the Wi-Fi signal is rising .
Mr Miller told The Sun : " I feel like an exile on my own planet .
It 's almost impossible to find somewhere without Wi -Fi nowadays .
" If I fancy a pint I have to travel three miles to the only pub in my area that does n't have it .
I can't just go to the shops because huge parts of the high street affect me .
" If I go somewhere , I can instantly sense the Wi-Fi and have to leg it . "
Mr Miller , who had a residency at the Ibiza nightclub Pacha before his allergy , said he has missed out on a large number of overseas gigs because all airports and most hotels have Wi-Fi .
The only place where he can escape the " electrosmog " is in his own home – a detached house with 18in thick granite walls in a village near Falmouth , Cornwall .
Mr Miller believes that the majority of headaches people get at work can be attributed to their office Wi-Fi connections .
" I 've spoken to friends who work in offices who end up living on painkillers because of their daily headaches , " he said .
" They tried turning off their transmitters and found their headaches stopped . "

It is uncontested that Dr. Collins is a highly accomplished scientist .
Viewed from this perspective , Obama 's appointment is a perfectly reasonable one .
However , Dr. Collins also happens to be a very " proactive " Christian evangelical guy who has apparently argued that evolution is a process instituted by God , as well as proposing that is divinely ordained .
He has written a book titled The Language of God : A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief , as well as being a founder of the BioLogos Foundation wherein the central tenet is articulated as follows : " We believe that faith and science both lead to truth about God and creation . "
The United States Constitution guarantees the right for individuals to practice their religious beliefs as they see fit .
Hence , in this sense , Dr. Collins is perfectly within his rights to believe in all sorts of religious narratives .
The problem is that he has taken his private beliefs into a very public sphere .
As I discussed in an earlier post , it is exceptionally rare for scientists in general , and scientists of great repute in particular , to be believers .
Hence , Dr. Collins is indeed a paradox .
You might also recall my post wherein I tackled the evolution versus religion debate .
Suppose that a submits a grant application to the NIH to study the neuronal activation patterns of religious folks ( this relatively new field is known as neurotheology ) .
Or , let us for a moment imagine a different group of evolutionary scientists who submit a grant application to explore the Darwinian underpinnings of morality .
These legitimate scientific questions are in direct conflict with Dr. Collins ' publicly stated religious beliefs on these matters .
What should we conclude ?
Assuming that Dr. Collins sits on the actual adjudication committees for these two grants , will his scientific training guide his thinking or will his religious beliefs rule the day ?
Many readers of this blog are likely to have displayed horror at the idiocy of George Bush 's and Sarah Palin 's support for the teaching of Intelligent Design in schools ( and their corresponding disbelief in evolution ) .
Needless to say , as an evolutionary behavioral scientist , I wholeheartedly agree that this is nonsensical and outrageous .
That said I hope that the same people who chided Bush for his unmitigated stupidity will find it in their hearts ( if they are not blinded by sheer partisanship ; see my post on this topic here ) to proclaim with equal aplomb that Obama was equally idiotic in appointing a Bible - toting guy to head the NIH .
This appointment makes as much sense as to appoint an individual who believes in faith healing to be Surgeon - General , or to appoint an astrologer to head NASA .
Soldiers in the trenches of war are " allowed " to be overtly religious .
Priests can be openly religious .
It is expected that contemplatives might be religious and / or .
Directors of the National Institutes of Health should not be proclaiming that the ultimate truth lies in Evangelical Christianity .
Obama 's appointment makes as much sense as to appoint an atheist as the next Pope !
As a Jew ( by cultural transmission ) and atheist ( by conviction ) , I am feeling left out by Dr. Collins ' publicly stated religious beliefs .
Thank Darwin ( ; ) that as a Canadian I do not need to apply to the NIH for my research funding !
After two consecutive posts on atheism / religion , I promise to switch gears for my next post .
Stay tuned .
Ciao for now .

Why do our children always disappoint us ?
We spend 18 years carefully teaching and molding our kids , hoping they avoid the mistakes we made , praying they become upstanding , hard - working adults .
Do n't listen to rock n' roll ( or hip hop , or bebop , depending on the era ) , we warn them .
Yet what do they do as soon as we turn our backs ?
Still , we lecture : Join the Army , do n't join the Army .
Become a doctor , not a teacher .
And for heaven 's sake , do n't go into journalism .
I heard that one , and like many kids , ignored the wisdom of my parents .
Because we are so sure of our own moral compass and political ideology , we probably also hope our kids follow us into the church pew and the voting booth .
Yet , they rebel .
The '60s hippie parents sometimes spawn the bow - tied neo-con .
The bow - tied neo-con begets the philosophy major who panhandles for beer money .
Maybe it's the Lord 's way of keeping the world upright .
But for the parent , it still stings .
Can you imagine dinner at the Shrivers when Maria married Arnold ?
So it has to sting right now for Rep. Michele Bachmann .
Here 's what Bachmann said about President Obama 's plan to expand AmeriCorps , a program that puts young adults to work making the world a better place by teaching disadvantaged kids and helping the poor :
" [ It 's ] under the guise of quote , volunteerism , but it 's not volunteers at all , " she said on the Sue Jeffers radio show in April .
" It 's paying people to do work on behalf of government .
There are provisions for what I would call re-education camps for young people , where young people get trained in the philosophy the government puts forward and then they have to go work in these politically correct forums .
" As a parent , I would have a very , very difficult time seeing my children do this . "
You 've probably guessed by now that Bachmann 's son , Harrison Bachmann , recently joined Teach for America ( TFA ) , one of the programs under the AmeriCorps umbrella .
By the time Madeline Hanshaw 's son Gary Reinbach was 13 he was drinking heavily .
This week , aged just 22 , he died of liver failure .
Here , she defends herself – and her son's memory – against those who have been quick to pass judgment
Madeline Hanshaw is standing in her kitchen .
The washing is whirling around the machine , there are coffee cups in the sink , and outside kids are playing noisily in the sunshine .
It could be an ordinary day : but Hanshaw is wondering how life will ever be ordinary again .
" My baby is dead , " she says .
" That 's going to be in my heart every day for the rest of my life . "
Hanshaw , 44 , is crying now .
A week ago , she is saying , she still hoped that Gary – " Gal " , she calls him – would pull through .
" I believed in the doctors , " she says .
" I thought they 'd find a liver for him somehow .
I thought he'd make it . "
Gary Reinbach was denied a transplant because , under guidelines drawn up by the Liver Advisory Group , patients who are likely to return to a damaging pattern of alcohol consumption are n't deemed suitable candidates .
So Gal did n't make it : last Sunday , a day after Hanshaw had gone public with her plea to doctors to make a liver available to him , her 22 - year - old alcoholic son died at London 's University College hospital ( UCH ) .
His last hours , she says , were truly terrible .
" He did n't want to die .
He kept saying that .
I really think that if they 'd given him a second chance , he'd have changed his ways .
Gary Reinbach had shown promise as a young boy .
Photograph : Christian Sinibaldi
" He was talking about going back to college , training , making a new life for himself . "
She pauses .
" That is n't going to happen now . "
Talking to Hanshaw you get the feeling that – though Gary was desperately ill in hospital for 10 weeks before he died – neither she , nor he , believed it would come to this .
She still seems unable to believe that drink could have made his liver pack up while he was so young .
She is adamant she did n't realise he was drinking at 13 – " do n't you think I 'd have done something about it if I 'd known ? " – and says that , when she did realise he was drinking heavily from the age of about 16 , she did all she could to persuade him to stop .
" But he was a young lad , and what young lad listens to his mum ?
I thought it was just a phase .
I thought he'd come to his senses , stop drinking and move on . "
What neither she nor Gary was prepared for was the suddenness , and severity , of liver failure .
" One moment he was just a heavy drinker , the next he was losing weight and being sick every morning .
Then one day I noticed a yellow tint in his eyes , and I told him to get to the doctor . "
He did – and a few days later he was in hospital , first at Queen 's hospital near his home in Dagenham , Essex , then at UCH .
" By then he knew it was bad , but he still thought he could get through .
He was asking me to call Alcoholics Anonymous so he could start to turn his life around , " says Hanshaw .
As she shows me the death certificate – Gary died , it says , of " multi-organ failure " caused by " alcoholic hepatitis " – one of Hanshaw 's two younger sons , Luke , 18 , arrives .
Luke , too , says he never for a second thought Gary would die .
" Everyone round here is shocked , " he says .
" What I keep asking myself is , how come alcohol is n't illegal , when it killed my brother ?
" My mates used to drink , but they 're not drinking now .
They 've had enough – no one else wants to die like Gary died . "
What Luke and his mates have discovered the hard way is what liver specialists like Dr Nick Sheron , of Southampton General hospital , have been saying for some time : that young people who abuse alcohol heavily will suffer the same consequences that older people who 've been abusing it for many years do ; in other words , their livers will fail .
" I became a liver specialist 15 years ago , and I remember how shocked I was when I first saw a man of 23 with liver failure .
But this year already I 've seen five people with it in their early 20s .
Gary is n't going to be the last death .
We 're going to see a lot more young people in this state over the next few years .
" The mistake people are making is to think this problem can't get much worse .
It can .
We 're already seeing heavier drinking in very young people and that can lead , as it did in the case of Gary Reinbach , to early liver failure . "
But Sheron says even he is shocked by figures out this week which show that , among 11 - 15 - year - olds who drink ( ie , who have had alcohol in the past week ) , consumption has gone up from 5.3 units a week in 1990 to 12.7 in 2007 and 14.6 last year – an almost threefold increase in consumption in under two decades .
" We 're aware of a trend towards greater consumption in youngsters who drink , " he says .
" It escalates – what you see is someone who starts having alcohol in their early teens , and then they start to drink more and more on more and more days of the week .
It starts with the weekend binge , and then it spreads to Thursday nights and then Wednesday nights .
And then they 're drinking heavily on a daily basis – a recipe for liver disease . "
From talking to Hanshaw , that seems very much to have been how Gary 's drinking progressed .
But the big question is , why ?
What makes a child who 's doing reasonably well ( Hanshaw says her boy more than held his own at primary school , though his secondary school career was inevitably blighted by his alcohol use ) descend into an alcoholic daze ?
Inevitably , there is n't one single reason : as Sheron points out , the reasons for alcohol misuse are always multifactorial .
But availability is crucial : what a lot of people do n't realise , says Sheron , is how much easier it is for kids today to not only get their hands on alcohol , but to get their hands on stronger alcohol .
" Compared with 1980 , beer is 170 % more affordable , " he says .
" But wine is 280 % more affordable … and spirits are 350 % more affordable .
It 's not just that it 's got cheaper : the strongest stuff has got more affordable than the weaker stuff . "
So how did Gary , who reportedly got through three bottles of vodka a day at the height of his addiction , get his alcohol ?
" What happens is that an older kid buys them their first booze or they get it from girls who 've got adult men to buy it for them , " says Hanshaw .
" Then they get a taste for it , and they 're away – and they find ways to get it , of course they do . "
But availability is only part of the jigsaw : drinking yourself into a daily stupor requires a fairly heavy dissatisfaction with life as well .
Hanshaw says Gary was bored – " there 's nothing for them to do round here , I think he drank to help him get through the boredom " .
But she feels , too , that he was deeply affected by her marriage break - up when he was 11 , and that alcohol provided some solace .
" I think the fact that his dad and I broke up had a lot to do with it , " she says .
" But then again , plenty of kids have parents that break up . "
She also points to the fact that Gary was a hot shot at tae kwon do , and might even have become one of the youngest black belts in the country .
" But when we split up we moved away from where the classes were held , and it was too difficult for him to get to them .
I think that was a big disappointment , yes : when we had arguments , he 'd always throw that one back at me . "
It 's pretty heartbreaking , this idea of an 11 - year - old lad suddenly wrenched from the life he knew and deposited in this ground - floor flat on a rundown estate , his dream stolen from him and the world suddenly seeming to offer only disappointment .
Hanshaw says she feels both she and her dead son have been unjustly vilified in the press over the last few days .
For the first time during our chat , there is an edge of anger in her voice .
" I know people are blaming me and I know people are blaming him , but what I say is – you do n't know me , and you did n't know my son .
I did my best for him , just like any other mother .
Yes , his dad and I split up , but we 're still friends , he 's been down here this week .
It was n't the worst break - up . "
One of the things that has hurt her most has been that some people have said that it was right that her son was n't deemed eligible for the liver transplant that might have saved his life .
" I 've heard people have said that reading about Gal makes them feel like ripping up their donor cards .
Well , rip them up !
We would n't want a liver from anyone like them anyway . "
She pauses .
" At the end of the day , I 'm just a mum who was trying to keep her child alive .
You 'd do anything … I 'd do anything … "
She had heard that a transplant would have given Gary a 75 % chance of recovery .
She did all she could for him in what turned out to be his final weeks .
" I was at the hospital every day . "
Now , she says , she 'd just like other mothers , and other young people like Gary , to know the reality of heavy drinking .
" If they could have seen my Gary lying there , so ill and so swollen … if they could have heard how much he wanted to live .
If I 'd known then what I know now I 'd have done something , anything , to stop him drinking but I did n't know it could turn out this bad .
And I did n't know how to stop it . "
How to stop young alcoholism is the $ 64,000 question : and according to Sheron the answer , like the problem , is multifactorial .
" There is n't one single reason for it , and there is n't one single solution to it , " he says .
One thing he will be pinned down on is cheap alcohol marketed directly at young people .
" We 've got to look at the fact that there are almost no controls on this , " he says .
" It 's being pushed through the internet , through mobile phones , through all channels . "
But for Gary Reinbach , there was to be no second chance .
" I 'm not saying he was the perfect son , " says his mother .
" But I 'll tell you this : he did n't deserve to die like that , at 22 .
No one does .
And I hope to goodness others learn from it , because I do n't want any other mother to go through what I 'm going through . "
California shed 66,500 jobs in June , and more losses loom as double - digit unemployment spreads to state and local governments , once reliable bastions of employment security .
June ’s 11.6 % unemployment rate is a post - World War II record .
Professional services , construction and trade continue to top the state ’s jobless categories .
But in a troubling sign , governments -- a stable part of the state ’s economy for a decade -- have been laying off thousands of workers in recent months .
And far more losses are ahead .
California lost 6,700 government jobs in June after dropping 14,200 in May .
Facing huge deficits , the state continues to furlough employees , eliminate jobs and cut services .
Most offices were closed Friday .

Layoff notices are piling up at thousands of public schools , where an estimated 17,500 teachers statewide have been told not to return to classrooms in the fall , when they will officially join the ranks of the unemployed .
“ I see more government job losses , ” said Ross DeVol , director of regional economics for the Milken Institute in Santa Monica .
“ There ’s no way around it . ”
The effect of axing public sector workers should be felt more strongly in the July unemployment numbers to be released next month , said Howard Roth , chief economist at the state Department of Finance .
The continuing weak economy “ tells me it ’s going to take more layoffs than we thought ” to put the state ’s budget in balance .
Deanna Ragle , 46 , a parole clerk in Bakersfield with the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , got a formal layoff notice in May , and she expects to be let go in September .
Six months ago , her husband lost his job .

“ I can imagine how hard it ’s going to be , ” she said .
“ I ’m hoping the layoffs just do n’t happen . ”
Firing Ragle and thousands of other public workers means “ we ’re going to have fewer government jobs -- but also diminished services , ” said Stephen Levy , director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto .
“ That ’s why people are going to find the DMV offices closed . ”
Many children could be studying in classrooms packed with more students and fewer teachers when school starts in late August and early September , Levy predicted .
It was n’t supposed to be this way for government workers .
Historically , the public sector has tried to prime the economic pump during tough times by putting more people to work .
Think of the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps during the New Deal in the 1930s .

But this time around , government employment is shrinking and not creating jobs , and it has become “ a drag on the economy , ” said Christopher Thornberg , an analyst at Beacon Economics , a Los Angeles consulting firm .
No one needs to explain this to Tamara Eccleston , 31 , and her fiance , Gregg Weinstein , 37 .
Both new teachers were fired from their Los Angeles Unified School District posts .
“ Teaching was supposed to be one of the most secure jobs , and we ’re finding out we ’re out of work , ” said Eccleston , who was at Weemes Elementary School in Venice .
The two are heading to Las Vegas to restart their careers .
“ We ’re not going to sit here and wait for the scraps to fall off LAUSD ’s table , ” said Weinstein , who taught at Gompers Middle School .

Nevada may not be the best choice , given that the neighboring state has 12 % unemployment , a rate even higher than California ’s .
Michigan , with 15.2 % , has the nation ’s bleakest job picture , followed by Rhode Island with 12.4 % , Oregon with 12.2 % and South Carolina with 12.1 % .
And the employment outlook for California is not expected to turn around this year .
A consensus of economists forecast that the hiring wo n’t start to pick up until some time in the first half of 2010 .
Joblessness has swept through most of the Golden State ’s economy since the start of the so - called Great Recession .
The hemorrhaging began in construction and spread to financial services , retailing , trade , tourism and now government .
In all , California lost 766,300 jobs in the last year and 904,300 since the recession officially began in December 2007 .
June ’s 11.6 % unemployment rate stayed level from a revised May figure .
The job - loss totals and unemployment rates are not always in sync , with one sometimes moving faster or slower than the other .
That ’s because they are based on separate surveys .
Job losses are based on a survey of businesses , and the unemployment rate is derived from a federal survey of 5,500 California households .

Southern California continues to suffer disproportionately , though Los Angeles County ’s official job figures seemed to brighten a bit in June , with unemployment dropping to 11.3 % from 11.6 % in May .
Economists cautioned that the drop was probably caused by disheartened job seekers leaving the labor market , rather than by more people going back to work .
Elsewhere in the region , unemployment rose , jumping in June to 13.7 % in Riverside and San Bernardino counties from a revised 13.2 % in May .
Orange County unemployment increased to 9.2 % in June from a revised 8.8 % the previous month .
Those grim numbers , if they spawn deep cuts in services across the state , could do long - term damage to California ’s economy , economists warned .

Take the case of the Fremont Adult School in Sacramento , which for decades has been teaching English to immigrants from dozens of countries .
“ There were probably 10 people teaching part time , and now they ’re all gone , ” said Christine Hodgins , who was just fired after 20 years there .
“ The immigrant community is n’t shrinking .
Our classes are fuller than they ’ve been in a long time , ” she said .
“ The demand is there ; the need is there , but the money is n’t there to run the programs anymore . ”

Judge for yourself .
She is grabbing something !

Russian teenager Chermen has his own assessment of why he survived the attack on School Number One in Beslan in which 326 people , 186 of them children , died .
" God wanted to save everyone but He saved only those who had the highest purpose in life .
So I know that when I grow up I will become someone great , " he said .
On the morning of 1 September 2004 Chermen was just eight years old and running late for the Day of Knowledge , as the traditional start of the school year is known in Russia .
Chermen made it to the commencement celebrations in time , but in doing so was in the school when a group of Chechen gunmen attacked , taking more than 1,000 people hostage .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The militants herded the hostages into the school gym , and there they held them for three days .
Inside the sweltering gym the terrorists refused to give hostages food or water , forcing them to take drastic measures .
" I drank pee .
It was tasteless .
I also found a piece of pear skin on a floor .
It was really good , " Chermen told me when we first met .
" But mostly I slept . "
At one point he was woken by the sound of an explosion inside the gym .
Chermen saw how one of the militants had blown himself up with a grenade attached to his body : " A terrorist grenade was hit by a bullet .
He blew up and his brains hit me in the face .
It was horrible .
It was fatty and slippery , " he said .
The explosion triggered a fierce gun battle between the hostage takers and the Russian Special Forces , who stormed the school in a desperate rescue bid .
Chermen 's story was one of many I listened to shortly after the attack .
I had arrived in the town in November 2004 to make a BBC documentary and I stayed for weeks , forging close relationships with the youngsters and their families .
In total I spoke to 140 child survivors during that time .
Their accounts varied only in the gory details and the amount of horror they had lived through .
I returned to Beslan in May 2009 , passing on the drive from the airport to the town centre the cemetery which had been built to bury the attack victims in row upon tidy row .
Five years ago there were just wooden crosses marking the graves , most of them bearing a photo of a slain child and covered in toys .
The toys are still there , but now there are also headstones , all built from the same copper - coloured marble .
By the entrance an imposing new statue of three gigantic angels holding baby ones on their stretched hands dominates the site .
" They named the cemetery a City of Angels because all the children , all the people buried here were angels , " 14 - year - old Lana told me .
" They were all beautiful and kind .
But it was their destiny . "
Lana , goes to the cemetery to visit the grave of her four - year - old brother .
Her father , unable to cope with the loss of his only son , died shortly after the attack from heart failure .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Like so many of the children I met again , Lana is still trying to overcome a torment of her memories of the siege , which bring out emotions unfamiliar to most her age .
" I can't forget how the terrorists were killing children , mothers and fathers right in front of us , " she said .
" They caused us so much pain .
I am so angry with them I could kill them .
They took the most precious things in my life , my brother and my father . "
Laima , another survivor who is also now 14 , has made a ritual of her visits to the grave of her best friend who was killed .
" I go to visit Zayka at the cemetery .
I sit by her grave and talk to her .
I ask her 'how is life over there ?
How are you doing ? '
I believe she is still near me .
For me she is n't dead . "
But others , like Christina , are still troubled by thoughts of those who died .
" I am scared of my dead friends .
They come to me in my dreams .
They have changed .
They are dressed in black .
They are angry and say ' Why us ?
We wanted to live too ! ' "
And Chermen said that he never goes to the cemetery " because I am simply afraid to flood Beslan with my tears " .
Today life in Beslan shows some signs of normality .
There are new playgrounds and attractions for children built with some of the £ 20 m in donations which flooded in during the months following the siege .
And in the last five years Beslan has enjoyed a baby boom , including 50 children born into families affected by the attack .
For many these new arrivals have brought hope and a renewed sense of purpose .
Diana , who was eight when she was caught up in the attack , says of her little sister Karina , born two years after the siege : " She makes me forget about what happened .
I taught her how to ride a bike .
The first word she said was Diana . "
Most of the survivors go to a new , state - of - the - art school which stands just across the road from the derelict School Number One .
The children refused to give the new school a number , calling it School on Kominterna Street instead .
But five years on the survivors find studying far from straightforward .
Almost all suffer from huge memory and concentration problems .
The teachers told me that most of the children display bouts of aggression and bad behaviour , but following the psychologists ' advice , they are reluctant to discipline them .
Nearly all the children receive poor marks .

" I have become angry and nervous , " Lana explained .
" When I sit at lessons I forget things .
They speak and I do n't understand what it 's about .
Everything escapes my head . "
All of the children I spoke to suffer from health problems .
Persistent headaches and heart problems related to stress are the most common aliments developed as a result of their traumatic experiences .
But what struck me most while talking to children today was how their initial fury and hate towards the terrorists have been gradually replaced and directed elsewhere .
Many , like Laima , blame the Russian government for not having done enough to prevent the attack and for mishandling the stand - off with the terrorists after they had seized the school .
" If the government had satisfied their demands they might not have blown up the gym , " she said .
But with only one terrorist in jail and not a single official found responsible for the attack , some of the children now search for their own answers about what happened and why .

Atzamas was 10 when , on the last day of the siege , the force of the bomb blast knocked him out .
He woke up trapped under a pile of bodies .
He says he has tried to understand things from the attackers ' point of view .
" They can't be the only ones to blame .
I have studied their lives , their school of Islam and I thought hard about the war in Chechnya .
" If they were attacked by Russian troops , they were fighting to be free .
And then they would want revenge on Russia - after all Russia had been killing their children too , " he said .
Since the attack each of the children has in their own way tried to overcome its legacy and focus on the future .
" I am going to be a doctor .
I will have my own clinic where I will treat future victims of terrorism , " Laima told me .
But Chermen has even loftier plans , born out of the sense of destiny his close brush with death has engendered .
" I will grow up to become the president .
It 's not a question whether I will or not .
It is just a question when , " he said .

When Bill Paxton first encounters the angel in his bedroom , we can hear a broadcast of a baseball game .
This flashback scene , as recounted by Matthew McConaughey , is supposed to take place in 1979 .
But the broadcaster refers to a player hitting .279 and stealing 73 bases for Lake Elsinore .
There was no professional baseball in Lake Elsinore in 1979 , and the only player to hit .279 and steal 73 bases for Lake Elsinore was Alfredo Amezaga in 2000 -- one year before the movie was released .

When the Los Angeles County Museum of Art announced that it was deaccessioning part of its textile collection , artist Robert Fontenot was on the scene .
He hit up three separate auctions and acquired 50 pieces , almost half of the items the museum was getting rid of .
The resulting work is sometimes arty , sometimes functional , and all beautiful !
He embroiders the accession number into each finished piece .
The project is still a work in progress , and I just love this quote from his artist ’s statement : “ Although each item has not yet been used , each item can have a use . ”
Yes !
I think that can apply to materials in a much larger sense , and his work is a fantastic reminder that old pieces can take on a whole new life with just a little bit of love .
Want to get your upcycle on ?
Thrift stores and even the back of your closet are full of textiles that can take on a whole new life !
Here are a few ideas to get you going :
You can check out more of Fontenot ’s amazing textile work at the Recycle LACMA blog to get some inspiraton .
For more of his work , take a peek over at Dictionary of Earthly Delights .
So , seamsters and seamstresses , I know you guys have done some awesome fabric upcycling of your own .

BUTTE , MO — Due to a loophole in the federal “ Cash for Clunkers ” program , local dentist Halman Johnson was able to bring his wife of twenty - two years into the local Ford dealership and walk away with $ 4500 cash and a 2010 Escort Cabriolet hybrid .
BUTTE , MO — Due to a loophole in the federal “ Cash for Clunkers ” program , local dentist Halman Johnson was able to bring his wife of twenty - two years into the local Ford dealership and walk away with $ 4500 cash and a 2010 Escort Cabriolet hybrid .
The “ Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009 , ” passed by Congress earlier this year , was designed to get inefficient , low - mileage polluters off the road , but according to Alonzo LaMonica of LaMonica Ford , the rules never specifically stated it had to be an automobile .
“ It specified mileage and age , but never indicated anywhere in the legislation that it could n’t be a person . ”
Dr. Johnson may not be the last to capitalize on the loophole .
Upon hearing of the dentist ’s trade - in , Congress gathered in an emergency session to issue a temporary moratorium on issuing cash for spouses , domestic partners , and parties to civil unions , but the ban does n’t take effect immediately .
Consumers have until Friday to bring their significant others to their local dealership and claim their rebate .
LaMonica said he hopes the ban is n’t permanent .
He spent nearly fifty - thousand dollars on an upcoming advertising campaign , urging customers to “ Trade in Your Wife for a Little Black Escort . ”
“ If this program ends , ” he said , “ that money ’s down the ol’ crapper . ”
Perhaps a bigger problem for LaMonica was what to do with Mrs. Johnson .
“ We could n’t just drop her into the junk heap with the rest of the trade - ins , ” he said .
LaMonica did the next best thing : he bought her a one - way ticket to Capitol Hill .
“ Those congressmen will know what to do , ” he explained .
“ They have plenty of experience dealing with other men ’s wives . ”
Those to follow Nie Haisheng into space must have impeccable dental hygiene
Would - be astronauts competing for China 's next space programme must comply with 100 rules - excluding those with bad breath or a runny nose .
The list , intended to recruit " super human beings " , also prohibits those with body odours , tooth cavities or scars which may " burst open " in space .
China will launch a space module next year and hopes for a docking by 2011 .
But aspiring " taikonauts " will get nowhere without marital approval .
Wives get the final say under the new rules .
Bad body odour will affect fellow colleagues in the narrow confines of a space shuttle
Shi Bing Bing , air force doctor
If a would - be astronaut 's spouse does not like the idea of them going into space they must remain on earth .
Shi Bing Bing , a doctor at the 454th Air Force Hospital in Nanjing , eastern China , said the new rules will help China send the best of the best into space .
" Bad body odour will affect fellow colleagues in the narrow confines of a space shuttle , " he said .
" These astronauts could be regarded as super human beings . "
Mr Shi's hospital has now carried out a first screening of candidates to weed out those who fell foul of the 100 rules .
A further two screenings will whittle hopefuls down to the small band who will follow in the footsteps of China 's space pioneers , chosen in 1997 .
Any candidate with a history of serious illness in the last three generations of their family is barred .
' Pleasant disposition '
Also prohibited are those with drug allergies or ringworm .
Successful candidates must possess a " pleasant and adaptable disposition " , the guidelines make clear .
China put its first person into space in 2003 , while Zhai Zhigang , the son of a snack seller , carried out the first Chinese spacewalk last year .
The country 's long - term goal is to build its own space station orbiting earth .
The most revealing insight into Goldman Sachs ' record quarterly revenues and profits was provided by finance director David Viniar .
He said the performance was achieved by " basic blocking and tackling " .
In other words , Goldman did n't do anything special between March and June .
Its bankers did n't score spectacular goals or touchdowns ; they simply went about their business in " plain vanilla " areas .
The result was that the firm generated profits at the rate of $ 38 m a day while also allocating $ 74 m daily to the pot labelled " compensation and benefits " .
If the second half of this year is like the first , Goldman 's staff can expect to receive roughly $ 700,000 a head on average in 2009 , with its big beasts collecting much , much more .
How did this happen so soon after the banking crisis ?
We can allow Goldman one little boast .
It clearly did a better job of managing risk than most of its competitors .
It did n't blow itself up and it is now freer than others to throw its capital behind profitable opportunities , particularly in bonds , currencies and commodities .
But the rewards for the survivors now start to look more obscene than ever .
The disappearance of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns , the retreat of Royal Bank of Scotland , and the chastened nature of the Swiss banks and Morgan Stanley has changed the market .
Goldman and a handful of other firms now enjoy immense pricing power .
Spreads between bid and offer prices have widened ; fees for underwriting and arranging rights issues have exploded ; and easy money can be made by finding buyers for the vast sums of debt that governments must issue .
Investment banking suddenly looks like one of the world 's least competitive industries .
Do n't worry , the winners argue , it 's a temporary phenomenon that will reverse when the rest of the sector is back on its feet .
We 'll see , but the behaviour of the survivors suggests the opposite : they are hiring staff on salaries and guaranteed bonus packages that make sense only if the days of mega- profits have returned permanently .
Their assessment may not be perverse .
Regulators are clearly determined to stamp on remuneration structures that encourage excessive risk - taking .
But Goldman demonstrated that , in the current investment banking climate , you do n't have to take big risks to earn big bucks .
The bank 's leverage ratio has halved since 2007 .
The question for governments in the US , Europe and Japan is whether they are prepared to tolerate this state of affairs indefinitely .
The point of rescuing the banks was to prevent economic catastrophe .
That process clearly involves banks rebuilding their capital bases and generating profits once again .
But once this stage is reached – and Goldman has got there faster than anybody else – it's time to ask whether exceptional profits deserve exceptional rates of taxation .
If we , the taxpayers , are obliged to underwrite the banking system , it is surely right to extract a fair price for that guarantee .
That 's how pricing power works , as Goldman would presumably understand .
BA needs Iberia
British Airways chairman Martin Broughton says the timing is n't right for a rights issue as " a number of key issues " have to be resolved .
No kidding .
A prospectus written today would have to include a mammoth section on risk factors .
BA does n't yet know the size of the deficit in its pension fund .
The accounting valuation suggests a widening of £ 1.2bn in the past year , but it 's the actuarial assessment that matters and that is likely to be even grimmer when the figures arrive in the autumn .
Nor is there any sign of improvement in the aviation market .
BA is now contemplating ripping out flat - bed seats in some of its 747s , acknowledging that demand for business class travel will be lower permanently .
And , perhaps most importantly , the intended merger with Iberia still has not happened .
This deal promises to deliver annual cost savings of £ 400 m , meaning it is by far the most important of BA 's " self - help " measures .
Chipping away at payroll costs and delaying the delivery of new planes is fine , but there 's nothing like a grand merger to achieve big savings .
Broughton says he is " frustrated at the slow progress " and hopes management changes at Iberia will provide " an impetus " to discussions .
That 's hardly a statement of confidence .
It sounds as the Spanish are waiting to see the size of the pension deficit .
In the meantime , any new cash will have to be raised via convertible bonds .
Air France and Lufthansa have already tapped this market , so BA should n't encounter any difficulties .
But it would be a sticking plaster .
BA needs Iberia soon .

A new photo claiming to show the retail packaging for Apple 's long - awaited Mac mini refresh has surfaced online , adding to speculation that March will serve as launch pad for several new desktop Macs .
The new image ( below ) , published by OneMoreThing.nl , depicts what could be the backside of a shrink - wrapped Mac mini - sized retail box .
Shown on the box is a photo of Mac mini with ports for Ethernet , FireWire 800 , Mini DVI , and Mini DisplayPort , as well as 5 USB connectors .
All of these ports match up with descriptions ( 1 , 2 ) of a next - generation Mac mini published in early January by AppleInsider .
The image of the Mac mini in the photo also appears identical to the system that cropped up last month in a still photo and video walk - around .
While the authenticity of the latest image remains suspect , it joins rumblings this week that six new Apple product part numbers have recently turned up in the inventory system of a large overseas reseller .
Obvious speculation would suggest these could represent 4 new iMac configurations and 2 new Mac mini configurations .
The source of the photo also told OneMoreThing.nl that the mini refresh would arrive alongside new iMacs that support up to 8GB of RAM and 1TB of hard disk space .
It 's long been rumored , and corroborated twice over ( 1 , 2 ) , that new Mac mini and iMac desktops would surface sometime in early 2009 with chipsets from NVIDIA .
A NVIDIA graphics icon on the rear of the purported Mac mini box would seem to be consistent with those claims .
It was an odd little story , tucked well inside the front section of this past Sunday 's New York Times .
An antiwar activist in the state of Washington had been exposed as an undercover informant for the US army , stationed at massive Fort Lewis , south of Tacoma .
And in one of those Kafkaesque twists for which our government is renowned , the army is now investigating itself to determine how such an arrangement came to pass .
Although the Times gave no credit , the story had been broken on 28 July by Democracy Now ! , a leftwing television programme co-anchored by Amy Goodman , a longtime progressive journalist .
For nearly an hour , two former associates of John Towery – a civilian employee of the army – explained how they learned their fellow activist was in fact a military spy .
" We hung out , " said Brendan Maslauskas Dunn , who filed the public - records request that inadvertently outed Towery , who had been going by the name John Jacob .
" We gave workshops together on grassroots direct democracy and anarchist struggle .
I mean , he was a friend . "
Fellow activist Drew Hendricks offered a weird twist , telling Goodman that , as far back as 2007 , Towery identified himself as an army employee and offered to provide Hendricks with " observations and inside knowledge of operations on Fort Lewis " .
The picture that emerges is worthy of a cheap spy novel .
If Maslauskas Dunn and Hendricks are correct , then Towery truthfully told antiwar activists that he worked for the army , but lied about his name and real purpose : gathering intelligence on his new associates and what threat they might have posed .
( According to the Times , antiwar groups in Washington have attempted to " disrupt military shipments " . )
Moreover , Towery 's alleged activities would almost certainly have been illegal .
According to two lawyers whom Goodman interviewed , Larry Hildes of the National Lawyers Guild and Mike German of the American Civil Liberties Union , such spying would violate the Posse Comitatus Act , which prohibits the use of American military forces for domestic law - enforcement operations .
The law was weakened during the Bush years , though Hildes and German told Goodman that operations such as that attributed to Towery remain illegal .
Towery 's alleged spying is yet another sign that Barack Obama 's reluctance to come to terms with the legacy of George Bush and Dick Cheney 's legacy is simply not tenable .
By attempting to move on without accountability , Obama is becoming complicit in the very activities against which he ran .
The Bush - Cheney administration 's obsession with running roughshod over constitutional and legal principles is by now well - established , with torture being just the most infamous example .
Only a week ago , the New York Times revealed that Cheney had pushed hard in 2002 to send troops to suburban Buffalo in order to arrest several al - Qaida suspects .
It 's difficult to imagine why Cheney would want to do such a thing other than to set a precedent .
In any event , Bush said no .
And as we know , Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz and their fellow neoconservatives were n't above casting institutions such as the military and even the CIA as weak and unpatriotic when it suited their purposes .
General Eric Shinseki , after all , was cashiered from his position as army chief of staff after he dared to tell the truth about how many troops would be needed to carry out a successful invasion and occupation of Iraq .
( Shinseki is now Obama 's secretary of veterans affairs . )
And when former diplomat Joseph Wilson , on a mission for the CIA , revealed he had found no evidence that Saddam Hussein sought to purchase uranium in Niger , Team Cheney retaliated by exposing his wife , Valerie Plame Wilson , as an agency operative .
The Towery allegations are not the first time it's been reported that the goverment has infiltrated the rather impotent antiwar movement .
A little more than a year ago , for instance , it was revealed that the Maryland state police had spied on peace activists in that state .
But the alleged misuse of the army places this on a different level , both ethically and legally .
Not to get ahead of the story , but if the Towery story bears out , then it 's difficult to imagine he was alone .
In that sense this could prove to be reminiscent of Cointelpro , the FBI 's secret , illegal programme , which kept tabs on dissidents from 1956 to1971 .
We need to know the truth about what happened during the Bush - Cheney years , and what may still be happening , with or without Obama 's knowledge .
Since his inauguration more than six months ago , Obama has been half - hearted , at best , about exposing his predecessor 's wrongdoing .
Maybe he 's right – maybe he can't investigate the Bush White House and govern the country at the same time .
But if that is the case , then Obama should quietly encourage officials like Vermont senator Patrick Leahy , who has made it clear that he'd like to conduct a no-holds - barred investigation .
Much as Obama would like to put it all behind us , he can't .
And he should n't .

A simple but effective deterrent
A simple fence made from wood , wire and beehives can deter elephants from raiding farmers ' crops .
A pilot study in Kenya has shown that such fences reduce the number of raids by elephants by almost half .
The work is the culmination of previous research which showed elephants are naturally scared of African honey bees .
A much larger trial is now under way in the hope the fences will provide an elegant solution to years of conflict between elephants and farmers .
In Kenya , elephants are not confined to national parks or reserves .
As they roam , they often come across increasing numbers of farms created by pastoralists who are being encouraged to settle down and grow crops .
The elephants break into the farms and raid them for food such as ripe tomatoes , potatoes and maize .
We expect elephants recognise the shape and smell of the beehives and avoid them in case they disturb the bees
Zoologist Lucy King
That causes significant economic damage and conflict with farmers who occasionally resort to shooting , spearing or poisoning elephants to protect their livelihoods and families .
So researchers from a British university worked with the charity Save the Elephants to conduct a pilot study of a novel " beehive fence " .
The design is based on the idea that elephants are wary of honey bees in the wild .
In 2002 , University of Oxford zoologist Fritz Vollrath discovered that elephants avoided trees with beehives in .
Colleague Lucy King followed this idea up by showing that elephants would quickly move on even if they heard the sound of a buzzing hive .
Buzzed off
Now a team led by King , including Vollrath , has taken the idea to its logical conclusion - the creation of a fence containing beehives .
In the Ex - Erok community in the southern region of Laikipia , Kenya , the team recruited farmers whose crops were regularly raided by elephants .
Around the side of one farm , nine traditional log beehives were hung under small thatched roofs , with each being linked by wire .
In all , the fence continued for 90 m with each hive 10 m apart .
The hives were left empty .
Another similar - sized control farm nearby was left unfenced .
Bull elephants close in on a human settlement .
The farmers than recorded how many elephants raided their crops and how often .
" The fence deterred a significant portion of elephants , " King told Earth News , speaking from her tent in the Kenyan bush .
In all , elephants raided the protected farm on seven occasions , compared to 13 raids on the unfenced farm .
Just 38 individual elephants reached the protected fields , compared to 95 feeding in those not protected , the team reports in the African Journal of Ecology .
" Even with empty hives , the beehive fence is a swinging , moving complex shape which provides a visual barrier to approaching elephants .
But from our other work in Kenya we have learnt that elephants avoid feeding on trees with beehives in and they run away from bee sounds , " says King .
" So we expect elephants recognise the shape and smell of beehives and will avoid them in case they disturb the bees .
Occupied hives will have even more success in deterring elephants and also provide honey for the villagers . "
Indeed , the pilot was so successful that the farmers involved ended up extending the fence at their own cost and initiative .
A severe year - long drought in the region has hampered the team 's efforts to conduct a much wider trial of the fence , using a different hive design that should produce more honey .
That is under way across 60 farms , with funds provided by the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund , Safaricom Foundation and Save the Elephants .
" We have built 1,700 metres of beehive fences which we are monitoring for hive occupations and elephant movements , " says King .
" We are having good success with hive occupations but the drought has caused the experiment to go on hold until the next rainy season in November when the community will try to plant once more . "
So why are elephants so scared of bees ?
The bees are n't likely to be able to sting though an elephant 's thick hide .
But they can and do sting elephants around the eyes and inside the trunk .
It seems that this only has to happen once for an elephant never to forget the experience .

A quick survey to help us focus development : https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/wikipathways
Haverford , Pennsylvania police had quite a little PR flap going on a few weeks ago , after they broke up a supposedly - illegal door - to - door lemonade ring .
According to the story in the Philadelphia Inquirier ( official motto : No , you 're thinking of the ) , seven little kids , including 5 - year - old triplets , were selling lemonade on their quiet suburban street , but one of their neighbors felt it was his duty to report the children to the police .
So the officer — whose name was blacked out in the official police report obtained by the Inquirer — visited Dana Kleinschmidt , mother of four of the lawbreakers ( including the triplets ) , and told her the kids were violating the law because they were selling food without a permit .
So Kleinschmidt told the kids they had to stop , but told the officer that she had never heard of that law .
Mostly because there was n't one .
" We all sold lemonade when we were kids , " John F. Viola , deputy chief of police , told the Inquirer .
" We all went , like , who calls [ police ] on kids ?
" William Nickerson does , apparently .
He called to complain when the kids showed up at his house , because he thought the kids were n't being properly supervised .
So when the unnamed officer rolled up , gun drawn , town statutes a - blazing , it turns out the law he cited — vending without a permit — does n't apply to anyone younger than 16 .
Viola found out about the incident after reading Kleinschmidt 's heart - wrenching post on HaverfordBlog.com .
And as news of the unnamed officer 's misinterpretation of the law spread throughout the township , Viola asked Sargent Joe Hagan , a patrolman for that area , to meet with the family , which he did .
He explained to them all that they had done nothing wrong , and that they could sell all the lemonade they wanted .
He said one of the triplets even hugged him .---
The right to health care is guaranteed in the Venezuelan Constitution , which was written and ratified by the people in 1999 .
Through implementing a state - funded social program called Barrio Adentro , or inside the barrio , free comprehensive health care is available to all Venezuelans .
Beginning in June 2003 through a trade pact with Cuba , Venezuela began to bring Cuban doctors , medical technology , and medications into rural and urban communities free of charge in exchange for low - cost oil .
The 1.5 million dollar per year program expanded to provide a broad network of small neighborhood clinics , larger regional clinics , and hospitals which aim to serve the entire Venezuelan population .
( 1 ) Chavez has referred to this new health care system as the " democratization of health care " stating that " health care has become a fundamental social right and the state will assume the principal role in the construction of a participatory system for national public health . "
( 2 ) In Venezuela , not only is health care a right ; it is recognized as essential for true participatory democracy .
Some of what characterizes this movement towards health care for all includes popular participation , preventative medicine , and evaluation of community health issues .
Western medicine typically operates in a top - down fashion .
Doctors treat symptoms , and often fail to evaluate the larger picture of community health issues or teach prevention .
( 3 ) In a private for - profit system , there is little incentive to prevent costly illnesses .
In Venezuela , however , Barrio Adentro began constructing clinics within neighborhoods where many had never been to a doctor .
Through this program , a community can organize to receive funding to build a clinic and bring in doctors .
The community is responsible for creating health committees , the members of which go door to door to assess the specific health issues of their community .
Doctors who live in the communities also make house calls .
( 4 ) People participate in the process of serving the health needs of the entire population .
The extensive health program is also being used to train a new generation of Venezuelan doctors .
The training program takes place within the clinic system itself and relies heavily on experiential learning .
The program seeks to build a new relationship between doctor and patient based on the values of service , solidarity and compassion .
Doctors participating in the training program are coming from the communities they are learning in and serving , building on their intimate knowledge of the communities to provide truly compassionate and personalized care .
Using popular forums , medical professionals are able to respond to the needs of the community and offer education , treatment and consultation addressing unique public health issues .
( 6 )
Although the system began by focusing exclusively on preventative health , it has expanded to include emergency health services , mental health services , surgeries , cancer treatment , dental care , access to optometrists as well as free glasses and contact lenses , support systems for those with disabilities and their families , as well as access to a large variety of medical specialists .
They have succeeded in taking an under funded , corrupt public health care system and changing not only the quality and accessibility but also the mentality of those working there .
Instead of a for - profit industry systematically denying access to large sectors of the population , health care in Venezuela is seen as a basic human right .
No one is turned away , and no one is denied care .
In Venezuela , they treat whole person , not simply their illness , and money stays where it belongs - outside of the health care system .
( 7 )
During my time in Venezuela , I developed a cough that went on for three weeks and progressively worsened .
Finally , after I had become incredibly congested and developed a fever , I decided to attend a Barrio Adentro clinic .
The closest one available was a Barrio Adentro II Centro de Diagonostico Integral ( CDI ) and I headed in without my medical records or calling to make an appointment .
Immediately , I was ushered into a small room where Carmen , a friendly Cuban doctor , began questioning me about my symptoms .
She listened to my lungs and walked me over to another examination room where , again without waiting , I had x-rays taken .
Afterwards , the technician walked me to a chair and apologized profusely that I had to wait for the x-rays to be developed , promising that it would take no more than five minutes .
Sure enough , five minutes later he returned with both x-rays developed .
Carmen studied the x-rays and informed me that I had pneumonia , showing me the telltale shadows .
She sent me away with my x-rays , three medications to treat my pneumonia , congestion , and fever , and made me promise to come back if my conditioned failed to improve or worsened within three days .
I walked out of the clinic with a diagnosis and treatment within twenty - five minutes of entering , without paying a dime .
There was no wait , no paperwork , and no questions about my ability to pay , my nationality , or whether , as a foreigner , I was entitled to free comprehensive health care .
There was no monetary value connected with my physical well - being ; the care I received was not contingent upon my ability to pay .
I was treated with dignity , respect , and compassion , my illness was cured and I was able to continue with my journey in Venezuela .
This past year , a family friend was not so lucky .
At the age of 56 , she was going back to school and was uninsured .
She came down with what she thought was a severe case of the flu , and as her condition worsened she decided not to see a doctor because of the cost .
She died at home in bed , losing her life to a system that did not respect her basic human right to survive .
Her death is not an isolated incident .
Over 18,000 United States residents die every year because of their lack of prohibitively expensive health insurance .
The United States has the distinct honor of being the " only wealthy industrialized nation that does not ensure that all citizens have coverage " .
(8) Instead , we have commodified the public health and well being of those live in the US , leaving them on their own to obtain insurance .
Those whose jobs do not provide insurance , can't get enough hours to qualify for health care coverage through their workplace , are unemployed , or have " previously existing conditions " that exclude them from coverage are forced to choose between the potentially fatal decision of refusing medical care and accumulating medical bills that trap them in an inescapable cycle of debt .
And sometimes , that decision is made for them .
Doctors often ask that dreaded question ; " do you have insurance ? " before scheduling critical tests , procedures , or treatments .
When the answer is no , treatments that were deemed necessary before are suddenly canceled as the ability to pay becomes more important than the patient 's health .
( 9 )
It is estimated that there are over fifty million United States residents currently living without health insurance , a number that will skyrocket as unemployment rates increase and people lose their work - based health care coverage in this time of international financial crisis .
( 10 ) Already this year , 7.5 million people have lost work - related coverage .
Budget cuts for the state of Washington this year will remove over forty thousand people from Washington Basic Health , a subsidized program which already has a waiting list of seventeen thousand people .
( 11 ) As I returned to the US from Venezuela , I was faced with the realization that as a society , the United States places a monetary value on life .
That we make life and death judgments based on an individual 's ability to pay .
And that someone with the same condition I had recently recovered from had died because , according to our system , her life was n't insured .
Many in the United States fear that people would abuse a free health care system , causing overcrowding and a compromised level of care .
Others claim that a single payer system would limit the freedoms of both doctor and patient .
These claims , propagated by the corporate media in the United States , are a hollow attempt to keep those in the US from organizing to demand single payer health care .
Primary care and preventative medicine are seen as the first steps towards sustainable universal health care , keeping people out of costly hospital stays , tests , and treatments down the road .
Socializing the costs of medicine keeps costs low by preventing expensive treatments and health problems .
It is difficult to understand how much quality , free health care means until you find yourself in a position of vulnerability and need .
I felt a sense of security traveling in Venezuela that I do not feel in the United States ; in Venezuela , there is a safety net ready to catch you when you fall .
People in the US must ask themselves , as a country , where our values lie and how we have not only let people slip through the cracks but worked to systematically exclude them .
Do we believe that insurance corporations and the medical industrial complex should be profiting from denying care and keeping sick people from receiving treatment ?
Or do we believe that care should be separate from an individual 's ability to pay ?
As a nation , we must embrace our humanity and value life over profits .

The “ selfish gene ” metaphor , while a great success , may now be getting in the way of peoples ’ understanding of evolution ( Image : Andrzeg Krause )
THE notion of the “ selfish gene ” is the most successful scientific metaphor of the past 30 years , followed not far behind by “ the extended phenotype ” .
Both were coined by Richard Dawkins and are , as it happens , the titles of his first popular science books .
The Selfish Gene ‘s message was that evolution is about the natural selection of genes , and genes alone .
Dawkins sees them as the best candidates to be evolution ’s units of replication .
As such , the genes that are passed on …
A while ago I got the idea to write a “ my experiences with JavaScript ” post ; unfortunately , I ’ve forgotten what I was going to put in it .
However , yesterday someone said approximately “ I need to learn JavaScript in 3 hours , what should I know ? ” , and I thought of quite a few not - immediately - obvious things to point out .
General
Beware the bad tutorials .
As far as I know , Mozilla ’s Core JavaScript 1.5 Reference and Core JavaScript 1.5 Guide are not bad .
( I start with the former for library / standard objects info , and the latter for language syntax . )
Anything Crockford says goes .
It ’s probably a good idea to use JSLint but I have n’t myself .
If you use Firefox with Firebug , or Safari , write your code to use the console object , if present ; it is a very nice tool for your inevitable print - debugging , and Firebug ’s version even lets you click on objects shown to inspect them .
Miscellaneous practice
Do n’t ever write a busy - wait / polling / delay loop .
It wo n’t work and it'll waste your users ' time .
JavaScript in the browser is an event - driven system ; use setTimeout ( callback once ) and / or setInterval ( callback repeated with specified period ) as appropriate .
You can write a background loop with setTimeout : function loop ( ) { if ( termination condition ) { return ; } else { ... do something ... ; setTimeout ( loop , 0 ) ; } } ; loop ( ) ;
( callback once ) and / or ( callback repeated with specified period ) as appropriate .
You can write a background loop with setTimeout :
Do n’t throw " foo " ; but throw new Error ( " foo " ) ; because that gives Firefox , at least , an opportunity to insert call stack information .
but because that gives Firefox , at least , an opportunity to insert call stack information .
JavaScript has two " nothing " values : undefined , of type " undefined " , and null , of type " object " .
undefined is returned by failed property lookups and the default return value of functions .
null does n’t show up much unless you use it , and is useful in your code for distinguishing deliberate absence from an accidental missing value ( bug ) .
Scope
Local variables are declared with " var " , but they are scoped to the nearest enclosing function , not the nearest { block } !
" , but they are scoped to the nearest enclosing function , not the nearest block !
Functions can be closures .
Use this when it ’s useful .
Do n’t write setTimeout ( ' foo ( ) ' , delay ) ( because string - eval is a bad habit ) , write setTimeout ( foo , delay ) or setTimeout ( function ( ) { foo ( ) /* for more complicated things */ } , delay ) .
this
Do n’t call a user - defined constructor ( say , Foo ) , as Foo ( ) , only new Foo( ) , or it will overwrite global variables instead of creating an object .
( new binds this to a new object inside the function ; a regular call leaves it as the global object . )
, only , or it will overwrite global variables instead of creating an object .
( binds to a new object inside the function ; a regular call leaves it as the global object . ) foo. bar( ) is the same as ( foo.bar ) ( ) , and is not the same as var x = foo. bar ; x ( ) .
The former binds this inside the function to the foo object ; the latter does not .
Properties and variables
for ( x in y ) ... does not do what you might first expect ; it iterates over all properties of the object , even inherited ones .
does not do what you might first expect ; it iterates over all properties of the object , even inherited ones .
If you see $ ( ' foo ' ) :
That is not some magic new operator .
$ is an identifier character .
That expression is a function call .
From what I hear , both Prototype and jQuery define functions named $ .
: That is not some magic new operator .
is an identifier character .
That expression is a function call .
From what I hear , both Prototype and jQuery define functions named .
foo. bar is exactly equivalent to foo [ " bar " ] .
is exactly equivalent to .
foo. bar returns undefined if bar is not a property of foo ; bar throws an error if bar is not a property of whatever the environment is .
So if you ’re doing browser feature detection , you write code like if ( window.console ) , not if ( console ) , even though window is the global object and its properties are variables .
Numbers
We all knew this was going to happen eventually .
If you believe in a quarterback as much as the Pioli Trinity obviously does in Matt Cassel , you do n’t risk letting him walk after one season .
Nobody likes a “ wham , bam , thank you , ma’am . ”
Well , unless it happens to the Broncos .
That ’s why the Chiefs have signed Cassel to a long - term contract .
The details of the deal are currently unknown , but you know the man got a Cassel of riches .
His agent is n’t going to let him agree to chump change when he was scheduled to make just a shade under $ 15 million this upcoming season due to the franchise tender the Hoody and Co. slapped on him back in New England .
There ’s one huge thing we Chiefs fans can take away from this development , and it ’s that the Chiefs ’ brain trust could n’t give their new signal caller much more of a ringing endorsement .
Update : Pro Football
Talk believes they know the details :
Though we are coming up empty via traditional efforts to determine details regarding Cassel ’s deal , we currently believe that it ’s indeed a six - year package , with a base value in excess of $ 60 million .
That ’s more than the six - year deal Tom Brady signed with the Patriots in 2005 , which further confirms that he ’s one of the most underpaid players in the NFL .
We also believe that the three - year take , one of the key factors in determining the value of a contract , is more than $ 42 million .
More money than — GULP ! — Tom Brady ?
Hope he ’s worth it , and I think he will be .
Remember , Brady also gave the cap - strapped Pats a break so they could add other players .
Funny thing is , Gisele will make more than both quarterbacks combined next year .

( P.S. – Yes , I am back .
More on that very soon .
Kind of an A.A. debriefing heading into the season . )
Taro Aso 's party has governed for most of the past half century Japan 's embattled prime minister , Taro Aso , is to call an election for 30 August , officials from his party say .
He made the decision after a crushing defeat in local elections in the capital , Tokyo , seen as a key indicator for a national vote .
Mr Aso 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) has ruled Japan almost continuously for the past 50 years .
His popularity has plummeted as Japan 's economy , the world 's second - largest , has suffered in the global downturn .
'' I want to seek the people 's mandate by dissolving the House of Representatives early in the week beginning 21 July .
Election Day is 30 August , '' Prime Minister Aso was quoted as saying in a meeting with cabinet ministers and officials from the LDP and its coalition partner , New Komeito .
Mr Aso also apologised in the meeting for the LDP 's poor showing in the Tokyo municipal assembly election , Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Jun Matsumoto said .
The only course of action for the prime minister is to dissolve the House of Representatives and ask the people for their verdict
DPJ leader Yukio Hatoyama
The opposition Democratic Party ( DPJ ) won 54 seats to 38 for the LDP , ending four decades of LDP dominance in the assembly .
Japan is gripped by a steep recession and the prime minister 's gaffes and apparent indecision have left him with an approval rating of about 20 % , says the BBC 's Roland Buerk in Tokyo .
Mr Aso has also been facing open rebellion within his own party .
Pressure to quit Meanwhile , the DPJ introduced a no -confidence motion against the prime minister and his cabinet in the lower house and a censure motion against the prime minister in the upper house .
The no-confidence motion is unlikely to be passed as the LDP - New Komeito coalition holds a majority in the more powerful lower house .
ASO'S KEY MOMENTS
Sept 2008 : Confirmed as PM Nov 2008 : Causes outrage by saying doctors lack common sense Nov 2008 : Alienates pensioners - a key constituency - by saying they " just eat and drink and make no effort " Feb 2009 : Economics minister says Japan facing worst economic crisis since WWII April 2009 : Introduces stimulus package after months of delay July 2009 : Tokyo election loss - fourth in recent weeks .
DPJ has at least 12 percentage point lead in opinion polls Profile : Taro Aso Japanese PM fights for survival
The censure motion could be adopted in the upper house , which the DPJ dominates .
'' The people are suffering under politics ruled by the survival of the fittest , '' said DPJ leader Yukio Hatoyama .
'' The only course of action for the prime minister is to dissolve the House of Representatives and ask the people for their verdict . ''
Mr Aso has already been widely expected to dissolve parliament after the Tokyo election defeat on Sunday .
He could also now come under increasing pressure to quit as LDP leader before the national poll .
Many in Mr Aso 's party fear that calling a snap election would be political suicide , says the BBC's Roland Buerk in Tokyo .
They would prefer he resigned and a new leader be chosen before the country went to the polls .
Mr Aso's LDP party has governed Japan for the past half - century , except for a break of less than a year in the 1990s .
The DPJ has promised that , if it comes to power , it will try to break bureaucracy 's grip on policy - making , and increase social welfare measures .
Its support , however , has been eroded by fundraising scandals - Mr Hatoyama recently had to apologise after it emerged that the names of dead people were included on lists of party donors .

" I can tell when he 's online and from there I can jump on to my laptop and start watching what he 's doing , " Stevenson said in a phone interview .
" We were watching him for a little while but , because he was logging on at really random times like really late at night , we set up some scripts to capture [ screenshots of ] what he was doing on the screen every 30 seconds , and that was then uploaded to our server . "
On top of that , Stevenson installed a keylogger on the laptop " so we were able to log all of his keystrokes and passwords and websites that he visited " .
Stevenson said it was a few weeks before the user first began browsing the web with the laptop on June 24 .
The screenshots , seen by this reporter , allegedly showed the thief browsing for porn videos for the first few weeks .
He allegedly sourced the racy clips by conducting Google searches for terms such as " porn " and " porn videos " .
But Stevenson knew that , if he bided his time , the user would slip up eventually .
It was n't possible to identify him immediately because the stolen laptop did not have a webcam .
Towards the end of July , the teen logged in to his Facebook account and , within an hour , he was arrested and charged with the theft , Stevenson said .
" From his Facebook account we managed to get his date of birth and school that he went to , and from there we were able to track him down , " Stevenson said .
This reporter saw the screenshots of the Facebook account but these , along with the alleged thief 's name , cannot be revealed for legal reasons .
Victoria Police confirmed the incident and said the teen was charged with theft but had yet to face court .
Stevenson said the police told him that , thanks in large part to his detective work , they were able to get the alleged thief to admit to a string of car thefts in the area .
He also dobbed in two of his accomplices , Stevenson said .
" They [ police ] were n't impressed with the amount of paper work they had to fill out so I 'd say they managed to retrieve quite a lot , " he said .
Stevenson 's high - tech vigilante detective work is one of the first cases of geek justice found in Australia but it follows a string of similar cases overseas .
In June , an Apple tool called " Find My iPhone " helped a US iPhone user track down his stolen phone without needing to place a single call to police .
In April , a US woman checking her video surveillance system from the internet while she was at work caught four people robbing her house .
She was able to watch while 18 officers surrounded the house and nabbed the looters .
Last year in New York , US police arrested two men and recovered almost $ 6000 worth of stolen computers and electronic devices after the owner of one of the stolen laptops was able to connect remotely to her Apple MacBook and photograph the thief .
Similarly , when an engineering student 's house was burgled in Philadelphia in March last year , he published the clues on a discussion website and an army of volunteer sleuths were able to track down the thieves and seize back two of the three stolen goods .
But Stevenson said such high - tech sleuthing tools were n't always foolproof .
" We had another laptop that was stolen over in America but as soon as the cops went to confront the thief they ended up throwing it in the river . "
In May 1922 , the then–highly competitive Bay Area newspaper industry was mesmerized by a case , and a device , that would influence crime lore for the next century .
San Franciscan Henry Wilkens had been accused of hiring a pair of hoodlums to stage the murder of his wife , Anna , during a family trip to the Santa Cruz Mountains .
San Francisco cops proposed hooking up Wilkens to a machine being popularized at the time by Berkeley Police Chief August Vollmer , the father of modern police work , who introduced cops to modern filing , police school , merit - based promotion , crime - mapping and , in 1921 , the polygraph .
" So long as the machine was hooked up to the living , breathing subject , it became kind of a Frankenstein 's monster , an artificial human given life by the subject to whom it was intimately attached , " Ken Alder wrote in his book The Lie Detectors : The History of an American Obsession .
" No wonder Wilkens was reluctant to undergo the ordeal .
But the police gave him the veiled threat they always give in such cases ; they told him that if his ' hands were clean , ' he had nothing to fear . "
Wilkens emerged from the session deemed to have told the truth in professing his innocence .
Soon after , Anna 's killer confessed he had been hired by Wilkens .
Evidence at trial showed Wilkens had lied about matters other than the murder during his polygraph test , but a jury deadlocked and he went free .
Nonetheless , San Francisco police were furious that Wilkens — whom they believed was guilty — tricked the polygraph machine .
And the SFPD captain of detectives declared at the next meeting of the International Association of Chiefs of Police that lie detectors " would not be countenanced . "
But the department eventually came around , and polygraph examinations have constituted a routine part of checks conducted on potential recruits for as long as the SFPD 's current background examination supervisor can remember .
And as in the case of Henry Wilkens , it seems as if people are still fooling the machine .
Seven years ago , a San Francisco police recruit named Michelle Alvis found herself at a consultant 's office , hooked up to an updated version of the device championed by Vollmer , with monitors measuring her pulse , sweat , and heartbeat .
" I was with her in the waiting room , and she was very nervous going into the test , " her ex-husband , Michael , wrote in a 2002 declaration filed in court as part of child custody proceedings .
" When she passed , she was very relieved and bragged to me , my mother , and my aunt ( and possibly other persons ) that it was easy to lie during the polygraph examination and pass the test .
She admitted to me that she was compelled to lie and did so successfully on four out of five questions . "
Attorney Lidia Stiglich , who represented Michelle Alvis in a recent , unrelated theft case , said it was Michael Alvis who was n't truthful .
" Ms. Alvis never lied on the polygraph nor boasted of doing same , " Stiglich said in an e-mail .
" The declaration to which you refer is from a hotly contested child custody matter . "
Michelle Alvis went on to become notorious in San Francisco , following allegations about her involvement in two incidents .
In 2006 , she shot a man to death after claiming to have seen him draw a weapon as he was hiding in an apartment attic .
She was later charged with stealing nearly $ 2,000 from a police evidence locker .
After a jury deadlocked seven to five in favor of her guilt , prosecutors dropped the charges this past May .
It 's impossible to conclude merely from statements in a custody proceeding that Alvis ' rocky police career can be traced to a faulty polygraph exam .
As her lawyer suggests , declarations in such a case warrant skepticism because angry ex-spouses can be motivated to make strong — and even false — accusations against each other .
But the mere question of whether Alvis managed to trick a lie detector is interesting because it throws light on the fact that the SFPD depends on the device even though scientific experts say polygraphs are all but worthless for job screening , with a significant likelihood of identifying truthful applicants as liars and giving dissemblers a passing grade .
" The vast majority of studies show that the polygraph is better than chance , but far from perfect , and far from reliable , " said Carnegie Mellon University statistics professor Stephen Feinberg , who led a National Academy of Sciences panel that concluded in a 2003 report that lie detectors were " intrinsically susceptible to producing erroneous results . "
Debunking the validity of the polygraph has been a routine exercise among scientists , journalists , and other experts since the Wilkens trial .
Polygraph exams are prohibited from being used as evidence at trial in most cases .
In 1988 , Congress passed a law prohibiting private companies from using polygraphs in employee screening .
In screening , " it has no validity whatsoever , " said Drew Richardson , a retired FBI special agent with a Ph.D. in physiology who has testified before Congress about the polygraph .
In this context , he said , the interesting question becomes not so much whether Alvis lied , but why she was sent to a polygrapher at city expense in the first place : " I do n't think people have a right to a job , but they do have a right to due process , and this is not due process .
It 's very bad . "
The SFPD background check polygraph exams are administered by the Burlingame - based company Patrick Coffey and Associates .
Coffey dismissed scientific reports questioning the accuracy of lie detectors as overblown and outdated .
Coffey said the Feinberg - led panel probably did n't include scientists with relevant expertise , particularly in the field of psychophysiology , and that polygraph science has advanced since then .
Johns Hopkins University researchers have given a thumbs up to a technique in which an individual subject 's sweat , pulse , and breathing results are compared to a computer database of known liars and truth - tellers who underwent the same test .
" All those studies they looked at are dinosaurs , " he said .
" Once you came into the computer age , when you have objective scoring , now you 're looking at a database that is purely mathematical . "
" The claim that we missed something and there 's a lot better science now is simply incorrect , " Feinberg retorted .
" Polygraphers are not scientists .
It 's not that everything they do is wrong .
It 's just that most of it is not fully based on science .
It 's just that they make lots of errors .
It 's just that they do n't know the difference between errors and accurate results . "
But Sergeant Martha Juarez of the SFPD 's background division says that the polygraph has been helpful in vetting potential cops .
" Has it ever been challenged by anybody ?
I do n't think so , " she said .
" If they 've told us the truth about everything , it will come out in the polygraph , so it 's been very useful for us .
It 's been a fact - finder , basically . "
She said only a few of the hundreds of polygraph exams the department conducts come back with suspicions that a candidate lied .
And " we still do the old - fashioned police work , " Juarez said .
" It 's all about footwork , telephone calls , computer database work .
If this person says they are not a drug dealer but the polygraph says they are , we say , ' Let 's fact - find . '
We go to their neighborhood .
We talk to their friends .
We check everything . "
Regarding Michael Alvis ' 2002 declaration about his ex-wife 's supposed lack of candor during her exam , Juarez said , " I hope they investigate that person to see if what the husband said is true .
If it 's bad on us , we want to know . "
Ironically , Coffey said that test subjects like Michelle Alvis might be mistaken in believing they have fooled the test .
Most polygraph examiners depend on the idea that everyone is a liar , but that some lies are worse than others .
They begin by asking " control questions " which are designed to create an irresistible temptation to deceive , causing the subject to sweat , pant , or palpitate in a way that provides a specific basis of comparison for more serious lies down the road .
Alvis " may think that she fooled those control questions , " Coffey said .
" Whether or not she was responding to control questions , or the examiner was n't on his best that day , it 's hard to say . "
This raises the question : Given that the city is already performing thorough , shoe - leather background checks , why not stop spending tax dollars on the discredited product known as the lie detector ?

As people become disillusioned from financial woes and a downtrodden economy and look to put new purpose in their lives , everyday folks are taking on new personas to perform community service , help the homeless and even fight crime .
" The movement is growing , " said Ben Goldman , a real - life superhero historian .
Goldman , along with Chaim " Life " Lazaros and David " Civitron " Civitarese , runs the New York - based Web site Superheroes Anonymous as part of an initiative dedicated to organizing and making alliances with superhero groups .
According to Goldman , who goes by the moniker Cameraman because of his prowess in documenting the movement , economic troubles are spawning real life superheroes .
" A lot of them have gone through a sort of existential crisis and have had to discover who they are , " Goldman said .
People are starting to put value in what they can do rather than what they have , he said .
" They realize that money is fleeting , it 's in fact imaginary . "
Estimates from the few groups that keep tabs put the worldwide total of real - life superheroes between 250 and 300 .
Goldman said the numbers were around 200 just last summer .
Where to find real - life superheroes
There is a growing diaspora of superheroes worldwide .
Here are a few resources .

Mr. Ravenblade , laid off after a stint with a huge computer technology corporation , found inspiration for his new avocation a few years ago from an early morning incident in Walla Walla , Washington .
" I literally stepped into a woman 's attempted rape / mugging , " Mr. Ravenblade said .
While details were lost in the fog of the fight , he remembers this much : " I did what I could , " he said , adding that he stopped the crime and broke no laws .
" And I realized after doing what I did , that people do n't really look after people . "
Public response to real - life superheroes has been mixed , according to Mr. Xtreme , who founded the Xtreme Justice League in San Diego , California .
" Sometimes it 's been really positive with people saying , ' Woohoo , the superheroes are here , ' and then the usual barrage , saying ' Oh , these guys are losers . '
Other times people will look kind of freaked out , and then sometimes people just do n't know what to think about us . "
Like Peter Parker kept his Spider - Man identity from his editor boss , Mr. Extreme and Mr. Ravenblade have asked CNN editors to keep their identities secret .
The current superhero movement started a few years ago on MySpace , as people interested in comics and cool caped crusaders joined forces , Goldman said .
It goes beyond the Guardian Angel citizen patrols of the early 1980s , as the real - life superheroes of today apply themselves to a broadly defined ethos of simply doing good works .

Fist help the homeless in Atlanta »
Chris Pollak , 24 , of Brooklyn , New York , can attest to the appeal .
" A lot more people are either following it or wanting to go out and do it , " Pollack , who goes by the name Dark Guardian , said .
By " do it , " he means patrol the harrowing streets late at night .
" A lot of kids say they 're real - life superheroes [ on MySpace ] , " Mr. Ravenblade said .
" But what are you doing ?
Being in front of a computer is not helping anybody . "
Comic book legend Stan Lee , the brain behind heroes such as Spider - Man and the X - Men , said in his comic books doing good -- and availing one 's self -- was indeed the calling card for superheroes .
" If somebody is committing a crime , if somebody is hurting some innocent person , that 's when the superhero has to take over . "
See a photo gallery of some real - life superheroes »
" I think it 's a good thing that people are eager enough to want to help their community .
They think to do it is to emulate the superheroes , " Lee said .
" Now if they had said they had super powers [ that would be another thing ] . "
Without super powers , real life superheroes confess to a mere - mortal workload , including helping the homeless , handing out fliers in high - crime areas and patrolling areas known for drug - dealing .
Mr. Ravenblade said he and some of his superfriends would soon be trying to organize a Walk for Babies fundraiser in Portland , Oregon .
" We work with charities that help children , " he said .
" We think a lot of crimes happen because of people who did n't get a lot of love when they were younger .
We do what we can to help that there . "
" Homeless outreach is the main thing I like to do , " said Chaim " Life " Lazaros , of Superheroes Anonymous .
" We give out food , water , vitamins , toothbrushes .
A lot of homeless people in my area know me , and they tell us about what they need .
One homeless guy said ' I need a couple pair of clean underwear . ' "
For Christmas , Lazaros said his group raised $ 700 in gifts and brought them to kids at St. Mary 's Children 's Hospital in New York .
" They were so excited to see real - life superheroes , " Lazaros said .

Many of the real - life superheroes even initiate citizen 's arrests , but what 's legal varies by state .
And in North Carolina citizen 's arrests are illegal .
Real - life superheroes who grab a suspected villain may find themselves under a specter of trouble .
" Not a good idea , " said Katy Parker , legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina .
" Seeing as how there 's no citizen 's arrest statute [ in the state ] , people who do this are running a serious risk of getting arrested for kidnapping , and being liable for false imprisonment . "
" Vigilantism is never a good thing , " said Bernard Gonzales , public information officer for the Chula Vista , California , Police Department .
He 's had some interactions with real - life superheroes .
" The very best thing a private citizen can do is be a good witness . "
Mr. Ravenblade said he 's just that .
" If you 're a real - life superhero you follow the law .
If you catch somebody you can't just tie them up and leave them for the cops , that 's for the comics .
You have to wait for the cops and give them a statement , " Mr. Ravenblade said .

While citizens helping out in the community is encouraged , Gonzales said the costumes can go .
" Where these people are out in public , and there 's children around and everything , and these people are not revealing their identities , it 's not a safe thing . "
But the costumes go with the gig , right down to the do - it - yourself approach to good deeds , including , apparently , recycling .
" The costume I have is simple , " said Mr. Xtreme .
" I made it myself .
I had a graphic designer design it for me and just took it down to the swap meet and had somebody imprint it on for me . "
" The mask , " an old bullfighter 's piece , " I got from Tijuana . "

A study by the World Economic Forum , the think tank that holds a high - profile annual meeting in Davos , Switzerland , each year , placed Russia 114th out of 121 nations in how easy it is to trade with , the Wall Street Journal writes Tuesday .
The report , first produced last year , analyzes components of trade friendliness such as customs paperwork , roads , tariffs and corruption .
The survey found that the most open economies in the world were Singapore , Hong Kong and Switzerland .
The United States ranked 16th .
Russia fell six places from 103rd since the WEF 's first global trade survey in 2008 .
And the picture is likely to get worse .
All data is from the previous year , so Tuesday 's report does n't include the 2009 import tariff increases Russia implemented in response to the sudden global downturn on goods including cars , steel and plastics .
Russia is a big exporter of fossil fuels and metals , but not much else .
In recent years , it swallowed billions of dollars worth more imported cars , cosmetics and other Western consumer goods .
Last month , Russia said it would withdraw its bid to join the 153 - nation WTO , a Geneva - based institution that oversees global trade and adjudicates disputes .
WTO members commit to trimming tariffs and getting rid of unnecessary obstacles to trade .
Joining the WTO would have forced Moscow to open its market of 141 million consumers .
Instead of signing up for the WTO , Russia said last month it would launch a customs union next year with two former Soviet republics , Belarus and Kazakhstan .
Those three countries would then apply to the WTO together , the Kremlin said .
Kazkahstan ranked 93rd in Tuesday 's WEF ranking .
Belarus was n't ranked at all .
Trade officials say a joint bid for WTO membership would be unprecedented and likely would take years .
You might know that I 'm a science fiction novelist and that I release all my books online for free ( using the excellent , free and simple Creative Commons licences ) simultaneously with their print publication by mainstream publishers ( HarperCollins in the UK , Tor in the US ) .
I 've explained at length elsewhere exactly why I do this , so I wo n't go into detail here , except to summarise by saying I do n't think we can stop others from copying – it's a lost cause .
Copying is actually wonderful , and I have copied my head off since I first snuck into the photocopy room at my dad 's office in 1980 .
My problem is n't piracy , it 's obscurity , and free ebooks generate more sales than they displace .
With that out of the way , let 's get down to cases .
First , why do we need publishers if we can just release ebooks and make the print available through one of the many excellent print - on - demand houses such as lulu.com ?
Well , a traditional publisher does a lot for you that is unrelated to printing books , from preparing the manuscript to ensuring that the book connects with an audience by wooing reviewers to talk the book up , booksellers to put it in the path of readers , librarians to put it on the shelf and , of course , by paying for a certain amount of marketing in the speciality and general press .
Releasing a book as a free download is n't newsworthy in and of itself .
It was , once upon a time , especially when that book had the backing of a major publisher .
Publishers are often characterised as being conservative about the net , so it was surprising when it happened .
These days , many writers have convinced their publishers to dip their toes in the water on this , and it 's simply not notable when it happens again .
Which is not to say that free downloads have no role when it comes to promotion , publicity and marketing .
Their main effect is to magnify any good feeling your book has generated , by making it simple for people who love the book to get it under the nose of their social circle .
I 've had readers email their friends the whole book with a choice titbit at the top , " Does n't this remind you of ...? " or " I knew you 'd go crazy for ... "
Ebooks are small : they 're text - blobs .
One reader pasted a copy of one of my novels into a mailing list with 60,000 like - minded ( I hope ) souls on it .
Booksellers – I 'm a former one myself – know that personal recommendations from friends are the best way to sell books – better than reviews , better than covers , better than store - placement .
A publisher 's publicity and marketing for a book is an excellent way to get it into some readers ' hands , and the word of mouth enabled by freely copyable ebooks then acts as a force - multiplier to expand the publisher 's efforts .
Whether your " natural " audience is small or large , free downloads generally expand it , by letting readers make informed guesses about who else will like it , and giving those readers a persuasive tool for closing the sale .
Which is not to say that there are n't writers who have other means of getting their work into some pool of readers ' hands initially , writers who might benefit from going it alone , or using a publisher for limited services , augmented by the writer 's own in - built megaphone .
But publisher or no , the important thing to remember is that a free ebook is n't publicity , it 's a tool for expanding your existing publicity and marketing .
It follows that the right time to do a free ebook release is when the printed book is available , so that the deal can be consummated quickly .
Asking internet users to remember how intriguing that download they found all those months ago was until the book hits the shelf is impractical .
The internet 's attention span is about five minutes , so unless the reader can do something affirmative to acquire the book within five minutes of being enticed by the ebook , there 's a good chance they never will .
These are the same crowds McCain drew during the campaign .
Who are these people ?
They ’re certifiable , in addition to dumb as rocks .
Listen to the first woman ask her question .
I assume we ’re to believe she was born and raised in this country .
You would n’t know it by her English , or her question .
At some point the Republicans need to come to terms with whether they truly want these people making up the mainstay of their party .

18 Things I Believe about Business — a Manifesto
I Believe …
The best businesses are honest with their customers and their employees .
The best companies have a win-win relationship with their customers and with their employees .
Management is about focusing the work of the employees by assigning tasks which best align the company ’s interests with the employees ’ interests .
Executive management is about focusing the work of the company by setting objectives which best align the customers ’ interests with the stockholders ’ interests .
These objectives define the company ’s interests .
Management and leadership are different .
Management makes sure that things are done right .
Leadership ensures that the right things are done by focusing on the right things and diverting effort from the wrong things .
Both management and leadership are performed at all levels in the organization .
The scope of your decisions is greater when you ’re higher up in the organization , but there is both management and leadership going on at all levels .
We can and should motivate employees without making them afraid .
It ’s possible for employees to balance work and family life , and still achieve company objectives .
This balance should be an employee goal , and companies should encourage and support their employees in the achievement of this goal .
Bad companies try to take inappropriate short - cuts .
An appropriate short - cut is an ethically responsible improvement to a business process that is planet - friendly , customer - friendly , employee - friendly and generally people - friendly .
On the other hand , inappropriate short - cuts use resources without replenishing them — ecological resources as well as people resources .
They pollute , they destroy , they burn out people and throw them away .
This results in short - term profitability but long - term loss — for our planet , for our people , and for the companies themselves .
Every business , ecological or financial failure can be traced back to attempts to take inappropriate short - cuts .
I have no evidence for this , but I believe that it is true .
A company that refuses to take inappropriate short - cuts is not at a competitive disadvantage .
Indeed , I believe such a company has a competitive advantage .
Customers want to deal with a company they can trust .
Employees want to work for a company that treats them fairly .
Most new companies start off on the right path and do n’t take inappropriate short - cuts .
But most new companies reflect the good values and ethics of the individuals who start those companies .
As companies get bigger , they tend to lose their connection with individual people .
The reputation of a company no longer reflects the values of its founders , and the executives and boards of directors lose their way .
Success leads to overconfidence and feelings of invulnerability .
The executives and board members begin to believe their own hype , and they think they can get away with violating ethical rules .
Groups of people ( e.g. , boards of directors , gangs , mobs ) — especially groups of people who consider themselves superior — will do things that individuals would never do .
Ethics are diluted in groups .
Greed and impatience are the motivation for most inappropriate short - cuts .
People want a result without having to pay the fair and appropriate price .
And they begin to think that they ’re entitled to take these short - cuts because of their reputation , their status or their wealth .
A company that takes inappropriate short - cuts is essentially saying , “ My company is more important than the planet , more important than sustainable life , more important than employees , more important than anything . ”
That ’s wrong .
An inappropriate short - cut is first proposed by someone in a company — particularly someone in a leadership position — who has lost their way , at least temporarily .
It ’s up to other people in the company to say “ no . ” I can forgive a temporary lapse in judgment for the person proposing the inappropriate short - cut .
But how can we tolerate the other people who agree to go along ?
In a sense , lack of integrity in business is like cancer in the human body .
Cancerous cells are constantly being created in everyone ’s body — in each and every one of us .
But healthy bodies quickly shut down the cancerous cells to prevent them from growing bigger .
The difference between a healthy body and a cancerous body is n’t in the creation of the cancer cells — it ’s in the body ’s ability to shut down the cancer cells before they grow bigger .
Lack of integrity in business works the same way .
It ’s human nature to occasionally want to take an inappropriate short - cut .
But in the good businesses those thoughts of inappropriate short - cuts are shut down before they ’re implemented .
All employees have the ability to say “ no ” to inappropriate short - cuts .
In many cases it ’s difficult to do so , but we do have the ability .
I ’ve painted this as a black - and - white issue , but it ’s really more like shades of gray .
Each executive , board member and employee in a company influences the direction and overall integrity of the company .
Higher - ups in the organization have more influence , but everyone has some influence .
I ’m not suggesting you immediately start saying “ no ” to the least little thing that seems wrong to you .
This is more of a statement of direction .
So pick your battles , and through a gradual change in approach we should be able to make things better .
Conclusion
I believe in the fundamental goodness of people .
And I believe that we can have fundamentally good businesses as well .
We just need to make it a priority .
There are a number of good businesses in existence right now , and there are also bad businesses .
Which kind do you work for ?
What are you going to do about it ?

En el lugar donde hasta 1991 estuvo la Refinería de Azcapotzalco , el año próximo se inaugurará un parque ecológico sobre terrenos donde aún hay altas concentraciones de hidrocarburos , revela un estudio realizado a petición de Pemex
Para el próximo año , el norponiente de la ciudad de México tendrá un nuevo espacio recreativo : el Parque Bicentenario .
Serán 55 hectáreas de amplias zonas jardinadas , un lago y un exclusivo restaurante que tendrá vista a los cuerpos de agua ; todo ello asentado sobre un coctel de contaminantes que permanecen como recuerdo de que hasta 1991 operó ahí la Refinería 18 de Marzo .
El diesel , la gasolina , compuestos volátiles como el benceno y otros combustibles , persisten en la superficie del terreno y hasta profundidades de 10 metros , en concentraciones por encima de los límites fijados en la Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM - 138- SEMARNAT / SS -2003 , que señala los rangos máximos permisibles de presencia de hidrocarburos en suelos .
La cantidad de contaminantes en ese terreno , así como los riesgos que representan para el medio ambiente y la salud , forman parte de un amplio estudio elaborado en 2005 por Grupo de Diseño Urbano , S.C. , por órdenes del entonces presidente Vicente Fox , para determinar las alternativas de uso del terreno y lograr la remediación del suelo contaminado .
Durante cuatro años los resultados sólo se conocían de manera aislada .
EL UNIVERSAL obtuvo una versión pública de ese estudio con base en la Ley Federal de Transparencia , tras combatir durante un año ante el Instituto Federal de Acceso a la Información ( IFAI ) la negativa de Petróleos Mexicanos ( Pemex ) a entregar las nueve carpetas que lo integran , y en las que se alerta de los potenciales riesgos a la salud para quienes estén cerca o permanezcan dentro de lo que será el Parque Bicentenario .
Ocho colonias en riesgo
La carpeta número cuatro de ese estudio incluye un análisis completo de riesgos a futuro , de los puntos que serán receptores de esos contaminantes — básicamente ocho colonias de las delegaciones Miguel Hidalgo y Azcapotzalco — , de las formas en que ocurrirá esa exposición y de la población que será receptora de la misma .
Un total de 26 mil 300 personas que habitan en una zona de 162 hectáreas circundantes al Parque Bicentenario estarán en riesgo de ingerir , inhalar o tener contacto dérmico con partículas contaminadas por benceno , tolueno , etilbenceno , metano o hidrocarburos aromáticos policíclicos ( HAPS ) que según la Agencia para Sustancias Tóxicas y Registro de Enfermedades de Estados Unidos , pueden dañar la piel , los fluidos corporales y el sistema inmunológico .
“ La población que se considera más vulnerable serán los trabajadores de la etapa de preparación y construcción del proyecto , pues tendrán contacto con mayor cantidad de materiales contaminados ; el segundo grupo vulnerable serán personas de entre cero y 18 años de edad , los deportistas que sean usuarios del parque , los jardineros y quienes realicen un esfuerzo físico mayor ; es decir , quienes generen una mayor ventilación pulmonar , y en el caso de los niños , por tener un peso corporal inferior ” , se alerta en esa carpeta .
El contrasentido
De acuerdo con el estudio , el mayor riesgo de contaminación a futuro lo generarían las excavaciones o el retiro de las losas de concreto que permanecen como vestigios de la ex refinería , pues esas obras dejarían escapar emisiones de vapores y partículas contaminadas por hidrocarburos que podrían esparcirse por las colonias Huichapan , Ignacio Manuel Altamirano , San Lorenzo Tlaltenango , San Diego Acoyoac , Plenitud , San Miguel Amantla , Ángel Zimbrón y la unidad habitacional Santa Cruz Acayuca .
“ Los resultados obtenidos confirman que es imperativo prohibir el retiro de losas de concreto y la excavación de los suelos , salvo en zonas muy reducidas y con las medidas de protección adecuadas ” , dice la carpeta nueve .
También señala que por lo menos hasta 2005 , 90 % de la superficie en ese predio se encontraba cubierta con concreto y asfalto , pues permanecían calles , banquetas y firmes de la ex refinería , además de losas de concreto armado de lo que fueron tanques de almacenamiento o instalaciones diversas , lo que contenía las emanaciones de contaminantes .
A pesar de esa advertencia , ha comenzado a registrarse el retiro de algunas losas .
Durante un recorrido en la zona , se pudo constatar que en el interior del predio hay tierra removida y excavaciones , sobre todo en la parte norte del mismo .
Los vecinos detallaron que las excavaciones superan los 18 metros de profundidad , pues esa es la información que representantes de Petróleos Mexicanos le han dado a colonos .
Las excavaciones ya han generado alarma entre los habitantes de la zona .
A principio de año advirtieron fuertes olores a combustible .
Contra el tiempo para sanear Grupo de Diseño Urbano forma parte del consorcio Museo Interactivo Infantil , que ganó la licitación para construir el Parque Bicentenario .
De hecho , esa relación entre ambas firmas sirvió para que otras empresas interesadas en obtener el contrato impugnaran el concurso durante el año pasado , aunque finalmente el gobierno federal entregó el proyecto , por mil 200 millones de pesos , al Museo Interactivo Infantil .
El estudio que realizó durante 2005 el Grupo de Diseño Urbano insiste en que es posible reducir la contaminación y mitigar los riesgos a la salud .
Para ello se desglosan varias medidas , como la instalación de sistemas de captura de vapores , colocación de barreras físicas que contengan la migración de contaminantes , y la instalación de materiales como arenas y arcillas para sellar el subsuelo .
Lo que no detalla el documento , al menos en su versión pública , es el tiempo que todas esas medidas tardarán en ser efectivas para eliminar la contaminación en la zona de la ex refinería .
Pero la ausencia de esa información no es privativa de ese estudio , pues documentos elaborados por Pemex durante 2008 , a los que también tuvo acceso EL UNIVERSAL , son omisos en señalar el tiempo que pasará antes de que desaparezca la contaminación .
Sólo un estudio elaborado en agosto de 2006 por una comisión especial del Senado de la República , creada ex profeso para analizar el grado de contaminación en la ex refinería , advierte que por lo menos pasarán dos décadas para que la limpieza del terreno sea efectiva .
Contaminación heterogénea
En febrero de 2008 , Pemex respondió a una solicitud de información de EL UNIVERSAL en la que dio a conocer que hasta ese momento se había realizado la limpieza de 22 hectáreas de terreno .
La remediación de otras 33 hectáreas se haría a partir de abril de ese año para sanear áreas en donde , a decir de la paraestatal , aún existían compuestos derivados del petróleo y aditivos para la preparación de gasolinas .
“ No obstante lo antes mencionado , tanto el tipo de contaminantes como su concentración no impiden que se lleve a cabo la remediación del sitio , hasta lograr que éste no represente riesgos para la salud de las personas y el ambiente ” , se lee en esa respuesta que , invariablemente , tampoco señala plazos para cumplir ese objetivo .
El contenido de esa respuesta coincidió con un informe que Pemex entregó a la Asamblea Legislativa del DF en mayo del año pasado , que incluyó los resultados de un análisis más , del Centro de Geociencias de la UNAM , también en 2005 , que reveló que a década y media de haber cerrado la refinería , la contaminación no había variado y se mantenía distribuida en el predio de manera heterogénea .
Ahora , el gobierno federal tiene el reto de limpiar el predio de aquí a las fiestas por el Bicentenario de la Independencia .
La paraestatal asegura que puede cumplir , pues en diciembre próximo concluirá la limpieza de las 33 hectáreas restantes , y subraya que la remediación terminará de manera formal cuando la Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales ( Semarnat ) determine que no hay riesgos para la salud en las zonas remediadas .

Northern Nigeria has been shocked by the attacks
By Joe Boyle
BBC News
Mohammed Yusuf , leader of an Islamic sect which launched deadly raids across northern Nigeria , has died in police custody , officially as he was trying to escape .
His followers attacked several police stations , threatening to overthrow the government and impose strict Islamic law - but who exactly are the group known locally as the Taliban ?
Since the group emerged in 2004 they have become known as " Taliban " , although they appear to have no links to the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Some analysts believe they took inspiration from the radical Afghans , others say the name is more a term of ridicule used by people in Maiduguri , the city where they were founded .
We believe [ rain ] is a creation of God rather than an evaporation caused by the sun
Mohammed Yusuf
Militant leader
The group is also referred to as Boko Haram , which means " Western education is a sin " - one of their core beliefs .
Isa Sanusi , from the BBC's Hausa service , says the group has no specific name for itself , just many names attributed to it by local people .
If their name is uncertain , however , their mission appears clear enough : to overthrow the Nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of Islamic law and abolish what they term " Western - style education " .
Flat - Earth views ?
In an interview with the BBC before he was killed , Mr Yusuf , 39 , said such education " spoils the belief in one God " .
" There are prominent Islamic preachers who have seen and understood that the present Western - style education is mixed with issues that run contrary to our beliefs in Islam , " he said .
" Like rain .
We believe it is a creation of God rather than an evaporation caused by the sun that condenses and becomes rain .
" Like saying the world is a sphere .
If it runs contrary to the teachings of Allah , we reject it .
We also reject the theory of Darwinism . "
Mr Yusuf himself was something of an enigma .
Analysts say he was extremely wealthy and highly educated .
" He is graduate educated and very proficient in English , " says Nigerian academic Hussain Zakaria .
" He lives lavishly - people say he drives a Mercedes Benz .
And he is very well - educated in a Western context . "
' We could see it coming '
Despite the secrecy surrounding the group , many in Nigeria say the attacks were far from surprising .
Mannir Dan Ali , a journalist with Abuja - based Trust newspapers , says there was a minor incident in early June which appeared to spark a series of statements from the group threatening reprisals .
Now it is becoming a monster , the government has realised it has made a mistake

" The whole situation seems to be a failure of intelligence , a failure of the security forces to act before matters reached the point that they have now reached , " he says .
" We could literally see it coming over the past few weeks . "
There has been widespread criticism of the security forces for their perceived laxness in monitoring the group .
Boko Haram 's members are largely drawn from disaffected youth - university students and jobless graduates among them .
Aminu Abubakar , a journalist covering the area for the AFP news agency , says it is widely believed that the authorities have been reluctant to deal with the militants because some of them come from rich families with connections to the government .
" People believe the government did n't want to crack down on these people because their parents would get angry , " he says .
" But now it is becoming a monster , the government has realised it has made a mistake and the earlier they deal with these people , the better . "
No ' swelling of ranks '
Divisions remain on how much of a threat the group poses - and how to deal with it .
Information ministry spokesman Sunday Dare says support for the militants ' cause is waning .
Some 300 people have died in a week of attacks " We live in a country where people are quite educated and I guess people are happy to make their decisions about Western education or otherwise and how it corrupts their values , " he says .
" I do n't see a swelling in their ranks at all . "
And Patrick Wilmot , a former lecturer at Jos university , said mainstream Muslims look on the so - called Taliban as " crazy " .
" They do n't need to be taken that seriously , they just need to be monitored . "
The BBC's Caroline Duffield , in Lagos , says the group 's member have isolated themselves from the rest of the community .
She says there have been incidents where local groups have prevented them from meeting in mosques and there is very little support for their stance in the wider community .
But the upsurge in violence has caused real alarm throughout Nigeria .
More than 300 people - mostly militants - were killed as a wave of unrest spread from the city of Bauchi on Sunday through Borno , Yobe and Kano states the following day .
And while Mr Yusuf 's death will obviously weaken the group , it could also spark calls for revenge attacks from those of his followers who have survived this deadly week .

IT LOOKS like a soap bubble or perhaps even a camera fault , but the image at right is a newly discovered planetary nebula .

DAY 1
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN PATRICK LEAHY : Judge Sotomayor , welcome to you and your large and lovely family , including your mother , who I believe saved up to buy your first encyclopedia when she was a hard - working widow .
Let me begin the opening statements by noting that you have more federal court judicial experience than any nominee to the United States Supreme Court in nearly a hundred years .
And the Constitution  is that a great document or what ?
And now , the ranking Republican from Alabama .
SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS : Thank you , Chairman .
Judge Sotomayor , let ’s talk about empathy .
I find it shocking that President Obama said that judges should have empathy .
I hate empathy .
My Republican colleagues hate empathy .
In fact , I am proud to say that we ’ve reached an all - time low in the “ understands the problems of ordinary people ” category .
SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD : Judge Sotomayor , if confirmed , you will join the Supreme Court with more federal judicial experience than any justice in the past 100 years .
And , therefore , I will devote my time to complaining about the way the Bush administration pummeled our civil liberties .
SENATOR ORRIN HATCH : Mr. Chairman , thank you for the opportunity to point out that we once had a Hispanic nominee for something , and the Democrats filibustered him .
When the world 's 20 million or so Twitter users click links in their feeds , most of the time , they 're routed through bit.ly 's URL shortening service , like sands through an hourglass .
By channeling people through the service on their way to the rest of the web , Twitter has created a valuable opportunity to make its famously revenue - free service pay — which is probably why rumors continue to circulate about Twitter acquiring bit.ly , which raised $ 2 million earlier this year .
Twitter did n't respond to e-mails sent to its press department , and Bit.ly general manager Andrew Cohen would n't address the Twitter buyout question .
But he did tell us about his company 's plans to make money — whether as part of Twitter , or as an independent entity .
It appears advertising will not be a part of that revenue equation .
When we raised the possibility of bit.ly serving contextual , interstitial advertisements between Twitter and the web — even for only one or two percent of outgoing links —
Cohen said , flat - out , " I 'm not going to do that . "
Instead , he 's going to mine those links to create a real - time news service that would work somewhat like Twitter trends , except that it would track the hottest links rather than the most - used words .
The result would be a Digg - like news service comprised of links determined to be important by bit.ly 's analysis engine .
" We 're seeing more than a billion clicks in the course of a month , " said Cohen .
" Looking at that volume of data , we can see the most interesting and the most important content that is being shared across the whole of the real - time web .
Sometimes that 's humorous stuff — the other day , the most shared video we saw on the web was William Shatner performing a dramatic reading of Sarah Palin 's farewell address .
" But it 's also occasionally very serious .
We were able to see the Neda video out of Iran trending well before CNN linked it in , and we 've begun to refine our capabilities there to be able to pinpoint stories like that . "
He said part of this technique involves looking for links being shared by unlike people , because that means they have universal appeal .
Another potential revenue source for bit.ly ( and for Twitter , if it acquires the company ) is that marketers could pay for deep data access and analysis .
The service already lets anyone see how a given bit.ly link is performing by adding a " + " after at the end of the URL .
For instance , the link " bit.ly /info/44u4 E + " tells me that just over 500 people clicked on a link I tweeted about my Spotify - for - the - iPhone review .
Bit.ly plans to expand those analytical tools to the point that companies will pay to use them .
" What we see are people , and marketers , coming to bit.ly and using it almost as an ad server — running campaigns on Twitter , but becoming interested in the ROI ( return on investment ) on those campaigns , " he explained .
" If I send out a tweet about dogs versus a tweet about cats , what is my average click rate normalized by the number of followers I have today ?
Did dogs perform better than cats ?
Did dogs perform 20 percent better than cats , and if so , if I share a URL about dogs again , has it performed two standard deviations beyond what I would normally expect for sharing a dog- related URL at noon on a Thursday ? "
Helping companies answer questions like that is another revenue opportunity .
A service for shortening URLs seems rather meaningless from a business perspective — after all , it 's just an algorithm for associating short , unique identifiers with longer strings of text .
The concept is so simple that a software engineer friend of mine who developed the redirx URL shortener , told me he would sell it to Twitter for $ 47 — quite a deal , when you consider that high - profile investors have judged bit.ly to be worth at least $ 2 million .
My friend made redirx before Twitter existed , and before there was so much data to analyze about who is clicking on which URLs .
Now that 140 characters has become such a widespread communication limit , though , URL shorteners , as simple as they are , hold at least two keys to Twitter 's eventual profitability .
So , what will bit.ly do if Twitter drops it , or develops its own URL - shortening service ?
Cohen says he's not too worried about that , because people also need to shorten and share URLs for e-mail , instant messaging , and so that they can verbally transmit web page locations to each other .
Nonetheless , bit.ly 's fortunes are closely tied to its status as Twitter 's default URL shortener .
What remains to be seen is whether it will become a part of Twitter too .
And for now , mum 's the word on that , as far as bit.ly and Twitter are concerned .

Welcome to Timeshare Relief 360 !
We want to share with you what ’s going on with our company and with the timeshare industry in general .
Although we have a particular point of view ( who does n’t ) , we ’re going to try to provide our readers , clients and timeshare buffs the unvarnished truth of what ’s going on in the timeshare industry .
About Timeshare Relief
Timeshare Relief was started in January 2004 , by two former timeshare owners : Cindy Martin and David MacMillan .
Cindy and David bought their timeshare in 1999 and quickly found it was “ not the slice of paradise they thought it would be . ”
Their maintenance fees continued to rise , yet their timeshare became harder and harder to use .
Their troubles were compounded when they tried to sell their timeshare through a well - known “ listing company ” but received no buyer offers , despite paying a hefty advertising fee .
After speaking with other timeshare owners , Cindy and David realized that their experiences were all too common .
That is why Timeshare Relief was started :
To provide RELIEF to dissatisfied timeshare owners .
Not only do our clients NEVER pay another timeshare assessment or maintenance fee billing , they are also provided with a financial solution that saves them money allowing them to break free of the “ timeshare trap ” .
Title transfers are handled by a professionally licensed , bonded , and insured title agency .
Four years late , the Law Lords finally put the British government ’s anti-terror policies under the spotlight on Wednesday by delivering a resounding repudiation of the government ’s use of secret evidence to impose control orders on alleged terror suspects ( the full judgment is here ) .
An unjustified stranglehold on liberty : the control orders
Introduced in March 2005 after the Law Lords ruled in December 2004 that the government ’s previous policy of imprisoning suspects without charge or trial in Belmarsh prison ( which had begun three years before ) was in contravention of the Human Rights
Act , the control order regime is effectively a form of house arrest .
As I explained in an article for the Guardian in April ,
[ Control orders ] keep suspects , for most hours of the day , confined to their houses .
They are tagged , told to report to the authorities several times a day , and are subjected to unannounced house raids by Home Office officials to ensure they are not breaching the conditions of their confinement .
Visitors have to be vetted by the Home Office .
If the detainee is a single man , he is unbearably isolated ; if married with children , he is trapped , unable to work , pushed to mental collapse as his children are unable to have friends over to visit , and are denied access to a computer for their studies .
In the Belmarsh years , several of the prisoners held without charge or trial developed what Gareth Peirce , one of their lawyers , described as “ florid psychosis , ” and as Press TV reported two weeks ago in an exclusive interview with one of these men , Mahmoud Abu Rideh , a Palestinian who has spent the last seven years either in Belmarsh , Broadmoor psychiatric hospital , or at home under a control order , the practical difference between prison and house arrest is often minimal .
On May 25 , Abu Rideh ’s wife finally gave up the struggle and returned to Jordan with their children .
As Cageprisoners explained , “ They were prevented from taking many of their belongings with them since many of the children ’s possessions had been seized by police as claimed breaches of their father ’s control order . ”
Cageprisoners also noted that “ Mr. Abu Rideh was denied the opportunity of bidding his family farewell at the airport , ” and stated that “ He now despairs at the thought of never seeing his family again , since he cannot leave the country and his family were told that they have no right to return to the UK , despite the fact that they are British nationals . ”
In his interview with Press TV , which took place just a week before the death , reportedly by suicide , of Muhammad Salih , a prisoner at Guantánamo who was held for seven years without charge or trial , Abu Rideh stated that he was unable to bear the thought of living any longer :
I am already dead .
My soul , my life , my heart — every part of me is dead .
I am just like a machine walking , with no other feeling .
I have nothing left — I cannot even sleep at night ; I have nightmares of what they have done to me , to my wife , my children , my time in prison , the searches … this is enough .
I ’ve lost my senses , I ’ve been driven insane , I can no longer take it .
What is the point of living ?
I ’ve lost everything , I ’ve lost my wife , I might as well kill myself , that is better for me .
I swear by God I have written to Gordon Brown saying that you have two weeks , if I am not helped in this period I will kill myself , whether that ’s by throwing myself in front of a train , or slitting my wrists , or throwing myself from a high building , or taking an overdose , whatever it takes .
Nobody has lived the life I have or what I ’ve had to endure .
However , while the practical effects of control orders should be genuinely troubling to anyone who believes in open justice , and the ancient right not to have your liberty removed except through the verdict of a jury of your peers , the Lords ’ ruling on Wednesday focused on the equally troubling context of how the decisions to impose control orders are made .
The Kafkaesque world of secret evidence
Primarily , this centres on an absurd situation whereby , in the Special Immigration Appeals Court ( SIAC ) , which deals with these cases , special advocates are responsible for representing the accused in closed sessions involving the use of secret evidence , but are prevented from revealing anything about those sessions to the men they represent .
This impenetrable barrier to transparency also works in the other direction , as suspects cannot brief the advocates effectively when they are kept in the dark regarding the details of the case against them .
In March , the full , horrific absurdity of this system was exposed by Dinah Rose QC in a Parliamentary meeting chaired by Diane Abbott MP , which was convened to canvas support for an Early Day Motion calling for an end to the use of secret evidence , and to discuss strategies for future campaigns .
Uniquely , to my knowledge , Rose has direct experience of SIAC in three different roles — as instructed by the Home Office , as a representative of some of the detainees held on the basis of secret evidence , and as a special advocate — and her insight was , therefore , particularly powerful .
Talking about a case on which she had served as a special advocate , she explained , “ The special advocates were told what the evidence was , but we were prohibited from discussing the material with the appellant or his lawyers .
We were simply unable to offer any resistance at all to the application , in the absence of any instructions , which might have explained or cast a different light on the evidence . ”
As a result , the judge revoked the man ’s bail , and ordered him to be sent to Belmarsh .
Remembering this ruling , Rose said , “ I can still recall my deep feeling of shame when I heard the appellant ask the judge the question : why are you sending me to prison ?
To which the judge replied : ‘ I can not tell you that . ’
I could not believe that I was witnessing such an event in a British court .
I could not believe that nobody protested or made a fuss .
They simply took him to jail , without any explanation at all . ”
She also explained that , “ although SIAC looks and sounds like a court , and the judges and barristers behave with the courtesy and formalities that are used in court , it is in reality nothing of the kind .
Often it feels to me like an elaborate charade , in which we are all playing the roles of barrister , solicitor , appellant and judge , but where the basic substance of a court hearing — the testing of evidence to establish where truth lies — is entirely missing . ”
The detainees and the Law Lords ’ ruling
In Wednesday ’s ruling , following hearings in February and March , the Law Lords were deciding the cases of three men , a joint Libyan / British national , an Iraqi and a British national , who are identified only as AF , AE and AN .
This anonymity is allegedly for their own protection — although it also conveniently dehumanizes them — but a few details about them are in the public domain .
AE , for example , who spoke to the BBC on Wednesday , is a Kurdish imam , who fled Iraq in 2002 after being imprisoned by the regime of Saddam Hussein in Abu Ghraib prison , and was given leave to remain in the UK .
Seized from his house in May 2006 , he says that he has no idea why he was placed on a control order , and has no way of responding to the vague claims that have been made publicly available , which indicate that the security services regard him as a radicalizing influence who supports the insurgency in Iraq .
Speaking about when he was first seized , he told the BBC , “ I said , ‘ Why am I being put on a control order ? ’
The answer was that they did not have to tell me . ”
AN , the British national , who was born in Derby , is apparently regarded as a link between extremists in the UK and the Middle East , and was placed on a control order after returning from a visit to Syria , and the joint Libyan / British national is AF , who was born in the UK to a Libyan father and a British mother .
A banking graduate , he had intended to become an accountant , but was placed on a control order in June 2006 , allegedly because the Home Secretary believed that he had connections to members of a group opposed to the regime of Colonel Gaddafi ( who , lest we forget , was our own implacable enemy until six years ago , when he cannily signed up to support the “ War on Terror ” ) .
Under the terms of his control order , he is now compelled to remain in his flat for 16 hours a day , cannot see anyone without permission , and is prohibited from using the Internet .
When the Lords made their ruling , they unanimously declared that they had had enough of the system as it currently stands ,
By nine votes to nil , they ruled that imposing control orders breaches Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which guarantees the right to a fair trial , because a suspect held under a control order is not given “ sufficient information about the allegations against him to enable him to give effective instructions to the special advocate assigned to him . ”
In the ruling , Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers , the senior Law Lord , wrote , “ A trial procedure can never be considered fair if a party to it is kept in ignorance of the case against him . ”
His opinion was followed by that of Lord Hope of Craigshead , who declared , “ The principle that the accused has the right to know what is being alleged against him has a long pedigree …
The fundamental principle is that everyone is entitled to the disclosure of sufficient material to enable him to answer effectively the case against him . ”
Lord Hope also wrote , “ The consequences of a successful terrorist attack are likely to be so appalling that there is an understandable wish to support the system that keeps those who are considered to be most dangerous out of circulation for as long as possible .
But the slow creep of complacency must be resisted .
If the rule of law is to mean anything , it is in cases such as these that the court must stand by principle .
It must insist that the person affected be told what is alleged against him . ”
Reinforcing these opinions , Lord Scott of Foscote wrote , “ An essential requirement of a fair hearing is that a party against whom allegations are made is given the opportunity to rebut the allegations .
That opportunity is absent if the party does not know what the allegations are .
The degree of detail necessary to be given must , in my opinion , be sufficient to enable the opportunity to be a real one .
The disclosure made to each of these appellants was insufficient to afford him a real opportunity for rebuttal .
He did not , therefore , have a fair hearing for Article 6 ( 1 ) purposes and these appeals must be allowed .
Opposition to control orders in the last two years
Since the control orders were introduced , the scope of their application has regularly been called into question not just by those whose job it is to work tirelessly against the State ’s increasingly authoritarian impulses , but also by politicians , and , in particular , by Lord Carlile , the government ’s “ independent reviewer ” of the control order regime .
Last March , a vote in the House of Commons to extend , for another year , the use of control orders — which were , at the time , in place against 15 alleged terror suspects — passed by 267 votes to 60 , but , as I explained at the time , “ Tory MPs were clearly not bowled over by a hyperbolic statement made by Security Minister Tony McNulty , who , as though infected by the ghosts of previous Labour hard men John Reid and David Blunkett , claimed , ‘ The threat ( of terrorism ) is clearly real , serious and represents a threat unparalleled in our country ’s history . ’”
Speaking on behalf of his fellow MPs , the Tories ’ shadow attorney general Dominic Grieve declared , “ On balance , and with a considerable degree of reluctance , our view is we should allow renewal to take place this year . ”
Other notes of caution were sounded by Labour MPs .
Andrew Dismore , the chairman of the joint Human Rights Committee , warned that the orders could create “ Guantánamo - style martyrs ” unless a maximum time limit was imposed , and Lord Carlile said that no control order should be extended beyond two years “ save in genuinely exceptional circumstances . ”
Similar scenes — involving Labour scaremongering , Tory “ reluctance ” and opposition from the Liberal Democrats — took place when the control orders were again renewed three months ago , but the most important dissent to note is Lord Carlile ’s mantra , repeated every year in his annual reports ( see here for the latest PDF ) , and just three weeks ago he repeated his call , backed up by peers and MPs on the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee .
Refuting claims by the Home Office that “ A definite end - date would mean individuals on control orders could simply disengage from involvement in terrorism - related activity on the basis that they knew they could re-engage at the end of that time period , ” Carlile reiterated his assertion that control orders lasting more than two years can only be justified “ in a few exceptional cases , ” telling the Committee , “ After that time , at least the immediate utility of even a dedicated terrorist will seriously have been disrupted . ”
Throughout this period , the Law Lords were critical , too , but not with the robustness with which they demolished the policy of imprisonment without charge or trial in December 2004 .
In November 2007 , for example , when they were called upon to review the cases of six Iraqis held under control orders , they ruled that an 18 - hour home curfew was in breach of the right to liberty , as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights , and , moreover , ruled that the system of secret evidence must be changed to let the suspects know the case against them , and to give them the right to a fair hearing , even though the Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , proceeded to ignore their ruling about secret evidence ( leading , 19 months later , to Wednesday ’s reiteration of terror suspects ’ rights ) , and also showed little willingness to relax the curfews .
As I explained in an article at the time , there was some great rhetoric in the ruling .
Lord Brown , memorably , said that the right to a fair hearing was “ one of altogether too great importance to be sacrificed on the altar of terrorism control , ” and Lord Hoffman declared , “ Such is the revulsion against detention without charge or trial , such is this country ’s attachment to habeas corpus , that the right to liberty ordinarily trumps even the interests of national security , ” adding that such rights were simply “ too precious to be sacrificed for any reason other than to safeguard the survival of the state . ”
However , as I also noted at the time , it was apparent that , by refusing to condemn the control orders outright , the Lords “ perpetuated a brazenly draconian system , which appears , dangerously , to be fuelled by anti-Muslim vindictiveness , even though the more prosaic truth is that it is driven by an anachronistic refusal to ‘ compromise the security services ’ by proceeding with trials using intercept evidence ( despite the fact that most other western democracies have managed to do so without imperiling their ‘ spooks ’ ) . ”
Throughout this period , however , the most disturbing opinions came not from the Lords , but from the Court of Appeal , whose ruling in October 2008 — that there might be cases where “ very little indeed ” or nothing could be disclosed to people accused of being involved in terrorism , in spite of a dissenting judge ’s alarm at a principle that might “ move us back towards unbridled executive power over personal liberty ” –- partly triggered the Law Lords ’ latest review , and may , in its bald defense of intolerable secrecy , have contributed to a necessary backlash .
What next ?
What happens next is not entirely clear .
The Lords did not quash the control orders on Wednesday , but ordered the men ’s cases to be heard again , and it is now up to the Home Office to decide whether to release more material to the men and their lawyers , or to rescind the control orders completely .
It is also unclear what effect the ruling will have on the other 14 men who are currently on control orders , or the 20 or so men in prison — or on deportation bail — whose cases are closely related , differentiated only by the government ’s extremely dubious determination to deport them to their home countries , even though , as I reported in February , this involves politicians and judges being obliged to creatively reinterpret the anti-torture laws preventing the return of foreign nationals to countries where they face the risk of torture .
New to his job , Home Secretary Alan Johnson has not yet succumbed to the rabid paranoia that infects all Home Secretaries when confronted by the “ terror threat . ”
In February , for example , Jacqui Smith actually declared war on the government ’s own secret terror court , overruling decisions by a SIAC judge that met with her disapproval , and — in what can only be described as an act of executive fiat — unilaterally revoking the bail of five men on deportation bail , kidnapping them on their way home from the London courtroom ( or in raids on their homes ) and imprisoning them in Belmarsh until the judge reasserted his authority the following day .
Presumably reading from a script that was left for him by Smith , Johnson said on Wednesday that the judgment was “ extremely disappointing , ” but did not spontaneously combust , as Jacqui Smith may well have done .
“ Protecting the public is my top priority and this judgment makes that task harder , ” he continued .
“ Nevertheless , the government will continue to take all steps we can to manage the threat presented by terrorism . ”
He added , “ All control orders will remain in force for the time being and we will continue to seek to uphold them in the courts .
In the meantime , we will consider this judgment , and our options , carefully . ”
Explaining that control orders had been introduced to “ limit the risk posed by suspected terrorists who could not be prosecuted or deported , ” as the Guardian put it , he also said , “ The government relies on sensitive intelligence material to support the imposition of a control order , which the courts have accepted would damage the public interest to disclose in open court .
We take our obligations to human rights seriously and as such we have put strong measures in place to try to ensure that our reliance on sensitive material does not prejudice the right of individuals subject to control orders to a fair trial . ”
This was standard government fare , though rather muted in its delivery , but if the new Home Secretary is seeking a “ third way , ” beyond releasing more sensitive material or rescinding the control orders , he might want to take some advice from Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , who responded to the Lords ’ ruling by saying that it “ clearly states that control orders are a fundamental infringement of human rights and an affront to British justice .
It is unacceptable to deny a person freedom without even telling them what they are suspected of . ”
Crucially , Huhne added , “ We do not need to sacrifice the freedoms we have fought so hard for .
We must not become what we are fighting .
This discredited regime should be scrapped immediately .
The government should focus instead on making it easier to prosecute terrorists by making intercept evidence available in court . ”
Using intercept evidence , and testing the reliability of the intelligence services
Huhne ’s main point — that the government should find a way to join the rest of the world in finding a way to use intercept evidence in court without compromising its intelligence sources or methods — is clearly the way forward , as without it the government is left clinging to nothing but its manifestly unjust , and largely failed attempt to deport men on the sly , or is required to maintain the “ house arrest ” charade that is both horribly petty and ruinously strenuous for those held in such a novel form of legal limbo .
As I also explained in my article in February , the government has , for years , been distressingly intransigent on the subject of intercept evidence , although , in a recent letter from the Home Office , Minister of State Vernon Coaker informed me that “ We [ the government ] have accepted the Chilcot recommendation that we should introduce intercept as evidence provided the conditions outlined in the report can be met . ”
The reference to “ the Chilcot recommendation ” refers to the findings in the Privy Council Review Of Intercept As Evidence ( PDF ) , headed by Sir John Chilcot and published in January 2008 , and although Coaker ’s concession is still rather hedged in by caveats , I hope that it signifies real change , because on Wednesday , the NGO JUSTICE , which describes itself as “ an all - party law reform and human rights organization working to improve the legal system and the quality of justice , ” published a major report on the use of secret evidence in British courts since SIAC was introduced in 1997 ( 241 pages , PDF ) , establishing the extent to which secret evidence has been used “ in a wide range of court proceedings from deportation hearings before SIAC , pre-charge detention hearings in terrorism cases , employment tribunals , asset - freezing cases , parole board hearings , and control order cases in the High Court and the Court of Appeals . ”
The report also explains that , although more than 90 special advocates have been appointed since 1997 , “ no central figures are published and even the government may not know the total number of special advocates that have been appointed , ” and also notes , in an analysis of the use of secret evidence that is at least as worrying as the “ mission creep ” outlined in the paragraph above , that “ defendants in some criminal cases are now being convicted on the basis of evidence that has never been made public .
Criminal courts have issued judgments with redactions [ passages blacked out ] to conceal some of the evidence relied upon .
Evidence from anonymous witnesses has also been used in criminal trials and is widespread in ASBO hearings . ”
In conclusion , then , if justice is once to be asserted in the UK , the government needs to move fast on incorporating intercept evidence in terror trials , so that the public — as well as the suspects themselves — will be able to test the validity of its claims .
One additional problem with secret evidence , of course , is that its use shuts off all scrutiny of the intelligence services ’ reliability , and although it is necessary for this work to take place behind the scenes , it is also unacceptable for the government to effectively hide behind a blanket assertion that the intelligence services never make mistakes , and that “ national security concerns ” should quash any notion of skepticism on the part of lawyers , prisoners and members of the public , especially because the public record is littered with abominable failures of intelligence in the years since the 9/11 attacks .
Without even having to draw comparisons with the non-existent “ ricin plot , ” the pointless and brutal Forest Gate raid , the intelligence failures surrounding the terrorist attacks on July 7 , 2005 , the murder of Jean Charles De Menezes , and countless other incidents , some of the chronic failures of intelligence in the control order regime — compounded by bureaucratic incompetence — are already well - known .
In April 2005 , for example , the Home Office was forced to apologize to ten of the men under control orders after what it described as a “ clerical error , ” which resulted in letters being sent to them stating , incorrectly , that the basis for their detention was their alleged involvement in the “ ricin plot , ” and in January 2005 an extraordinary list of intelligence blunders relating to the Belmarsh prisoners was published in the Independent .
In an article entitled , “ Belmarsh detainees : Flawed intelligence exposes scandal , ” Robert Verkaik noted , amongst other errors , that “ A security service assessment was embarrassingly withdrawn after it emerged that the purpose behind a visit to Dorset by a group of Muslim men had not been to elect a terrorist leader but to get away from their wives for the weekend , ” that “ The Home Secretary has been forced to concede that some of the funds raised by [ Mahmoud ]
Abu Rideh for alleged terrorist activity were sent to orphanages in Afghanistan run by a Canadian priest , ” that “ Two of the detainees were awarded compensation for false arrest shortly before they were detained under the anti-terrorist emergency powers , ” and that “ Testimony against two of the detainees came from an affidavit sworn by a man who was offered a lenient sentence in return for evidence . ”
Although Verkaik observed , justifiably , that these mistakes were based on the “ open ” evidence against the suspects , he was undoubtedly correct to add that “ the inaccuracy of some of these assertions raises questions about the reliability of the secret evidence that the detainees have never been allowed to see . ”
Given the government ’s poor track record , there is absolutely no reason to believe that the quality of the government ’s secret evidence is any more reliable , and , in fact , more than enough reasons to suspect that it not only involves credulousness and incompetence , but also , as with the “ ricin plot ” ( one of whose cleared defendants is currently on a control order ) , material derived from the use of torture .
As Eric Metcalfe , JUSTICE ’s director of human rights policy , said in response to the Lords ’ ruling on Wednesday , “ The House of Lords judgment marks a turning point .
The government can decide to limp on with the use of secret evidence for ever diminishing returns .
Or Parliament can act to end its use once and for all . ”
He added , “ Secret evidence is always unreliable , unnecessary , undemocratic and unfair .
Because it has never been properly tested , it breeds complacency and false confidence in its results .
Secret evidence damages public trust in our courts and in the rule of law itself . ”

Superstar Brad Pitt is on his way to Berlin for the premiere of Tarantino ’s Hitler action comedy ‘ Inglourious Basterds ’ .
But BILD managed to first catch up with him in a tucked - away Hotel bar in southern France guarded by two bodyguards in Hawaiian shirts .
Brad Pitt was dressed all in black wearing sunglasses , suede shoes , unshaven and smiling .
We both wanted a beer but the bodyguards had scared off the waiter ...
Brad Pitt : “ You brew good beer in Germany . ”
He laughs .
“ My sunglasses are good for hiding puffy eyes after drinking . ”
They are from the 80s .
BILD : How would you rate your film if you were a critic ?
Brad Pitt : “ Lots of fun !
I ’m happy with it , because all the actors are great .
Each one is a mini star ! ”

BILD : Who is the real Brad Pitt ?
Brad Pitt :
He is sitting right in front of you .
There ’s nothing else .
BILD : Are you still a big kid ?

BILD : Do you believe in God ?
Brad Pitt ( smiling ) : “ No , no , no ! ”

Brad Pitt : “ No , no , no !
I ’m probably 20 per cent atheist and 80 per cent agnostic .
I do n’t think anyone really knows .
You ’ll either find out or not when you get there , until then there ’s no point thinking about it .
BILD : Are you scared of ageing ?
Brad Pitt ( smirking ) :
The grey hairs on his beard glisten : “ No I like it .
I think it ’s good . ”
BILD : What is your typical day as a dad ?
Brad Pitt : “ I get going early , make breakfast , get the kids dressed , brush their teeth and take them to school .
Angelina is working at the moment .
We take turns . ”
BILD : Angelina told me once about your giant bed where all eight of you snuggle up ?
Brad Pitt : “ Yes we have a 3 metre wide bed , but even that is n’t big enough .
They all come crawling in in the morning .
It ’s just about surviving !
We all have sleep deprivation . "
BILD : Do you find the time to make love ?
Brad Pitt ( looks puzzled ) : What ?
BILD : Is it sometimes just the two of you ?
Brad Pitt : “ Yes we make time for ourselves .
It ’s very important for every relationship . ”
BILD : How ?
Do you fly off somewhere ?
Brad Pitt : “ That ’s a trade secret ! ”
BILD : Your answers are very short and quick .
Brad Pitt ( beaming ) : “ Ha !
I ’m a father of six .
You have to be quick and focused . ”
BILD : What car do you drive ?
Brad Pitt : I ’m not a car person .
I like motorbikes . ”

Brad Pitt : “ Yes for fun !
2 ½ hours just straight on the whole way . “
BILD : How many motorbikes do you have ?
Brad Pitt : “ Sorry , but I ’ve got a problem with that one ” .
He smiles sheepishly .
BILD : Why ?
Too many ?
Brad Pitt : “ Yeah !
To be honest I do n’t know how many I have . “
BILD : Has money changed you ?
Brad Pitt : “ It makes everything easier , but money can also be a burden . “
BILD : Do your rings have a story ?
Brad Pitt : “ No I just like them . “
BILD : And your watch ?
Brad Pitt ( checks ) : “ Yes , a Rolex . “
BILD : Your necklace ?
Brad Pitt : “ From my girl . “
BILD : What is your most important possession ?
Brad Pitt : “ My family - and yes a couple of my motorbikes . “
His laugh fills the bar .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- American International Group said Friday that it 's spending $ 1.1 billion in bonuses to retain key staff members to help the troubled insurer wind down businesses and keep other parts of the company competitive .
AIG said it has already incurred $ 824 million of expenses from a retention plan that was set up in 2008 and runs through 2011 .
Another $ 249 million will be spent during the second half of 2009 , the insurer estimated in a regulatory filing .
In 2010 , the plan will likely cost $ 18 million , while in 2011 it will cost $ 1 million , AIG added .
That brings the total cost of the plan to $ 1.092 billion , AIG estimated .
The ultimate amount paid could be less , mainly because of forfeitures , AIG AIG , +0.55 % noted in the filing .
AIG almost collapsed last year under the weight of billions of dollars in derivatives - based guarantees it sold on mortgage - related securities .
The government saved the company with multiple bail outs worth more than $ 100 billion .
A national furor erupted earlier this year when it emerged that AIG had paid roughly $ 160 million to retain employees at the derivatives unit that wrote the guarantees .
See story on AIG death threats .
Some recipients of the bonuses agreed to pay the money back , but the episode has sparked a debate about compensation across corporate America .
See MarketWatch Special Report on CEO Pay .
' Penny wise pound foolish '
AIG is in a tricky situation , because its derivatives unit still has more than $ 1 trillion of exposures that need to be unwound while keeping losses under control .
The company needs derivatives experts to stick around to manage this process , but if it pays them too much to stay it may be heavily criticized for spending too much government money on eye - popping bonuses .
" This company is not going to heal itself and be wound down without people , " Cathy Seifert , an insurance analyst at Standard & Poor 's Equity Research , said .
AIG 's derivatives business " needs to be wound down very carefully .
You want qualified people doing that . "
If AIG does n't pay experts enough to keep them , the company could lose more money on its derivatives positions than it saves on compensation , she explained
" There 's something to be said for not being penny wise and pound foolish , " Seifert added .
" I 'm sorry if that 's not a politically acceptable thing to say . "
Pay czar
The White House in June appointed Kenneth Feinberg to oversee compensation at some of the large financial institutions , including AIG and Citigroup C , +1.42 % , that received a lot of government support .
Feinberg has the power to reject pay packages for the top 100 employees of these institutions .
However , he only has authority over future compensation arrangements , so AIG 's 2008 retention plan may be outside of his jurisdiction .
" AIG , along with the other six institutions receiving exceptional assistance , will need to convince Mr. Feinberg that they have struck the right balance to discourage excessive risk taking and reward performance for their top executives , " an official from the Treasury Department said Friday .
" We are not going to provide a running commentary on that process , but it 's clear that Mr. Feinberg has broad authority to make sure that compensation at those firms strikes an appropriate balance , " the official added .
" We all have a shared interest in ensuring that those companies can return to profitability as soon as possible so that taxpayers can recoup their investment . "
Unwinding
AIG said Friday that the notional value of its derivatives portfolio was $ 1.3 trillion at the end of June .
That was down 13 % from the end of the first quarter .
The insurer said it reduced the number of positions in the portfolio by 20 % to roughly 22,500 .
AIG Financial Products , as the derivatives unit is known , lost $ 132 million during the second quarter .
That was less than the $ 6.2 billion the unit lost in the same period last year .

CODEWEAVERS TO OVERTAKE MICROSOFT BY 2018
Current Sales Trend Indicates Gadfly Open Source Developers Will Be Nation 's Largest Provider of Windows Technology ; Microsoft Imperiled
CodeWeavers Offers to Buy Microsoft Campus " On Credit "
SAINT PAUL , Minn. ( July 24 , 2009 ) – CodeWeavers , Inc. today announced that recent sales trends position them to overtake Microsoft 's operating revenue in 2018 , based on Microsoft 's fourth quarter report dated July 23 , 2009 showing a 17 percent decrease in revenue quarter over quarter .
Yesterday while eating lunch at his desk , CodeWeavers President and CEO Jeremy
White spied a story reporting that Microsoft 's quarterly revenues had decreased 17 percent - leading to the first year - over - year decline in their 34 - year history .
" I nearly spit a mouthful of a Jimmy John 's Turkey Tom sandwich onto my desk in excitement and awe , " he said , " because our own revenues had grown by more than 20 percent during our fourth quarter . "
Quickly firing up Microsoft Excel ( which was incidentally running on Linux via CodeWeavers ' revolutionary CrossOver product ) ,
White plotted out the point of intersection in which - current trends continuing - CodeWeavers would overtake Microsoft in sales .
The answer : third quarter , 2018 .
" The writing 's on the wall ; a day of reckoning is coming , " said White .
" Clearly Microsoft is in a tailspin .
And that 's why we 're advising Goldman Sachs and other tech investors that they need to pay more attention to open source products like CrossOver . "
Microsoft - based in Redmond , Wash .
- is currently the nation 's largest software developer , employs 92,000 , and has annual revenues of $ 60 billion .
CodeWeavers and the open source Wine project provide the only alternate implementation of the Windows API .
CodeWeavers provides software that lets Mac OS X and Linux users run Windows programs without having to pay for a Windows OS license .
CodeWeavers currently employs about two dozen people worldwide and their revenues are in the lower seven - figure range .
This summer , Microsoft 's pending launch of its Windows 7 operating system was arguably overshadowed by CodeWeavers ' launch of version 8.0 of its celebrated CrossOver software , providing even greater functionality for Mac and Linux users to run Windows applications without buying a Windows operating system .
White speculates that the success of CrossOver 8.0 will only accelerate CodeWeavers ' global dominance .
" Using the same exacting analytical reasoning behind our chart , it is simple to conclude that we will soon become the primary provider of the Windows API .
I look forward to shouldering that awesome burden , and determining which arbitrary new API all developers must follow , " exclaimed White .
Smell of Victory Puts CodeWeavers CEO in Credit Buying Frenzy
White 's forecast for sales increases has strategically altered his company 's operational plans .
" I 've thrown away the Folger 's can in the break room we used to collect coffee donations , " he said .
" And I lifted the policy requiring employees to use the same coffee grounds for two days running .
Morale and productivity have already skyrocketed .
But I want more ! "
At last report , White had skipped a quarterly staff meeting and was hurtling toward Seattle in his 1993 Subaru Impreza .
" Right now I 'm heading to Microsoft 's campus with a tape measure and a book of carpet swatches the size of my head .
Finally : an office of my own ! "
Barely audible over the whine of his powerful 1.5 - liter engine , White concluded by saying , " You can never plan too far in advance .
I hope Steve does n't mind me just dropping in like this . "

Subprime loans created the housing crises .
They encouraged people to buy homes they could n’t afford .
Thus they were forced to foreclose upon their properties .
Everyone agrees that subprime loans were a big problem .
Their issuers have been scorned as evil credit sharks .
So of course our heroic government needs to step in and regulate and save us from these callous practices .
Thus , in the consistent spirit of insanity , the government ’s own Ginnie Mae and FHA are becoming $ 1 trillion subprime guarantors :
Much to their dismay , Americans learned last year that they “ owned ” Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Well , meet their cousin , Ginnie Mae or the Government National Mortgage Association , which will soon join them as a trillion - dollar packager of subprime mortgages .
Taxpayers own Ginnie too .
Only last week , Ginnie announced that it issued a monthly record of $ 43 billion in mortgage - backed securities in June .
Ginnie Mae President Joseph Murin sounded almost giddy as he cheered this “ phenomenal growth . ”
Ginnie Mae ’s mortgage exposure is expected to top $ 1 trillion by the end of next year — or far more than double the dollar amount of 2007 .
( See the nearby table . )
Earlier this summer , Reuters quoted Anthony Medici of the Housing Department ’s Inspector General ’s office as saying , “ Who would have predicted that Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae would have swapped positions ” in loan volume ?
Ginnie ’s mission is to bundle , guarantee and then sell mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration , which is Uncle Sam ’s home mortgage shop .
Ginnie ’s growth is a by - product of the FHA ’s spectacular growth .
The FHA now insures $ 560 billion of mortgages — quadruple the amount in 2006 .
Among the FHA , Ginnie , Fannie and Freddie , nearly nine of every 10 new mortgages in America now carry a federal taxpayer guarantee .
Herein lies the problem .
The FHA ’s standard insurance program today is notoriously lax .
It backs low downpayment loans , to buyers who often have below - average to poor credit ratings , and with almost no oversight to protect against fraud .
Sound familiar ?
This is called subprime lending — the same financial roulette that busted Fannie , Freddie and large mortgage houses like Countrywide Financial .
On June 18 , HUD ’s Inspector General issued a scathing report on the FHA ’s lax insurance practices .
It found that the FHA ’s default rate has grown to 7 % , which is about double the level considered safe and sound for lenders , and that 13 % of these loans are delinquent by more than 30 days .
The FHA ’s reserve fund was found to have fallen in half , to 3 % from 6.4 % in 2007 — meaning it now has a 33 to 1 leverage ratio , which is into Bear Stearns territory .
The IG says the FHA may need a “ Congressional appropriation intervention to make up the shortfall . ”
The IG also fears that the recent “ surge in FHA loans is likely to overtax the oversight resources of the FHA , making careful and comprehensive lender monitoring difficult . ”
And it warned that the growth in FHA mortgage volume could make the program “ vulnerable to exploitation by fraud schemes . . . that undercut the integrity of the program . ”
The 19 - page IG report includes a horror show of recent fraud cases .
If housing values continue to slide and 10 % of FHA loans end up in default , taxpayers will be on the hook for another $ 50 to $ 60 billion of mortgage losses .
Only last week , Taylor Bean , the FHA ’s third largest mortgage originator in June with $ 17 billion in loans this year , announced it is terminating operations after the FHA barred the mortgage lender from participating in its insurance program .
The feds alleged that Taylor Bean had “ misrepresented ” its relationship with an auditor and had “ irregular transactions that raised concerns of fraud . ”
Is anyone on Capitol Hill or the White House paying attention ?
Evidently not , because on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue policy makers are busy giving the FHA even more business while easing its already loosy - goosy underwriting standards .
A few weeks ago a House committee approved legislation to keep the FHA ’s loan limit in high - income states like California at $ 729,750 .
We wonder how many first - time home buyers purchase a $ 725,000 home .
The Members must have missed the IG ’s warning that higher loan limits may mean “ much greater losses by FHA ” and will make fraudsters “ much more attracted to the product . ”
In the wake of the mortgage meltdown , most private lenders have reverted to the traditional down payment rule of 10 % or 20 % .
Housing experts agree that a high down payment is the best protection against default and foreclosure because it means the owner has something to lose by walking away .
Meanwhile , at the FHA , the down payment requirement remains a mere 3.5 % .
Other policies — such as allowing the buyer to finance closing costs and use the homebuyer tax credit to cover costs — can drive the down payment to below 2 % .
Then there is the booming refinancing program that Congress has approved to move into the FHA hundreds of thousands of borrowers who ca n’t pay their mortgage , including many with subprime and other exotic loans .
HUD just announced that starting this week the FHA will refinance troubled mortgages by reducing up to 30 % of the principal under the Home Affordable Modification Program .
This program is intended to reduce foreclosures , but someone has to pick up the multibillion - dollar cost of the 30 % loan forgiveness .
That will be taxpayers .
In some cases , these owners are so overdue in their payments , and housing prices have fallen so dramatically , that the borrowers have a negative 25 % equity in the home and they are still eligible for an FHA refi .
We also know from other government and private loan modification programs that a borrower who has defaulted on the mortgage once is at very high risk ( 25 % - 50 % ) of defaulting again .
All of which means that the FHA and Ginnie Mae could well be the next Fannie and Freddie .
While Fan and Fred carried “ implicit ” federal guarantees , the FHA and Ginnie carry the explicit full faith and credit of the U.S. government .
We ’ve long argued that Congress has a fiduciary duty to secure the safety and soundness of FHA through common sense reforms .
Eliminate the 100 % guarantee on FHA loans , so lenders have a greater financial incentive to insure the soundness of the loan ; adopt the private sector convention of a 10 % down payment , which would reduce foreclosures ; and stop putting subprime loans that should have never been made in the first place on the federal balance sheet .
The housing lobby , which gets rich off FHA insurance , has long blocked these due - diligence reforms , saying there ’s no threat to taxpayers .
That ’s what they also said about Fan and Fred — $ 400 billion ago .
Seventy years after The Grapes of Wrath , Chris McGreal recreates John Steinbeck 's famous fictional journey to reveal life in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression
Looking back on the past few weeks , Johnnie Levy can see how she was driven to the brink of death and did n't care .
The sharpest economic downturn of her 63 years stripped Levy of her beloved job as a seamstress and unravelled her world until she found herself sitting in a church hall in the black end of Tulsa waiting to see a nurse with a syringe in one hand and a Bible in the other .
Tulsa has seen its share of poverty and desperation over the years .
In the 1930s , it saw a tide of hundreds of thousands struggling west along Route 66 to escape economic collapse in the north and the notorious dustbowl of drought and wind across the Midwest .
Whether they had lost their land or their jobs , that flow of desperate humanity – chronicled so devastatingly through the fictional Joad family in John Steinbeck 's Grapes of Wrath – struggled hard to find enough to feed and clothe their children as they trekked towards an illusory dream of prosperity in distant California .
To travel the old road today – stumbling across crumbling ghost towns and half - abandoned communities , across the sprawling Native American desert reservations , through cities where people work all the hours they are n't sleeping and still cannot afford to go to the doctor - is to encounter new despair , some of it still recognisable to the Joads .
The banks are once again evicting .
Foreclosures plague the parts of northern Arizona and New Mexico traversed by the evicted 70 years ago .
But the monster – as Steinbeck described the financial system – has spawned modern beasts unknown to the Joads , such as the vast multinationals discarding American workers in favour of cheaper labour in Mexico and the health insurance companies that cut off the medical lifelines to the gravely ill .
For those who fall off the juggernaut of American capitalism , or who fail to find space on it in the first place , there are considerable challenges in a land with an inherent suspicion of people in need .
There were a dozen or more at Tulsa 's Friendship Baptist Church – a young blonde mother grappling with two small children , an old Mexican immigrant with a gammy leg and a walking stick , elderly African American women – staring at a television with an animated preacher beseeching them to follow the word of God .
Occasionally someone stood and made their way out the rear of the hall to a room where they were encouraged to pray for divine intervention .
But it was the other door , at the front of the church , that everyone had half an eye on .
Periodically a name was called to a large van in the car park painted with an orange cross that formed the " T " in the logo Good Samaritan .
Inside doctors and nurses – all required to be good Christians – offered free consultations and medicines to those who Oklahoma 's hospitals do n't want to see because they can't pay .
The van perpetually makes the rounds of Tulsa 's churches in run-down neighbourhoods , providing for the city 's working poor , struggling pensioners and , increasingly , newly unemployed Americans when their health becomes one more burden on top of the daily trial to pay the rent and put food on the table .
" It affected me very emotionally when I lost my job , " said Levy , who shares a first name with her father .
" I 'm a seamstress and I love to sew and I love to talk to people about sewing .
That 's one of the reasons I stopped taking the medications .
I got to the point where I did n't care , and that 's not right . "
Levy was cut adrift when the recession first reduced her hours and then wiped out her job in June .
With the job went the medical insurance that paid the cost of the daily dose of insulin she needs to counter diabetes and for other treatments that come with age .
Although Levy has a pension , most of it is eaten up by rent on a one - bedroom flat and food and utilities .
She shakes her head at her confused priorities but said there simply was n't enough money left to meet the high cost of medicines and so , as she is still too young to qualify for the government 's free medical care for the elderly , Levy stopped taking her insulin and other drugs .
" I did n't realise how badly it hit me and affected my health until I came here for treatment a couple of weeks ago .
My blood sugar level was more than four times what it should be , " she said .
" I really have nothing else to lean back on . "
Like so many in Oklahoma and across the south , Levy has a visceral distrust of government – not just President Barack Obama 's administration but any of them .
In the heart of the Bible Belt it is often religious organisations that step in to the breach .
Evangelising courses through Oklahoma and charity healthcare comes with God thrown in .
The Good Samaritan clinic sits in the car park of a church in a mostly black , with some Hispanics , district of Tulsa .
The city , like so many in America , remains racially divided with much of its African American population , poor or affluent , gathered in northern neighbourhoods separated from the shiny , soulless heart of Tulsa and its pristine riverside walks by an industrial area and railway tracks .
" You see a lot of children in need here , " said Veronica Banks , the minister at Friendship church .
" You see a lot of elderly in need , a lot of single mothers and a lot of the working poor .
Even though they 're working they cannot afford medical care , the cost of healthcare the way it is .
They 're on minimum wage jobs or only working part time .
We know the faces , we know the names . "
Friendship church has a mostly black congregation .
But the clinic draws white faces across boundaries that many in the city would not normally cross .
Among them is Harmony Banes , raised in poverty in what she describes as an abusive family without love by a mother who was eventually certified as clinically insane because of drug addiction .
" When I was in high school my family only had 60 bucks a month for groceries for five people .
We lived in a trailer .
I 'm much happier here .
I live in an apartment , around a lot of love , " she said .
Banes is 27 and a mother herself now .
Her husband pulls in about £ 15,000 a year as a bartender .
From that there 's the rent , two young mouths to feed and clothe , and the interest on college loans to study at Oral Roberts university in Tulsa , led by a prominent Christian evangelist and described as one of the " buckles on the Bible Belt " .
She cannot even begin to think about paying back the principal on the loans .
That leaves nothing for medical insurance for Baines or her husband , although the children get free cover from the state of Oklahoma .
So she 's at the free clinic to get blood tests .
" I pretty much hold back from going to the doctor , " she said .
" I was raised in a very poor family and never had insurance all the way through high school so for me it 's normal .
Thank God I 've never been really super sick .
If ever I needed something somehow it was provided .
God willing , whatever way it came , it came .
It was just one of those faith , trust in God kind of things .
If the needs not met there 's a reason , I guess . "
But Banes does worry and her lip quivers as she thinks about what would happen to her children if she ever did get really sick .
Banks says that as the financial crisis has deepened the free clinics are seeing more people like Banes .
" Everybody feels that economic crunch now .
Generally in the past it was very rare we had to turn people away .
But within the last eight months we 've had to send them down the pipe to the next clinic because of the overflow .
I walked in today and there was probably one of the largest lines I 've seen at this clinic , and our clinic is a small clinic . "
The patients are encouraged to pray while awaiting treatment .
The medical staff introduce God as part of what the organisation describes as holistic care .
" We find a lot of people who come to us with a medical need but would n't set foot in the door of a church , " said the mobile clinic 's nurse , Lynn Hersey .
" They want to check and see if someone who is a Christian can be trusted with one little thing , if they 're going to shove Jesus down their throat because they ate the bait and came in through the door . "
But there 's another kind of evangelising at work too , involving a web of interests more focussed on Mammon than the Almighty .
Much of Good Samaritan 's work is funded by hospitals trying to keep patients who cannot pay out of emergency rooms , where they must be treated for any immediate health crisis by law whether they can pay or not .
Those same hospitals have an interest in promoting charity as an alternative to President Obama 's plans for government to take the lead in getting healthcare to the poor and the middle classes likely to be bankrupted by catastrophic illness .
Good Samaritan makes no secret of where it stands on the issue ; the government has no business involving itself in healthcare .
" Governments treat you like a number , " said the organisation 's director , Dr John Crouch .
" I really believe that there has to be a way to cover the folks who can't get care at all , and I think one of the ways is what we 're doing .
Maybe there 's a different way of funding us , besides just funding us through our donations .
We 're emphasising that the more all the time . "
Hersey concedes that the present system can be a tragedy for the poor .
What happens to someone with a chronic disease and no insurance ?
A woman with cancer , say , who might get the surgery she needs thanks to Good Samaritan but not the medicines afterwards .
Hersey hesitates .
" They go without , " she said .
You mean they die ?
" Yes . "
But Hersey quickly added that where there is no chemotherapy there is still God .
" I can say that even with the spiritual help they may die but for those of us who are Christians and believe in God intervening directly in peoples lives , we 've seen many answers to prayer where medicine falls short .
We have seen cancer turn around , " she said .
It 's a message Banes and Levy are only to open to .
There is no anger or bitterness on their part at their situation , only a sense of helplessness and suspicion of authority .
Banes might have been expected to support Obama as the president most likely to act to help the poor .
" I voted for the other guy .
McCain , " she said .
" Something grated against me [ about Obama ] .
I really do n't know what it was .
I 'm not racist .
It 's just one of those things where he 's a good speaker , he talks very very well , even better than Bill Clinton I would say .
But I was n't about to go there .
I went the other way . "
Banes said she does n't have confidence in the government to look after her interests even if the state of Oklahoma is providing free healthcare to her children .
" If for some reason Oklahoma state 's healthcare failed then I would have something to worry about because of my children , I know .
But I 'm really not going to worry about it because that 's one more thing to put on the plate .
I do n't really trust the government , " she said .
" The Lord has a plan and if anything happens , then it 's meant to be " .
Levy , too , voted for McCain .
" There 's a lot of people with health problems who really need help and they have no place to turn , " she said .
" But the government ?
People who run government do n't care about people like us .
And there 's a lot of people need to know that there 's someone who cares about them . "
Toro Rosso say they think Alguersuari will take three races to acclimatise to F1
Toro Rosso have announced that Jaime Alguersuari will drive for the team , taking the place of the sacked Sebastien Bourdais .
The Spaniard , 19 , will become the youngest driver to take part in a Grand Prix when he races for the Italian outfit in Hungary this weekend .
The British Formula
Three champion has been picked from Toro Rosso 's young driver programme by boss Franz Tost .
Toro Rosso let French driver Bourdais go after two seasons with the team .
Bourdais scored six points in 27 grands prix for Toro Rosso , but is now threatening legal action against them for what he considers a ' breach in his contractual duties ' .
I do not expect anything from him for at least his first three races
Toro Rosso boss Franz Tost Reports say that five - time world rally champion Sebastian Loeb could drive for Toro Rosso in the last Formula 1 race of the season in Abu Dhabi .
Barcelona - born Alguersuari will join team - mate Sebastien Buemi , who until the Spaniard 's arrival was the the only rookie driver racing in F1 this season .
" I am aware that I 'm facing a very tough challenge , because coming into Formula 1 is never easy , " said Alguersuari .
" Coming into Formula 1 in the middle of the season is even harder and doing so without any testing is really difficult .
" But already I feel I am getting great support from the team , who have quite a reputation for looking after rookie drivers . "
Tost said Alguersuari was chosen to replace Bourdais because he was considered the " most mature " prospect in the young driver programme .
He added : " I do not expect anything from him for at least his first three races , during which he has to get used to the car , the team and to the F1 environment . "
606 : DEBATE Alguersuari takes over from New Zealander Mike Thackwell as the youngest driver to start a GP weekend .
Thackwell took part in the Canadian GP in 1980 at the age of 19 years and 183 days , but was not classified as a race - starter because he did not take line up when it was restarted after a first - lap crash .
Alguersuari will be 19 years and 125 days if he starts Sunday 's Hungarian GP .

The plant , built by BrightSource Energy , will use the steam power not to generate electricity for the oil pumps , but rather to heat the underground oil so that it flows more efficiently .
Under normal circumstances , oil fields just use oil or other fossil fuels to provide raw fuel necessary for steam production .
So this is rather interesting ( not to mention refreshing ) , to see oil companies not just recognizing the usefulness of green power , but embracing it as well .
The ship left the Cypriot port of Larnaca on Monday Israel has deported eight pro-Palestinian activists detained at sea last week as they tried to ferry aid to Gaza in defiance of Israel 's blockade .
Nobel peace laureate Mairead Maguire and former US congresswoman Cynthia McKinney were among them .
They complain the Israeli navy seized them illegally in Palestinian waters .
Israel 's navy maintains a blockade of Gaza 's sea border .
It said the Greek registered ship ignored orders to stop and was intercepted .
The crew and passengers were taken into custody last Tuesday and the ship , which had set sail from Cyprus , was impounded in the Israeli port of Ashdod .
Israel 's Interior Ministry announced on Monday that the activists would be sent home after refusing to comply willingly with their deportation orders .
Officials said the three tonnes of aid would be delivered to Gaza by road once it had been checked over .
On Friday , five Bahrainis were deported after interior and foreign ministry officials touched down on Israeli soil for the first time to escort them home .
Israel has allowed several protest boats to dock in Gaza in the past year , but has blocked others .
' Kidnapped '
Speaking to the media from jail near Tel Aviv , Ms Maguire said the activists were considering contesting the Israeli deportation orders because the recipients had been brought to Israel by the authorities against their will .
" We were kidnapped and we were brought here at point of a gun from Gazan waters here to Israel ; we have been abducted , " Ms McGuire told the al - Jazeera network .
Ms Maguire co-founded Women for Peace , which later became the Community for Peace People , along with fellow Belfast woman Betty Williams .
The two women were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976 for their efforts in trying to encourage a peaceful resolution to the Troubles in Northern Ireland .
The International Committee of the Red Cross recently described the 1.5 million Palestinians living in Gaza as people " trapped in despair " , unable to rebuild their lives after Israel 's offensive .
Donors have pledged $ 4.5 bn for reconstruction and rehabilitation in Gaza following the 22 - day offensive which left more than 50,000 homes , 800 industrial properties and 200 schools damaged or destroyed , as well as 39 mosques and two churches .
Israel says its blockade of Gaza is necessary to prevent weapons smuggling and to put pressure on the Hamas movement to release an Israeli soldier captured in a cross - border raid in 2006 .

A burst water main has caused a section of road , top , in Bellevue Hill to collapse , causing a landslide , middle .
Bottom , the crater which has been left .
Credit : James Brickwood and Seb Lane , smh.com.au reader .
Front page thumbnail image : Renee Miller , smh.com.au reader A Woollahra Council spokeswoman said council rangers told Sydney Water about a possible leaking main on Tuesday morning and Thursday afternoon this week .
" There was no water at ( nearby ) Cooper Park so they basically thought there was a problem with the main , so they thought they 'd phone and report it to them , " the spokeswoman said .
" On Thursday they did a follow up and phoned ( Sydney Water ) again in the afternoon because the problem was still there . "
Sydney Water spokesman Brendan Elliott said a crew inspected the leak on Thursday but identified it as storm water .
" There was no sign of the small main having sprung a leak , instead they thought the water there was storm water , " Mr Elliott said .
Residents have also told smh.com.au that water was leaking out of the ground " for days " in the same spot the landslide occurred .
Matthew Brown , who lives in nearby Kendall Street , said he was walking his dog past the leak early yesterday .
" At that time it was a pretty big leak , it was dinner plate - size , a big gurgle of water coming out of the ground and the site had been cordoned off , " Mr Brown said .
I whipped out my phone to take some pictures and the policeman said ' I hope you 've got life insurance ' and recommended I put it away , go home and turn off the electricity
" That was 6.30 am in the morning so I can only assume it was going on all night and the day before . "
Woollahra Council denies taping off the leaking section , which was last night swallowed up by a 25 metre crater .
Mr Elliott also said Sydney Water workers did not put up any form of safety tape .
" That 's not our practice , " he said .
He said it was very unlikely a main of that size - 300 mm in diameter and cast iron construction - would leak in this way .
" They typically break really fast so the idea it leaked slowly is unlikely , " Mr Elliott said .
" We can't rule out the possibility it 's one and the same thing but it would appear to be unlikely . "
A smaller water pipe may have been responsible for the longer term leak , he said .
The Liberal Mayor of Woollahra , Andrew Petrie , said council workers were jackhammering about 20 metres from the site yesterday as part of ongoing streetscaping but denied the council was responsible for the damage .
Another resident , Erin Scott , said she called Sydney Water about 6 pm last night after noticing " water spurting from the top of the hill and mud all over the bottom of the park " .
Ms Scott said she was told to call Woollahra Council so reported it to them a short time later .
" They took my details and description of the problem and said they 'd send someone out to look , " she said .
" Seventy - five minutes later the water was much louder and stronger and no - one had come so I called again .
" Ten minutes later someone turned up but by that stage it was too far gone , the land had started eroding quickly and within five minutes a massive tree just next to the footpath was gone .
" We watched from our window whilst one lone council worker just stood and kept people out of the way for about the next hour . ''
The council spokeswoman confirmed the call centre received Erin 's phone calls at 6.26 pm and 7.42 pm .
" The council ranger was on site by 7.45 pm , '' she said .
Fifteen minutes later , a 25 metre section of Victoria Road gave way .
Two cars , a tree and a power pole were swept down the hill into Cooper Park .
The ruptured gas main sparked a police lockdown ; residents at home at the time were stranded without power and not allowed to leave , while people trying to make their way home were told to spend the night elsewhere .
The flow of gas was stopped at 4 am today , according to NSW Fire Brigades , allowing repair work on the water main to begin .
Sydney Water workers are on site today .
Victoria Road is closed indefinitely between Bellevue and Birriga roads , while Bellevue Road is closed between Buller Street and Victoria Road .
Bellevue Hill Public School is also closed today .
Another Sydney Water spokeswoman , Karen Smith , earlier said the road closures could remain in place for several days .
" There is probably going to be disruption for local traffic around the site for at least a few days while the embankment is repaired , " Ms Smith said .
" In terms of the pipe , we have n't been able to fix it because the ground is quite unstable - we 're at the site now assessing the damage and assessing what has to be done .
" We 're working with the police and all the other utilities out there to see what can be done . "
Resident Seb Lane said the gas leak was so loud last night he thought a helicopter was flying overhead .
" It was such a loud noise when I went up the top ( of the hill ) , " Mr Lane said .
" I said to my dad ' I think there 's a helicopter ' ... and a policeman said ' there 's been a big gas and water leak and that 's what the noise is ' .
" I whipped out my phone to take some pictures and the policeman said ' I hope you 've got life insurance ' and recommended I put it away , go home and turn off the electricity . "
Another resident , Renee Miller , said she could smell gas as she was driving up along Berger Place from Bondi .
" The police said ' you ca n't get in , you 're going to have to find somewhere else to stay tonight ' , " Ms Miller said .
" They said ( the landslide ) had taken half of Victoria Road down into the park . "
" There have been no reports of any injuries as a result of the incident and no evacuations were necessary , " police said .
Ms Smith said water to the Bellevue Hill area had been restored at 10.30 pm on Thursday night , once the broken water main had been switched off .
" Our system is very versatile and we can move water around from different areas , and we were able to get water into the Bellevue Hill area at about 10.30 pm , " she said .
" As to how many properties had no water or low pressure it is a bit harder to determine ... ( but ) they would have only been without water for an hour or two , and they 've still got water . "
A couple of years ago we were in the middle of selling our house right at top of the real estate bubble .
Homes were routinely going for asking price , and some houses were even getting multiple offers above asking price .
At the time the thinking was that the market would continue going up , and it was better to buy now than in a couple of years when prices had skyrocketed .
Looking back , that thinking seems a bit foolish now , but at the time it seemed reasonable .
We ended up selling our townhouse for the asking price , and we made a nice profit .
The problem is , we also ended up buying a house for more than it was worth .
Hindsight is 20 / 20 , right ?
Now that the market has been dropping for a while things are extremely tough for homesellers .
Because of the rash of low or no down payment mortgages that happened a few years ago , a lot of homeowners are finding themselves underwater in their mortgages , they owe more than the house is now worth .
The real estate Web site Zillow.com reported that 21.8 % of all U.S. homes , representing more than 20 million residences , were in a “ negative equity ” or “ underwater ” position after prices dropped more than 14 % nationally in the year ended March 31 .
With so many homeowners being underwater , a huge number of them are just deciding to walk away from their homes , and the mortgages .
The result ?
A ton of foreclosures .
According to Lawrence Yun , chief economist with the National Association of Realtors , there were 2 million properties in foreclosure in 2008 .
That number could climb to almost 2.5 million this year .
With such a huge number of foreclosure properties available , and due to the tough economic times , getting your house to sell is harder than ever .
Here are a few tips to help you sell a bit faster .
Tips To Sell Your Home In A Down Market
To make sure your home sells in a down market , there are a few things that you can do .
You have to be willing to price it right :
If you ’re going to sell your home in a down market , you may have to be willing to make some concessions on price .
In many areas foreclosures have depressed the prices quite a bit .
While you may not be able to cut your price to the level of some of those bank owned homes , you can still do your research as to what comparable homes are selling for , and undercut their prices .
You may not get as much action as the foreclosures , but you will at least get more action than other sellers who are n’t as flexible on price .
Try not to get emotionally stuck on a certain price .
Research prices on sites like Zillow.com where you can see what other homes are selling for , or have an agent give you a comparative analysis .
Make sure the home has curb appeal :
Even if you ca n’t compete on price with foreclosures , you can do your best to make sure that the your house at least looks better on the outside than the foreclosure down the block .
Get the home power washed , paint the trim and the doors , put on new exterior lights and / or knockers , and give your plants some sprucing up .
All the hard work should pay off by at least getting that buyer through the door .
( When we sold , this was key for us because there were similar units at the same or lower price .
Our unit was just in better shape , had been repainted , etc. )
Clear the home of clutter :
When you ’re living in the home , it may be ok to have stacks of papers on the coffee table , and tons of personal photos on the walls .
But when you ’re selling a home you want the potential buyers to picture themselves living in the house .
Remove personal photos from the walls , and replace them with neutral framed art .
Take everything off the countertops in the kitchen to make it seem like there is more counter space .
Remove any unnecessary furniture and put it into storage .
If you can remove clothing from the closets and put it into self storage you make the closets feel bigger .
Reduce all the extra clutter throughout the house to make it feel bigger , more spacious and buyer friendly !
Fix big problems :
If your house has a big problem that will turn a lot of buyers off , fix it !
Shag carpeting in the living room ?
Consider changing it out with fresh new carpeting .
Non-working water softener ?
Pay to have it fixed , or get a new one .
( We actually did this ) .
Big hole in the wall ?
Get some drywall and patch it up .
Ugly peeling linoleum in the kitchen ?
Put in new flooring .
Anything that can cause instant dislike for your house should be fixed , as long as it is n’t too expensive .
Fix smaller problem areas around the house :
Go throughout the house and take notes of all the small things that need fixing that may be a turnoff to a potential buyer .
Take the time to go around and fix those things one by one .
If you noticed them , the buyer will too !
When we sold our house we ended up repainting some trim on the outside of the house , repainting several rooms that had scratches and marks on the wall , and removed some rubber marks on the kitchen linoleum .
It only took us one or two days of hard work , but in the end the house looked much better , and was more inviting to a buyer .
Consider staging the house :
When we sold we actually staged the house to make the rooms feel more spacious , give it a less cluttered look and a make people feel more at home .
In the living room we removed several larger pieces of furniture , and replaced them with smaller more luxurious pieces from our parent ’s houses – in a different layout .
We took our personal photos down and put up framed art pieces .
We removed all the magnets and photos from the fridge , and put up nice valances on the windows .
Watch a lot of HGTV and try to emulate what the experts do to stage a house !
Offer bonuses to agents or buyers : consider offering a bonus to the first agent to bring in a full price offer , or offer to pay closing costs for a buyer ( this might be especially attractive for first time buyers ) .
I ’ve even heard of buyers offering to pay a years worth of homeowner ’s association fees .
Be creative .
Use the power of the web and your personal networks to market your house :
Do n’t rely on the listing that your agent has put online to sell your house .
Use other online venues to help sell your house .
Put an ad on craigslist , use sites like zillow.com or trulia.com , get your own url with the house ’s address ( 4000wooodland.com ) , promote the house through social media like facebook and twitter , and send out a copy of your listing to people on your email list .
Sometimes word of mouth is one of the best ways to market a house .
Get a good agent to help you sell :
Get a good agent to help sell your house , not a friend of a friend – or your aunt Agnes who just got her real estate license .
Your house is one of your biggest assets , and this is no time to do someone else a favor .
Call a local real estate office and ask for their top salesperson .
Interview a few agents and ask them to tell you what their marketing plan is for your home .
Use someone who understands the power of the internet , the importance of good wide angle interior photos , and an overall marketing strategy for your house .
When the house is showing , keep the house clean and do n’t be there ! :
When you are having an open house , or the house is having a showing , make sure that you are n’t there .
There ’s nothing more annoying than having the home ’s owners in a house when you ’re trying to look at it .
Also , make sure to keep the house spic and span to make sure that it shows well .
Finally consider baking cookies before a showing , or lighting one of those cinnamon roll candles .
It will give the house a pleasant aroma , and people will feel at home .
Selling your house in a down market is n’t an easy task , but you can still do some hard work along the way and make your chances that much better .
In the end your house will show better , and you ’ll be able to sell your house that much quicker .
Do you have your own tips for things that can make a home sell faster ?
Were there things that you did when selling your house that made it more attractive to buyers ?
Let us know about it in the comments !
AN Orthodox Jewish couple are suing their neighbours in a block of Bournemouth flats over motion sensors which automatically turn on the lights in the communal hallway .
The pair of religious dolts – Dena and Gordon Coleman – insist that the system , installed to cut down lighting costs at Embassy Court , makes them prisoners in their own flat between Friday evenings and Saturday nights .
Faced with a situation where we could never again have full use of our flat , we were left with no alternative but to seek legal advice .
We consulted solicitors and a caseworker at the Equality and Human Rights Commission and were advised that we had a strong claim .
According to the Times , like many Orthodox Jews , the Colemans will not use electricity between sundown on Friday and Saturday night , which they regard as a day of rest .
But since the sensors were installed , the lights come on as soon as they set foot outside their front door – which they say makes them “ responsible ” for switching them on and therefore prohibits them from leaving the building .
The couple say that their human rights have been breached , and are claiming up to Â £ 5,000 damages .
If their claim is successful , the owners of the 35 flats in the seafront building will be liable to pay the couple ’s costs as well as any damages .
Dr Coleman , 56 , a head teacher at a Jewish Orthodox school in Borehamwood , and her husband have owned the apartment at Embassy Court for six years and spend most weekends there .
The lights were installed six months ago by the building ’s management company to save energy and reduce the electricity bills .
The couple ’s offer to install a manual override for use on the sabbath was turned down by the Embassy Court Management Company on the grounds that it would set an “ unacceptable precedent ” .
In a letter to the owners of the other flats , the Colemans wrote :
One resident , who did not want to be named , said that the couple ’s action has caused “ quite a stir ” , adding :
There has been a meeting about it and many of the residents are n’t happy .
There ’s a feeling that things should n’t be changed just to suit people in one flat when everyone else is happy .
The county court writ against the three directors of Embassy Court Management Company , who all live in the building , accuses them of breaching the couple ’s rights under the Equality Act 2006 and Human Rights Act 1998 .
In a statement the company said :
The directors believe that almost all lessees at Embassy Court support the actions taken by the management company to reduce communal lighting costs .
Although other lessees are innocent parties in this legal dispute , in accordance with the lease expenses reasonably incurred in these legal proceedings will be recoverable from all lessees in the service charge .
The case is due to be heard at Bournemouth County County later this year .
Leslie Bunder , the editor the Jewish community website somethingjewish.com , claimed that the Colemans were over - reacting .
He said :
As long as they are not physically doing the act of turning the light on , it ’s actually not against the rules .
They should not be putting the onus on their neighbours to change .
It ’s a bit arrogant really .
It ’s an embarrassment , it ’s giving reasonable Jews a bad name .
But Chanie Alperowitz , the director of Bournemouth Chabad , an Orthodox Jewish group , disagreed :
On the sabbath there are 39 forms of creative activity which are forbidden .
Among them is the prohibition of lighting a fire .
When using electricity , one causes a fire as there are sparks created by the electricity .
If the light is switched on by someone stepping outside their door , their actions have caused it to happen .
I think the neighbours and management company should revisit their decision and accommodate their beliefs .
It is not going to inconvenience anybody , especially if [ the Colemans ] have offered to pay for the override switch themselves .
A small consideration offered in an atmosphere of give and take would help to make the world a better place .
Among the 39 prohibition , I was tickled to learn , was EXTINGUISHING a fire on the sabbath – unless it was life - threatening !
View Birmingham ’s parking ticket hotspots in a larger map
Today the Birmingham Post publishes the first story to come out of the crowdsourcing platform I ’ve been creating – Help Me Investigate .
It ’s about parking ticket hotspots in Birmingham * .
UPDATE : The Birmingham Mail have also published a report , from which the map above comes .
The site has only been public for a couple of weeks , and we have refrained from any launch or publicity , preferring to let it grow organically in these early stages .
But the early results have been extremely encouraging .
Although the parking ticket story is the first to appear in traditional media , it is not the first investigation to be completed on the site .
One investigation was completed during the testing stage ; another shortly after .
Both had resolutions that might not have made traditional media , but were important to the users and , for me , resulted in the sort of engagement you want from media ( more on that below ) .
The most exciting investigation , however , was into the long - awaited website for Birmingham City Council .
That dug up what appeared to be an overspend on the website which we ’re still investigating .
It ’s not clear whether it was a coincidence that a story on the issue appeared in the local paper the same day , but it certainly seems that the Council ’s web team launched their Twitter feed that day as a result , and further stories were generated later .
Particularly interesting was the fact that someone who had worked on the project set up another Twitter feed to give further information to the person who began it .
You can read more about how the investigation developed on Josh Hart ’s blog post ( down at the time of writing ) .
And the story has n’t yet finished – the site ’s Support Journalist Heather Brooke wrote the most impressive Freedom of Information request I ’ve ever seen , asking for information on the process of building the website .
Just read it .
We now await the results .
Engaging and social
What has also been extremely encouraging is the way the site seems to be engaging users in a different way to traditional publishing – one of the objectives of Help Me Investigate .
My own experience of the site has been this : the social dynamics involve you in issues that you might otherwise never explore .
I now know things about bus deregulation , for example , that I would never have read about .
It was my desire to help a friend that made me read them .
Likewise , when people help you with an investigation there ’s an instinct to want to help back .
This generates a feedback loop where you are each helping add little bits to the investigation as a way to thank the other people who helped you .
You do more than you would alone – another of the site ’s objectives .
These are still early days with small numbers of people and the site is developing continuously ( we ’re using an agile development approach which means it ’s changing in response to how people use it rather than our assumptions ) .
It will get better as it gets used more , and we learn more , but I ’m surprised how well it ’s working even at this early stage – in some ways I think the simple framing of the site to ‘ Help Me Investigate ’ results in work you would n’t get elsewhere .
This week marks the point at which we are that bit much more public , and that bit much more ‘ proven ’ , so I expect things to ramp up a bit .
In particular , I have now started an investigation into councils and parking tickets nationally : which are the worst and best offenders ?
This should test how we expand the experience gained in a local investigation into a national one .
If you want an invite you can request one from the Help Me Investigate home page .
I ’ve also been writing about what we ’ve been learning along the way on a Help Me Investigate blog .
Comments , questions and suggestions very much welcome .
* You can read the back - story to the parking tickets investigation by the wonderful Neil Houston , who helped compile and analyse the data that was obtained by Heather Brooke ; and by Nick Booth , who is a co-founder of Help Me Investigate along with developer Stef Lewandowski .

While the Pirate Bay sale has dominated headlines recently , it was n't that long ago where the focus was on the Pirate Bay trial .
The founders of the controversial peer - to - peer sharing website were convicted of copyright infringement , which factored into their decision to sell the website they created .
The Pirate Bay fiasco made an impact on European politics as well .
The Sweden Pirate Party , whose main issue is copyright reform , secured at least one seat in the European Parliament with 7.13 % of the vote back in June .
Now the success of that movement has jumped across the pond and inspired a new movement and a new political party : The Pirate Party of Canada .
Yes , a movement has been in the works since late last month to make the Pirate Party and official , registered political entity , and they are more than halfway towards their goal .
And like its Swedish counterpart , it has a very simple platform , which I have included below :
Started in 2009 , the Pirate Party of Canada strives to reform Canadian copyright laws , reform the patent system , and protect every Canadian ’s right to privacy .
It is our current goal to complete the registration process to become an official federal party .
We are in favour of : - Copyright Reform - Reform of the patents system - Better respect of privacy - Net Neutrality - Open Government
In order for the Pirate Party to become official in Canada , it needs 250 people to sign a declaration of membership to the party .
Yes , that 's all the Pirate Party needs to have the ability to accept donations and run on the ballot .
We think it 's inevitable that the Pirate Party gets its 250 signatures .
Whether it will have the same type of success as its European counterpart remains to be seen .
It needs a lot more work to be taken seriously , starting with a more detailed party platform .
People are passionate about copyright reform though .
I would watch this movement if I were you .

The struggle of the Indigenous and Amazonian peoples
No struggle without solidarity !
The struggle of the Indigenous and Amazonian peoples
The rubber boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries came at the expense of the blood of 50,000 indigenous Amazonians .
Today , the worthy descendents of the heroism of Juan Santos Atahualpa - the Amazonian people - are rising up against Imperialism and Capitalism and their plan to usurp not only these people 's lands , but also their lives and their destinies .

Today , the worthy descendents of the heroism of Juan Santos Atahualpa - the Amazonian people - are rising up against Imperialism and Capitalism and their plan to usurp not only these people 's lands , but also their lives and their destinies .
The State is systematically contravening international treaties such as the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples ' Convention ( Convention No.169 of the International Labour Organisation ) , which provides for obligatory consultation in advance with indigenous peoples on any planned intervention on their lands , through the appropriate community bodies .
Last year , Amazonian people led a nine - month rebellion , seeking to force the Aprista ( Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana ) regime to repeal Executive Orders 1015 and 1073 ( see http://www.anarkismo.net/article/9576).
In the Peruvian rural regions of Loreto , San Martín , Amazonas , Ucayali , Cuzco and Madre de Dios the war drums are sounding again , calling the people to rebel in an indefinite popular general strike that has been spreading through the countryside and the Amazon regions since 9 April and that has , since 14 may , gone on to become a call to insurgency for the people in struggle .
Faced with this , the government has called a State of Emergency which has already claimed one victim , our Awajun brother Manuel Dekntai , and several arrests .
Legalising the dispossession of the native peoples Law No.20653 , the General Law on Native Communities , which was passed by General Juan Velasco Alvarado 's military regime in June 1974 , recognised the " legal existence and juridical identity of the indigenous Amazonian people and their territories , declaring them to be inalienable , indefeasible and inviolable " .
This was confirmed in the 1979 Constitution .
However , it was removed at the strike of a pen by the Fujimori Constitution of 1993 , to open the way for dispossession and plundering by successive governments , opening the door to the Trade Promotion Agreement ( NAFTA ) and becoming law following the Executive Orders of the second Aprista government .

So , once again , the Peruvian State has shown itself to be an instrument of domination in the hands of the exploiting classes , who are seeking to continue to expropriate not only the political rights but also the resources of our indigenous ( native ) peoples who are now rising up in revolt against the oppressor .
As libertarian communists , we declare that the native communities ' right to self - determination is the exercising of popular power , based on communitarian principles , the utilization and collective use of natural resources , and on those forms of work and collective benefit that they have traditionally preserved .
In defence of the land and " Pachamama " or " Nugkui " For the native peoples , whether from the jungles or the Andean region , " the land is our embryo , the origin of the existence of our peoples with out own cultures and identity .
If we have no land , we are an indigenous people without life and thus sentenced to extermination " .
For the native peoples , whether from the jungles or the Andean region , " the land is our embryo , the origin of the existence of our peoples with out own cultures and identity .
If we have no land , we are an indigenous people without life and thus sentenced to extermination " .
In the cities , ownership of the land can only be through " title deeds " , but for the indigenous people , ownership of the land lies with " mother earth " .
For the Andeans , it is " Pachamama " ; for the Shuar and the Awajun , it is " Nugkui " , and so on according to the historical and cultural worldview in each region .
In other words , while each people gives it its own name , the concept of " property " as it is understood in Western society does not exist .
Indeed , they consider themselves in some way to be the " children of the earth " , which gives them sustenance .
Hence , their relationship with the land acquires an almost " sacred " nature .
Simply put , the land does not belong to men , it is man who belongs to the land .
In the indigenous Amazonian worldview , for example , " land " covers a " broad concept of integration as a collective benefit in interdependence with nature " .
" The mountains and waterfalls where our ancestors meditated are inherited as sacred places and they are respected as founts of visions and spiritual strength " , as some say .
In other words , their relationship with the land that hosts them also conditions their ideological conceptions and their culture .
The State seeks to destroy collectivist nuclei
It is important to denounce the efforts of the official press which is dedicated to misinforming , misrepresenting or hiding the just means that are being attacked in the Peruvian jungle , in collusion with the current neo-liberal government and its leaders - Alan García ; the vice - president and retired admiral responsible for the prison massacres during the first Aprista government of the 1980s , Luis Giampietri ; the prime minister , Yehude Simon , previously a left - wing leader who had even been imprisoned for his beliefs and who is now the faithful guardian of the Aprista reaction .

For these politicians who control the State under imperialist orders , the path lies through the dispossession of the communities .
It is at the same time a plan to destroy their type of social organisation and the relationship that links them to their land , a relationship that in essence clashes with the Western understanding of property and is therefore a brake on the voracity of trans- national Capital which is trying to take root in these zones , usurping them in alliance with the State .
Already the 1993 Constitution of the State repealed the " inalienable , indefeasible and inviolable " nature of the indigenous lands .
This paved the way for the State to declare the lands of the native peoples " negotiable , in accordance with the market economy " by means of executive orders , thus bypassing the legislature .
We must not forget the fact that it was Fujimori's 1993 Constitution that left the door open for dispossession , as mentioned above .
So it is clear that work has already begun to suffocate and isolate the communities , for the greed of the multinationals in gaining concessions for oil , gas , mining , tourism and logging in areas traditionally belonging to these peoples .
The Unión Socialista Libertaria believes that the struggle of the indigenous people , Amazonian and Andean , for the defence of their land , their way of organising themselves and their culture , is part of a minimum programme that involves the conquest of the demands of the peoples oppressed by the State , Capitalism and Imperialism .
This minimum platform should be based on the need for or the use of direct action in order to expel the trans - nationals from their lands .
This is necessary in order to protect the integrity and sustainability of the region 's habitat and ecosystem - which , it should be remembered , is one of the " lungs " of the planet - and in order that there can be sustainable development and planned usage of the flora and fauna , on the basis of criteria established by the communities .
Furthermore , there needs to be active self - defence of their lands , which must be restored to their original condition .
True , active solidarity with the indigenous and Amazonian peoples ' struggle will take the form of popular protest ( agitation , propaganda , union - led strikes and popular strikes , direct action , etc. ) , to be incorporated into a general platform of struggle based on that of the native peoples .
Support the just protest of the Indigenous and Amazonian peoples
As libertarian communists who expect nothing from the State ( other than its destruction ) , we sympathise with the struggle of the native peoples as an immediate part of a larger project for the liberation of all exploited people , and thus part of a wider strategy or maximum programme of social revolution .
As libertarian communists who expect nothing from the State ( other than its destruction ) , we sympathise with the struggle of the native peoples as an immediate part of a larger project for the liberation of all exploited people , and thus part of a wider strategy or maximum programme of social revolution .
For this reason , we should support demands which in the short term serve to improve living conditions and to enhance their social , political and economic organisation with the aim of facing up to the exploiter State and destroy it from within , building those kernels of popular power which will bring down the giant with the feet of clay that is Capitalism , mortally wounded at a global level by a global crisis from which it cannot recover if , as we want , it is the bourgeoisie that has to pay and not the poor .
Now all that is needed is to put capitalism out of its agony by giving it the coup de grace .
We thus support the struggle of the Amazonian people to seek satisfaction of the following immediate demands from the State : Respect for the autonomy and self - determination of the native communities and their active political participation in the making of decisions .
The final decision of whether or not to approve legal regulations or contracts for concessions must be made by means of direct - democratic mechanisms ( popular assemblies , referendums , etc. ) .
The repeal of laws that damage or endanger the interests of Native and Rural Communities : repeal of Law No.29317 , the Forestry & Wildlife law , which is the product of a forced and partial modification of Executive Order No.1090 ( the " Jungle Law " ) and the related orders 1089 , 1064 and 1020 .
In other words , the 99 Orders that were imposed on the people without any consultation .
Benefits and facilities so that native communities or peoples can develop their productive , commercial and industrial activities .
Similarly , benefits and facilities for the commencement and promotion of education and culture within the communities ( by them and for them ) .
More schools and qualified teachers to promote the education of native students .
Greater benefit from oil and gas exploration and extraction to devolve to the native peoples , together with the building of hospitals , roads and all the necessary infrastructure , provided it is approved by the people themselves .
Capitalist property and community holdings
Why is capitalism not only seeking to appropriate the lands and natural resources of our native communities , but also to demolish their traditional organizational forms , based on communitarian and collectivist principles ?
Why is capitalism not only seeking to appropriate the lands and natural resources of our native communities , but also to demolish their traditional organizational forms , based on communitarian and collectivist principles ?
Private property serves to separate men , it is the origin of social classes .
But ownership and possession are two completely different things .
Possession derives from the use of goods according to the needs of the person or the group , whereas property is concerned with the right of certain persons or groups to these goods at will , in any moment .
Quite rightly , the communitarian form of the possession , management and use of the means of production is more than a right , it is the product of the exercise of popular power that has been built up over the centuries by native peoples .
Popular power has nothing to do with institutions created in direct opposition or by some chance mechanistic deformation of the dialectic : it is a network of social relations in which the criteria of equality , solidarity and fraternity between the members of the exploited classes predominates , in a class war against the exploiters against whom they stand .
It seeks their annihilation as a class of oppressors , not only through direct action but also through the construction of a new form of social organisation based on communitarian and federalist principles ( free association ) .
Anarchism takes this concept of power and carries it out through instruments such as federations , assemblies and communities , with the active and continuous exercise of direct democracy as opposed to " bourgeois or representative democracy " .
We therefore believe that delegating power means centralising it and institutionalising it , in other words turning it into an end , not a service .
Our answer to this is to build a popular , libertarian alternative in Peru ( of a type discussed above ) that ensures a truly multicultural , diverse and solid society .
Respect for the autonomy and self - determination of the native peoples !
Long live the struggle of the native communities !
Down with the Jungle Law and the privatization of water !
Down with the expropriating laws of the State !
Against NAFTA - submissive and anti-popular !
The jungle is not for sale , it is for protecting !
Trans -nationals out !
Create and build popular power !
Long live those who struggle !

Too much screen time diverts children away from more active hobbies , such as sports
Researchers found those who spent the most time in front of a screen , an average of two and a half hours a day , had “ significantly ” higher blood pressure levels than those who spent hardly any .
Researchers believe that one of the reasons could be that too much “ screen time ” diverts children away from more active hobbies , such as sports , although they think there are also other factors involved .
High blood pressure is one of several risk factors that can increase the risk of developing potentially deadly heart conditions .
The study looked at 111 children aged between three and eight .
On average the children spent 1.5 hours a day in front of the computer , although some spent considerably more .
Click Here !
The findings , published in the Archives of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine journal , show that those children who spent the least amount of time in front of a screen had significantly lower blood pressure levels than those who spent the most .
David Martinez - Gomez , from Iowa State University , said : “ The results of this study showed that TV viewing and screen time were associated with elevated blood pressure independent of body composition in children .
“ Given that total objective sedentary time was not associated with elevated blood pressure , it appears that other factors , which occur during excessive screen time , should also be considered in the context of sedentary behaviour and elevated blood pressure development in children . ”

Recent data indicate that HIV and AIDS affect gay and bisexual men at rates grossly disproportional to other groups .
Why did it take CDC so long to ask these questions and what will we do to answer them ?
This article is part of a
special series this week focusing on HIV and AIDS in the United
States .
Rewire is partnering with CHAMP , the AIDS Foundation of Chicago , the HIV Prevention
Justice Alliance , and other organizations to highlight issues on domestic HIV and AIDS policy while
several thousand people attend the National HIV Prevention Conference
in Atlanta , Georgia .
See the first piece in this series by Julie Davids and David Munar , The AIDS Crisis in the United States : Wlll the Obama Administration Meet the Challenge ?
CDC official Dr. Amy Lansky announced today at a plenary session of the National HIV Prevention Conference the CDC ’s finding that , in the United States , gay men and other men who have sex with men ( MSM ) have AIDS at a rate more than 50 times ( that ’s right , FIFTY TIMES ) greater than women and non -gay / bi men .
This confirms in emphatic terms that of all the disparities and disproportionate impacts in the HIV / AIDS epidemic in the United States , the greatest one is the extraordinarily disproportionate impact on gay and bisexual men — of all races and ethnicities – though the most disproportionate impact is on African American gay , bi and other MSM .
As incidence estimates released by CDC last year revealed , MSM constitute more than half of all new cases of HIV and are the group in which the number of new cases each continues to slowly increase .
What ’s new today is that the CDC has calculated * rates * of HIV / AIDS prevalence among MSM , not just raw numbers .
Lansky says the CDC estimates that there were 692.2 new HIV cases in 2007 per 100,000 MSM .
Having a rate as well as the raw numbers allows comparisons for the first time to other population groups at risk , such as women and heterosexual men .
In turn , to calculate a rate , one must be able to know or estimate the size of the underlying population .
It ’s fairly easy to know how many women or African Americans or Latinas / os there are in the country or a state or a community .
It ’s not so easy to know how many gay men there are , especially since many gay and bi men have reasons not to disclose their sexual orientation and since the government has not been especially interested in accurately counting us .
The CDC took a range of estimates from several nationally representative surveys and studies and decided to use the figure of 4.0 % , representing the median estimate of the proportion of adolescent and adult men who acknowledge having had sex with another man in the past five years .

Why has it taken so long to make this estimate , which in turn allows population comparisons and impact assessments ?
Maybe part of it is due to natural scientific reluctance to make guesses about things that cannot be accurately measured .
But that does n’t really make sense , because policymakers push scientists all the time to make estimates about hard - to - measure phenomena affecting public policy .
Seems clear to me that this was at least an indirect effect of the pervasive homophobia still affecting much of government , public policy , media and societal norms in this country .
At the same time we applaud this newly honest statement and comparison , and what it means about the continuing devastating impact on MSM communities and populations , most especially on MSM of color , it is equally important to reaffirm the devastating and disproportionate impact that HIV has as well on other populations and communities , particularly women of color in the South and elsewhere and on transgender women in urban areas throughout the country .
We must fight for funding and adequate social investment to end HIV / AIDS wherever it continues to persist and thrive , which is almost always where concentrated social injustice also thrives .
We will not decisively end AIDS anywhere unless we end it everywhere .
Mike Nelson , Kevin Murphy , and Bill Corbett of Rifftrax
By Zack Handlen
There ’s an art to making fun of bad movies , and Mike Nelson , Kevin Murphy , and Bill Corbett have it down .
Veterans of the cult classic TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 , the three have been in the business of laughing at the screen for nearly two decades .
When SCI FI cancelled MST3K in 1999 , Nelson , Murphy , and Corbett took some time off for other projects before coming back in 2007 with The Film Crew , a series of Shout !
Factory DVDs that mimicked the MST3K model , minus the talking heads .
After Shout !
stopped distributing the new project , the three established their current home , Rifftrax .
Stripping the MST3K concept down to is essence , Rifftrax offers downloadable audio files of Nelson , Murphy , Corbett , and occasional guest stars presenting gags on a wide variety of films , from Twilight to the Star Wars series to classics like Jaws .
On August 20 , Rifftrax will bring its act to the big screen , with a live riffing on Plan 9 From Outer Space to be simulcast to movie theaters across the country .
The A.V. Club recently sat down with Nelson , Murphy , and Corbett to talk about how they work to attract new audiences , the challenges of riffing on Harry Potter , and what happens when puppets turn into middle - aged men .

The A.V. Club : What prompted the Plan 9 From Outer Space live show ?
What sort of technical difficulties did you have to overcome to bring it to multiple theaters ?
Mike Nelson :
There are satellites involved in this .
We are actually using the resources of outer space to bring Plan 9 — which I think Ed Wood would ’ve liked .
But actually , it came about just because we love doing these live shows .
The actual Rifftrax business requires us to keep our nose to the grindstone instead of going out , and spending a lot of time on tour just did n’t really work out .
So this is the best way to reach a lot of people , something we ’ve had a lot of success with .
Advertisement
AVC : You ’ve riffed on Plan 9 before .
Is there a concern about repeating old jokes ?
Bill Corbett :
We are defiantly not changing a thing .
MN : Because we think we ’re that great .
Kevin Murphy :
It ’s like a Mozart concerto .
No , that ’s actually silly .
We ’re freshening it up some , but we realize also that most of the people who are gonna come to see this have never seen us do Plan 9 in any way , shape , or form , live or even on video .
We ’re getting a brand new audience here , we ’re reaching places we never have before .
Small towns are gonna be able to see us live .
We ’ve never been able to get there .
It ’s a much bigger audience , and it plays so well onstage when we ’ve done it before .
It seemed just like the perfect film for us to perform .
Advertisement
MN : Although when we do it , it ’s been different every time .
It ’s not been hugely different , but we just find that we like to do a pretty in - depth review each time we do a version of it , and then revise as needed .
We just want to tinker and make it better .
So there ’ll be new surprises .
BC : And we always do a certain amount of messing around onstage that ’s improvised , sometimes to our detriment .
Advertisement
AVC : Do you leave room for improvisation ?
KM : Oh absolutely .
Reacting to the audience is a big part of it , because it ’s funny , sometimes you ’ll add an errant grunt or groan —
Advertisement
BC : That ’s really Kevin , adding the grunt .
MN : Or flatulence .
KM :
And the audience will go crazy like they never have before .
People react to the film so differently all the time .
When the film itself is so silly , sometimes it does n’t need our support whatsoever .
Advertisement
BC : Yeah , there are times when the audience is in full belly - laugh mode , and it seems a little greedy or unreasonable to try and wedge a joke right in the middle of that .
We try and go with their rhythm .
It ’s a lot of fun .
Advertisement
AVC : Why Plan 9 ?
Is it just a film you like working with ?
MN : It ’s that , and it ’s also , this is something we hope people will go to a theater at night and go , “ Oh hey , look at that on the placard , there , I think I ’ll check that out . ”
So the movie needed its own marquee appeal .
There ’s not a lot of movies that do that , in terms of the movies we like to use .
If we did Voodoo Man , which is an old Bela Lugosi one we like , that ’s not gonna draw in a lot of people .
Plan 9 ’s got a lot of appeal , and it ’s a lot of fun on its own .
Advertisement
KM : It ’s sort of the 1812 Overture of bad movies .
AVC : If this is a success , will you do it again ?
BC : Absolutely .
KM : Oh yeah .
MN : That ’s part of the goal .
AVC : Rifftrax has really opened up the kind of movies you can riff on .
When you do something like Twilight , is there concern about the negative reaction from fans who do n’t get the joke ?
Advertisement
MN : Not really .
Actually , the Twilight one surprised me .
I thought we would get lots of spooky goth girls picketing outside the Rifftrax headquarters , but that did n’t happen .
BC : Well , they would ’ve had to be out in the sunlight for that .
MN : If we just keep daylight hours , we ’re fine .
KM :
It does n’t rain here enough in San Diego for the Twilight girls to come by .
Advertisement
MN : But no , we have n’t — aside from hearing years ago that Roger Corman was n’t a big fan of what we ’d done at Mystery Science , we have n’t gotten a lot of complaints .
AVC : Roger Corman ?
It seems like he’d be happy for the free publicity .
BC : You would think .
MN : Yeah , I think he ’s just a little sensitive .
We do n’t actually do a lot of — in sheer numbers , we do n’t rag on the film .
It ’s not like this constant shaking our fists on the screen when we do something .
It ’s sort of a funny meta -commentary .
But maybe in his case , maybe we got a little personal .
Advertisement
BC : Every now and then .
KM : I think we beat on Corman more than any single director , and he richly deserves it , too .
Advertisement
AVC : In terms of the meta - commentary , do you work to strike a balance between goofy jokes and outright bitterness when it comes to the movies you really do n’t like ?
BC : Very well put , actually .
I should write that down .
That ’s a good mindset to go in with .
Every now and then , I think it ’s safe to say for certain material , we ’ve uncorked a bit much .
But we also have recently done movies we like a lot .
We did Jaws , we did Casablanca , movies we genuinely love .
That was great fun in terms of the meta -commentary .
It would n’t work for any movie we loved , but I was very pleased how those turned out .
Advertisement
KM :
It does turn out to be more of a roast when we do those .
It ’s a riff - roast rather than a riff .
BC : Yeah .
We ’re just missing Dean Martin and Foster Brooks .
AVC : Are there movies you love that you have your eye set on in the future ?
MN : Maybe the Godfather series — which I think are great , except for III , of course .
Because it ’s something that everybody knows , and it ’s so much in their consciousness that it ’d be fun to add something new to it .
Blasphemy , perhaps , but still , it might be fun .
Advertisement
BC : Yeah , these are things that will outlive us in the ages , too .
So anybody who ’s worried about us making fun of them can rest assured that they ’ll outlive our measly little commentary .
AVC : Does being annoyed with a movie make it easier to riff ?
KM : For a thing like that , when you ’re generally genuinely angry and impatient with a film , you do have to kind of temper that , but it does certainly flavor the scene , because you can feel that coming through .
I think we ’ve learned how to censor ourselves , and generally , I do n’t think we add any commentary there that a lot of people in the audience would n’t be thinking , but perhaps not expressing out loud .
Advertisement
MN : I think there ’s a few times where people have said we were a little too harsh on a film , with Star Wars in particular .
But for every person who says that , there ’s a dozen who say , “ It was perfect , they actually held back on that . ”
Advertisement
BC : Since we have put down the puppets , and we ’re no longer filtering the commentary through cartoon characters , basically , it ’s a slightly different thing .
Because you ’re kind of playing yourself .
We ’re still in a sort of character at times .
We have little skitlets in our material , when we ’re hitting each other in the face .
Certainly it ’s scripted .
I think it ’s great , we have learned to ride it well .
Occasionally we twist one way or the other , but …
AVC : Does working without obvious “ characters ” change the jokes you tell ?
MN : Yeah , I think it does a little bit .
We have to be pretty aware of the fact that we ’re three middle - aged men sitting in a booth watching movies .
Our characters are just slightly to the side of ourselves .
It definitely changes it — like Bill says , when we were speaking through ventriloquist dummies who could go to any lengths , and then we could just pull the dummy back and say , “ Now cut that out ! ”
But in the case of our own selves …
But we can get away with a little bit , you just write a premise where someone goes mad for a couple of minutes .
You can go pretty far .
Advertisement
KM : We take turns going mad .
BC : That ’s the good part , yeah .
KM : Or all of us are .
AVC : You ’ve been doing this a while .
Do you feel like you ’ve got the process nailed down at this point ?

MN : I do .
I think we ’re in a good place with it .
I see when other people try and do it , when we look for new writers , it ’s quite a learning process .
It ’s hard to get it down , and it ’s a hard kind of writing .
It ’s a very specific kind of writing .
I think we ’ve been doing it long enough that we ’re very familiar with it .
I quite enjoy the specificity of it , and the poring over film , but it ’s not for everyone .
AVC : Do you still get surprised in the writing ?
Do you still surprise each other ?
Advertisement
BC : Oh yeah .
KM : Absolutely .
It ’s one of the things that keeps it fun , as a matter of fact .
The three of us like working with each other , in part because we always keep it interesting for each other .
Advertisement
BC : We actually had a funny little case of that , recently , what we all come up with when we accidentally wrote the same parts of a short we were doing .
We duplicated our efforts .
It was funny because of the different stuff we came up with for the same moment .
Both were interesting , but very different takes .
KM : I want to give credit to sort of the fourth riffer , who is Conor Lastowka .
He ’s been writing Rifftrax as well , since just about the beginning .
Advertisement
BC : Since he was 7 years old .
KM :
And he just blended in so quickly and has done so well that he ’s really an integral part of what we do now .
Advertisement
MN : He brings quite a different perspective .
For one thing , he ’s a lot younger than us , and we love that .
We ’re instructed by him often in pop-culture matters .
BC : Otherwise , all our references would be The Mary Tyler Moore Show .
So we have to watch that .
Advertisement
KM : He can wear a “ W00t ” shirt , and it ’s not ironic .
BC : Or it has like a triple - gainer of irony that we have no access to .
AVC : Do you each bring different things to the writing and performance ?
BC : I will speak personally and say it ’s amazingly flexible when we write .
I do n’t give a ton of thought as to who does what , because I actually think Mike and Kevin can kind of do anything .
Maybe the one thing I ’ll say is that if I have something that really needs great singing , I ’m inclined to give it to Kevin .
Advertisement
MN : He ’s really , really our only option .
BC : He ’s our point man there .
KM : I usually sort of want to give the lines that dealt with rage to Bill .
I honestly do n’t know why , but he does rage well .
But Mike does rage perfectly well as well .
I do n’t know if I do .
But I ’m just inclined to give it to Mike or Bill .

BC : Kevin has single - handedly spread the meme that I am a psychopath .
Thank you very much .
AVC : Back on Mystery Science
Theater 3000 , you were working with movies that were edited for TV .
What ’s it been like adjusting to full - length movies for Rifftrax ?
Advertisement
MN : The longer your movie is , and when you ca n’t edit out a chunk , you end up burning whole premises early on that you do n’t have for later , so it gets exponentially harder as it gets toward the end , especially if you have five action sequences that are basically the same .
You end up having to be a lot more inventive , and I think it ’s allowed us to stretch a little bit .
And also to work a bit harder , because there ’s no , “ Let ’s trim this part out , there ’s nothing here . ”
That option not being available to you makes it quite a challenge .
KM :
And it becomes exponentially more difficult when we ’re doing sequels .
Say with the Harry Potter movies , you ca n’t go back to the same well over and over again .
You burn all the goofy Harry Potter jokes in the first film , so that ’s been a real challenge .
Advertisement
BC : Yeah , we have nothing else to say about Hagrid , I think .
It ’s fair to say .
We ’ve pretty much covered him farting , belching , everything .
KM : It ’s all been done .
So we ’re done with Hagrid .
We just wo n’t say a thing when he ’s on the screen from now on .
Advertisement
BC : There ’s one more aspect to it that ’s interesting to me .
We ’ve taken on some long movies now , three hours and counting , and then it becomes this weird existential question .
Three guys are actually sitting there , peppering out lines fresh as daisies , three and a half hours later ?
KM : Who the hell are they ?
BC : It was a little different when it was roughly an hour and 20 of material for Mystery Science Theater .
Advertisement
AVC : Now that you do n’t have to worry about censors , have you considered doing more explicit movies than you have in the past ?
BC : Mostly we avoid that stuff .
I think we do n’t — I do n’t think any of us are drawn to doing particularly more edgy or blue or violent stuff .
Advertisement
KM : I ’d say that during all the time we ’ve been doing this , we ’ve found that trying to make fun of films that are pointedly violent or pointedly sexual , it gets boring really fast for us .
I guess it ’s just not our inclination .
BC : Yeah , it ’s confusing .
Kevin and I did do Saw , as a Rifftrax Presents , which is just a — how would you describe it , Mike ?
As an offshoot of the Rifftrax brand ?
Advertisement
MN : Yeah .
BC : Kevin and I just wrote it and recorded it in Minnesota .
It was fun , I enjoyed it , I thought it was pretty good material , but I ’m happy to stop there with the Saw series .
Advertisement
AVC : Rifftrax is audio-only .
Do you miss doing the sketches from the MST3K and Film Crew days ?
MN : I do , a little .
I ’d have to say that those were so time - consuming compared to the rest of it , and there are many , many people who kind of wanted to fast - forward through those .
I mean , I ’m proud of them and I enjoyed them .
Among ourselves , we had a ton of laughs , and really did some inventive stuff , but in terms of concentrating our efforts , I do like to knuckle down on the movie .
Advertisement
BC : I kind of miss the camaraderie of the shoot days , when the whole crew would come and it would be kind of a party after a long bunch of writing .
Not always a party , sometimes things could go wrong .
I do miss them too .
I enjoyed them , but as we put down the puppets , and are getting up there in years , I ’m a little less eager to jump in front of a camera like a silly person .
KM : Oh God , yeah .
[ Laughs . ]
BC : That said , I think a lot of people — like , my wife was a fan of Mystery Science Theater and liked the sketches , and tended to skip over the movie parts .
So I know that the opposite of what you said is true .
Advertisement
KM :
We have gotten a chance to do music recently , and that ’s a lot of fun .
That sort of gives me the creative release I used to get doing sketches .
AVC : What would you say to bring in MST3K fans who , for whatever reason , have n’t gotten into Rifftrax yet ?
Advertisement
MN : I think the Plan 9 thing is going to be very comfortable and familiar for the people who were real MST fans .
I think the spirit of the humor is , there ’s a continuation there that I do n’t think will jar anyone .
I understand people getting emotionally attached to something and not wanting it to change .
We saw that on the show itself , we ’d change something on the wall , and people would write in and complain .
BC : That was me , Mike .
I really liked that thing on the wall .
MN : That ’s why we hired you , to stop you writing letters .
I think that Plan 9 , though , will be very , very familiar to those fans .
Advertisement
KM : As we develop Rifftrax as a site , there is something for people who are familiar and comfortable with the Mystery Science Theater stuff .
We ’ve got actual DVDs of old bad movies that worked out really well .
And we ’ve got this MP3 podcast technology that allows us to riff any movie we want .
So I think we ’ve got something for the generations past and the generations present and the generations to come .
It ’s been fun to adapt the thing to new media and new technology , and still have it be guys making fun of movies .
BC : Yeah .
I ditto what both Mike and Kevin said .
I would add to the list of things we have that are comfortable for MST fans — we have a lot of old industrial and educational shorts .
Advertisement
KM : They ’re swell .
They ’re so much fun , they ’re just delicious .
BC : People are gobbling those up .
And we love doing them .
In the end , it ’s definitely different , but it does feel like a continuation .
Like Mike , I kind of understand people who may have liked a thing about the show in particular that ’s not with Rifftrax , but I also think it ’s true that what we ’re doing now is pretty much a response to what we got at Mystery Science Theater .
Especially in our last couple of seasons , when we were doing the blockbuster specials and the Oscar specials .
We did these little clips of Titanic and the Halloween movies and Jurassic Park 2 .
And people just responded so well , they said , “ It would be so great if you could bring your treatment to the stuff that ’s coming out in theaters now . ”
We kind of found a way of doing it .
Advertisement
KM : So we ’d like to invite all MST fans of the past to step up on our porch and try our lemon - drink .
See what they think of it .
BC : Yeah .
Kevin ’s especially .
MN : I will add , not to be too long - winded here with this one particular question , but the Twilight thing seemed to open up a whole new fan base of people who did n’t know what in the hell MST was .
They saw this , and they get it .
That ’s such a great in for people , that movie ’s so serious .
To have people talking back to it seems perfect .
I ’ve been delighted to find there are fans that do n’t know what MST is .
Chinese Broccoli Beef Noodle Stir Fry
Here ’s what you ’ll learn :
How to choose and buy the freshest Chinese broccoli ( gai-lan )
The perfect marinade recipe
Secrets to no-fail Chinese stir fries
Chinese Broccoli ( Gai - Lan )
Chinese broccoli should be almost all stem and green leaves .
Look for Chinese broccoli with minimal open flowers ( lots of open white flowers means that the Chinese broccoli is past its prime and bitter .
You can also tell from the cut stems if the Chinese broccoli will be perfect or too old .
See the bottoms of these cut stems ?
It ’s milky - translucent and smooth .
If the bottoms of the stem have a hard white circle in the middle ( instead of smooth , milky and translucent ) it will probably be past its prime and taste tough and bitter .
Photo below is Chinese Broccoli…see the beautiful stem - bottoms ?
For this Broccoli Beef Noodle Stir Fry recipe , you can use ANY type of noodles .
Really , spaghetti noodles are fantastic in this dish .
I happened to have Japanese style egg - noodles , so that ’s what I used !
Cook your noodles according to package directions .
While the noodles are cooking , marinate the beef slices in soy sauce , cornstarch , sugar , oyster sauce and rice wine .
If you do n’t have rice wine , use dry sherry or any dry white wine will do .
The sugar and the oyster sauce will help the meat caramelize .
You want beautiful , carmelized meat in your stir fry ?
Here ’s the secret .
DO NOT CROWD THE MEAT !
Single layer , ladies and gents !
Once you add it to the wok or frying pan , LEAVE THE THING ALONE .
Resist the temptation to shake , move it around or flip …until the first side has a chance to caramelize .
Then flip .
See the nicely caramelized bits ?
Once the meat finishes cooking , remove to a plate .
Now it ’s time for Chinese Broccoli ( Gai Lan ) .
Stir fry for a minute , scooping up the oils at the bottom of the wok all over the Chinese Broccoli .
Bathe the oil over the Chinese Broccoli .
Now turn heat down , add 1/4 cup of water or browth and cover to let steam .
A couple of minutes later …test the Chinese Broccoli to see if done !
A knife should pierce easily into the steam .
Now its the cooked noodles turn to take a bath in the sauce .
See it absorb all the juicy bits ?
Now return the beef and broccoli to the wok and serve !!
Yum .
A Very Ordinary Henchman Demjanjuk Trial to Break Legal Ground in Germany
The trial against suspected concentration camp guard John Demjanjuk is a legal first for Germany .
For the first time , a person who was low on the chain of command is to be indicted , even though there is no proof of his having committed a specific offence .
Other alleged henchmen have gotten off far more lightly .

I srael and the U.S. have well - deserved reputations for standing up for their citizens abroad .
Canada , under Stephen Harper , is gaining a reputation for failing its own .
Omar Khadr rots in Guantanamo .
Abousfian Abdelrazik , tortured in his native Sudan , had to be holed up in the Canadian embassy in Khartoum for a year before being allowed to return to Canada .
Bashir Makhtal – abducted from Kenya to his native Ethiopia and sentenced to life in prison for allegedly belonging to a separatist group – may or may not get Ottawa 's help in fighting the verdict of a kangaroo court .
Huseyin Celil – a Uighur Canadian human - rights activist serving a life sentence in China after being convicted , in secret , on charges of terrorism – has been forgotten by Ottawa .
Its waning interest has run in tandem with its increasing enthusiasm for business with China .
Perhaps the Harper Tories do n't want anything to do with anyone tarred with the terrorism brush , rightly or wrongly .
But now comes the case of Suaad Hagi Mohamud .
The Toronto woman was left dangling in Nairobi after an airport official thought her lips did not match the picture on her passport .
Rather than helping her , the Canadian embassy became a party to tormenting her .
It has taken 11 weeks and a DNA test to prove her identity .
Her case would n't even have come to light had it not been for Star reporter John Goddard , who has kept at it , day after day .
Gar Pardy , former head of the consular services section of foreign affairs in Ottawa , and others see a pattern of discrimination .
They draw comparisons with Brenda Martin , jailed in Mexico but rescued by a minister 's intervention and flown back on a government plane .
She is white , others not .
The others are also Muslim .
Star columnist Christopher Hume yesterday accused the Harperites of racism based on colour .
" This smacks not just of prejudice but of apartheid . "
Former MP Omar Alghabra , who was Liberal citizenship critic , says the " elephant in the room " may be the Tory belief that some Canadians are not " real " citizens and , thus , unworthy of consular help .
Dan McTeague , former Liberal minister responsible for Canadians abroad , says Harper shows no interest in Canadians in trouble overseas unless he is embarrassed into action by the media or the courts .
Given that 9 per cent of Canadians are abroad at any given time , we need a parliamentary debate on the issue .
Dirty laundry
Protocol has it that when travelling abroad , the leader of a country refrain from washing dirty domestic laundry in front of foreigners or playing partisan politics .
Not Harper .
Either he cannot help himself or he does mean to fully use the international stage to beam loud messages back home .
Sept. 2007 : He 's in Australia , from whence he berates Chief Electoral Officer Marc Mayrand .
The latter had said he could n't deny women in niqabs the right to vote because the law did not let him .
The Prime Minister accused Mayrand of subverting the will of Parliament , when , in fact , Mayrand was upholding it .
But Harper , riding a wave of bigotry in Quebec in time for three federal by - elections , would n't let facts or protocols get in his way .
Last month :
At the G - 8 summit in Italy , he blasts Michael Ignatieff for saying Canada was losing clout globally .
In turned out that the latter had n't said so and Harper apologized , rightly .
But he would n't have magnified his problem had he refrained , in the first place , from domestic mudslinging abroad .
This week : Grilled in Guadalajara about his decision to impose visas on visitors from Mexico , Harper blames our refugee system .
That is seen by Tories as a Liberal legacy , when , in fact , it was Brian Mulroney who set up the independent Immigration and Refugee Board and the rules governing it .

Harper wants to tighten the rules .
What better way to set up the coming changes than to use the megaphone of a foreign summit to badmouth the system back home ?

More non-green shoots courtesy of the American Bankers Association .
Reuters : Fallout from a still deteriorating housing market caused the rate of consumer loan payments at least 30 days late to rise to 3.23 percent in the January - to - March period from 3.22 percent in the 2008 fourth quarter , the American Bankers Association said .
Delinquencies were the highest since the ABA began tracking the data in 1974 .
Late payments on home equity borrowings set records , rising to 3.52 percent from 3.03 percent on loans and to 1.89 percent from 1.46 percent on lines of credit .
Credit card delinquencies also broke a record , with delinquencies jumping to 6.6 % -- a number that understates the severity of the problem since , as Reuters notes , it does n't take into account bank - issued cards .
What 's the problem ?
Jobs jobs jobs .
On Thursday morning , IT consultant Paul Nash received an urgent call from a client whose Apache webserver had crashed the previous night and inexplicably would n't restart .
Equally vexing , people who tried to visit the client 's website during the 10 - hour outage received a message advertising TeamViewer , a maker of widely used software for remotely managing PCs and servers .
After 90 minutes of troubleshooting , Nash traced the problem to TeamViewer , which he used to remotely administer the client 's servers .
It turns out the program had opened up its own webserver on the client 's machine as soon as Apache went down and in the process made it impossible for the client , a large provider of business software , to restart its proper website .
" At that point , basically the webserver is hosed because if Apache tries to start up again , it sees someone else on port 80 and it falls over and dies , which is kind of antisocial behavior , " Nash , who is the principal at Toronto - based Nash Networks , told The Register .
Nash was able to get Apache up and running again by killing TeamViewer processes on the server , but by then , the client " had quite a bit of irate support requests stacked up . "
The incident highlights a serious liability that comes from using what he otherwise regards as a great tool for remotely managing the thousands of PCs and servers entrusted to him .
But what really sticks in Nash 's craw , he said , is the blase attitude TeamViewer support people showed when he reported the SNAFU .
" They said they do n't see what the problem is , " he said .
After he escalated the complaint , Nash finally received instructions for modifying the registry of machines running TeamViewer so its webserver wo n't automatically start should the normal webserver go down .
But this requires him to put his hands on every machine he manages , a solution that 's needlessly cumbersome .
Also concerning , said Nash , is TeamViewer 's lack of disclosure that its software is receiving incoming traffic sent to machines that run the software .
" They 're sitting in the middle and they 're in a position to snoop on all my traffic , " he said , adding that he thinks that scenario is unlikely .
Still , when Nash learned that TeamViewer does monitor for incoming web requests , he said it made him wonder : " What else are n't they telling us ? "
TeamViewer 's website claims the software has more than 15 million installations in 50 countries .
Company representatives did n't immediately respond to requests for comment sent early Friday evening Germany time .
We 'll be sure to update this article , if they get back to us . ®
Update
A TeamViewer representative emailed us the following :
Yes TeamViewer tries to use port 80 if available first .
TeamViewer also waits about 10 Minutes for an eventually available Webserver to start .
If this does n't happen because there is no Webserver or because the Webserver crashes TeamViewer grabs port 80 .
If you should start the Webserver afterwards TeamViewer still uses port 80 so the Webserver can't work on it .
If you then close TeamViewer or restart the PC you can reallocate port 80 again .
ARLINGTON HEIGHTS , Ill. , July 23 ( UPI ) -- A 93 - year - old Illinois man says he is marrying his third - grade sweetheart after 85 years apart .
Roland " Mac " McKitrick , 93 , of Arlington Heights , proposed to Lorraine Beatty , 92 , of Georgia , Tuesday morning , about three years after they reconnected following an 85 - year lull in their friendship , the Arlington Heights Daily Herald reported Thursday .

" She was my third - grade sweetheart back in 1921 , " McKitrick said .
" We knew each other for about one year .
Then , for all practical purposes , we lost contact for 85 years . "
However , McKitrick said both he and Beatty had brothers living in Connecticut who became friends , and the two reunited through their brothers .
" I still picture her as my third - grade sweetheart .
I 've carried that in the back of my mind since that time , " McKitrick said .
He said he still has a photograph of himself with Beatty taken when they were children .
" That snapshot stayed in my memory , " he said , " and her face stayed in my memory . "
North Korea today warned that it would launch a " merciless " attack if provoked by the US and its allies , hours after President Barack Obama described the state 's nuclear and missile programmes as a " grave threat " to the world .
" If the US and its followers infringe upon our republic 's sovereignty even a bit , our military and people will launch a one hundred or one thousandfold retaliation with [ a ] merciless military strike , " the state - controlled Minju Joson newspaper said .
The newspaper described Obama as a hypocrite for supporting a nuclear - free world while making what it claimed were " frantic efforts " to develop new nuclear weapons at home .
" The nuclear programme is not the monopoly of the US , " it said .
Russia , which shares a border with North Korea , quickly responded that any missile heading for Russian airspace would be promptly shot down .
" We will see it and shoot it down , " the deputy defence minister , Viktor Popovkin , said , according to Interfax .
The North Korean warning came as reports in Japan and South Korea said the regime could be preparing to test launch two long - range ballistic missiles , possibly in retaliation against sanctions agreed by the UN security council at the weekend .
The security council imposed stiffer measures as punishment for North Korea 's controlled nuclear explosion last month , including a ban on all weapons exports from North Korea and the import of all but small arms .
The security council also called on member states to stop and search North Korean ships suspected of carrying nuclear and ballistic weapons technology .
Obama said today that every effort would be made to enforce the sanctions .
While he repeated his offer of negotiations , Obama said that " belligerent , provocative behaviour that threatens neighbours will be met with significant and serious enforcement of sanctions that are in place " .
A South Korean newspaper reported that North Korea had started withdrawing money from bank accounts in Macau to prevent it from being frozen under UN sanctions .
North Korea has responded to UN action by threatening to conduct more missile launches , enrich uranium and weaponise all its plutonium .
There are also fears that it is preparing to carry out another nuclear test , its third since October 2006 .
Reports in South Korea said a train capable of transporting intercontinental ballistic missiles had been spotted arriving at a launch site in Musudan - ri on the north - east coast , weeks after it had taken a missile to a newer site in the north - west .
Any tests would be likely to involve an improved version of the Taepodong - 2 missile , which has a theoretical range of 4,800 km , enough to put it within striking distance of Alaska .
In previous tests the missile has either failed or fallen harmlessly into the Pacific ocean .
A senior US military official warned this week that North Korea could pose a real threat to the US west coast in " three to five years " if its missile development continued unchecked .
" It does not include how long it takes to build that warhead , " General James Cartwright , vice - chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , told a senate hearing on missile defence .
" And that assumes a lot of luck on their part in moving forward . "
North Korea 's rhetorical outbursts serve two purposes : to intimidate its enemies and whip up support for the regime at home .
The country 's leader , Kim Jong - il , is consolidating his position as he prepares to hand over power to his youngest son , Kim Jong-un .
Today North Korea denied Japanese media reports that Jong - un had flown to Beijing earlier this month to meet the Chinese president , Hu Jintao .
The Asahi Shimbun newspaper said Jong - un , 26 , had told Chinese officials he held a senior position in the ruling Korean workers ' party and had been officially anointed to succeed his ailing father , who suffered a stroke last summer .

It ’s Snow Leopard day zero , so of course I had to upgrade .
All in all , everything is great .
( Especially the multiple monitor window migration fix ! )
But the # 1 thing that annoys me about all OS X releases in the colors in Terminal .app .
They ’re pretty much unusable on a dark background ( especially the blue ) .
For some time , there have been hacks to fix the problem .
Well of course these hacks did n’t work on 10.6 anymore .
Never one to shy away from the problem , I dove in .
And we have success !
Here ’s how to make it work :
Find Terminal.app in Finder ( / Applications / Utilities ) , right click , “ Get Info ”
There is a checkbox “ Open in 32 - bit mode ” , Check it !
Install SIMBL .
Plugsuit was installed on my machine before , it freaks out because of the 10.6 changes .
SIMBL silently just works or does n’t .
Get My updated TerminalColours SIMBL plugin .
See the original post for details on how to install it .
Restart Terminal.app
Enjoy your readable colors !
This works because InputManagers still work in 32 bit mode , but not 64 bit mode .
So by forcing Terminal.app to run in 32 bit mode , SIMBL can still hook in .
I just had to update TerminalColours to swizzle a new method that 10.6 uses to pick colors .
Hope you enjoy !

Yes , you burn calories while weightlifting , running or doing other exercise .
No , the calorie burn does not continue as you pig out later .

After an intense hour of sweating on the treadmill or pumping iron , most of us look forward to the extra post - exercise " afterburn " of fat cells that has been promised to us by fitness pundits .
This 24 - hour period of altered metabolism is supposed to help with our overall weight loss .
Unfortunately , a recent study found this to be a myth for moderate exercisers .
The new research clarifies a misunderstanding that exercisers can ignore their diet after a workout because their metabolism is in this super active state .
" It 's not that exercise does n't burn fat , " said Edward Melanson , associate professor of medicine at the University of Colorado , " It 's just that we replace the calories .
People think they have a license to eat whatever they want , and our research shows that is definitely not the case .
You can easily undo what you set out to do . ”
The findings were detailed in the April edition of Exercise and Sport Sciences Review .
What does happen Melanson and his team set out to measure whether people were able to burn more calories for the 24 hours after a workout compared to a day with no exercise .
Their test groups , totaling 65 volunteers , included a mix of lean vs. obese and active vs. sedentary people .
On exercise days , they rode stationary bikes until they had burned 400 calories .
Their pre and post exercise diet was controlled .
Throughout the groups , there was no difference in the amount of fat burned in the 24 - hour period either with or without exercise .
Of course , during the exercise plenty of calories were being burned and that 's the formula that Melanson would like us to remember .
" If you are using exercise to lose body weight or body fat , you have to consider how many calories you are expending and how many you are taking in , " Melanson recently told WebMd .
The daily energy balance or " calories in vs. calories out " is the most reliable equation for long - term weight loss .
While the current research focused on the moderate activity levels of most people , the researchers admitted they still need to examine the effect of higher intensity workouts and multiple consecutive days of exercise .
They are clear on their current message .
" We suggest that it is time to put the myth that low intensity exercise promotes a greater fat burn to rest , " Melanson writes .
" Clearly , exercise intensity does not have an effect on daily fat balance , if intake is unchanged . "
Type of workout
So , how about a weight resistance training program mixed in with cardio work ?
Another fitness industry claim is that more muscle mass on your frame will raise your metabolism rate , even while sitting on the couch .
The same study , using the same test groups , found the post - exercise rate of calorie burn did not change on days of lifting versus no lifting .
It is true that a pound of muscle burns seven to ten calories per day versus only two calories per day for a pound of fat .
However , the average adult just does n't put on enough lean muscle mass to make this difference significant .
While this research dispels one myth about exercise , there is still overwhelming evidence of the benefits of movement when combined with your eating habits .
So , before eating that double cheeseburger and fries , you might want to do some math to figure out how many stairs you 'll have to climb to break even .

$ 10 To Answer This Question I ’m completely unable to find an answer , so I ’ll give ten bucks via PayPal ( or whatever ) to the first person to give me a working answer to this question :
How do I force an ATI X1550 card to output YPrPb signals on VGA under Windows Vista ?
Even if it ’s a stupid answer , if it works , I ’ll pay you .
It ’s probably a registry key , or maybe there ’s software , or maybe the Russians know something .
If I have to buy the ATI HDTV dongle , and you can confirm that for me , I ’ll give you five bucks .
Thanks for the assistance .
Google Reader Recommends Feeds , Adds Drag -n - Drop Organization Google Reader has added a feature to the sidebar that recommends RSS feeds you might be interested in subscribing to based on your current subscription .

It ’s been described as almost a Digg - like system , in that the eventual goal would be to improve Google results through the wisdom of crowds by changing the results for everyone based on a mass consensus in the voting up and down ( and deleting ) of search results .
This feature was originally developed on Google ’s SearchMash test engine .
The voting experiment is a tasty one , so much that those who have n’t been offered it are clamoring for it , while the Google Suggest experiment has so much potential appeal , it should be an option in Google ’s preferences .
One limitation of the Experimental program is that you can only “ install ” one experiment to your search results at a time .
Hopefully , Google will find a way to offer Suggest as an option to all users and let them choose a different experiment to play around with .
YouTube User Comment On Republican CNN / YouTube Debates
The YouTube blog has put together this playlist of what YouTube users who attended last night ’s CNN / YouTube Republican Presidential Debate had to say after the debate : 46 videos in all , so take your time .
Google Helps You Read Experts Exchange For Free Experts
Exchange is a website that answers questions on computer issues , and it ranks very well in Google search results .
Problem is , it costs money to read the answer , $ 12.95 a month .
Luckily , they expose the full answers to search engines ( which is why they are able to rank so well ) , so you can easily read the whole answer without registering and paying for an account .
Any time you see Experts - exchange.com in Google search , just hit the cache link to read the page with the complete answer .
Do n’t even bother trying to view it normally , because they expect you to pay for content .
Hopefully they left this loophole open on purpose , because we all know paying for content is a loser of a business model .
The Wall Street Journal has a back door for Digg users , and this is a type of back door as well .
Sites can lock down their communities to paid users , but do n’t expect search engine visitors to pay .
After all , why would I pay for a website if I ca n’t even see the quality of the “ Expert ” answers ?

Google Gadgets Now Run On Mac ’s Dashboard Google Desktop ’s Gadgets are now cross-platform compatible with Apple ’s Mac OS X Dashboard .
That means you can run Gadgets alongside Widgets in the Dasboard , on Google ’s Sidebar , and on the iGoogle personalized homepage , making them amazingly versatile , and letting Google ’s platform pick up the slack when Dashboard is missing something important .
If Google does the same for Windows Vista , and helps Gadgets run on Vista ’s Sidebar , that would be amazing .

Infinite Nanoseconds !
Google ’s calculator has all sorts of stuff we mere mortals can’t understand , and here ’s another one : 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 millenium = inf nanoseconds
Well , I did n’t know that !
So , Google is saying that “ infinite ” is actually 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,000 years .
Good to know that there ’s a definite limit on infinite .

Stars Of The YouTube Debate Hopefully you already read my liveblog report of the Republican presidential debate , presented by YouTube and CNN , but whether you have or not , here are the top YouTube user videos used tonight :
The debate led off with this song introducing the eight candidates .
It ’s funny , and says it all well :
This was the first question , which sparked a huge arguement between Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney .
Rudy lost a lot of votes thanks to the term “ sanctuary city ” tonight , but Romney could be hurt in the long run :
The first cartoon question :
All the candidates knew this guy , who heads up a tax watchdog group :
This is the “ throwing gun ” question :
This was a hugely difficult question , even making my wife nervous :
Another cartoon question , and Fred Thompson briefly thought the figure in it was supposed to be him :
This gay Brigadier General asked one of the toughest questions of the night , plus he got the chance to respond from the audience : Retired Brigadier General Keith Kerr did not disclose that he is a member of a Hillary Clinton steering committee .
Anderson Cooper said afterwards that if CNN had known that beforehand they seriously would have had to consider his prominent role in the debate .
And the final , more lighthearded Yankees vs. Red Sox question :
CNN / YouTube Republican Debates : LIVEblog
The CNN / YouTube Republican Presidential debates are starting in a moment , and I ’ll be posting updates here as they happen .
8:00 : And they ’re off .
8 candidates , all the questions are from YouTube videos ( 5,000 in all , 2,000 more than the Democrats , though there was more time due to the delay ) .
The candidates are not on stage , but instead the Florida governor comes out ( after a very flattering introduction ) to introduce them .
They are : Duncan Hunter
Ron Paul
John McCain
Fred Thompson
Rudy Guiliani
Mitt Romney
Mike Huckabee
Tom Tancredo
This does not seem to be a Ron Paul - packed crowd , as far as I could tell from the applause .
You get that sometimes , the crowd acting like Paul is Jesus .
8:07 : They will insist candidates stay on the question , not answer previous questions .
Good luck !
8:10 : What a great start !
A YouTuber singing about each of the candidates .
8:11 : First question is to Giuliani accusing him of making a sanctuary for illegal immigrants .
Giuliani answers well , that they only allowed illegal children to attend school to avoid having 70,000 people on the street when crime was bad , but gave the names of arrested immigrants to the government .
Romney ’s response was devastating , that New York actually filed a lawsuit to protect its illegal status , and that you have to arrest all illegals because they are already committing a crime by being here .
I may not agree with that , but it was a great answer .
8:14 : Giuliani accuses Romney of hiring illegals to work on his house , Romney says he can’t check the papers of everyone who works for a contractor he hires .
They are slugging it out , and my wife is loving the fight .
8:16 : They refused to allow the debate to continue , until Anderson Cooper stopped them by playing another clip , also asking if candidates will pledge to veto any bill that grants amnesty to illegals .
Thompson answers it well , saying they must enforce the borders and eliminate sanctuary cities , a shot at Giuliani .
Then he takes a shot at Romney as a flip - flopper , and accuses Giuliani of fighting to keep New York as a sanctuary city .
The words “ Sanctuary City ” are going to hurt Giuliani coming out of this debate .
8:21 : McCain answer the question , saying that we have to work harder to get the American people to trust us after our recent failures .
He refused to yield when Cooper said “ time ” about five times .
Tancredo seems very pleased with himself , giving a speech about how everyone wants to be like him .
8:24 : About Americans losing their jobs due to illegals , Tancredo answers well that there are no jobs Americans wo n’t work , just jobs Americans wo n’t do for the wages illegals will accept .
8:26 : Huckabee is asked why he allowed illegals to get in - state tuition prices , but wo n’t allow military children from other states to get same .
He says the question is misinformed , but then explains exactly how the bill would do just that .
He also says the way we treat our veterans is disgraceful .
8:29 : Romney strikes back , fighting with everyone on stage .
He ’s annoying my wife with his attack stance , but it sure is entertaining .
8:30 : Question for Ron Paul , something about Paul supporters on the internet who say he believes in a conspiracy to form a North American Union of the U.S. , Canada and Mexico .
He says that our sovereignty is definitely under threat , and there are moves toward such a union , just like there were moves towards a European Union .
8:33 : McCain asked if we need to get the government spending under control , and he says the Republicans have lost their way on limiting spending , and he agrees .
He says he vetoes every pork barrel bill that crosses his desk with a veto pen he got from Ronald Reagan , and he makes the writers of that pork famous .
Romney talks about it without attacking anyone , and says we need to get this under control .
Giuliani says we need to have across the board cuts , no filling the jobs of government workers who retire over the coming years .
8:36 : Asked about increased government spending , and about 3 government programs that would be cut .
Thompson says that he would cut from the OMB ’s report on 100 programs that need to be cut , cutting all of them , and reform Social Security and Medicare with individual spending accounts and re-indexing .
8:39 : Paul lists 3 programs , he ’d cut , and you can see the Paul supporters in the crowd getting loud .
Huckabee says he ’d get rid of the IRS and revamp Social Security .
8:40 : Cartoon Uncle Sam asks a question about eliminating the federal income tax for a national sales tax .
McCain says no .
He also attacks Paul , saying Paul ’s attitude of isolationism caused World War II and allowed Hitler to go to power .
Lots of cheers , a few very loud boos .
The audience is mostly behind McCain , although McCain broke the rules by addressing a prior issue .
Paul says he is not an isolationist and has many military supporters .
8:43 : Question about opposing vetoing efforts to raise taxes , and everyone says they would pledge not to raise taxes .
Thompson and McCain say they pledge it to the American people , not independent groups .
Tancredo ( I think ) says he would not raise taxes , unless there was an emergency .
8:45 : Romney says he supports farm subsidies to protect our food supply and encourage new technologies .
Giuliani says we can’t lower subsidies , because they are higher in Europe than here , so if we lower them without them being lowered in Europe , we ca n’t compete .
8:48 : Giuliani asked by Anderson Cooper about something in the news today about records over security expenses when he was mayor .
He says he hid nothing , that as far as he knows nothing was hid , and that ’s all .
8:50 : Tancredo asked about toxic toys from China , Hunter also responds .
Hunter says China is cheating with the trade deficit , buying arms , and asks Americans to buy American with the Christmas shopping .
First commercial break , or it would be if a video ran by Fred Thompson did n’t so badly attack the other candidates .
Cooper lets the other candidates respond .
Romney says , “ I was wrong ” about being pro-choice many years ago .
Huckabee says he barely ever rose taxes , and he cut many other taxes .
8:59 : A guy with and tossing a gun asks about gun control , and Hunter ( ironic , right ? ) answers well , and says you ca n’t toss guns around safely .
9:00 : Giuliani asked about gun control and his record .
He says they had to be aggressive to protect New York , but that Americans have the right to bear arms , and nationally we can only have loose requirements , but states have the right to be a little more strict based on their local culture .
Thompson responds that gun laws in D.C. banning all firearms did n’t work , and Giuliani says he agrees that what works in New York will often not work elsewhere .
9:04 : Question about what guns the candidates have .
Thompson jokes , I will not tell you what guns I have , or where I keep them .
McCain talks about his war experience with guns , but does not own guns .
Giuliani has no guns .
9:05 : Question about black - on - black crime .
Romney says you need to have a mom and a dad to have values and prevent crime , and better prepare kids in inner city schools .
Giuliani says Romney has a mixed record on crime , with some categories going up , some down , while his record was all successful in reducing crime , especially in inner city neighborhoods .
9:08 : New topic : Abortion .
Asking pro-life candidates what crime those who get abortions would be charged with .
Paul says he does n’t think women should be charged with a crime , but that he never , as a ob / gyn , saw a medically necessary abortion , and that the abortionist should be charged with a crime .
However , he says it should be up to the states , not the federal government .
Thompson says we need to put the right judges on the Supreme Court to change things , but that things should be like they are now .
9:09 : Question : If Congress passed a federal ban on abortions , would you sign it ?
Giuliani says “ I would probably not sign it , I would leave it up to the states to decide ” .
Romney says he ’d love to see that kind of consensus , but it ’ll never happen , and it will probably be left to the states .
9:13 : Huckabee asked about the death penalty .
He says he is the only one on stage who had to decide to put someone to death , and that it is a very tough decision , and explains the difference between the death penalty and abortion .
The question is what would Jesus do , and Huckabee says Jesus was too smart to run for public office .
Tancredo says he ’d ask Jesus for advice .
9:16 : Guy holds the Bible , and asks if you believe every single word .
Giuliani says you ca n’t take every work literally , but he believes in it and reads it frequently and lets it guide him .
Romney says he believes it is the word of god .
Huckabee says that it is the word of god , regardless of the meaning of every word , it ’s all there for a reason .
Commercial break 9:23 : Question for Giuliani about Islamic terrorists .
He says a small group is ruining the good name of a great religion .
He says “ September 11 ″ twice , for the first time in the debate .
He says Democrats bury their head in the sand , and are afraid to even say that the terrorists are Islamic , that saying such only offends the terrorists , not the rest of normal Islamic people .
9:25 : McCain says we ca n’t set a date for withdrawl , but that he was the only one who said Rumsfeld ’s strategy was a failure , and that our current strategy is working .
9:27 : Question that McCain is an expert on waterboarding , and opposes it , and whether the other oppose it .
Romney says he should n’t debate specific methods , but opposes torture .
McCain comes out fighting , and says “ I ’m astonished you do n’t know what waterboarding is ” , Romney says he does , and McCain asks how he could not be against it then .
Romney clarifies that he does not want to lay out accepted an unaccepted types .
McCain says we ’d have to withdraw from the Geneva Convention under Romney , that we ca n’t be Jack Bauer .
Yes , he said Jack Bauer !
9:32 : Question about who ’d make a long term commitment to the people of Iraq .
Thompson says we should n’t be there forever , but as long as it takes .
Paul says the best commitment is to give the Iraqi people their country back .
McCain says Vietnam sent an important message to the enemy , and that Iraq will keep the terrorists from coming to our cities .
Paul says our bases in other countries cause them to want to fight us .
Tancredo says
Paul ’s idea of not going overseas is nice , but that ’s not the word we live in .
9:37 : Question for Giuliani about whether he is trying to use September 11 to get into the White House .
He says his record , both in the Justice Department and as mayor , all before September 11 , show why he should be President .
9:39 : Question from a computer animated Dick Cheney , who asks if the Vice President will be allowed as much power as Cheney did .
Thompson jokes he thought the animated character was him , and says that the most important thing is that the Vice President be prepared to be President .
McCain says Bush had to rely on Cheney because of his limitations , but that he would not have to .
My wife says McCain is very cuddly .
Last commercial break .
9:47 : A retired Brigadier General says that he is openly gay , and wants to know why the armed forces cannot be allowed to serve with gays .
Hunter says he agrees with Colin Powell that soldiers cannot co-exist as a unit because of the type of person who becomes a soldier and how hard it would be for them to deal with it .
Huckabee says we can not put our soldiers at risk by affecting unit cohesion .
9:49 : Romney is quoted as saying that he can’t wait for the day gays can serve openly .
He responds that this not the day for that .
My wife is screaming at the screen , saying he ’s worse than Kerry at sticking by what he says .
9:50 : The soldier who asked the question gets up and says he was not given a good answer .
9:51 : McCain responds , saying that those who serve right now say that the policy is working .
9:52 : Question about whether candidates accept support of log cabin Republicans .
Huckabee says he needs all the support he can get , and will accept it , but will not change his positions because of that .
9:53 : Question by guy inside a dollar bill graphic showing social security being squandered .
Thompson says we need to protect young people from being hurt by his own generation .
Romney says we face so many problems , including these entitlements , and we need to take America in a new , stronger direction .
9:55 : Question about space exploration and Mars .
Huckabee says our lives have been greatly improved by the space program ( makes a joke about people being late to the debate because they do n’t have GPS ) , and says that Hillary Clinton should be on the first rocket to Mars .
Tancredo says we have been talking about spending all night , and that we ca n’t afford to go to Mars .
9:58 : Question about why black people do n’t vote Republican .
Giuliani says the party does n’t communicate well what it has to offer , as well as improving schools for them .
He says his efforts on welfare show how he can improve things for the African American community .
Huckabee says he does have the support of the black community , and that he got 84 % of the vote from them .
10:01 : Question about the Confederate flag and what it means .
Romney says that with the problems we have we should n’t waste our time on that , and that we face extraordinary challenges and should n’t be divisive like the Democrats .
It ’s a great answer .
Thompson says that people who fly that flag are not racists , but it has a racist connotation , and we do n’t need to go out of our way to bring up things like that .
10:04 : Question about investing in infrastructure in this country .
Giuliani says he did a good job investing in that as mayor , and that we need to make serious efforts at a sustained program over the next several generations .
Paul says we are building bridges overseas and not here , and we need to get out of other countries .
10:06 : McCain says he will use veto to oppose all pork barrell spending and takes a shot at Giuliani for fighting against the line item veto .
Giuliani demands the chance to respond , and gets it , and says that the line item veto is unconstitutional .
He also mentions that he beat Bill Clinton to do it .
10:08 : Question for Paul about his chances .
Paul mentions how much money he ’s made , and rants about his beliefs .
10:09 : Last question , for Giuliani about supporting the Red Sox .
Giuliani says he always roots for the American League team , and that the Yankees won when he was mayor .
Romney retorts that he is a Red Sox fan , and that he was proud when his team beat the Yankees in 2003 .
And that the end of the debate .
Giuliani was not perfect , but he did a good job holding as the front runner .
He was hurt early on but did solidly as the debate went on .
Romney attacked too much and looked desperate .
Huckabee won the debate , coming off as well - tempered and with well - developed viewpoints .
Thompson came off better prepared and sounded better than he has in the past .
McCain came off strongly , but not necessarilly enough .
Great debate , very exciting and a great look at the views .
CNN is saying that tonight was the first time any candidate made an attack ad , that being the Fred Thompson video showed midway through the debate .
All in all , a great two hours of TV , and covered enough bases to give anyone a good view of the field .
If you only watched one debate , this one was definitely the right one to watch .
Wait , So I ’m Not A Trained Server Technician ?
This site has been down for two days , which , you know , is always fun and profitable .
The reason ?
Me and GoDaddy came up with this wonderful sponsorship agreement , which would allow this site to move to a dedicated server and thusly be more stable and not ever go down for two days , as well as allowing me the flexibility to install lots of useful plugins I could n’t otherwise on a shared host .
Problem is , that did n’t work out so well .
Turns out running a server is hard
In the end , I ’m glad to say the problem was not my fault , I ’m just the one suffering for it .
Turns out that GoDaddy ’s default server provisioning enables a service called iptables , which manages a lot of NAT and firewall stuff on Linux , but installed it without enabling the ports for HTTP and FTP access ( which are kind of important ) .
Also , I have to change a setting in an “ A - Record ” , whatever the hell that is .
Anyway , I ’m going to re-attempts the server move this weekend .
Until then , enjoy some speedblogging .
Also , I ’m still looking for someone interested in helping me sell some ads for this site .
Traffic has been spiking like crazy , and on a 30 % commission , it ’s a nice way to make some side money .
If you ’re interested , just hit the contact form or comment on this post .
Google Prioritizes Sales Over Content Google has removed the Video link on its search results pages with one to Google Product Search , relegating the very useful Video link to the “ More ” menu .
The Video link is fourteen items down the More menu , making it a lot of work to reach .
Previously , on any Google search , you could hit Video to get results from dozens of popular and unpopular video sites , making it the easiest way to find video on the internet .
Now ?
Not so much .
Google seems to be prioritizing Product Search , with its huge links to Google Checkout , over Video , which is actually a very popular and fast growing segment of the internet .
It ’s a decision that , unless backed up by traffic number saying no one used the Video link , makes no sense and implies Google ignored the needs of its users over its need to sell stuff .
That ’s dissapointing .
I ’ve been trying to find a video card for my wife ’s computer all week , and Google has been no help .
Every search on a product name reveals site after site that is selling that product .
Why Google ca n’t do powerful integration with Product Search , and then remove the product results from the web results , I have no idea .
I could not find forums discussing my various technical issues , because Google listed site after site with the same useless sales information .
Google needs to do a non-commercial search engine .
They ’d be able to sell more ads , since the results would contain no stores , and users would finally have a way to get answers to their questions .
I posted my questions to my two blogs because Google was a waste of my time .
Three years ago , when I started doing this , Google was the place that indexed blogs and forums and ranked them high , now it ’s the place that ranks every outdated deal and online store above actual information .
Google ’s mission is to organize the world ’s information .
When it comes to searching for anything anyone is selling , there is n’t any information to be found .
