Let us add our voice to the chorus calling on Ford to bring the awesome Focus RS to America .
Julian Rendell of Autoweek flogged the 301 - horsepower hatchback hard and came away all but raving about it .
He calls it " a very special car " with " snarling performance " from a 2.5 - liter turbocharged four - banger five - cylinder propelling " a beautifully poised and compliant chassis . "
The car tops out at 163 mph yet is , according to Autocar , " civilized and well - mannered enough to live with every day . "
It 's 0 to 60 time of 5.9 seconds may not sound quick , but everyone who 's driven the RS says it is much faster than that number suggests and an absolute joy to drive .
" Remortgage the house , rob a bank , sell yourself , sell your own grandmother , just do whatever it takes to put an RS on your drive .
Because it really is one of those cars , " the magazine writes .
We have reason to be hopeful .
Motor Trend spotted an RS in suburban Detroit , and we think it looks hot in white .
Are you listening , Ford ?

The term ' dirty sanchez ' originated in the porn industry , particularly films involving ass - to - mouth ( atm ) action .
It describes the ( originally unintentional , i.e. blooper ) act of leaving a shit moustache on a partner 's face by taking your cock out of her ass and putting it in her mouth without wiping it off first .
The result is that as the dick is thrust between the lips , shit is scraped off and comes to rest on her upper lip in a moustache configuration .
Anyone who thinks it involves the deliberate wiping of shit with fingers on a partner 's face is a know - nothing fucktard .
A neo -Nazi group who adopted a half - mile section of highway in Springfield , Kansas last year may find their pure highway renamed after rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel .
Although lawmakers were not happy about the adoption , they had no choice but to accept the group 's application .
In 2005 the US Supreme Court ruled that a group can't be denied entry to the Adopt - A - Highway program because of its political beliefs .
The final solution for Kansas lawmakers seems to be renaming the highway .

Since its discovery just a few years ago , graphene has climbed to the top of the heap of new super - materials poised to transform the electronics and nanotechnology landscape .
As N.J. Tao , a researcher at the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University explains , this two dimensional honeycomb structure of carbon atoms is exceptionally strong and versatile .
Its unusual properties make it ideal for applications that are pushing the existing limits of microchips , chemical sensing instruments , biosensors , ultracapacitance devices , flexible displays and other innovations .
In the latest issue of Nature Nanotechnology Letters , Tao describes the first direct measurement of a fundamental property of graphene , known as quantum capacitance , using an electrochemical gate method .
A better understanding of this crucial variable should prove invaluable to other investigators participating in what amounts to a gold rush of graphene research .
Although theoretical work on single atomic layer graphene - like structures has been going on for decades , the discovery of real graphene came as a shock .
" When they found it was a stable material at room temperature , " Tao says , " everyone was surprised . "
As it happens , minute traces of graphene are shed whenever a pencil line is drawn , though producing a 2 - D sheet of the material has proven trickier .
Graphene is remarkable in terms of thinness and resiliency .
A one - atom thick graphene sheet sufficient in size to cover a football field , would weigh less than a gram .
It is also the strongest material in nature — roughly 200 times the strength of steel .
Most of the excitement however , has to do with the unusual electronic properties of the material .
N.J. Tao , director of the Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors at the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University has experimentally measured an important property of graphene -- a two - dimensional crystal lattice with broad potential for electronic applications .

Graphene displays outstanding electron transport , permitting electricity to flow rapidly and more or less unimpeded through the material .
In fact , electrons have been shown to behave as massless particles similar to photons , zipping across a graphene layer without scattering .
This property is critical for many device applications and has prompted speculation that graphene could eventually supplant silicon as the substance of choice for computer chips , offering the prospect of ultrafast computers operating at terahertz speeds , rocketing past current gigahertz chip technology .
Yet , despite encouraging progress , a thorough understanding of graphene 's electronic properties has remained elusive .
Tao stresses that quantum capacitance measurements are an essential part of this understanding .
Capacitance is a material 's ability to store energy .
In classical physics , capacitance is limited by the repulsion of like electrical charges , for example , electrons .
The more charge you put into a device , the more energy you have to expend to contain it , in order to overcome charge repulsion .
However , another kind of capacitance exists , and dominates overall capacitance in a two - dimensional material like graphene .
This quantum capacitance is the result of the Pauli exclusion principle , which states that two fermions — a class of common particles including protons , neutrons and electrons — cannot occupy the same location at the same time .
Once a quantum state is filled , subsequent fermions are forced to occupy successively higher energy states .
As Tao explains , " it 's just like in a building , where people are forced to go to the second floor once the first level is occupied . "
In the current study , two electrodes were attached to graphene , and a voltage applied across the material 's two - dimensional surface by means of a third , gate electrode .
Plots of voltage vs. capacitance can be seen in fig1 .
In Tao 's experiments , graphene 's ability to store charge according to the laws of quantum capacitance , were subjected to detailed measurement .
The results show that graphene 's capacitance is very small .
Further , the quantum capacitance of graphene did not precisely duplicate theoretical predictions for the behavior of ideal graphene .
This is due to the fact that charged impurities occur in experimental samples of graphene , which alter the behavior relative to what is expected according to theory .
Tao stresses the importance of these charged impurities and what they may mean for the development of graphene devices .
Such impurities were already known to affect electron mobility in graphene , though their effect on quantum capacitance has only now been revealed .
Low capacitance is particularly desirable for chemical sensing devices and biosensors as it produces a lower signal - to - noise ratio , providing for extremely fine - tuned resolution of chemical or biological agents .
Improvements to graphene will allow its electrical behavior to more closely approximate theory .
This can be accomplished by adding counter ions to balance the charges resulting from impurities , thereby further lowering capacitance .
The sensitivity of graphene 's single atomic layer geometry and low capacitance promise a significant boost for biosensor applications .
Such applications are a central topic of interest for Tao , who directs the Biodesign Institute 's Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors .
As Tao explains , any biological substance that interacts with graphene 's single atom surface layer can be detected , causing a huge change in the properties of the electrons .
One possible biosensor application under consideration would involve functionalizing graphene 's surface with antibodies , in order to precisely study their interaction with specific antigens .
Such graphene - based biosensors could detect individual binding events , given a suitable sample .
For other applications , adding impurities to graphene could raise overall interfacial capacitance .
Ultracapacitors made of graphene composites would be capable of storing much larger amounts of renewable energy from solar , wind or wave energy than current technologies permit .
Because of graphene 's planar geometry , it may be more compatible with conventional electronic devices than other materials , including the much - vaunted carbon nanotubes .
" You can imagine an atomic sheet , cut into different shapes to create different device properties , " Tao says .
Since the discovery of graphene , the hunt has been on for similar two - dimensional crystal lattices , though so far , graphene remains a precious oddity .
These are two plots of quantum capacitance as a function of potential .
In a ) various theoretical predictions of quantum capacitance are shown for graphene samples from pure , ( the bottom V - shaped plot ) to those above , indicating successively greater levels of impurity .
In b ) the red curve indicates theoretical prediction of quantum capacitance in graphene as a function of potential .
The blue line shows the closely matching results of experimental measurements .
Variations from theoretical ideal are the result of charged impurities in the graphene sample .

The standard government response to exigent circumstances takes one of two forms :
1 ) In order to prevent A , we must do A .
2 ) In order to accomplish B , we must do not -B .
Both responses are clearly contradictory , but go largely unchallenged .
The seeming presumption is that , faced with an emergency , humans reject their uniquely - defining morals , ethics , subjective values , and , especially , deductive reasoning .
Therefore , emergency government actions may also reject these human concepts and the contradictions become moot .
But , as these characteristics define a human and give his frail body a comparative advantage over the hostile environment of nature , the human response to emergency should be a magnification of the importance of these inputs to decision making , not rejection .
That is not to say that human reasoning is infallible and will always triumph against nature .
The curse of reason is that we are born with very little innate knowledge .
Without instruction or prior experience , a man 's wits are his only protection in an unfamiliar environment .
Also , charitably , humans are optimistic when it comes to judging risk and therefore tend to underestimate the benefits of emergency preparedness and planning .
The assumptions behind having government do anything in an emergency situation now lie naked before you :
A ) People who underestimate preparedness and planning elect people to appoint people to undertake emergency preparedness and planning .

B ) Those people do not underestimate preparedness and planning .
C ) In an emergency , those people will retain reasoning behavior while everyone else reverts to animalism .
D ) By virtue of their experience and instruction they have received , those people are qualified to supplant their morals , ethics , subjective values , and especially deductive reasoning for the unnamed populace .
No honest evaluation of assumptions A - C could possibly conclude that they could be true .
The idea that there exist among us superhuman beings and that , as if by magic , they are all currently appointed or elected government emergency planners is ludicrous .
However , a government emergency planner could be more experienced and / or learned in emergency planning and operations than , say , the owner of the corner gas station , so we must take a closer look at assumption D .
Imagine Government Emergency Evacuation Plan I , written , edited , vetted , and exercised in non-exigent circumstances .
The goals of Plan I would be continuity of government , protection of human life , and protection of property , in that order .
To those ends , Plan I would list the actions to be undertaken by various agencies and personnel upon plan activation .
As an emergency plan , Plan I would have , as one of its tenants , reliance on in - place stocks for initial operations .
As an evacuation plan , one of the in - place stocks necessary to execution would be fuel for evacuating vehicles .
Rather than stockpile millions of gallons of gasoline for every family truckster leaving the evacuation area , Plan I would , sensibly , rely on commercial gas stations and private stocks to fuel non-government vehicles .
Not surprisingly , with all the local families needing fuel for their minivans to leave the evacuation area , and fuel trucks prevented from entering the evacuation area , fuel is in high demand and supplies are limited .
The basic law of supply and demand predicts an increase in fuel prices , therefore , also unsurprising .
Invariably , government enacts response # 1 , preventing A by doing A .
To prevent Mr. Jones from undervaluing his dollars with respect to gasoline , in the name of preventing price gouging the government forces Mr. Smith to undervalue his gasoline with respect to dollars .
With no incentive for Mr. Jones to conservatively purchase fuel , and no incentive for Mr. Smith to sell gasoline that will cost him more to replace , government response # 1 guarantees a quick and lasting shortage of gasoline in the evacuation area .
By failing to properly account for the subjective valuations of Mr. Jones and Mr. Smith , Government Plan I fails in its reliance on in - place stocks .
This failure is evident at the moment government response # 1 is enacted .
Oh , but it 's worse than that .
As high demand and limited supply of gasoline are wholly unsurprising , Government Plan I likely includes , as one of its agency actions , government response # 1 as part of its reliance on in - place stocks .
In other words , to ensure the availability of gasoline , Plan I calls for an action ensuring a shortage of gasoline ( government response # 2 ) .
Our not - so - imaginary Government Evacuation Plan I , developed in non-exigent circumstances by our supposed learned and / or experienced government emergency planners , is a plan to fail * .
Since they cannot even plan reasonably , there is no reason to believe that , in an actual emergency , they will discover their senses and thus have some moral , ethical , reasoned superiority over other individuals responding to emergency conditions in their own way .

Would Viper pilots experience g- forces in space ?

Sci-fi TV show Battlestar Galactica has been much praised for its gritty realism – despite being the story of space - borne refugees fleeing genocidal robots .
Its treatment of subjects like suicide bombing and torture have won it plaudits from all corners ; its cast and creators were even invited to address the UN earlier this year .

But does the series “ do ” science as convincingly as it does politics ?
We spoke to Kevin Fong , lecturer in space medicine at University College London and a keen advocate of manned space travel , about the series ’ depiction of space travel and the challenges facing astronauts on long space journeys .
You ’re an expert on the effects of space travel on human physiology .
How plausibly was that portrayed in the show ?
The key thing that usually affects your health in space is microgravity .
That ’s because when you ’re weightless , your muscles waste away .
Your heart , which is a muscle pump , also atrophies to a degree .
But you get problems across the board , including some non-intuitive places .
For instance , you have problems with haematopoiesis – blood formation .
Astronauts have trouble forming red blood cells , and possibly some dysfunction in the white blood cells as well .
You also get some suppression of the immune system , but it ’s not clear whether that ’s due to stress or a direct effect of the microgravity .
You also get problems with hand - eye coordination .
You certainly would n’t be throwing Viper craft around the way they do [ in the film ] if you had the sort of impairments you see in shuttle crews .
For the first 48 hours or so , it ’s all that a lot of them can do not to throw up .
They ’re certainly not doing loop - the - loops .
Of course , none of that happens in Battlestar Galactica , because the ships have artificial gravity !
That ’s quite a common thing in science fiction TV , but it ’s never really explained …
In the real world , you have three ways to get gravity .
First , you can generate gravity by virtue of inertial mass , which means you have to take a planet with you , and obviously you ca n’t do that .
Second , you can do it by linear acceleration .
But that means that if you did a short journey , say from Earth to Mars , at one g , you ’d be travelling at a significant fraction of the speed of light by the time you got there .
Or , of course , you can do it rotationally , which is entirely possible : Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick realised that when they were making 2001 .
The idea of a rotating spaceship has been around since the dawn of rocketry – Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wrote about it in his 1920 book Beyond the Planet Earth .
Viper pilots in the series pull off a lot of high - speed manoeuvres that supposedly subject them to high g- forces .
Is that plausible ?
The problem with a lot of modern fighter aircraft is not the aircraft – it ’s the pilot .
If you ’re pulling a tight turn , there ’s enough centripetal acceleration to make the blood pool in your legs and cause you to pass out .
I remember going to a meeting once where somebody said that , by about the mid-2020s , fighter pilots would be redundant because of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) .
I can see the reasoning behind that .
That would also happen in space , albeit in a slightly different way , if you turned in a tight circle .
It ’s a necessary story construct to have people flying these vehicles , but you would think that , if they had that much technology , they would probably be able to get the things to fly themselves much more efficiently .
After all , electronic hardware today can withstand the sort of g- forces that you get when you smash into the surface of Mars after your parachutes have n’t worked very well .
Where do you think Galactica got the science right ?
I think that the science that drives it is n’t physics , astronomy or evolution : it ’s psychology , and I think the psychology ’s extremely accurate .
Consider “ 33 ” , the first proper episode of the show .
It ’s called that because the Cylons attack every 33 minutes for days on end , relentlessly – and the characters all fall apart in a very believable way .
What psychological problems do real astronauts face ?
People in the spaceflight community are very clear that we ca n’t do Battlestar Galactica - type missions where you put something the size of an aircraft carrier into space .
If we send a crew to Mars , it will be in something the size of a few caravans strapped together .
It would be a small crew living in cramped conditions in a fragile vehicle travelling through an exposed environment , with a persistent risk of death , for up to two - and - a - half years .
You could have problems with compatibility ; they might well fall out and have arguments .
There are recorded instances of astronauts having psychological problems like depression on missions .
There was a well - publicised case of an American astronaut who was arrested for allegedly attempting to murder a romantic rival .
It ’s not remarkable that things like this have happened .
Actually it ’s surprising that they have n’t happened more often .
These are , after all , normal people , living in extraordinary conditions .
So how do you deal with astronauts ’ health issues ?
The things that make healthcare difficult in space are power availability , the volume of equipment you can carry , and its weight ( because of the payload mass ) .
There ’s also an equipment problem .
Every kilogram you launch into low Earth orbit costs about $ 20,000 ; whereas , of course , the Galactica has a fully equipped sick bay and a more - or - less endless supply of energy .
A lot of the problems we have with current space travel are down to the lack of an expert doctor .
Astronauts get good paramedic training , but not an awful lot of it , and they then have to assume the doctor ’s role .
On Galactica they have several doctors , the main one being Doctor Cottle .
He ’s a fantastic character , endlessly toking away on a cigarette .
I always thought it was pretty funny that he smoked in sick bay
I thought that was really interesting as he ’s quite a dark character .
If you pasted him into episodes of M * A * S*H , he would n’t look out of place .
I ’m not sure whether he smoked because , due to advanced technology , he knew he was n’t genetically susceptible to lung cancer , or if he just thought “ we ’re all gonna die anyway , I might as well smoke ” .
In every episode , you saw the whiteboard showing the number of surviving humans , and the number generally went down .
The risk of premature mortality from smoking , when the Cylons can jump out of hyperspace and kill you within minutes , probably does n’t mean all that much .
So that ’s how I read him : he was quite nihilistic and thought they were all going to die .
Enlarge By Alex Wong , Getty Images Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor visits with Sen. Al Franken , D. Minn. , on Capitol Hill on Thursday .
WASHINGTON  Efforts to rivet the attention of the Hispanic community on Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor 's confirmation hearings next week could complicate Republicans ' political ambitions for next year .
The nation 's major Spanish - language television networks , Univision and Telemundo , plan beefed - up coverage of the Senate Judiciary Committee 's proceedings , which begin Monday .
And Latino activist groups are lobbying for confirmation of the nation 's first Hispanic justice .
All of that creates " a big problem " for Republicans who want to oppose Sotomayor , says Lionel Sosa , a marketing executive whose GOP clients have included former president George W. Bush and John McCain .
Sosa cautions
Republicans against opposing a wave of ethnic pride for the nominee : " If you are Latino , you are for Sotomayor . "
Hispanic voters have determined the winner in Florida elections since 2000 and in Nevada since 2004 , says Luis Fraga , director of the University of Washington 's Diversity Research Institute .
He credits divisive debates over immigration with turning Hispanics — who helped elect Bush — away from the GOP .
Republicans must defend Senate seats next year in three states that , according to 2008 Census Bureau estimates , have high percentages of Hispanics : Arizona ( 29.6 % ) , Utah ( 11.6 % ) and Florida ( 20.6 % ) .
In the past , Hispanics of Central American and Latin American origins might not have identified with Sotomayor because of her roots in Puerto Rico , Fraga says , but now they do .
" There is that pride that the nominee is a Latina , " says Estuardo Rodriguez , a director of Hispanics for a Fair Judiciary .
The coalition , which includes organizations such as the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the Mexican - American Legal Defense and Education Fund , is organizing events in states where the Hispanic population is high and the senators are n't committed to Sotomayor .
Where Sotomayor supporters see ethnic pride , some Republicans , such as Alabama Sen .
Jeff Sessions , suspect bias .
They point to conservatives who do n't like Sotomayor 's statement that a " wise Latina " might be better equipped to handle some cases than her white male colleagues , and a case where she sided with a majority of appellate court judges in tossing a Connecticut firefighters ' test that did not qualify any blacks and few Hispanics for promotion .
The Supreme Court reversed that ruling last month .
Sessions , the top- ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , expressed concern last month that Sotomayor 's " policy preferences could influence her decision - making . "
Sessions also is questioning Sotomayor 's 12 years as a director of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund , a group he calls " outside the mainstream . "
Texas Sen. John Cornyn , who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee , has publicly advised fellow Republicans to be cautious about how they criticize Sotomayor .
At least one prominent Judiciary Committee Republican , Sen. Lindsey Graham , is leaving the door open to backing Sotomayor .
" The only way she can get derailed is if she performs poorly next week , " Graham , who is up for re-election in South Carolina , told McClatchy newspapers .

OTTAWA
O n Parliament
Hill the sound of the recession ending is the same as a window closing .
If Mark Carney is right – and the Bank of Canada Governor has been wrong before about the early return of boom times – the Liberals missed the most promising opportunity to defeat the Conservatives in spring and are now under pressure to take their next best chance in the fall .
In hindsight , that Liberal moment came and went in late June .
With key advisers urging their new main man to seize the twin advantages of rising popularity and a sagging economy , Michael Ignatieff looked in the mirror and blinked .
After less than six months learning the leadership ropes , and with Conservatives negatively framing his public persona , Ignatieff was n't confident enough of his readiness to force an unpopular summer election .
Rather than roll the dice , he rolled over by cutting a transparently face - saving deal to keep Stephen Harper in power longer .
Controversial then , that decision is suddenly much more contentious today .
Carney 's prediction that growth will return this quarter is also a warning that fortune is again tilting towards the ruling party .
" Time for a change " loses much of its appeal when the times are already changing for the better .
Instead of blaming Conservatives for job losses , misjudging the deficit and mismanaging the economy , Liberals would have to fall back on the weaker , more nuanced and less evocative argument that it was the Official Opposition that forced a reluctant government to open the stimulus floodgates .
None of that would matter so much if Liberals had n't been overly confident Conservatives , with a lot of help from the recession , would defeat themselves .
Gripped by the same hubris that convinced the party it could afford Stéphane Dion , Liberals failed to give Canadians reasons to vote for Ignatieff , not simply against Harper .
Foolish as the failure to establish themselves as a compelling alternative now seems , lying low is appealing to Liberals still nursing bitter memories of what happened when Conservatives made Dion and his policies the ballot question .
But that does n't change the urgent new reality confronting the party .
Carney has indirectly started the clock ticking for an autumn campaign that Ignatieff and Liberals are still far from ready to contest .
It 's rare for any opposition party to be entirely prepared for an election .
Even so , Liberals are unusually , and dangerously , distanced from the starting blocks .
Ignatieff is still introducing himself to a skeptical electorate , a policy platform promised for spring remains a summer work in progress and there is a yawning vacancy in the leader 's office where there should be a tough , seasoned and confidence - inspiring strategist .
Liberals should take cold comfort from the historical footnote that the same sense of drift and ennui preceded the first of Jean Chrétien 's three majority victories .
In sharp contrast to the party 's current situation , Chrétien 's political instincts were honed , if not always perfectly sharp , the first and best of the Red Books provided solid platform planks and the supporting cast , including Eddie Goldenberg , Chaviva Hosek and John Rae , was shrewd , smart and focused .
Ignatieff may yet morph from public intellectual to prime minister .
Liberals may still find a purpose beyond the return to power .
Someone may be found to fill the strategic vacuum in the leader 's office .
But all of that must now happen at light speed and , if Carney is correct , without the ill wind of hard times at the party 's back .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Honda 's new hybrid- only Insight , touted as a low - cost competitor to the Toyota Prius was dealt a major blow Monday after it failed to get a thumbs up from the influential magazine Consumer Reports .
" The Insight is the most disappointing Honda Consumer Reports has tested in a long time , " said David Champion , director of the magazine 's auto test center .
The magazine roundly pans Honda 's ( HMC ) new hybrid car in its upcoming August issue , criticizing its ride quality , handling , interior noise , acceleration , and rear - seat access .
Champion called the car " noisy and stiff - riding , " in a statement released by the magazine .
Out of 22 currently available hatchbacks and small wagons the magazine has rated , the Insight ranks 21st .
The Insight scored 54 out of a possible 100 points in the magazine 's tests .
Therefore , Consumer Reports will not recommend the Insight based on the results .
The only car that ranked worse was the Dodge Caliber .
The Caliber scored 49 .
Honda defended its car 's performance .
" Initial feedback from most customers and automotive media regarding the all - new Honda Insight has been very positive , " said Honda spokesman Chris Naughton .
" In fact , the Insight has won several hybrid comparison tests completed independently by automotive media outlets , " Naughton said .
The Insight is a " mild hybrid , " unlike the slightly more expensive Toyota Prius against which it competes .
The Insight requires its gasoline engine to run most of the time , even at low speeds .
Consumer Reports recorded fuel economy of 38 mpg in its tests , a figure the magazine called " commendable . "
The Insight 's official EPA - rated fuel economy is 41 mpg in combined city and highway driving .
The Prius is Consumer Reports ' top-rated hybrid car and America 's top - selling hybrid vehicle by a wide margin .
The Prius was redesigned for the 2010 model year .
The 2009 Touring version earned 80 points in the magazine 's testing and was the highest - rated hybrid vehicle .
Consumer Reports rates vehicles using a series of standardized handling and performance tests performed at the magazine 's Connecticut test facility .
It also rates vehicles using more subjective measures like build quality and functionality .

Obama ’s castle - in - the - air , pie - in - the - sky , wish - upon - a - star health care would never , could never , and should never be appropriate for Americans .
As Dr. Seuss might put it , not in a hush , not in a rush ; not even if read ; not even if Red ! 
ObamaCare is doomed to fail and Congressional members who support it will be the next to go .
Leave .
Lose elections .
Be relegated to life again in the real world .
We frequently hear that Britons , Canadians , French , Swedes and others are often ill - served by their health systems .
I understand their concerns and their experiences because I , myself , lived under a national health program for a year and found the experience utterly awful .
Chances are that the care has grown far worse since I left it 32 years ago .
I was accepted into a masters program at the University of Manchester , England for the school year 1976 - 77 .
I sold my house , packed my bags , and went abroad . 
At that time I was a Teacher of the Deaf ; Manchester was the first university to ever train teachers of the deaf ; and I wanted to broaden my skill and knowledge base .
Included in the out - of - country tuition costs was health coverage through the National Health system in England .
I was relieved to learn that I had any kind of coverage at all , then thought no more about it .
A few weeks later my nonchalance would change .
During a trip to Edinburgh , Scotland , to attend the International Festival , I walked and rewalked the Royal Mile , putting far too much stress on my vehicle - spoiled joints .
Within a couple days of my return to Manchester , I was almost crippled and so went to hospital .
Once there , I was put into a waiting room that reminded me of a picture I had seen of suffering in mental hospitals , circa 1880 or so .
The room was about the size of a small town gymnasium , high ceiling as well , but cold and unappealing .
It was full — standing room only — of people with all kinds of emergency conditions waiting endlessly to be seen by a nurse , let alone a doctor .
After hours of painful standing , I decided to ask about the holdup and walked on through the treatment doors .
A nurse stopped my advance so I asked for either 1 ) a timely visit by a doctor or 2 ) the phone number for a doctor with a private practice .
I received neither .
The nurse shepherded me to a quiet corner where she advised me to be more patient .
She explained the costs I would face if I went elsewhere .
She at least found me a chair and I waited .
The local doctors ’ offices provided more shocking experiences .
The service was faster but the treatments were nonexistent — unless prescriptions were all that one wanted .
In fact , I do not recall ever leaving the office without a prescription , even when the decisions were highly suspect .
Pills were passed out like candy .
Public Pacifiers .
Appointments with a doctor were a hoot — once I learned the procedures .
The first visit , however , was shocking and confusing .
I had phoned to schedule an appointment then upon reporting in , I was given a 12 - inch colored piece of the material used for name signs in offices .
Mine happened to be red with a number cut out instead of a name .
Say 34 .
I went to the waiting room where I joined a large group of people , all of whom were staring at a large wooden board with about 6 colored lights on it .
I observed carefully so as to see what would be expected when my turn arrived .
A buzzer went off , the blue light began flashing , and someone stood to ask those around him if they had blue with a number lower than his own .
No one responded , so he left the room .
On it went with yellow , green , orange lights flashing but then the red light flashed .
Thus far , the herd had trained me well , so I stood and asked :  Does anyone have Red before number 34 ? 
No one did , so I left the room but that was as far as I had been trained .
Someone finally noticed my confusion and told me that I must go down a long hall and report to the .RED DOOR .
But of course !
Dr. Red Door .
Names were not important .
Just procedures .

Sightseeing is so much more fun when you can eat while you ’re doing it .
So in order to save you some time , and make sure you never have to stare at another car park while you enjoy your dinner , here ’s our guide to the world ’s most scenic dining experiences .
UNITED KINGDOM

Whilst partaking in a traditional English afternoon tea at the National Portrait Gallery , a sight across famous landmarks that is only surpassed by Lord Nelson ’s can be enjoyed .
Or if you prefer gawping from the south side , then the Tate Modern ’s seventh floor restaurant serves its seasonal menu , whilst a river view and St. Paul ’s Cathedral can be marveled at .

Anywhere that Prince Charles described as ‘ the highest slum in Wales ’ is well - worth checking out .
Surprisingly not swamped with gang - banging , pimpin ’ and thievin’ , but a recently revamped café in an unrivalled spot for gazing over Snowdon .
AMERICA

If the jetlag does n’t get you in a spin , this New York eatery certainly will as it , err , revolves .
High above Times Square .
The food is pretty damn fine too .
Whereas our next destination , The Stratosphere in Las Vegas , takes us to dizzy heights above the city though the quality of the dining sadly lags behind , remaining at ground level .
If you would like a taste of Paris , but do n’t have a passport , then amble over to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant .
You ’ll never know the difference .
( Ok , you will - but it sounds good ! ) .
Better news along the Californian coast as just outside San Francisco perched on the rocks of the Pacific coast is Cliff House , which has been serving up delightful dishes and mouth - watering views since 1863 .
And , over in Hawaii , the luxurious La Mer is the height of luxury with a Pacific panorama .
Book us a table , Danno ..

If you prefer your water cascading with violent beauty , as some people do , then there is the Watermark perched perfectly high above Niagara Falls .
AUSTRALIA
The view across the bay at Oskars restaurant
Now , not wanting to offend our Aussie friends , let ’s give some props to the Gold Coast hugging Oskars , where as the surfers negotiate the waves , diners negotiate the fresh and locally - sourced , seafood - packed menu and drift off as the sun sets and the moon rises across the ocean horizon .
JAPAN
Meanwhile , over in Japan , in the shadow of the stunning Mt. Fuji is this aptly named plush hotel offering an exquisite range of quality menus from French , traditional Japanese to a modern garden cafe as the lake and peaks lie gracefully in the background until the evening sky is consumed by starry nights .

An address of One Red Square tells you what you ’re going to be gawping at as you consume some Russian specialities in an area drenched in history .
As time is against us let ’s drop in to the glorious Lake Como area , where spoilt for choice we ’ll plump for the numerous options from street cafés to family run Trattoria available in the quaint , picturesque charm of Menaggio - which if given five minutes to describe it , I will end up fully - fledged member of Adjectives Anonymous .
EUROPE
( A view from Le Ciel de Paris , Nicole Chatelier © 2007 )
In the Eur district of Rome , make your way up to the Quattordicesimo Piano restaurant of the Il Fungo building and peruse the Italian Rationalism style architecture while eating some slightly pricey Italian food .
The final destination on this whistlestop tour is obvious , but essential .
Paris .
High above the city on the 56th floor of the Tour Montparnasse is Le Ciel de Paris , the astronomically highest dining point in Europe - with gastronomically high standards of cuisine too folks .
Phew , now on the short trip home I can consider all the ones I ’ve missed .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - The World Health Organization is poised to declare a global influenza pandemic after a spike in H1N1 cases in Australia , where five people have been admitted to intensive care and 1,263 cases of “ swine flu ” recorded .

The World Health Organisation is poised to declare a global influenza pandemic after a spike in H1N1 cases in Australia , where five people have been admitted to intensive care units and 1,263 cases of " swine flu " recorded .
The VIDRL is Melbourne 's largest public health reference laboratory with core responsibilities in virology and mycobacteriology .

Australian authorities on Thursday defended their handling of the flu virus , saying the high number of cases was a result of widespread testing .
“ We have tested 5,500 people in the last two weeks , that is more people than we test in our whole ( normal ) influenza season , ” said Victorian state premier John Brumby .
“ Elsewhere around the world , in the United States and Canada , they are only testing the most serious cases , ” said Brumby .
The WHO will hold an emergency meeting of experts on Thursday to discuss the spreading virus in a sign the U.N. agency may be poised to declare the first pandemic in more than 40 years .
There have been 27,737 cases reported in 74 countries to date , including 141 deaths , according to the WHO ’s latest tally .
PANDEMIC ALERT
Confirmed community spread in a second region beyond North America would trigger moving to phase 6 -- signifying a full - blown pandemic -- from the current phase 5 on the WHO ’s 6 - level pandemic alert scale .
“ We are pretty certain we are seeing that , ” Peter Cordingley , spokesman for WHO in the Western Pacific , told Australian radio .
Australia has the fifth - highest number of H1N1 flu cases worldwide , after the United States , Mexico , Canada and Chile .
Its first H1N1 case was announced on May 9 , with a woman in the tropical northern state of Queensland testing positive after returning from Los Angeles .
Australia ’s government has ordered 10 million doses of swine flu vaccine being developed by pharmaceutical company CSL Ltd .
The country has implemented standard health procedures to stop the spread of H1N1 , such as thermal scanning at airports , quarantining those diagnosed and issuing hygiene warnings .
But some health experts say Australian authorities have failed to control the spread of H1N1 due to a lack of co-ordination between national and state health officials .
“ The message given to people was that this was not a serious disease and people have not complied with quarantine guidelines .
People have gone to work sick .
People have not taken it seriously , ” James Schluter , a biochemist with law firm Holding Redlich , told Reuters .
Analytics company iStrategyLabs has examined the demographics stats from Facebook 's Social Ads platform , and they 've reached some very interesting conclusions .
Facebook 's userbase , as a whole , is getting much older very fast .
As you can see in the chart below , the overall number of users between 18 and 24 years of age has grown only 4.8 % between the fourth of January and the fourth of July of 2009 .
In comparison , the number of users aged 25 - 34 has grown 60.8 % ; the number of users aged 35 to 54 has grown 190.2 % , while the number of users older than 55 years has grown a tremendous 513.7 % .
If the iStrategyLabs numbers are correct , Facebook , simply put , is not a young site anymore .
Most of the users ( 20,3 million , or 28.2 % overall ) on the site belong to the 35 - 54 age group .
Compare that to the age group that was once Facebook 's bread and butter - the 18 - 24 group - which is now in third place with 18 million ( 25.1 % ) users , behind the 25 - 34 year old group , which makes for 25.2 % of Facebook 's user base with 18.1 million users .
The number of users aged 55 and over has grown from negligible 950,000 to 5.9 million in mere six months .
Now , although it may seem like the number of young users has declined , this is not true .
The overall number of users of all ages is growing .
But they are growing at very different speeds , and therefore the percentages have changed significantly ; on a site like Facebook , which lives on advertising , this is a big deal .
However , although the number of young users has increased , the number of high school and college students has declined by - 16.5 % and - 21.7 % , respectively .
This can indicate several things : first , that the data that iStrategyLabs is incorrect or very rough ( which is a possibility , since Facebook does n't guarantee that the data provided to advertisers is absolutely accurate ) ; secondly , it 's possible that Facebook users simply do n't think that their education , or the school / college they 're in are very important so they 're simply not entering the data .
It 's probably a little bit of both , but it 'll be interesting to see and compare Facebook 's own demographics data with these numbers .
In any case , these are significant changes .
If you show the same ads to Facebook users now , they will react vastly differently than they would have half a year ago .
If you 're an advertiser on Facebook , you should take these changes into account and react accordingly , because your campaign might not be as effective as it was a couple of months ago .

Editor 's note : Paul Begala , a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor , was a political consultant for Bill Clinton 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House .
For another view on taxes , read here
Paul Begala says April 15 is the one day the government asks us to sacrifice for the greater good .
( CNN ) -- Happy Patriots ' Day .
April 15 is the one day a year when our country asks something of us -- or at least the vast majority of us .
For those who wear a military uniform , those who serve the rest of us as policemen and firefighters and teachers and other public servants , every day is patriots ' day .
They work hard for our country ; many risk their lives -- and some lose their lives .
But for the rest of us , the civilian majority , our government asks very little .
Except for April 15 .
On this day , our government asks that we pay our fair share of taxes to keep our beloved country strong and safe .
Freedom is n't free .
That 's what the courageous World War II veterans of the American Legion taught me back in Texas Boys State decades ago .
That phrase had special meaning for them .
Those guys had seen buddies blown apart at Anzio or Guadalcanal .
I grew up in a different era .
There was no draft , and while I have friends and family members who joined the military , most of my peers , like me , opted for the security and prosperity of the private sector .
This country has showered me with the blessings of liberty .
So what do I owe my country in return ?
Paying my fair share of taxes , it seems , is the least I can do .
Thanks to President Obama and the Democratic Congress , 95 percent of Americans will get a tax cut this year .
No one -- not even the wealthiest 1 percent -- will have to pay higher income taxes until 2011 .
So why are a bunch of Fox News clowns and right - wing cranks hosting " tea parties " all over the country ?
The Boston Tea Party , in case the clods at Fox did n't know it , protested " taxation without representation . "
Note the second word : without .
The goofballs tossing tea bags today have representation .
They voted in the election ; they lost .
That a bunch of overpaid media millionaires would lead a faux - populist revolt is comical .
They somehow held their populist instincts in check as George W. Bush and the Republicans cut taxes on the idle rich and put the screws to the working stiffs .
Bush 's tax policies were a godsend to the Paris Hilton class , but they sent the country on the road to bankruptcy and helped ruin the economy .
But now that we the people have decided to set things right , now that we 've hired Obama to fix the mess conservatives created , now they 're protesting ?
Give me a break .
Instead of tossing tea bags for the cameras , the Fox phonies ought to go to Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
There they would find better , braver men who have truly sacrificed for their country .
They deserve nothing but the best -- not the shameful and shoddy conditions they endured during the Bush administration .
iReport.com : Share your thoughts on taxes and tea parties
You want something to protest ?
How 'bout protesting how little we give back to our veterans ?
Or how 'bout protesting that the entire budget of the National Cancer Institute ( where government researchers battle a disease that will strike half of all men and a third of all women ) is 0.03 percent of what we gave the bandits at American International Group alone ?
Oh , but veterans benefits and cancer research might cost money .
It might require -- dare I say it ? -- paying taxes .
If the whiners at Fox News want to advertise their selfishness , they are free to do so .
But please do n't dress it up as patriotism .
Patriotism is putting your country ahead of yourself -- which is the precise opposite of what the tea party plutocrats are doing .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala .

Inconclusive news from the internet filtering trials might turn out to be bad news for the anti-censorship lobby in Australia .
The Australian Government ’s refusal to explain what exactly would count as a bad result for internet filtering adds to the sense that it will be ploughing on with this regardless .
First the bad news .
Initial testing of the Australian government 's internet filtering system is being reported as having " gone off fairly well " .
Five out of nine ISPs that tested the filtering system - iPrimus , Netforce , Webshield , Nelson Bay Online and OMNIconnect - said they had encountered minimal speed disruptions and few technology problems during the testing phase .
Tech2U and Highway1 have yet to conclude testing , and the two remaining ISPs - Unwired and Optus - would not comment .
Overall , the results may turn out to be something of a mixed bag .
At Nelson Bay Online only 15 users , or one per cent of the customer base , are said to have participated .
At another ISP , there were complaints that a perfectly legal porn site had been blocked .
CEO of iPrimus Australia Ravi Bhatia said : " The users have not experienced any problems , they have n’t experienced any service degradation so it ’s been a pretty good experience . "
Noting that the test had had no impact on speed , Webshield managing director , Anthony Pillion , added : " From a technical perspective we ’re more than confident that if the government decided to roll out a mandatory Internet filter based on or around an Australian Communications and Media Authority [ ACMA ] blacklist or subset thereof , then it can be done without any impact whatsoever to the speed of the Internet . "
The real issue with this outcome is that the results do n’t settle matters one way or the other .
They are good enough to reassure the government that the filtering approach might not be as impossible as critics have maintained .
However , as two of the nation 's largest ISPs - Telstra and InterNode – remained steadfastly aloof from the testing procedure – these results are in respect of a very small sub -set of individuals indeed , and may not generalise out to the broader internet experience .
Despite this , as anti-censorship website somebodythinkofthechildren points out , the argument must now move on from the purely technical .
The problem is that the government does not wish to be drawn on what constitutes success or failure , either for the trial , or for filtering itself , as the following exchange with Triple J reporter Kate O’Toole back in April of this year makes clear .
Talking to Senator Stephen Conroy , the architect of the filtering scheme , on Triple J radio ’s Hack programme , Kate O’Toole suggested : " Before you start the trial you ’ve got to have an understanding of what is , what ’s a pass and a fail , like you ’ve got to be able to measure … you ca n’t sort of wait until the trial finishes and then look back and decide how you ’re going to measure the outcome . "
Conroy ’s response provided an interesting insight into the governmental approach to research .
He said : " Well actually that ’s how you conduct a trial .
You wait to see what the result is and then you make a decision based on the result .
" If the trial shows it can not be done without slowing the internet down , then we will not do it .
But if the trial comes back and says it can be done , then we will go down the path of blocking the RC , and we will look at how it ’s possible for parents to be given a choice , a menu of options , that they can block their children from accessing . "
The debate continued :
Ms O’Toole : " So do you have a rate of over - blocking in mind that would be unacceptable ? "
Senator Conroy : " Well as I ’ve said , let ’s wait to see what the trial shows us . "
Ms O’Toole : " And then you ’ll put the goal posts up afterwards ? "
Senator Conroy : " As I said , you want to pre-empt the trial , then we ’re happy to wait to see what the trial comes back to us with .
Perfectly happy . "
This is research – but perhaps not as most researchers know it . ®

Superman and Wonder Woman among those who will appear in new collaboration with Teshkeel Comics in Kuwait
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday 10 July 2009
In the article below , we said that while the Islamic superheroes were sometimes shown praying or reading the Qur'an , these comics aimed to appeal to children of all faiths .
In fact , for that reason , there is no praying or reading of religious texts in this series of comics .
They are superheroes battling injustice and fighting evil the Islamic way , and they are teaming up with some of the west 's biggest comic book icons .
Superman , Batman and Wonder Woman are among those joining forces with The 99 , who personify the 99 attributes of Allah , according to Islamic tradition .
What will unfold on the pages of the collaboration between DC Comics in the US and Teshkeel Comics in Kuwait is yet to be seen , but the appearance of The 99 – who already appear in comics in the Muslim world – alongside archetypal American heroes would have been unlikely during the Bush years .
DC Comics ' president and publisher , Paul Levitz , believes the cross-cultural project is unprecedented .
He said : " It is a long - standing tradition for characters to meet others in the fictional world , and over the years a lot of the superheroes have been translated into Arabic , taking on ethnic elements .
But this is a nice step forward .
The most difficult creative test is when you are working with the least precedent and when you 're trying to reach an audience that has a different cultural bias and different interests . "
The mini-series will hit shops within a year , with links between the publishing firms easing the creative process .
Comic book aficionados have mainly responded positively to the news , although questions have been raised about how Wonder Woman 's skimpy costume will fare in the Middle East .
One fan writes : " Maybe they can colour her differently in other markets so it looks like she is wearing a bodysuit .
It would be cool if there was a line about Wonder Woman choosing to cover up out of respect for where she 's going since she was an ambassador ( I doubt they would have her take the more radical decision and not cover up as a feminist move ) . "
A few accuse DC Comics of betraying the US : " Muslim - pandering , anyone ?
Thank you , Time Warner , for showing us whose side you 're on .
I guess we can add you to the list of traitorous companies who have forgotten 9/11 . "
Unlike their western counterparts
The 99 do not wear disguises , unless you count the burka - wearing Batina The Hidden , nor are they outsiders with secret identities .
They are ordinary people who develop extraordinary abilities after coming into contact with mystical gems infused with power and wisdom .
Only Batina , one of five females , is fully veiled , and although characters pray or read the Qur'an , they are meant to appeal to children of all faiths .
The team behind The 99 includes comic book stalwarts Fabian Nicieza , Stuart Moore , June Brigman , Dan Panosian , and John McCrea , who have all worked at DC Comics and Marvel .
The 99 comics , which sell about 1 m copies a year , enjoy a high profile in the Middle East .
The adventures are to be made into an animated film , while the first of several 99 - inspired theme parks has opened in Kuwait .
The creator of The 99 and founder of Teshkeel Media , Dr Naif Al - Mutawa , a psychologist by day , hopes his comics help dialogue and co-operation .
Like Levitz , he is unsure of how the story will develop .
" Are we going to have them working together from day one , or will they think the other is the enemy ?
Enemy number one is fear .
You could open it with Obama 's speech [ in Cairo ] with the two sets of superheroes watching it and having different reactions .
There 's plenty of possibilities . "
About 23 heroes have been launched and there are more to come .
Mutawa said : " We 're building the brand slowly .
" It 's difficult to have any kind of reading or comic book culture here because there is a lot of stuff that does n't come in or it 's censored .
Certain storylines do n't work and some stuff , like magic , just is n't allowed . "
Horoscopes are popular with people throughout the world .
While most people are familiar with western astrology and with the Chinese zodiac , much less is known about the ‘ Molluskan Zodiac ’ ( sometimes known as the mariners zodiac ) .
But ask any fisherman , and they will tell you instantly which of the ten signs of the molluskan zodiac they were born under .
The zodiac has its origins in the many superstitions that sailors believe in .
Throughout history sea-goers have attached special significance to many of the creatures that are found throughout the world ’s oceans .
The Molluskan Zodiac was born out of the belief that certain mollusks are watching over sailors and can influence their fate .
The dates of the molluskan zodiac are connected to important fishing dates throughout the year .
It is the dangers of fishing in stormy winter seas that gave rise to the phrase “ I ’d rather be a clam than a barnacle ” .
If you like astrology , and if you like mollusks , then the molluskan zodiac may be just what you need .
New horoscopes are added weekly .
Paddy posted about The Tee Shirt , expecting that something like this would happen :
" A typical street whore . " " A bunch of ghetto thugs . " " Ghetto street trash . " " Wonder when she will get her first abortion . "
There they are , folks .
The Family Values Crowd .
See how they value other people 's families ?
These are a small selection of some of the racially - charged comments posted to the conservative ' Free Republic ' blog Thursday , aimed at U.S. President Barack Obama 's 11 - year - old daughter Malia after she was photographed wearing a t - shirt with a peace sign on the front .
A... peace sign ?
A peace sign ?!
Really ?
No more killing ?
What was she thinking ?
These would have obviously been so much more acceptable :
The thread was accompanied by a photo of Michelle Obama speaking to Malia that featured the caption , " To entertain her daughter , Michelle Obama loves to make monkey sounds . "
Though this may sound like the sort of thing one might read on an Aryan Nation or white power website , they actually appeared on what is commonly considered one of the prime online locations for U.S. Conservative grassroots political discussion and organizing [...]
Moderators of the blog left the comments - and commenters - in place until a complaint was lodged by a writer doing research on the conservative movement , almost a full day later .
I 'm sure it was just an oversight .
No , wait .
Freepers do n't believe in oversight .
" Could you imagine what world leaders must be thinking seeing this kind of street trash and that we paid for this kind of street ghetto trash to go over there ? " wrote one commenter .
" They make me sick ....
The whole family ... mammy , pappy , the free loadin ' mammy - in - law , the misguided chillin ' , and especially ' lil cuz ...
This is not the America I want representin ' my peeps , " wrote another .
How American of them .
How inclusive and Big Tenty .
Why , I bet their next convention will have at least two African Americans ... if the Tee Vee camera can find / train on them long enough before the planted " ghetto thugs " slip out the back door to collect their paychecks .
The Extras Union is fussy that way .
Now take a deep breath , because you 'll need oxygen after you read the next part .
Check out the Freeps ' " disclaimer " , and then take in how well the Commenters abided by the rules :
A note on the front of the blog reads , " Free Republic does not advocate or condone racism , violence , rebellion , secession , or an overthrow of the government , " but one comment on the thread read , " This disgusting display makes me more and more eager for the revolution , " while another read , " I never actually wnated [ sic ] to be a pistol before but ... "
Ahh , the inevitable mention of guns .
We all knew they 'd make an appearance .
There 's that Very Special violent streak we all know and abhor .
After attention from other blogs , the thread was suppressed and placed under review , but before long it was returned to the site intact , and attracted a new series of racial slurs when the original complaint email was posted publicly to the site , with the sender 's email address intact .
But there 's always that one deeply sensitive soul , in this case the Creepy Freepy Leader , whose wisdom is passed down to his Fellow Freepers :
" The writer has a point , " wrote site owner Jim Thompson sarcastically .
"
We should steer clear of Obama 's children .
They can't help it if their old man is an American - hating Marxist pig . "
His kindly influence was felt instantly .
Why , just look at the resulting , er , empathy :
" I agree Jim , " wrote commenter , by the nickname NoobRep .
" The kids did n't pick their commie pinko pansy of a father .
Nor did they choose to be put into the spotlight .
But Obama / Soetoro is fair game and so is his witch of a wife . "
" Poor kids .
I hope they 're not ' punished with a baby ' , " wrote another .
" Hopefully they wo n't deal cocaine like the Kenyan . "
" DIRTBAGS !
All of them .
Our [ White House ] is now a joke to the rest of the world .
We have no respect and this is not going to turn out well , mark my words .
We will be hit , and much worse than last time .
We are now seen as weak and vulnerable .
Ghetto and Chicago thugs have taken over . "
And then they all donned their fishing waders , joined hands in a show of unity , and dove back into the cesspool from which they originally oozed .

Apple released the iPhone 3G on July 11th , 2008 , which gives you early adopters just a few weeks before your one - year warranty runs out .
What does this mean ?
It means you should give your iPhone a good hard look to determine if it ’s in your best interest to take your iPhone to your local Apple Store to try to obtain a replacement .
There are at least 18 well - known defects with the iPhone , all of which oblige Apple to replace the handset for free .
All are detailed are over the next few pages , including ways to test your iPhone to make sure everything is functioning properly .
Issues that Apple considers grounds for replacement include hairline cracks , discolored screens , dead pixels , flakey WiFi , dodgy GPS and crackly speakers .
If your precious iPhone is suffering from any of these problems , read on to make sure you ’re properly prepared before you head down to your local Apple store and get a replacement .
Hurry , before it ’s too late .
The purposes of this article are twofold : to help the average iPhone owner decide whether or not to seek a replacement iPhone pursuant to Apple ’s 1 - year warranty ; and , to prepare the average iPhone user for the process of replacing his or her iPhone .
Should You Replace Your Old iPhone ?
There are three main questions you should answer before bringing your iPhone to a Genius .
First , does your iPhone have a problem caused by a legitimate defect ?
Second , is your iPhone still covered by its warranty ?
( July 10 is the last day if you purchased your iPhone on July 11th , 2008 ) .
Third , do you really want to replace your iPhone ?
Ultimately the decision is yours to make and should be made honestly — it is not in your best interest to try to obtain a new iPhone based on false pretenses .
The bottom line : if you genuinely believe your iPhone is defective , it is your right to demand that Apple repair or replace it pursuant to its 1 - year warranty .
Let ’s discuss .
Turning your problem into a defect .
Take a close look at your iPhone .
Get out a magnifying glass if necessary .
It does not matter how insignificant the problem may seem .
For this article , a “ problem ” refers to any imperfection in your iPhone .
If you want to exchange your iPhone , you will need to show that your problem is also a defect .
A “ defect ” refers to any physical flaw that is not attributable to the iPhone owner ’s fault or negligence .
That is , a defect is a problem with the iPhone that is wholly attributable to either a flaw in the iPhone ’s design or an imperfect manufacturing process .
Hardware problems are by far the easiest to claim to be a defect .
This is the case because , absent blatant evidence of abuse like water damage or trauma , it is simply not feasible to open an iPhone up and diagnose each and every one of its many parts .
That is , the Genius will usually just give you a new iPhone .
The next thing to do is to prepare to for a trip to your local Apple Store .
For previous generations , the question : “ Where were you when Kennedy was shot ” has served as a conversation starter as well as a catalyst for exploration of a shared history .
It would seem that the quintessential question will soon be : “ where were you when you found out Michael Jackson was dead ? ” ?
For the record , I was at the gym .
Credulous , I trusted that the Jackson story would get a few minutes of coverage before Bret Baier returned .
My jejune confidence that Charles Krauthammer would momentarily be providing commentary about actual news was hastily crushed .
Abstrusely , Fox News brought Shepard Smith in to cover this astounding turn of events .
You know what would be really shocking ?
Michael Jackson dying at the age of 87 .
That would have been a real stunner , well deserving of the nauseating nonstop narration that should be reserved for heads of state .
Time really stands still on the treadmill when you are listening to a fervid Geraldo lamenting Anna Nicole Jackson ’s “ shocking ” death .
All other news of the day having been declared inconsequential , Fox proceeded to indulge in unnecessary and disproportionate keening about the calamitous death of the world ’s most famous pedophile .
The same Michael Jackson who once told a reporter it was “ sweet ” and “ charming ” to sleep with little boys and ply them with “ Jesus Juice ” ( known to lucid people as “ wine ” ) has been deified .
Jackson , who dangled one of his babies off of a hotel balcony also obtained those children via a bizarre and labyrinthine arrangement , named one of them Blanket and made them wear burkas .
Jackson is exceedingly popular in the United Kingdom , confirming Mark Steyn ’s reflection that the United Kingdom is further along than the United States in the march toward complete social and economic collapse .
But not to worry , we wo n’t quit until we ’re Number One .
Michael Jackson recently converted to Islam .
Michael ’s brother , Jermaine , converted to Islam in 1989 .
Even the Religion of Peace failed to deliver true bliss .
Americans know far more about Michael Jackson than they do about the history of Iran and its relationship to the United States .
Most of what America knows is wrong , having been subjected to pertinacious propaganda in Ayers ’ based public education .
Which is why the interest in the life and death of Neda Agah - Soltan was so facilely dwarfed by the opulent freak show that surrounds Michael Jackson .
Neda was the beautiful young Iranian woman who was gunned down in the streets of Tehran for the crime of showing up .
She showed up to take a stand for freedom and took a bullet in the neck for her aspirations .
A relative in the United States had cautioned Neda not to attend any demonstrations , telling her “ They ’re killing people . ”
To which the lionhearted and prescient Neda replied : “ Do n’t worry , it ’s just one bullet and its over . ”
For just a flicker in time , Neda became an icon , a symbol of the young Iranians ’ longing for the most elemental liberties .
It was easy for Americans to be incensed at the barbarous slaughter of a young woman so lovely and earnest .
Young Iran has caught a glimpse of freedom , the inescapable byproduct of advancing technology .
The noteworthiness of Neda is in no small measure due to the ease with which young Americans can appreciate her as not so unlike themselves .
Part of the delusive indoctrination that goes on in public schools includes the rewriting of Iranian history in a way that abets the left .
In actuality , before the Jimmy Carter regime , the United States and Iran were on friendly terms .
The Shah of Iran was the least backward of all Muslim leaders .
The shah , who is erroneously characterized as a villain , was responsible for giving women the right to vote .
In other Arab states , they still do n’t have the right to leave the house without a husband or other male relative .
Unimaginable though it may be post - Carter , Iran and Israel were not always bitter enemies .
The current government of Iran is as much an enemy of the Iranian people as it is of Israel .
Iranians are understandably horrified by the new American president who has referred to the Ayatollah as Supreme Leader , a show of respect for the legitimacy of the barbaric regime .
Barack Obama went so far as to send a letter to the Ayatollah Khamenei weeks before Iran ’s June 12th election .
Obama was pandering to the brutal , backwards and oppressive Iranian leadership .
Back when the news still took the trouble to cover the bloodbath in Iran , the world saw young Iranians holding signs in English .
Urgent pleas were coming through computers worldwide begging the leader of the free world to help the Iranian people .
Many Americans would be amazed to learn how many Iranians were educated via petrodollars in the United Kingdom or the United States .
Some Iranian young people speak far better English than your local high school kids .
The late shah ’s son reached out to Obama for support :
“ I would like to take this opportunity and tell the President this is a crucial moment - on behalf of my compatriots and millions who have been turning to the outside world , particularly to this President - to say : do n’t let us down . ”
While Barack Obama was eating ice cream , Neda ’s parents were forced from their home by government agents .
Public displays of mourning were shut down .
Nineteen year old Kaveh Alipour was gunned down by government barbarians .
After frantically searching for news about his missing son at hospitals and eventually the morgue , Alipour ’s father was told he would be required to pay a $ 3000 “ bullet fee ” to reimburse the government for the ammo expended in executing his child .
Barack Obama did eventually deliver the obligatory “ we are outraged ” statement .
He held off as long as he could , until public opinion became too clamorous to overlook .
While he gabbled , the violence in Iran escalated .
Iranian citizens were being massacred in the streets with axes and machetes .
Students were being routed from their beds in their dorm rooms .
Ronald Reagan responded to a similar cry for help from the people of Poland who were then enslaved by the Soviet Union .
Reagan minced no words in decrying the Soviet Union as an “ Evil Empire ” .
He never expelled gibberish about how the United States should n’t “ meddle ” as innocent citizens suffer .
Then , as today , pantywaist liberals were caterwauling about toning down the rhetoric so as not to pique oppressive dictators .
Thankfully , Reagan ignored such nattering .
The Poles were doing what the Iranians are today : insisting on the most basic of human liberties .
Ronald Reagan had no intention of sitting on the sidelines waiting to see how this thing played out :
“ In a stiff note to Soviet boss Leonid Brezhnev ; Reagan said that if the Russians kept up their thuggish response to Poland they ‘ could forget any new nuclear arms agreement . ’
Gone too would be better trade relations , and in their place would be the ‘ harshest possible economic sanctions ’ if they even thought of invading Poland as they had done with Czechoslovakia in 1968 or Hungary in 1956 . ”
The Soviets responded by declaring martial law and shutting down the Polish borders , as well as squelching communications with the outside world .
Reagan was unflinching .
He wrote in his diary :
“ I took a stand that this may be the last chance in our lifetime to see a change in the Soviet Empire ’s colonial policy re Eastern Europe .
We should take a stand and tell them unless and until martial law is lifted in Poland , the prisoners were released and negotiations resumed between Walesa and the Polish government , we would quarantine the Soviets and Poland with no trade or communications across their borders .
Also tell our NATO allies and others to join us in such sanctions or risk an estrangement from us .
A TV speech is in the works . “
Reagan helped spirit the defecting Polish Ambassador out of the country and to the United States .
Leonid Brezhnev was livid .
Reagan was delighted ; Brezhnev ’s outrage confirmed to Reagan that he was on the right track .
Ronald Reagan went on to use every tool at his disposal to topple Brezhnev ’s regime and replace him with Lech Walesa .
Ronald Reagan won the battle to liberate the Polish people .
They have not forgotten .
He is considered , in the words of the Polish president , the “ architect of democracy . ”
Barack Obama is certainly no Ronald Reagan .
The entire world , including the United States would be better off and more secure if the Ayatollah ’s government toppled .
The death of a pedophile has created a distraction from having to deal with the knotty problem of full scale slaughter in the streets of Iran .
An open source software project got some good news this week , as a judge dismissed a suit brought by the maker of a commercial alternative .
Thomson Reuters , which makes EndNote , an academic reference management product , had filed suit against George Mason University , claiming that its support of the open source Zotero project , which imports EndNote files , was in contravention of the university 's license to EndNote .
The suit , which requested an injunction against the distribution of Zotero , has now been dismissed .
Depending on whether Thomson Reuters appeals or refiles the suit , this may leave Zotero in the clear .
Academic reference managers , which allow their users to keep track of the publications that they cite when writing up their own research , are a fairly specialized market .
EndNote has a number of features that make it a compelling option , including a series of filters for online search queries and tight integration with document preparation software , notably Microsoft Word .
It also offers one of the few cross-platform options on the market , and has a large library of reference styles to match the formats used by different journals .
But there is also a degree of product lock - in , as many researchers have built up libraries of thousands of references over the years .
Zotero undoubtedly looks a bit threatening to Thomson Reuters , as it has a number of these features .
It operates as a browser plug - in , which allows it to cross platforms easily and integrate well with online searches ; it is also able to import EndNote reference databases .
But the key feature that got it into legal trouble was the fact that it was able to import and use EndNote reference style files .
As it turns out , that last feature is what got George Mason University in hot water .
GMU supports the development of Zotero but , until recently , it had a site license to the EndNote software .
That license contains clauses that prohibit the reverse - engineering of the software or creation of derivative works .
Since Zotero reads EndNote files , the suit accused GMU of violating this license .
The case could have addressed some interesting questions , such as the degree to which duplicating functionality falls under the definition of reverse engineering , and whether a file - format translator is a derivative work , as well as whether it 's legally permissible to prohibit either of these .
Zotero also serves what is primarily an educational audience , and educational purposes have a fair use exception in many cases .
But , the suit 's quick dismissal suggests that none of these issues are likely to be aired in a courtroom , at least as a result of this case .
That said , neither of the parties to the case , Thomson Reuters and GMU , have been willing to make official statements about the decision as of when we prepared this report .
The dismissal was first reported on the blog of one of Zotero 's directors ( I 'll digress to note that the blog is named The Quintessence Of Ham ) , but the author indicates that he does n't expect to have details on the decision until some time next week .
The relevant court does n't post information on these matters , and was unable to supply us with details .
One of the people we contacted suggested it may have been dismissed simply on procedural grounds , but we have been unable to confirm this .
The Zotero blog post does , however , note that the suit has n't slowed down Zotero development in the slightest , as a number of major features have been added in the nine months since it was filed .
A number of these features seem compelling enough that they might induce some users to switch even in the absence of an EndNote import function .

LOS ANGELES  Michael Jackson ’s mother was granted temporary guardianship of his three children by a Los Angeles judge on Monday , and a hearing on permanent custody was scheduled for next week .
Mr. Jackson ’s mother , Katherine Jackson , 79 , also petitioned to be named administrator of his estate , and a hearing on that matter was set for August .
Shortly afterward , Mr. Jackson ’s father , Joe , held a disjointed news conference in front of the family ’s San Fernando Valley home , during which he veered among his central topic , his plans for his new record company ; his grandchildren , who he said were “ happy ” ; and the private autopsy on his son , which the family ordered after findings of a county autopsy last Friday proved inconclusive pending the results of toxicology tests .
Mr. Jackson said that there would be no funeral until the outcome of the private autopsy , whose results , he said , he expects shortly , and that the family was unprepared to say more about the arrangements .
I 'm still here at the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) 2010 , and just had the chance to try out something cool .
The Intel Atom processors are lightweight x86 processors for use in a whole range of small devices .
And being x86 - based , they can run modern desktop operating sytesms .
At the beginning of 2010 , Intel released the n450 version of the Atom .
And to help engineers and hobbyists get started , they 've created a " development board " which is a small circuit board containing an Atom processor , 1G of SO - DIMM memory , and several ports including USB 2.0 ports , a video port , and two ethernet ports .
Optionally , you can get the board inside a handy , durable plastic case .
What 's the point of this ?
To experiment building your own Atom - based devices .
Here at IDF , they had a hands - on lab where you get to play with it .
When I think back to my college days in the late 1980s , I was originally going into computer hardware engineering , not programming .
And we were working with all sorts of devices and chips and circuit boards .
But to build our own computer - powered devices required huge amounts of work that probably included burning yourself with a soldering iron .
Getting software onto the device was practically an afterthought ( assuming you had any hair left on your head after building your device ) .
But now the line has blurred between hardware and software engineer .
Much of the computer itself is already built for you and lives inside the Atom chip itself .
So here in one of the sessions , they had these development boards laid out for us , and we were presented with a challenge : Install an operating system on it .
These boards had a keyboard and monitor plugged into the aforementioned ports , and had a small hard drive also plugged into them .
We had a choice of several operating systems , including Google Android , Ubuntu , and MeeGo .
And the way you install the operating system is start with a laptop computer to download the binary image , copy the image to a USB drive , plug the USB drive into the development board 's USB port , and turn the thing on .
Now if you 've installed an OS on a regular computer , the next steps will sound very familiar .
Boot the development board to the BIOS , select the bootup device ( in this case the USB drive ) , and run the installer that 's on the USB drive .
I chose the Google Android operating system .
I downloaded the files , copied them to the USB drive , plugged it into the board , booted the board , and away it went .
It booted off the USB drive and ran the Android installer .
The installer did its thing , installing Android onto the hard drive .
When that was done , I rebooted the device , and it started up .
In other words , it really no different from installing a new operating systsem on any other computer .
But in this case the " computer " is this tiny little board that can be used as the basis for some really cool products that we 've been seeing here , including netbooks , smart TVs , or even high - tech motorcycles .
Now in the case of , say , a smart motorcyle , you would also have to include data acquisition hardware that would monitor the parts of the motorcyle .
So you 're not totally off the hook for building hardware .
But if you were to build , say , a smart TV , you 'll need to also develop ( or acquire ) some software for displaying TV shows .
But wait !
Windows already has that built in with its media center .
So you could have one of these Atom boards running Windows , and attach the board to a huge monitor ( which is really what today 's TVs are ) and plug anything else into the USB ports , such as a keyboard or some other kind of controller .
Here at IDF they have several such smart TVs on display .
Of course , these are n't just hacked together with a development board and a monitor .
Instead , in many cases , it 's just a little box with an Atom processor in it and the necessary software , and you plug it into your own TV ( and your own stereo system , and your own network ) .
BUT -- the basic architecture is much like what I just described .
( And many of these TVs have their own software , instead of the basic Windows Media Center . )
In the past it would have been overkill to embed a full x86 - based processor inside , say , a TV , along with a hard drive and full operating system .
( " Oops , Windows crashed ; time to reboot the refrigerator . " )
But now that we have inexpensive hardware like hard drives and Atom processors , and powerful operating systems , why the heck not ?
Add to that modern lightweight operating systems like MeeGo and you 're really onto something .
There are some seriously cool things here , and Smart TVs are among them .
And I imagine it wo n't be long before you own at least something that has an Intel processor ( and fulll operating system ! ) inside it .
Maybe a smart TV , maybe a netbook , or even a high - tech motorcycle .
Want to get your hands on one of these development boards ?
They 're $ 149 without the case .
( They 'll announce the pricing on cases later , but they Intel guy said he thought they 'd only be around $ 10 or so . )

The same blue food dye that gives your Gatorade its turquoise tint and turns your tongue a peculiar shade of purple might also protect your nerves in the case of spinal cord injury .
By lucky accident , researchers discovered that the commonly used food additive FD&C blue dye No. 1 is remarkably similar to a lab compound that blocks a key step in nerve inflammation .
When rats with spinal cord injury were given an infusion of blue dye , they recovered much faster than rats that did n't get the treatment .
And researchers reported only one adverse effect :
The rats turned blue .
" One of the reasons no one had done this before is that food science is very separate from neuroscience , " said neuroscientist Maiken Nedergaard of the University of Rochester Medical Center , who co-authored the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science .
" Those two fields do n’t interact at all . "
Approximately 12,000 people suffer spinal cord injuries each year in the United States , mostly in car accidents or catastrophic falls .
After an initial blow to the spine or neck , swelling around the spinal cord can cut off blood supply to the cord and kill additional nerve cells .
A small number of patients benefit from steroids given immediately after the injury , Nedergaard said , but most continue to get worse because of secondary swelling .
" We have no treatment at all right now for most patients with spinal cord injury , " she said .
" Right now we 're just observing patients get worse . "
In 2004 , Nedergaard and colleagues discovered that swelling around the cord is caused by the rapid release of ATP , the molecule that normally provides energy for the cell .
Excessive amounts of ATP overstimulate nerve cells and cause them to die of metabolic stress .
The researchers found that blocking an ATP receptor called P2X7 prevented much of the inflammation associated with spinal cord injury .
But until now , they had n't identified a clinically useful drug that could block the receptor .
" We just had proof of principle , " Nedergaard said .
" We did n't have anything we could give to patients . "
Then , while searching for chemicals with structures similar to the P2X7 receptor , the scientists came across FD&C blue dye No. 1 , completely non-toxic and approved by the FDA in 1928 .
" Each of us in United States eats about 14 milligrams of blue dye per day , " Nedergaard said .
" It 's in anything blue , in M&Ms , in Gatorade , in Jell - O .
We eat 100 million pounds a year in the U.S. , so we already know that there ’s no toxicity . "
Another benefit of blue food dye is it crosses the blood - brain barrier .
So instead of injecting the medicine into the spine , which would be dangerous in an injured patient , blue food dye can be delivered into a vein .
To test whether the compound could improve recovery after spinal cord injury , rats were given an intravenous infusion of Brilliant Blue G , which is nearly identical to blue food dye , 15 minutes after a 10 - gram weight was dropped on their spinal cords ( under anesthesia ) .
Animals who received the blue dye recovered much faster than animals who did n't :
By six weeks , the treatment group could walk with a limp , while the no-treatment group never recovered the ability to walk .
" The paper presents novel findings , in a convincing manner , " wrote neurosurgeon Michael Fehlings of the University of Toronto , who specializes in spinal cord injury but was not involved in the research .
When given 15 minutes after injury , the food dye appears to improve recovery and reduce inflammation , Fehlings said .
But he pointed out several issues that need to be addressed before assuming the treatment could work in people .
" The time window of 15 minutes post - injury is not clinically relevant , " Fehlings wrote in an e-mail .
Most patients do n't make it to the emergency room within 15 minutes of getting hurt , so for the treatment to work , he said , it would have to be effective at least two hours after an injury .
In addition , the rats experienced injury to their middle back , while most spinal cord injuries in humans are caused by damage to the neck and upper back .
Nedergaard agrees that more research is necessary , and her group hopes to pursue a phase I clinical trial as soon they can get funding .
Unfortunately , because blue food dye is so cheap , they 're not likely to find a drug company to sponsor the trials .
" There 's no commercial interest because you can buy it by the pound , " Nedergaard said .
" We 're planning a clinical trial here in Rochester , but we 'll have to wait for funding from the government . "

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
Marching in dramatic silence , many with tape over their mouths , hundreds of thousands of Iranians kept alive public support for opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi Wednesday even as the government stepped up efforts to thwart daily protests calling for a new presidential election .
Supporters of defeated reformist candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi line the streets of Tehran Wednesday .

Large crowds gathered in Haft - e - Tir Square in central Tehran Wednesday evening for a fifth day of protests , according to witnesses .
The demonstrators are demanding that officials throw out the results of the balloting Friday that kept hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in power .
More protests are expected Thursday after Moussavi , in a message on his Web site , called for an afternoon " ceremony of mourning , " which he planned to attend .
Referring to those who have died or been wounded " as a result of illegal and violent clashes " with his opponents , Moussavi urged people to gather in mosques and holy sites and wear " mourning symbols " in a show of sympathy and support for the families .
The protests have claimed at least eight lives , according to Iran 's government - funded Press TV .
The eighth death was included in a report the Intelligence Ministry provided to parliament Wednesday , the network said .

The National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of the Iranian Majlis briefed lawmakers " about the current situation in the country , " Press TV reported .
No details of the report have been made public .
Iran is also investigating reports of violence at a Tehran University dormitory in the wake of rallies sparked by last week 's disputed election .
Moussavi and former President Mohammad Khatami sent a joint letter asking Iran 's courts to quell post-election violence and release protesters who have been arrested .
The letter , posted on Moussavi's Web site , said , " the use of violence against ordinary people , raiding people 's residences just because they chant the sacred phrase of Allh - o - akbar ( Allah is great ) , beating up women and men , destroying buildings " is not in line with the standards of the Islamic Republic .
For a second day Wednesday , pro-Moussavi marchers urged their peers to march silently -- perhaps as a way of keeping a low profile in the face of riot police , witnesses told CNN .
Protesters held placards and posters reading , " Where is my vote ? " and " Freedom , " the witnesses said .
Some held signs that said " Silence " and put their finger to their lips .
Several business owners reported that they closed up shop early so their employees could attend Wednesday 's rally .
The government cracked down by banning international media from covering the protests and blocking access to Web sites .
Watch Christiane Amanpour on media restrictions »
A CNN iReporter who is not being identified said Wednesday 's rally ended without incident .
" The people of Iran are finally fed up with the lies , the temperament , the foolish actions of Ahmadinejad , " a 20 - year - old Iranian man told CNN .
Authorities in Tehran transported dozens of protesters to jail Tuesday and blocked access to social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook .
The government accused international reporters of being the " mouthpiece " of " hooligans " who have created unrest , and said it could not guarantee the safety of those reporters .

" I do believe them because the militia , they do n't care who you are .
If they see a camera , you will be a target , " said a CNN producer who is not being identified for his safety .
He was referring to the Basij , a volunteer paramilitary force that takes its orders from the Revolutionary Guard and is suspected of being behind most of the violent acts .
Citizens were barred from using typical means of getting Iran 's stories to the outside world , but amateur videos and photos blossomed on sites such as YouTube and CNN 's iReport .
The content was impossible to verify in most cases , and much of it was posted anonymously or through third parties , some with little information .

On the ground in Iran
Iran 's Revolutionary Guard corps said it will pursue legal action against Web sites that it said were inciting people to riot .
The Guard , a military unit that enforces the government 's Islamic codes and morality , blamed U.S. , British and Canadian companies , including American intelligence agencies , for financially and technically supporting the Web sites .
Despite the Guard 's threats , defiant Moussavi backers stood firm .
" We are fighting with our lives and the world is just watching , " said Ali , a Tehran University student who requested his last name not be used .
" They see how the government is trying to silence us , how they are beating us -- but they do n't come to our help .
It 's OK .
We will succeed , even if we have to fight alone . "
Though the focus of demonstrations has been in Tehran , reports of protests and violence sprouted in all corners of Iran .
Human rights group Amnesty International , which is monitoring the situation through media reports and a network of local correspondents , said people had protested in Tabriz and Bobol in the north , Shiraz in the south and Mashad and Zahedan in the east .
It reported several deaths in Oroumiye and Shiraz as well as beatings by police , use of tear gas and the detention of hundreds of protesters .
A video on CNN's iReport site by a third party showed several people who apparently had been shot , purportedly in the city of Esfahan , about 200 miles south of Tehran , and others attempting to treat them without medical supplies .
In Shiraz , 28 - year - old Najmeh said she has taken to the streets every day since Saturday -- much to the chagrin of her worried parents .
But Wednesday , the hospital nurse said no more .
" The police are everywhere you look , " she said .
" They hurt and arrested so many people last night that no one wants to go out . "
Thousands of miles away , members of Iran 's national soccer team sported green arm and wrist bands Wednesday during their World Cup qualifying match against South Korea .
The team does not normally wear bands of green , the venerated color of Islam that has been adopted by Moussavi supporters , and many Iranians viewed the gesture as a sign of support , although that has not been confirmed .

Meanwhile , the Swiss ambassador to Iran -- the protecting power of the U.S. in Iran -- was called into the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday to hear Iranian complaints regarding U.S. interference in Iran 's election process , P.J. Crowley , assistant secretary of state for public affairs , told reporters in Washington .
U.S. President Barack Obama has voiced " deep concerns " about the elections , as has the European Union .
But neither has dismissed the election results outright .
Counter - demonstrations by Ahmadinejad backers have also drawn thousands , reflecting a deep fissure in the country .
Iran 's all - powerful leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , appealed to the citizenry to stand behind the Islamic republic .
He is to deliver a sermon Friday that will be closely watched for a sign of how the government plans to resolve the stalemate .
On Tuesday , Khamenei -- who has given his blessing to the election results -- asked the country 's election authority , the Guardian Council , to recount some of the votes .
But Moussavi is asking for fresh elections .
CNN 's Samson Desta and Reza Sayah in Tehran , and Mitra Mobasherat and Saeed Ahmed in Atlanta , contributed to this report .

Here ’s the story being reported : Monday , an man named Yavuz Berke stole a Cessna 172 from a Canadian airport , crossed into American airspace and buzzed around for six hours over at least three states .
And for most of that time he was pursued by four fighter jets .
Eventually , he ran low on fuel , landed on a highway in Missouri , and was apprehended .
That ’s the Readers Digest version of what the MSM is presenting for this story .
But what goes virtually unreported is that only one building was emptied …
The Wisconsin Capitol builing [ sic ] in Madison was evacuated as a precaution as the plane flew through that region .
Did the plane not represent a threat to schools or colleges too ?
Could the pilot not have discharged a firearm while in flight as was the case in Boston ?
It would n’t have taken Houdini to secretively discharged Lord - knows - what on the masses below while the fighter pilot escorts tried to avoid stalling their aircrafts .
Perhaps the real story has to do more with how those in power view those not in power .
Thoughts …
How many times have we seen a serial criminal and child molester finally put away for good after murdering a child ?
( John Couey was arrested 24 times before he raped and murdered Jessica Lunsford . )
Our government can’t even guard our borders …

In fact , according to federal data , about a half million serious crimes have been committed by illegal aliens over the past 10 years .
Our debt is rapidly reaching a simply unsustainable limit .
But not to worry !
As of 2003 , our Congress had plenty of millions .
( I ’m sure the numbers are even more interesting now …
But hey , who cares about a few millions here or there ?!?)
Yeah , let the ethereal crazies fly around , but so long as we secure our capitol buildings and our out - of - touch lawmakers , all is well .
Consider this :
It took 24 arrests to finally stop John Couey .
Through all the criminality , violence , and perversion , it took 24 arrests , a child rape , and a child murder , to finally stop him .
Now , just how long do you think it would have taken the authorities to have shut him down if he so much as even threatened one judge or politician ?
In this ship of state , it ’s “ politicians and lawyers first ” , and the women and children can simply fend for themselves .

Fattest State Weighs Its Options
Once Again the Nation ’s Heaviest State , Mississippi Grapples With Its Growing Girth
WebMD Health News By Miranda Hitti WebMD Health News
July 1 , 2009 —
It ’s official , again .
For the fifth year in a row , Mississippi is still the nation ’s heaviest state — ground zero for obesity in the U.S .
That ’s according to a new report , F as in Fat 2009 , issued today by the nonprofit Trust for America ’s Health in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
The report shows that 32.5 % of Mississippi adults are obese and 44.4 % of kids 10 - 17 are overweight or obese .
Topping the obesity charts is getting to be a habit for Mississippi .
And that ’s prompting some navel - gazing in the state .
Here are eight steps two Mississippi mayors and a Mississippi endocrinologist say it will take for Mississippi to put the brakes on obesity .
1. Address the environment .
Yes , personal choices about diet and activity are important .
But if there ’s no healthy food available at affordable prices , and no place to exercise or even take a walk , that ’s a problem .
“ I am not here to tell you to be healthy or force you to be healthy .
I ’m just here to give you an opportunity for it , ” Chip Johnson , mayor of Hernando , Miss . , ” I have to put that opportunity out there , and if the people do n’t take advantage of it , that ’s their choice . ”
Johnson says Hernando , which is located about 12 miles south of Memphis , Tenn. , has a population of 15,000 people and is in Mississippi ’s Delta region .
“ Mississippi is the fattest state in the fattest nation in the world at the fattest time in all of history , and the Delta is the fattest area of our state .
So we ’re right here , smack - dab in the middle of the fattest thing going on , ” Johnson says .
2. Spring for sidewalks .
Gene McGee , mayor of Ridgeland , Miss. , says his town ( population : 23,000 ) mandates sidewalks for new subdivisions .
“ That , hopefully , encourages families or individuals to walk in the subdivisions , ” McGee tells WebMD .
In Hernando , Mayor Johnson says grants will pay for sidewalks to be installed in the city ’s poorest neighborhood , and crumbling sidewalks elsewhere have also been upgraded .
Johnson says he ’s seen more people walking on the new sidewalks .
“ It ’s like that movie — if you build it , they will come , ” he says .
3. Spruce up parks .
“ I think it ’s very important to encourage communities to have facilities such as multi-use trails or parks that encourage physical activity , ” says McGee , noting Ridgeland ’s system of multi-use trails for biking , jogging , or walking .
Johnson says in Hernando , volunteers rehabbed an overgrown football field and track at a burned - down high school , turning it into a site for youth football and soccer and a place for neighborhood residents to walk and jog .
4. Reframe obesity .
Obesity should n’t be thought of as a personal failure or sheer gluttony , but as a “ chronic medical condition , ” says Gabrial Uwaifo , MD , FACP , FACE , an endocrinologist at the University of Mississippi in Jackson , Miss .
Uwaifo wants obesity to be covered by insurance , not paid for out of pocket .
5 . Step away from the fryer .
Uwaifo , who moved to Mississippi two years ago from the Washington , D.C. , area , says he was surprised by how Mississippians eat .
“ I was amazed at how virtually everything was fried , ” Uwaifo says .
“ I ’ve seen oranges dunked in oil ” as well as fried bananas and apples .
Uwaifo is n’t ruling those foods out totally , but he says if they ’re dietary staples , “ it could be dangerous for your heart , it could add up over time . ”
6. Launch a public health blitz .
That ’s something Uwaifo wants to see happen .
He likens it to the antismoking public campaign .
“ Just the same way we finally got people to understand that the Marlboro Man looked good but all that smoking was n’t good for him and will kill him eventually .
That ’s the sort of public health onslaught I think needs to be put out regarding food .
People need to understand that we do end up being what we eat , ” Uwaifo says , cautioning that messages should be tailored to different ethnic populations and age groups .
“ It has to be handled sensitively and carefully .
It can not be one - size - fits - all , ” Uwaifo says .
If Mississippi really steps up to the plate by making a major commitment to tackle obesity , the state could end up being an obesity underdog .
Given the high rate of obesity , even small changes could make a “ measurable impact , ” Uwaifo notes .
7 . Make healthy food available and affordable .
This has n’t been as simple as putting in sidewalks .
Mississippi is one of the nation ’s poorest states , and as Uwaifo points out , “ as long as it ’s far cheaper to get high - fat , high - carbohydrate , simple starchy things , whatever public education you put out there is not going to work .
People finally have to work with what is in their pocket . ”
Johnson points to a new farmer ’s market — all with local food — on the Hernando town square on Saturday mornings that is proving popular .
It ’s within walking distance of poor neighborhoods and also draws people from up to 60 miles away , says Johnson , adding that the city ’s poorest neighborhood also has a new community garden .
But he ’s not happy with the choices at local stores in certain neighborhoods .
“ We still do n’t have healthy foods accessible in our lower - income neighborhoods , ” Johnson says .
“ People who do n’t have a car and who walk to the corner market for their meals , well , their only options are the fried chicken and the fried pizza sticks and all that stuff sitting there in the counter .
When you go in these corner stores , there ’s no fresh vegetables .
There may be a brown banana laying there , that ’s the best you can hope for .
So we ’re trying to encourage that , and that part has not happened here yet , ” Johnson says .
8 . Walk the walk .
“ Setting an example for people is very important , ” says McGee , who is an avid cyclist , covering 100 - 150 miles per week on his bike .
But he was n’t always like that .
“ When I started cycling , I was probably 35 pounds over what I am right now , ” he says .
Taking up cycling “ helped me to lose weight , and it also taught me that to exercise , I ’ve also got to eat right , and so I ’ve learned to turn down those foods that are n’t good for you . ”
National Obesity Findings
Mississippi is in the least desirable spot on the obesity list .
But other states do n’t have much room to crow .
The report shows rising adult obesity rates in 23 states , and no states with declining adult obesity rates .
That ’s better than last year ’s report , which showed rising adult obesity rates in 37 states .
“ We ’re still getting fatter but maybe a little more slowly than before , ” James Marks , MD , MPH , senior vice president of the health group at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , said today in a news conference .
For perspective , only one state — Colorado — has an adult obesity rate of less than 20 % .
But in 1991 , no state had an adult obesity rate over 20 % , and in 1980 , the national average of obese adults was 15 % .

Easy LXDE is a DebianPureBlends project launched in 2009 for making a distribution of Linux which is easy , especially for the new user .
Key design aims are :
Ease of installation and setup .
The system should work on installation , rather than needing extensive configuration .
Ease of use , especially for first - time users .
Features which will be familiar and easy to use for users familiar with other operating systems ( except where there is a compelling reason to do things differently ) .
Stability
A full range of software packages .
Good performance .
Secondary design aims include :
Easy to customize - enabling more advanced users to adapt the system to their needs .
Very clear documentation .
Long term aims - features to be added in future versions :
Choice of distro and desktop .
( The project will need a new name at that point , being not just LXDE . )
Strategy
The strategy is to use :
DebianStable
Backports to provide access to the latest programs .
Additional ?repositories enabled by default , for popular non-free packages that many new users consider essential .
LXDE as a lightweight , easy - to - use , easy - to - configure , modular desktop .
Background
The motivation for this project include these observations :
Many users who are not coders are unwilling to invest the initial effort in changing to Linux .
These users sometimes say that the time spent on learning and configuring Linux takes away from their actual work and makes them less productive .
While it may or may not be true that Linux is as easy to use as ( say ) Windows , the Linux user is less likely to have support through acquaintances who know Linux .
For the experience of installing Linux for the first time to be comparable to installing Windows or starting to use a Mac , the Linux installation has to be extremely smooth and intuitive .
These factors lead to the ironies such as representatives of open source foundations using non-free operating systems
If making non -free software ( including drivers , and popular programs such as Skype ) difficult to install for a newbie leads to frustration , it may contribute to these users giving up on free software .
In an ?ICT4D context ( ICT for Development ) , support is often lacking , and the emphasis is often on introducing computers to children who have never seen them before .
In ?ICT4D and education contexts , sellers of proprietary systems can be quite aggressive in promoting their systems , and one of their selling points is their claim that their systems are easier to use .
Status
This project has been worked on by Debian / LXDE developer Andrew Lee and other developers at DebConf9 ( Spain , July 23 to 30 , 2009 ) , mini-DebConf Taiwan ( Taipei , Sep 26 to 27 , 2009 ) .
And also the effort on lubuntu .
The project is moving slowly at present ( late 2010 , early 2011 ) due to lack of time by Andrew Lee .

DNA In Another Dimension
3 - D construction technique creates a wealth of structures
Shawn Douglas
View Enlarged Image Models of 3 - D nanostructures made from DNA .
USING DNA as a basic chemical building block rather than a genetic molecule , scientists have devised a method for creating complex three - dimensional nanostructures with precisely controlled dimensions that range from 10 to 100 nm ( Nature 2009 , 459 , 414 ) .
The strategy of self - assembly could provide a general route for manufacturing sophisticated devices with nanoscale features , the researchers say .
The technique , developed by William M. Shih of Boston 's Dana - Farber Cancer Institute and colleagues , is an extension of DNA origami , in which hundreds of short oligonucleotides fasten to a long single strand of DNA in such a way that it folds into a predetermined shape ( C&EN , March 20 , 2006 , page 10 ) .
Researchers have already used the technique to create 2 - D snowflakes and smiley faces , as well as a 3 - D DNA box ( C&EN , May 11 , page 30 ) .
Shih 's strategy allows nanotechnologists to build a vast diversity of 3 - D DNA structures , a capability his group demonstrated by constructing a tiny railed bridge , a genie bottle , and an icosahedron .
Shih 's team designs the structures by computationally " carving " them out of a honeycomb lattice made of a DNA double helix .
Using computer - aided design , they arrange a single strand of DNA so that it winds around that carved structure and then determine what short oligonucleotides are required to hold it in place .
" The challenge was actually getting it to work , " Shih tells C&EN , because DNA is negatively charged , and repulsive forces tend to keep it from packing into the compact sculptures .
" We did n't know what kind of tricks we would need to get it to fold correctly , " he says .
Ultimately , patience proved to be one of the tricks .
Although most 2 - D DNA origami structures fold within an hour , Shih 's 3 - D sculptures take about a week to fold .
" This successful move into three dimensions heralds a new era for the field of structural DNA technology , " writes Duke University chemistry professor Thomas H. LaBean in a commentary that accompanies the paper .
" Through the ages , some of the most iconic and lasting artifacts of human ingenuity have been sculptures and carvings , created from a wide variety of materials .
But until now , a general purpose material from which nanometer - scale , three - dimensional shapes could be made has been lacking . "
( CNN ) -- North Korea has concluded an investigation of two detained American journalists , and they will stand trial , according to the nation 's state - run news service , KCNA .
Laura Ling was taken into custody March 17 along the China - North Korea border .
" A competent organ of [ North Korea ] concluded the investigation into the journalists of the United States , " the news service reported Friday .
" The organ formally decided to refer them to a trial on the basis of the confirmed crimes committed by them . "
The two journalists , Laura Ling and Euna Lee , entered the country illegally and intended " hostile acts , " according to KCNA last month .
The allegations " have been confirmed by evidence and their statements , " the news service reported .
Preparations were being made to try the two " on the basis of the already - confirmed suspicions , " the report last month said .
The two are allowed consular contact and their treatment was governed by international laws while the investigation was underway , according to KCNA .
Watch more on the journalists »
A Swedish diplomat was allowed to meet the journalists , the U.S. State Department said last month .
The department said previously it had received information that the journalists were being well treated .
Ling and Lee were taken into custody March 17 along the China - North Korea border .
They are reporters for the San Francisco , California - based media outlet Current TV .

FYI : 5 August 1990 Choosing a Name for Your Computer Status of this Memo This FYI RFC is a republication of a Communications of the ACM article on guidelines on what to do and what not to do when naming your computer [ 1 ] .
This memo provides information for the Internet community .
It does not specify any standard .
Distribution of this memo is unlimited .
Abstract
In order to easily distinguish between multiple computers , we give them names .
Experience has taught us that it is as easy to choose bad names as it is to choose good ones .
This essay presents guidelines for deciding what makes a name good or bad .
Keywords : domain name system , naming conventions , computer administration , computer network management Introduction
As soon as you deal with more than one computer , you need to distinguish between them .
For example , to tell your system administrator that your computer is busted , you might say , " Hey Ken .
Goon is down ! "
Computers also have to be able to distinguish between themselves .
Thus , when sending mail to a colleague at another computer , you might use the command " mail libes@goon " .
In both cases , " goon " refers to a particular computer .
How the name is actually dereferenced by a human or computer need not concern us here .
This essay is only concerned with choosing a " good " name .
( It is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of the domain name system as described by [ 2 ] . )
By picking a " good " name for your computer , you can avoid a number of problems that people stumble over again and again .
Here are some guidelines on what NOT to do .

A chef prepares a meal in the White House kitchen .
W.H. makes CEOs pay for lunch
Four of the most powerful business leaders in America arrived at the White House one day last month for lunch with President Barack Obama , sitting down in his private dining room just steps from the Oval Office .
But even for powerful CEOs , there ’s no such thing as a free lunch :
White House staffers collected credit card numbers for each executive and carefully billed them for the cost of the meal with the president .
Advertisement
The White House defended the unusual move as a way to avoid conflicts of interest .
But the Bush administration did n’t charge presidential guests for meals , one former official said , and at least one etiquette expert found the whole thing unseemly – suggesting it was a serious breach of protocol .
“ I ’m sure they have their political reasons for doing that , but I think it ’s not what quote , hospitality , unquote is all about , ” said Letitia Baldrige , who headed Jacqueline Kennedy ’s White House staff in the early 1960s .
“ We ’ve got to relax about this .
To have people to the White House and worry about the price of things is laughable . ”
“ I do n’t know what the menu was , but I ’m sure it was n’t braised pheasant , ” she said .
The White House did not say what was served for lunch or how much the attendees were charged .
A spokeswoman said White House staff collected the credit card numbers separately from the event .
Around the table with Barack Obama that afternoon were Ursula Burns , CEO of Xerox Corporation ; Muhtar Kent , CEO of The Coca - Cola Company ; AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson ; and Honeywell International CEO Dave Cote .
“ From time to time , White House guests are asked to reimburse for their meals , the reasons include ensuring there is no conflict or appearance of a conflict , ” said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki .
“ That is consistent with our tough ethics rules and we will continue the practice when appropriate . ”
The former senior Bush administration official said meals with the president were covered by official entertainment expenses that fall under the Executive Residence budget or the White House ’s annual account .
But the Bush administration was so sensitive about appearing cozy with corporate America that another former high - ranking official cannot recall a single instance of President Bush lunching with CEOs in the White House .
For Obama , the politics of dining with CEOs is much different :
In the midst of the greatest economic collapse since the Great Depression , most Americans would likely approve of the president sitting down with the leading figures of the private sector to develop strategies to fight the recession .
Still , the decision to bill the CEOs for their meal shows the political sensitivity of relations between the commander in chief and corporate chieftains .
The lunch meeting did not show up on Obama ’s public schedule and was largely overlooked by the press .
The low - visibility session was part of an ongoing and concerted White House effort to maintain constant contact with the nation ’s top business leaders .
The corporate outreach effort , spearheaded by Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett , gives the president the opportunity to hear private first - hand accounts from the executives who are fighting their way through the global economic recession .
“ This is something that happens on an ongoing basis , ” Jarrett told POLITICO .
“ A lot of CEOs have now had the opportunity to sit around the table with the president . ”
Jarrett said some meetings include a meal , some are held in the Roosevelt room , and others are held outside the White House , at restaurants across Washington , DC .
The offsite dinners include Jarrett and White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel but are not attended by the president .
Jarrett said the dinners with Emanuel are n’t free , either : Attendees split the tab .
The sessions , Jarrett said , are held “ to make sure we are creating the kind of environment where CEOs are creating jobs .
It ’s to make sure we have the best information to turn the economy around . ”
The discussion at the June 25 lunch was open ended , with no set agenda item , and touched on health care , education and the economic recovery .
Jarrett said the four companies were chosen because they are each dominant global corporations .
“ The president had recently returned from a trip overseas and he was eager to talk to these four huge global corporations about how they see the world economic situation . ”
In a statement to POLITICO , Xerox CEO Burns offered some insight into the lunch : “ The exchanges were very open and candid and touched on issues from health care reform and corporate governance to foreign tax deferral and investments in education for math and science , ” Burns said .
“ The president was receptive – and set the tone that he was using these discussions to help inform the administration ’s views on policy reform . ”
Rob Ferris , a spokesman for Honeywell , offered a brief statement : “ Mr. Cote was honored to participate in the lunch with President Obama at the White House and appreciated the opportunity to share his thoughts on the state of the global economy and other issues , ” Ferris said .
“ He was grateful for the president ’s engagement and interest in the dialogue . ”
Said AT&T spokesperson Claudia Jones :
“ We certainly appreciate that the president is reaching out and engaging the business community .
He ’s personally involved and is listening to our viewpoints in ways that are very constructive . ”
A spokesman for Coca - Cola confirmed the company ’s CEO ’s attendance at the meeting but declined to comment on what was discussed .
Some of the CEO outreach events have been on the White House public schedule , while others have not .
They sometimes focus on specific business constituencies :
The sessions have included face time , for example , with high tech companies , manufacturing companies , small businesses , hospitality executives and minority automobile dealers .
In addition to the four attendees at the June lunch , other CEOs invited to the White House or to the dinners – or both – so far this year include : Jeff Immelt of General Electric , Ken Chenault of American Express , Robert Wolf of UBS , Jim Owens of Caterpillar , Ivan Seidenberg of Verizon , Paul Otellini of Intel and Eric Schmidt of Google , says the White House .
The meetings often result in a specific follow up from the administration .
At the June lunch , for example , AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson caught the president ’s attention when he brought up the AT&T Foundation ’s $ 100 million Aspire program , which focuses on preventing high school dropouts .
Obama asked Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to follow up the next day to see how the government can learn from the company ’s success .
“ Part of what we want to do is match up best practices we find in the private sector to make sure we include those best practices here , ” Jarrett said .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama often talks about all of the forces lining up against his health care plan .
But there 's one critic who has remained relatively mum in the debate .
Dr. David Scheiner was President Obama 's personal physician for 22 years .
David Scheiner , a Chicago , Illinois - based doctor , has taken a hard look at the president 's prescription for health care reform and sees bad medicine .
" This is n't that kind of health care program that I think is going to work , " he said .
So what makes Scheiner so special ?
He was Obama 's personal physician for 22 years , and voted for the former Illinois senator in the 2008 presidential election .
Scheiner thinks the president 's plan does n't go far enough .
In his mind , the worst part of the proposal is that " private insurers continue to be a part of the health scheme . "
Watch Scheiner talk about his objections »
" Everybody keeps saying we do n't want the government involved in health care , " Scheiner said in an interview .
" But the government is involved in Medicare , and it works . "
Scheiner would rather see the nation adopt a single - payer system like the ones in Canada and Europe .
The financing system relies on one " payer " -- which could be a government - run agency -- to fund all health care costs billed by doctors , hospitals and other health professionals .
The benefits , advocates say , is that pricey administrative costs are cut , resulting in large savings to patients .
It 's something that an up - and - coming coming state Sen .
Obama talked about six years ago .
" I happen to be a proponent of a single - payer universal health care plan .
...
But as all of you know , we may not get there immediately , because first we 've got to take back the White House , and we 've got take back the Senate , and we 've got to take back the House , " Obama said in 2003 .
But that position evolved during the campaign .
" If I were designing a system from scratch , then I 'd probably set up a single - payer system .
But the problem is we 're not starting from scratch , " Obama said in Albuquerque , New Mexico , in August 2008 .
Now , the president favors giving Americans the option of joining a government - run plan that would compete with private insurers .
Watch more on the health care debate »
" Nobody is talking about some government takeover of health care .
I 'm tired of hearing that , " Obama said in Raleigh , North Carolina , on Thursday .
But Scheiner says that nobody has seen the details of that option , making it a hard sell for the president .
" We do n't even fully know what the public option is going to be .
If the public option is too good , patients who are sick will flock to it , and I 'm not sure it will be able to support itself . "
Scheiner almost had a chance to confront the president with his concerns .
He was invited to a recent televised town hall meeting with Obama , but he says he was dropped from the program .
" I just hope that the Congress , the American public and the president will hear some of my words , " he said .
" We 've got to do something better . "
Scheiner finally had a chance to have his say Thursday .
He and other doctors who support a single - payer system gathered in Washington to meet with lawmakers and rally supporters .
He may not be the president 's doctor anymore , but Scheiner says he 's trying to save the patient before it 's too late .

Relive the glory days of your childhood with this Adult Size Big Wheel ( $ 650 ) .
Reinforced for grown - man - sized individuals — 275 lbs max on this model — these puppies feature hardened steel frames , metal flake glossy paint , alloy rims , a fully adjustable seat , and all the power slides you can handle .
Oh , and we wo n't need to remind you to remove the bell and tassels first thing .
Think globally , suffer locally .
This could be the moral of “ Methland , ” Nick Reding ’s unnerving investigative account of two gruesome years in the life of Oelwein , Iowa , a railroad and meatpacking town of several thousand whipped by a methamphetamine - laced panic whose origins lie outside the place itself , in forces almost too great to comprehend and too pitiless to bear .
The ravages of meth , or “ crank , ” on Oelwein and countless forsaken locales much like it are shown to be merely superficial symptoms of a vaster social dementia caused by , among other things , the iron dominion of corporate agriculture and the slow melting of villages and families into the worldwide financial stew .
The book , wrought from old - fashioned shoe - leather reporting of a type that ’s disappearing faster than nonfranchised lunch counters on Main Street , is n’t chiefly a tale of drugs and crime , of dysfunction and despair , but a recession - era tragedy scaled for an “ Our Town , ” Thornton Wilder stage and seemingly based on a script by William S. Burroughs .
The madness stalking tiny , defenseless Oelwein may eventually come for all of us , we learn , and once again , as happens in America whenever our collective attention wanders from the gray struggles of the little guy to the purple capers of the big wheels , attention must be paid .
Right now .
Or else .
“ Methland ” begins quietly and solemnly , with a ballad of cultural invisibility .
Reding , a loyal native of the Midwest who ’s frankly sentimental about its past and starkly lucid about its likely future , invites his rushing readers to gaze down at the “ flyover country ” of America and see not a grid of farms and county roads but a patchwork of failed institutions and aspirations .
There ’s the hospital , groaning under a load of uninsured patients with ­minimum - wage jobs and maxed - out household budgets .
There ’s the school , imperiled by dwindling tax receipts and students with ever more grown - up problems .
And there , on a street in a district of drab houses not far from the faltering central business district , is a passel of latter - day Tom Sawyers on bikes , riding along not for the summertime heck of it but to shake up batches of low - grade speed contained in plastic soda jugs lashed to their back fenders .

It ’s magnificently potent stuff , this meth , whose crudest versions are concocted from a mash of over - the - counter cold pills and flesh - eating bulk industrial chemicals .
Just a few grains of it , snorted through scarred nostrils and allowed to saturate stressed synapses , can keep a person awake and going for days .
And that ’s not an entirely bad thing here , where survival means working harder for less each year , from late shift to day shift , until perception blurs .
Militants have been battling pro-government forces for three years
Ethiopia has refused a request by Somalia for military support to fight insurgents , saying such an intervention would need an international mandate .
The Somali authorities have been battling Islamist insurgents who control much of the country .
The speaker of Somalia 's parliament had earlier urged neighbouring countries to send troops within 24 hours .
Ethiopian troops helped topple an Islamist movement in Somalia in 2006 , but were withdrawn earlier this year .
On Saturday Somali parliamentary Speaker Sheikh Aden Mohamed Nur urged neighbouring Kenya , Djibouti , Ethiopia and Yemen to intervene as fierce fighting continued for a second day in the capital Mogadishu .
But Ethiopian government spokesman Bereket Simon said that an international mandate was needed for such an intervention .
He added that the international community , not just Somalia 's neighbours , should assist its transitional government .
Assassinations
Somalia has been without an effective government since 1991 .
Its UN - backed transitional government controls only parts of Mogadishu , but little of the rest of the country .
There are some 4,300 African Union troops deployed in Mogadishu , but they lack any mandate to pursue the insurgents .
Pro-government forces have been fighting radical Islamist guerrillas in the capital since 7 May .
On Friday , gunmen killed Mohamed Hussein Addow , an MP who represented the Karan district where fighting has been particularly intense in recent days .
It was the third killing of a high - profile public figure in as many days .
Somalia 's security minister - an outspoken critic of the militant Islamist group al - Shabab - was killed in a suicide attack in the northern town of Beledweyne , and Mogadishu 's police commander was also killed this week .
Militant groups including al - Shabab , which is accused of links to al - Qaeda , have been trying to topple Somalia 's government for three years .
Some four million people in Somalia - or about one - third of the population - need food aid , according to aid agencies .

Six volunteers spent 3.5 months together inside a mock Mars spaceship in Moscow , Russia ( Image : ESA )
A group of volunteers that spent 105 days locked up in a mock spaceship simulating a trip to Mars is finishing up their final tests this week .
The programme , which was used to test the psychological and physiological effects of isolation , will pave the way for a longer 520 - day mission that will take place in the first half of 2010 .
Isolation has long been a part of human exploration , both on Earth and in space .
But manned trips to Mars could be a challenge for even the most balanced and carefully selected crews , since the missions would involve small crews , tight quarters , years of separation from friends and family , and communications delays that could last up to 40 minutes ( see In space no one can hear you scream ) .
To investigate issues that would arise in such situations , the European Space Agency has partnered with the Russian Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow to arrange a 105 - day simulated mission to Mars .
The experiment took place in a multi-floored facility in Moscow that includes a mock spacecraft , a descent vehicle , and a simulation of the Martian surface .
Advertisement
On 14 July , a crew of six emerged from the module .
Although researchers are still analysing the results of the tests conducted during the simulation and performing follow - up tests on the participants this week , the mission seems to have finished largely without incident .
“ The most difficult part of the mission was not a single event but more the monotony , ” says Oliver Knickel , a mechanical engineer in the German army and a volunteer for the 105 - day mission .
Less focused
The bulk of the crew ’s working day was occupied by psychological and physiological tests , Knickel told New Scientist .
The crew ate astronaut - style pre-packaged meals that were intermittently enhanced by fresh vegetables like radishes and cabbage that the crew grew in a small greenhouse .
In his off - time , Knickel passed the time by writing letters , learning Russian , and playing poker and dice with his crewmates .
But the isolation and confinement in a cramped space did take its toll .
“ I had a hard time focusing on the things I was doing , ” Knickel told New Scientist , adding that he did not retain newly learned Russian vocabulary words was well as he did back home .
Right chemistry
Crew compatibility is important for the success of future Mars missions .
“ You have a crew that has to live together and function as a team for a long period of time , and they really can’t leave that environment , ” says Jay Buckey , a doctor and former astronaut at Dartmouth University in Hanover , New Hampshire .
Participant Cyrille Fournier , an airline pilot from France , says there was a good sense of camaraderie over the 3.5 months the six volunteers spent together .
“ We had an outstanding team spirit throughout the entire 105 days , ” he said in a statement .
“ Living for that long in a confined environment can only work if the crew is really getting along with each other .
The crew is the crucial key to mission success , which became very evident to me during the 105 days . ”
Self - directed mission
During the mission , the crew had to respond to simulated emergencies and deal with a communication delay of up to 20 minutes each way when talking to ‘ ground controllers ’ – mimicking the time it takes for radio signals to travel between a Mars - bound spacecraft and Earth .
Such communication lags mean that crews would not be able to respond in real - time to commands from the ground and would probably need to function fairly autonomously .
Nick Kanas , a psychiatrist at the University of California in San Francisco , and colleagues used a month in the 105 - day experiment to examine what happens when crews are given more freedom to devise their own schedules in order to meet a mission ’s overarching goals .
This increased autonomy has also been tested in the Haughton - Mars Project in the Canadian Arctic ( see What is it like to live in isolation for months on end ? ) and at an underwater facility called Aquarius off the coast of Florida .
In the future , Kanas hopes to perform a similar experiment aboard the International Space Station .
Safe environment
Isolation studies on Earth allow researchers to set up carefully controlled experiments , but they do have a downside .
“ Ground missions do n’t really capture the danger in the space environment .
If someone does want to quit , they can just knock on the door and be let out , ” Kanas told New Scientist .
Not so on a future trip to Mars , says Kanas : “ There ’s no possibility of support in case of a medical or psychological emergency .
You ’re really on your own . ”
To deal with such issues , other researchers , including Buckey , are developing software that would allow astronauts on long missions to act as their own counsellors and conflict negotiators ( see Self - help software to soothe stressed astronauts ) .
An even longer simulated mission to Mars – lasting 520 days – is set to begin at the Moscow facility in the first half of 2010 .
Toyota , the world ’s largest carmaker , would launch Toyota Fortuner in the Indian market on August 24 , betting big on its sports utility vehicle .
Toyota ’s Indian unit Toyota Kirloskar Motor ( TKM ) expects Fortuner to “ take away 50 per cent market share ” in this category .
Toyota Kirloskar Motor Deputy Managing Director ( Marketing ) Sandeep Singh said the joint venture expects to sell 2,000 units of Fortuner from the launch date to December end .
Fortuner would come with a price tag of around Rs 20 lakh , he added .
Company officials said Toyota has not planned to launch any new model over the period between the unveiling of Fortuner in August and its compact car by next year - end .
However , there would be limited editions and variants of existing models hitting the roads .

Fear is a powerful emotion and neuroscientists have for the first time located the neurons responsible for fear conditioning in the mammalian brain .
Fear conditioning is a form of Pavlovian , or associative , learning and is considered to be a model system for understanding human phobias , post - traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders .
Using an imaging technique that enabled them to trace the process of neural activation in the brains of rats , University of Washington researchers have pinpointed the basolateral nucleus in the region of the brain called the of amygdala as the place where fear conditioning is encoded .
Neuroscientists previously suspected that both the amygdala and another brain region , the dorsal hippocampus , were where cues get associated when fear memories are formed .
But the new work indicates that the role of the hippocampus is to process and transmit information about conditioned stimuli to the amygdala , said Ilene Bernstein , corresponding author of the new study and a UW professor of psychology .
The study is being published Monday , July 6 , in PLoS One , a journal of the Public Library of Science .
Associative conditioning is a basic form of learning across the animal kingdom and is regularly used in studying how brain circuits can change as a result of experience .
In earlier research , UW neuroscientists looked at taste aversion , another associative learning behavior , and found that neurons critical to how people and animals learn from experience are located in the amygdala .
The new work was designed to look for where information about conditioned and unconditioned stimuli converges in the brain as fear memories are formed .
The researchers used four groups of rats and placed individual rodents inside of a chamber for 30 minutes .
Three of the groups had never seen the chamber before .
When control rats were placed in the chamber , they explored it , became less active and some fell asleep .
A delayed shock group also explored the chamber , became less active and after 26 minutes received an electric shock through the floor of the chamber .
The third group was acclimated to the chamber by a series of 10 prior visits and then went through the same procedure as the delayed shock rats .
The final group was shocked immediately upon being introduced inside the chamber .
The following day the rats were individually returned to the chamber and the researchers observed them for freezing behavior .
Freezing , or not moving , is the most common behavioral measure of fear in rodents .
The only rats that exhibited robust freezing were those that received the delayed shock in a chamber which was unfamiliar to them .
" We did n't know if we could delay the shock for 26 minutes and get a fear reaction after just one trial .
I thought it would be impossible to do this with fear conditioning , " said Bernstein .
" This allowed us to ask where information converged in the brain . "
To do this , the researchers repeated the procedure , but then killed the rats .
They then took slices of the brains and used Arc catfish , an imaging technique , which allowed them to follow the pattern of neural activation in the animals .
Only the delayed shock group displayed evidence of converging activation from the conditioned stimulus ( the chamber ) and the unconditioned stimulus ( the shock ) .
The experiment showed that animals can acquire a long - term fear when a novel context is paired with a shock 26 minutes later , but not when a familiar context is matched with a shock .
" Fear learning and taste aversion learning are both examples of associative learning in which two experiences occur together .
Often they are learned very rapidly because they are critical to survival , such as avoiding dangerous places or toxic foods , " said Bernstein .
" People have phobias that often are set off by cues from something bad that happened to them , such as being scared by a snake or being in a dark alley .
So they develop an anxiety disorder , " she said .
" By understanding the process of fear conditioning we might learn how to treat anxiety by making the conditioning weaker or to go away .
It is also a tool for learning about these brain cells and the underlying mechanism of fear conditioning . "

Fear of Alzheimer ’s Disease
Here ’s an interesting chart that I found at this Web site : http://seniorjournal.com.
Although most Americans fear cancer the most , the greatest fear of those 55 and over is Alzheimer’s .
This was a survey conducted by the MetLife Foundation .
They found that although there ’s fear , there ’s very little preparation for this devastating disease .
The greatest risk factor is age .
While there are about one in 10 over 65 with the disease , the number jumps to closer to half of those over 85 .
Doctors at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health say that obesity may be linked to an increased risk of dementia .
Two - thirds of dementia cases in those over 65 are actually diagnosed with Alzheimer ’s disease .
If you ’re obese , the risk rises by 42 % and if you ’re underweight , the risk rises by 36 % .
So maintaining a normal weight is your best bet for preventing dementia .

I love to cook .
Along the way , I often discover excellent shortcuts and money - saving tactics for home food preparation .
I get excited , and I immediately want to share the idea , but it ’s simply not enough to warrant a full article on its own .
So , I usually save it .
I jot the idea down somewhere in my notes and move on with things .
Today , I decided to dig through my notes and pull together several of those useful frugal cooking tactics .
Hopefully , these tactics will find use in your own kitchen .
5 Tactics to Try in Your Kitchen
Make Your Own Cream of ….
Soup !
One staple of many inexpensive recipes is canned soup , usually of the “ cream ” variety – cream of chicken soup , cream of mushroom soup , and so on .
Some people , particularly those who are focused on eating healthy , try to avoid these ingredients , since such soups are usually laden with salt and preservatives .
Thankfully , it ’s pretty easy to make this soup yourself – and it ’s a perfect substitute for the canned soup in those recipes .
Just mix together 2 tablespoons of butter ( or margarine ) , two tablespoons of flour , half a cup of milk , and ( optionally ) a quarter of a teaspoon of salt over medium heat .
The easiest way to do it is to put in the butter first , wait until it melts , then sprinkle in the flour while stirring , then slowly add the milk while stirring .
If you want to make cream of chicken soup , add in half a cup of chicken broth or chicken stock .
If you want to make cream of mushroom soup , add in half a cup of milk and quarter of a cup of finely diced mushrooms .
If you want to make cream of celery soup , add in half a cup of milk and a quarter of a cup of finely diced celery .
Once you have all of the ingredients in , let it simmer over low heat for three minutes while stirring .
The amount in the pan is usually just a bit more than a can ’s worth of cream soup and it substitutes perfectly ( and often tastes quite delicious ) .
It ’s also quite a bit healthier and , from my calculations , cheaper , too .
Utilize Leftover Fruit Juices
Sometimes , especially during the winter here in Iowa , we ’ll pick up no - sugar - added canned fruits , particularly pineapple , because the fresh fruit options are questionable at best and the frozen fruits are often laden with sugar .
Often , though , when the can is empty , we ’re left with half a can full of juice that would normally go to waste .
Instead , we ’ve found it ’s a great idea to put that juice to use as a marinade .
We save the juice , then the following night , we mix some soy sauce , some pepper , some olive oil , and a bit of garlic with it .
Then , we soak our main entree ( often , chicken breasts or chops or fish fillets ) in the marinade for an hour or so , then grill it .
Delicious , particularly when you consider that the backbone of the marinade would have been thrown away in most homes .
Leftover Meat As Pizza Topping
Quite often , when we eat something like a roast or a whole chicken , there ’s quite a bit of meat left over .
Sometimes , it makes sense to freeze the meat , but quite often , it simply seems like it ’s going to go to waste – we ca n’t put it in the composter and there ’s only so much of the same thing you can eat as a leftover .
One great ( surprising ) tactic is to simply take the leftover meat and chop it finely , then freeze that chopped meat .
Then , the next time you prepare a pizza , thaw the contents of the bag and use that as a key pizza topping .
Almost any meat works here : roast , fish fillets , chicken breasts , and so on .
Each one makes for a distinctly different pizza , plus the pizza is usually so different from the original dish that you rarely notice that it ’s the same thing you had a few days ago .
Use the Freezer !
If you do n’t have enough food to fill your deep freezer , start saving your milk jugs right now .
As they empty , rinse them out , fill them up with water ( up to about an inch below the top , then cap them and stick them in the freezer .
Why do this , you might ask ?
It ’s simple .
Once the new items have been cooled down to the temperature of the freezer , they will help maintain the cold temperature of your freezer .
In short , your freezer will run less often , and it wo n’t lose nearly as much cold when you open the door .
Even more important , during a power outage , a full freezer will warm up much slower than a partially full one .
The items you stored in there will act as cold sinks , keeping all of the frozen food colder for longer than if the freezer was empty .
Even better , those frozen gallon jugs make for great ice packs for coolers .

One simple regular dish we like to make is the standard meatloaf .
It ’s often the center of our meal , with vegetables and other items as side dishes .
Most of the time , we make a very basic meatloaf …
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 eggs , beaten
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup uncooked rice
1/4 cup chopped onion
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/4 teaspoon rosemary
Just mix all this up , put it in a loaf pan , and bake it for an hour – easy as pie .
However , we often do n’t eat the whole meatloaf , even after leftovers .
We could , of course , grate it up for pizza , but there ’s a much better use for that meatloaf .
Just take the leftover meatloaf , cut it into 3/ 4 inch cubes , and add it to spaghetti sauce .
These make for wonderful meatballs and , when they ’re coated with the sauce , you do n’t even remember that it was originally meatloaf .
This is a great way to make homemade meatballs for your pasta dinner .
Swine flu has affected about 100,000 people and killed about 450 people around the world till now .
Swine flu is so called because of its origins in the flu that infected pigs .
But new research has shed more light on the evolution of swine flu and how fatal the virus can become .
The swine flu virus is now called Novel H1N1 virus .
The structure of novel H1N1 virus :
All influenza viruses have 8 genes .
Two of the genes , Hemagglutinin( H ) and Neuraminidase ( N ) , are responsible for the ability of the virus to enter a cell and spread from cell to cell .
There are 16 H sub - types and 9 N sub - types .
This makes a total of 144 combinations possible .
Variations in these combination determine how fast this virus can spread and how dangerous the virus can be for people .
Research into origins of novel H1N1 virus :
Research funded by the National Institute of Health ’s ( NIH ) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) and National Institute of General Medical Sciences ( NIGMS ) has put together a picture as to where the novel H1N1 virus came from and how it has evolved .
The research found out that the novel H1N1 virus has its origins not only in swine flu , but also in the virus that caused a pandemic in 1918 .
The pandemic had killed 40 - 50 million people around the world .
Research into potential danger from novel H1N1 virus :
A NIGMS funded team from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a team from Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention ( CDC ) came together to research the ability of the novel H1N1 virus to spread and cause disease .
The researchers infected mice and ferrets with the novel H1N1 virus .
They found that the virus replicated in higher levels in the respiratory tract , and was more deadly than seasonal viruses .
They also found the virus infecting the intestinal tracts of the ferrets , which is not seen in seasonal flus .
The ability of the novel H1N1 virus to spread through respiratory droplets was found to be lower than seasonal flu viruses .
The ability of a flu virus to bind to cells is regulated by Hemagglutinin ( H ) .
This is less effective in novel H1N1 than seasonal flus .
Also , the novel H1N1 virus did not have a version of another gene called PB2 , which helps a virus spread efficiently .
However , the researchers point out that flu viruses mutate very quickly to acquire properties that help them spread faster .
The novel H1N1 virus can easily exchange genes of other flu viruses to become more efficient .
Experts say that researching into how the novel H1N1 virus evolves is very important in preventing a pandemic .
No doubt , careful attention will be paid to how this virus evolves by researchers around the world .

A majority of Americans now give President Obama 's handling of the economy a negative rating and many economists and city officials are concerned that Obama 's gargantuan stimulus effort has not given the expected quick boost to the economy .
Some argue this is because funds have been slow in coming due to bureaucratic red tape meant to ensure that the money spent will not be wasted .
Jared Bernstein , chief economist for the office of Vice President Joe Biden ( who knew that the Vice President needed a chief economist ? ) , is quoted as saying " We 're hitting the right balance between speed and oversight . "
Unfortunately for the American public , sound economics teaches that , regardless of how fast the money is spent or how much oversight is provided by bureaucrats , the money doled out by the stimulus plan will be wasted and will have a detrimental impact on the economy in the long term , because that is the nature of profligate government spending .
From an economic perspective , Obama 's stimulus plan is equivalent to a giant welfare scheme .
Instead of the money going to lower income Americans , however , it is meant to go to municipal bureaucrats of various stripes .
Instead of productive American citizens determining what to do with their own scarce resources , the state is stepping in and dictating how they will be used .
Consequently , such spending is essentially government consumption , which is what vulgar Keynesians think we need now more than ever .
Such economists are shocked — shocked ! — to find out that Americans are now saving any increases in income instead of blowing it on even more consumer goods .
Not to worry , however .
If private citizens do not consume enough for official tastes , the government always can .
Certainly we can expect that when the government spends a trillion dollars this will provide a positive statistical boost to GDP , if for no other reason that government spending makes up a significant portion of GDP .
Where , however , does the state get the money to spend ?
Ah , as Hamlet might say , there 's the rub .
There are only three ways the government can obtain funds to throw at all their shovel - ready projects and all three leave in their wake negative economic consequences .
The most obvious thing the government could do to raise the funds to spend on fiscal stimulus is to raise taxes .
However , this method is the economic equivalent of robbing Peter to pay Paul .
Taxation directly impinges on taxpayers ' well - being because they are left with less income from their labors with which to provide for themselves and their families .
Additionally , taxation reduces prosperity in the long run , because it fosters capital consumption over time .
Taxation reduces the ability to save and invest in capital , because savings come out of income and as people have less income at their disposal , they have less to save and invest .
Taxation reduces the incentive to invest as well , because future rates of return on any investment will be reduced by taxes on positive income .
A project that might have netted 10 % without new taxes might only net 7 % after taxes .
If a 7 % rate of return is not an acceptable rate for a specific capitalist , he will choose not to save and invest .
If saving and investment decreases over time , capital will be consumed .
Labor will become less productive , resulting in lower incomes and less prosperity .
Not what you want to happen when trying to get out of a depression .
Because taxes are so politically unpopular , governments usually resort to additional ways to raise funds , one of which is borrowing .
A good case can be made that government borrowing is more harmful for long - run economic progress than taxation .
Although taxation reduces both consumption and investment spending , government borrowing comes entirely from the nation 's pool of savings .
The money that is lent to the government in Treasury bond purchases is entirely money that was saved and ready for investment .
Instead of being invested in productive capital accumulation , however , it is being lent to the government to fund state consumption .
When the government borrows , it becomes a major demander of loanable funds , so market interest rates increase , making it harder for private entrepreneurs to gain access to capital for their production .
As private capital available for productive enterprise shrinks , our economy becomes less productive and less prosperous .
The other source of funding turned to by the government is monetary inflation .
Governments can either create money and spend it outright or they can inject money into the economy through the banking system so that people and banks can use this new money to buy up government bonds , thereby monetizing the debt .
This route is preferred by governments who want to borrow more money without all those nasty rate increases .
Monetary inflation produces another set of negative economic consequences .
In the first place , when the government increases the money supply , in general people hold more money than they want to at prevailing overall prices .
They relieve this excess supply by spending the excess money on consumer and producer goods .
Increasing the money supply does not spontaneously increase the stock of these goods ; it merely increases the amount of money being spent on the same quantity of goods .
Because more money is spent , the demand for producer and consumer goods increases , so overall prices increase and the purchasing power of the dollar falls .
There is , therefore , no general social benefit from inflation .
In fact , monetary inflation via credit expansion is the source of our present trouble .
Artificial credit expansion — credit not funded by savings — creates the business cycle by spawning capital malinvestment .
Artificial credit expansion makes many unwise investments ( say , in residential and commercial real estate and financial derivatives ) look profitable because of the accessibility of cheap credit , so business activity expands , manifesting itself in an inflationary boom .
Bad investments , however , are not made economically sound merely because there is more money in existence .
These bad investments eventually must be liquidated .
The boom resolves itself in a bust whose twin children are capital consumption and unemployment .
The moral of the story is that monetary inflation is not a way to sustainably generate economic prosperity .
One thing the government does do , however , by increasing the money supply is discourage saving .
This is because , as prices rise , money saved becomes worth less and less , so people are more likely to spend it on present consumption while the spending is good .
Promoting consumption is the last thing we need to build up a capital stock that has been woefully depleted thanks to malinvestment .
The old economic saw cuts true : there is no such thing as a free lunch , and there is no costless way to fund government spending .
Given that Obama's $ 798 billion stimulus program is a done deal , the only question is which economic poison will the government pick to drink : taxation , borrowing , or inflation ?
It turns out that that answer is all three .
The government 's fiscal response to our current debacle is a near perfect example of what not to do when trying to regain solid economic footing .
While not wanting to be identified as the great tax assessor and , hence , promising to cut taxes for most citizens , Obama is actively seeking ways to increase taxes for a host of Americans .
Imposition of a national sales tax is a very live option sitting atop the Obama Administration 's policy table .
The Administration is also presently considering raising taxes on health care expenditures by taxing employer - provided health care benefits and by decreasing the deductibility of medical expenses .
It wants to raise taxes on cigarettes , adult beverages , and sugar - sweetened elixirs such as soda pop , fruit juices , iced teas , and sweetened coffee drinks .
Obama has proposed raising corporate taxes by $ 190 billion over the next ten years .
He wants to place heavier taxes on commodities and option traders .
Obama even is favorably considering increasing taxes on intangible drilling , an important technique in oil and gas exploration .
While taxing these specific groups may be politically doable , it cannot be good for capital accumulation and economic recovery .
It is already conventional wisdom that a huge part of the stimulus program will be funded by borrowing .
Who would have thought that in his first year in office , Obama 's thirst for red ink would make George W. Bush , himself no foe of government borrowing , look like the frugal presidenté .
The U.S. government reported the first monthly budget deficit in an April in over 25 years and a record budget deficit in the month of May .
The current year 's official deficit is slated to be $ 1.85 trillion ( that 's right , trillion ) !
The good news is that the Obama administration has things under control .
They project that next year 's deficit will only be $ 1.25 trillion .
When the U. S. Treasury spends over a trillion dollars more than it receives in taxes , it must borrow to fill the gap .
In fact , the deluge of government debt has already begun .
The national debt has increased by $ 804 billion in less than five months .
Last week alone investors bought $ 65 billion in long - term Treasury debt .
Not surprisingly , interest rates on Treasury notes have begun to rise .
Already this year interest rates on 10 - year Treasury Bonds have increased 1.4 % , and rates for 30 - year fixed mortgages increased to 5.5 % , the highest they have been since November 2008 .
Higher market interest rates indicate , of course , that loanable funds are becoming relatively more scarce and we know that they are being shunted to less productive uses perpetrated by the state .
Even Ben Bernanke is publicly confessing concerns that fiscal deficits like the ones being projected for the near future will serve as a serious drag on the economy .
One thing that Bernanke is not concerned about is inflation .
Increasing liquidity by expanding the money supply is his drug of choice to prescribe to an ailing economy .
From the first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009 , the monetary base increased from $ 96.2 billion to $ 820.8 billion , an inconceivable annual rate of 753 % .
Such a huge expansion understandably sows seeds of fear of hyperinflation .
If banks , who are presently sitting on a mountain of excess reserves , began to feel things are closer to normal and begin making loans at pre-2008 quantities ( something the government is encouraging ) there will be a gigantic increase in the money supply .
Notwithstanding official worries about deflation , Federal Reserve money supply figures reveal that the money stock has already inflated at a noticeably higher rate .
The Fed 's measure of MZM , money of zero maturity , increased from $ 8356.8 billion in the first quarter of 2008 to $ 9385.5 billion in the first quarter of 2009 .
Additionally , as the table below indicates , the rate of growth in the monetary aggregates accelerated during the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year .
As discussed earlier , economic theory teaches us if the money stock increases , overall prices of goods will be higher than they would be without the increase , because demand for goods will be higher due to increased spending .
While it is not always easy to distinguish between relative and overall price increases when price changes are occurring , it does appear that prices of many goods have resumed an upward trend .
The national average of the price of regular gasoline has increased by 58 cents since the end of April .
It has increased $ 1.01 since the end of last year .
Agricultural crop prices have also been rising steadily this year while reserve grain inventories have shrunk to low levels .
Robert Murphy has recently made us aware that the non-seasonally adjusted consumer price index increased at an annual rate of 4.3 % last month .
All of these trends are consistent with the above mentioned monetary inflation and suggests that , as sound economic analysis tells us , the recent monetary inflation has not provided any real help to the economy in general , but is merely serving to spur increased prices .
The moral of the story is that we are right to be concerned that the Obama stimulus plan will not stimulate economic progress and will not usher in the next age of prosperity .
Government spending merely directs scarce factors of production away from their most productive uses .
Taxation , government borrowing , and monetary inflation all produce negative economic consequences .
Real economic expansion is the product of wise entrepreneurs using capital that is funded by real savings .
Such economic progress results in more goods that can be purchased for lower prices .
As we are seeing play out before our eyes , the only thing that government stimulus plans stimulate is capital consumption and fewer goods available for higher prices — not a recipe for economic recovery .
Attack of the giant squids : Terror as hundreds of 5ft long creatures of the deep invade Californian coastline
Marine biologist John
Hyde holds a jumbo flying squid , which have returned to the Californian coast
Hundreds of aggressive jumbo flying squid have appeared off the coast of San Diego , attacking divers and washing up dead on beaches .
The 5 - foot long sea monsters , which have razor - sharp beaks and toothy tentacles , have been bringing terror to scuba drivers and swimmers on the coast 's tourist - packed beaches .
The carnivorous calamari , which can grow up to 100 pounds , came up from the depths last week and swarms of them have pounced on unsuspecting divers .
Some divers have reported tentacles enveloping their masks and yanking at their cameras and gear , leaving many too scared to go in the water .
Increasing numbers of the squid , which come from Mexico , are being found in California and scientists say they may have moved because of global warming , a shortage of food or a decline in natural predators .
Stories of too - close encounters with the alien - like cephalopods have chased many veteran divers out of the water and created a whirlwind of excitement among the rest , who are torn between their personal safety and the once - in - a - lifetime chance to swim with the deep - sea giants .
The so - called Humboldt squid have been known to attack humans and are nicknamed ' red devils ' for their rust - red coloring and mean streak .
The squid hunt in schools of up to 1,200 , can swim up to 15 mph and can skim over the water to escape predators .
' I would n't go into the water with them for the same reason I would n't walk into a pride of lions on the Serengeti , ' said local diver Mike Bear .
' For all I know , I 'm missing the experience of a lifetime . '
The squid are too deep to bother swimmers and surfers , but many longtime divers say they are staying out of the surf until the sea creatures clear out .
Yet other divers , including Shanda Magill , could n't resist the chance to see the squid up close .
On a recent night , Magill watched in awe as a dozen squid circled her group , tapping the divers before dashing away .
A marine biologist holds the beak of a Humboldt squid which have taken over the Californian coastline , bringing fear to swimmers and divers
The squid 's beaks are almost as large as a grown man 's hand
But the next night , things were different when a large squid surprised Magill by hitting her from behind and grabbing at her with its arms , pulling her sideways in the water .
The powerful creature ripped her buoyancy hose away from her chest and knocked away her light .
When she recovered , she did n't know which direction was up and could n't find the hose to help her stay afloat as she surfaced .
' I just kicked like crazy .
The first thing you think of is , " Oh my gosh , I do n't know if I 'm going to survive this " .
If that squid wanted to hurt me , it would have , ' she said .
Other divers have reported squid pulling at their masks and gear .
Veteran scuba diver and amateur underwater videographer Roger Uzun swam with a swarm of the creatures for about 20 minutes and said they appeared more curious than aggressive .
He said the animals taste with their tentacles and will touch to determine if people are edible .
' As soon as we went underwater and turned on the video lights , there they were .
They would ram into you , they kept hitting the back of my head , ' he said .
The squid have razor sharp teeth and have been known to attack humans
' One got hold of the video light head and yanked on it for two or three seconds and he was actually trying to take the video light with him , ' said Uzun , who later posted a 3 - minute video with his underwater footage on YouTube .
' It almost knocked the video camera out of my hands . '
The wayward squid have also been hauled up by fisherman in waters off Orange County , just north of San Diego .
Research suggests the squid may have established a year - round population off California at depths of 300 to 650 feet and divers have been encountering them at about 60 feet to 80 feet under water .
No one knows how many squid are in the shallow waters , but one biologist estimated they could number in the hundreds , or possibly thousands .
' Usually where there 's one squid , there 's a lot of squid , so I would assume that there 's a good number , ' said John Hyde , a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in San Diego .
Diver Shanda Magill said her light and hose was ripped from her diving rig by a Humboldt squid last week

The toughest package of tax increases and spending cuts in a generation is expected to be unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne in his first Budget .
He will say the measures , designed to tackle Britain 's record deficit of £ 155bn , will be based on fairness , with the better - off paying more .
It is the coalition government 's first Budget , fulfilling the Conservatives ' pre-election pledge to hold a Budget within 50 days of coming to office .

At least 100 Americans arrived in Egypt Sunday and made their way up to the Egypt - Gaza border at Rafah with a rumored 1 million US dollars in medical supplies for the besieged Strip .
Less than a week after Israeli naval boats seized and boarded the Free Gaza ship , the Spirit of Humanity , and as activists from half a dozen countries remain in Israeli prison from the first group of activists , the Americans , with the Viva Palestina movement , will try to enter the Strip via Rafah .
Following the first British Viva Palestina convoy which was allowed into the Strip in early October 2008 , the American group - also lead by British MP George Galloway - will attempt to deliver supplies and show solidarity with the closed - off coastal area .
Forever Typecast , Christopher Reeve as Superman , Roger Moore as James Bond , Jay & Silent Bob
Movies Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
We here at Bullz - Eye always knew that we wanted to run a piece in conjunction with the release of " Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince , " but what we did n't know was what kind of piece it would be .
We considered the matter , and we came to the conclusion that it would 've been a little too easy to whip up a list of our favorite Hollywood wizards .
In the midst of the discussion , however , an observation was raised about the film itself : what 's going to happen to these kids – Daniel Radcliffe , Rupert Grint and Emma Watson – after the last of the " Harry Potter " books has been adapted for the silver screen ?
Will they be able to rise above their roles and find work elsewhere , or are they destined to be remembered solely as Harry , Ron and Hermione ?
From there , we quickly began to bandy about the names of other folks who have and have n't been able to score success in other cinematic identities , and the piece began to write itself .
Ultimately , only one of our selections seemed impossible to pigeonhole as either " Forever Typecast " or " Escaped Typecasting , " and when you see that actor 's name , we think you 'll nod your head knowingly and understand exactly why we had that problem .
FOREVER TYPECAST
Christopher Reeve , AKA Superman
There are worse roles one can be remembered for than the Man of Steel , but as Kirk Alyn and George Reeves would tell you , once you 've worn the cape and the big red S , it 's damned hard to get people to see you without it .
In Reeve 's case , much of the problem stemmed from being a virtual unknown when he scored the break of a lifetime and got hired to play the universe 's most famous Kryptonian .
Although time has , appropriately enough , been very good to his first post - " Superman " film ( " Somewhere in Time " ) , it certainly was n't a box - office smash .
Those who were aware of Reeve 's status as a Juilliard - trained actor were likely unsurprised by his decision to spend his time between " Superman " sequels pursuing parts in such commercially - questionable films as " Monsignor , " set during World War II , " The Bostonians , " the Merchant - Ivory film based on the Henry James novel , and " The Aviator , " George Miller 's tale of a 1920 's mail pilot .
To everyone else , however , it probably just looked like he was trying desperately to distance himself from the role that had established him .
In truth , that did n't really start until after the last of the " Superman " films , with 1988 's " Switching Channels , " but people just did n't buy the guy in a romantic comedy …or in horror films , either , as the 1995 remake of " Village of the Damned " proved .
The great acting continued – see " Remains of the Day " for proof – but nothing seemed to supplant Superman .
Reeve , who died in 2004 , obviously ended up carving a new legacy for himself , with his efforts to increase funding for research toward treatments and cures for paralysis caused by spinal cord injury and other neurological disorders .
But if he had n't had that fateful horseback - riding accident in 1995 , would he have escaped from his most famous role ?
We 'll never know .

Roger Moore , AKA James Bond
Unlike his primary predecessor , once Roger Moore was cast as superspy 007 , it was a part he found nearly impossible to escape .
It did n't help matters that Moore 's acting range was always pretty limited , or that prior to stepping into the role of Bond , he was largely known for playing characters that were somewhat similar to Bond in the TV series ’
" The Saint " and " The Persuaders . "
But from ' 73 to '85 he was James Bond , and following Sean Connery so successfully was no mean feat – just ask George Lazenby .
By the time Moore left Bond , he was 58 , and the roles pretty much dried up , although he 's always seemingly embraced his most famous part , and managed to play Bond types in bad movies like " Boat Trip " and " Spice World . "
Indeed , he seems to have nothing but fond memories of that time in his life , as is evidenced by the full set of commentary tracks he provided for his Bond films on the most recent DVD releases of his 007 tenure .
His humility is perhaps his greatest asset , and these days he devotes nearly all of his time to UNICEF .

Paul Reubens , AKA Pee Wee Herman
As a member of the famous Groundlings comedy troupe in Los Angeles , Paul Reubens had created scores of characters , but one of them would prove to be both his meal ticket and his albatross .
Reubens was knocking around ideas about a guy who loves to do stand - up comedy but is n't terribly good at it .
With the help of fellow Groundling Phil Hartman , Reubens eventually found the voice ( squeaky ) and look ( suit , bow tie , pants about four inches too short ) for Pee - wee Herman .
Pee -
Wee was a huge hit , serving as the basis for a hit play , a beloved television show , and two movies of , well , varying degrees of quality .
The problem was that when it came to securing work , Pee - wee had much better luck than Reubens did , something Reubens only exacerbated by making numerous appearances on sitcoms in character as Pee - wee , pretending that he was real and Reubens did n't exist .
After " Pee - wee 's Playhouse " went off the air in 1990 , Reubens attempted to prove that he had more to offer , as both a comedic actor ( his death scene in the original " Buffy the Vampire Slayer " remains a favorite of ours ) and a dramatic one ( one word : " Blow " ) , but thanks to an ill - advised arrest at a Sarasota movie theater in 1991 – not to mention another charge in 2002 for child pornography – Reubens ' post - Pee - wee existence has been a troubled one .
It appears that Reubens has finally come to terms with this , though , as he is currently working on two different " Pee - Wee " scripts .
Hey , if it ai n't broke … – David Medsker
Bela Lugosi , AKA Dracula
As Nosferatu , Max Schreck may have been cinema 's first iconic vampire , but when push comes to shove , the only vampire that really matters is Count Dracula … and the only Count Dracula that really matters is the one portrayed by Bela Lugosi in 1931 .
Although Lugosi – who , believe it or not , really was born within spitting distance of the Transylvania border – had been an actor for years in his native Hungary as well as Germany , it was n't until making the move to America in the early 1920s that he truly embarked on his path to Hollywood .
There 's no question that Lugosi 's performance as Dracula is the most iconic of all time ( as our own Mr. Westal said , " If someone says , " Talk like a vampire , " you do n't launch into a Gary Oldman or Christopher Lee impression " ) , but what do you do when your performance is too iconic ?
In Lugosi 's case , he was n't exactly thrilled that he'd been forced into the niche of playing " the boogey man " – his phrase – almost exclusively , but he did the best he could with the situation .
Still , it must 've hurt when he turned in a perfectly fine performance alongside Greta Garbo in the comedy " Ninotchka , " only to find no change in his fortunes .
As those who 've seen Tim Burton 's " Ed Wood " know , Lugosi 's later years found him suffering through a stream of grade - B ( and lower ) films , and when the grim reaper finally came to call…yes , Bauhaus fans , Bela Lugosi 's dead …he was laid to rest wearing one of his Dracula outfits .
Now that 's some serious typecasting .

Anthony Perkins , AKA Norman Bates
Here 's a guy who genuinely could have been one of the great character actors , if only Hitchcock had n't come along and cast him as one of the most iconic movie characters of the '60s .
These days , a cross - dressing killer with mother issues may seem old hat , but it 's easy to forget that in 1960 , everything about Norman Bates was revolutionary .
He was the monster living next door , and it scared the hell out of people .
Afterwards , he continued to work , but in projects that were never as memorable as " Psycho . "
The bulk of his other film work was eventually forgotten by most , but Bates was permanently lodged in people 's minds .
He finally , after 23 years , agreed to play the part once again in 1983's " Psycho II , " a move the led to him getting cast in Norman Bates - type roles in movies such as " Crimes of Passion " and " Edge of Sanity . "
Clearly he was riding the gravy train by this point , as he also returned to the role another two times : " Psycho III " ( which he also directed ) came out in ' 86 , and 1990 featured his final Bates outing , the TV movie " Psycho IV : The Beginning , " in which Henry Thomas played the teenage Bates while Perkins reminisced on a radio talk show .
Mother would not be happy .

Jason Mewes & Kevin Smith , AKA Jay & Silent Bob
We 're included both of these gentlemen in one listing because it 's almost impossible to think of them separately .
As the story goes , Kevin Smith had intended to play the role of Randal Graves in " Clerks " ( he has said that this is why Randal has the best lines in the film ) , but when it became apparent that helming the film was going to take up too much of his time , he deferred to Jeff Anderson in the role and took on the lesser part of Silent Bob .
As for Jason Mewes , however , one gets the impression that he pretty much is Jay , so there was n't a great deal of acting involved there .
Since the View Askew - niverse wrapped up with " Clerks II , " Mewes has still managed to work steadily , but trying to escape from playing a drug dealer by appearing in " High Hopes , " a film revolving around a bunch of guys trying to steal government marijuana , is n't exactly what you 'd call stretching one 's wings , and when Mewes appeared alongside Paris Hilton in " Bottoms Up , " his best friend was played by …guess who ?
… Kevin Smith .
Even in his other roles ( most of which have been in films that have gone straight to video ) , it 's hard to get past his inherent Jay - ness .
As for Smith , his regular behind - the - camera gigs have kept him from working very hard to get away from the role of Silent Bob , but while we 'll give him credit for his performances in " Catch and Release " and " Live Free and Die Hard , " the problem is that …well , the guy is Silent Bob .
The only difference is that , once you get him talking , you 'll be hard pressed to ever get Kevin Smith to be silent again .
As such , he 's probably going to be stuck being called by his character 's name for the rest of his life .

No one could have imagined how big of a cult sensation " The Evil Dead " would become back in 1981 , but while the low - budget horror classic served as a springboard for director Sam Raimi into the big leagues , the film 's star , Bruce Campbell , was left in the dust .
Though he revived the character of the smart - mouthed , chainsaw - wielding Ash for two more sequels , Campbell spent a lifetime trying to distance himself from the iconic role – so much so that he 's been known to sign autographs as Bruce " Do n't Call Me Ash " Campbell .
When he finally did put the character to rest in 1992's " Army of Darkness , " the Michigan - born actor found it difficult to find any sort of decent work .
Two failed ( but relatively good ) TV series later , and the only thing Campbell had to show for himself was a recurring stint on the Raimi - produced " Hercules : The Legendary Journeys " and a handful of generic hero - type roles in a slew of made - for - TV movies .
Campbell came awfully close to reinventing himself as an elderly Elvis Presley in 2002's " Bubba Ho-tep , " but despite an award - worthy performance , the film failed to perform as anything other than a fun midnight movie .
The actor eventually embraced his notoriety as a B - movie action hero in the horror / comedy send - up , " My Name Is Bruce , " and has even carved out a nice role for himself in the USA spy drama , " Burn Notice , " but do n't think for a second that it 's quelled the cries for another " Evil Dead " film .
The good news ?
Raimi and Campbell have hinted that something 's in the works .

Judd Nelson , AKA Bender
You can't help but think that when Judd Nelson read the script for " The Breakfast Club , " he triumphantly pumped his fist in the air in the same manner as his character John Bender in that movie 's iconic final scene .
Bender provided Nelson with a showcase to display the actor 's versatility ; he 's funny yet insightful , tough yet cowardly , and most importantly he 's eminently quotable .
It 's the kind of role that few grown - up actors ever get the chance to play , and Nelson , then a mere 25 and with only two movies to his credit at the time of its release , knocked it out of the park .
His star seemed destined to rise even higher with the release of the Brat Pack dramedy " St. Elmo 's Fire " a mere four months after " Breakfast Club , " but alas , only John Parr managed to score a hit with that one .
Nelson continued to stay busy in the ensuing years , trying his hand at anything from broad comedy ( " From the Hip " ) to crime dramas ( " Blue City , " " New Jack City " ) and even provided the voice of Rodimus Prime in the original animated " Transformers " movie .
However , most of those projects did poorly – Nelson even received Razzie nominations for his work in " Blue City " and " From the Hip " – or in the case of " New Jack City , " succeeded for reasons other than Nelson 's involvement .
He had a three - season stint as Brooke Shields ' almost - brother - in - law ( and boss ) on " Suddenly Susan , " but when he made an appearance on a 2007 episode of " Family Guy , " it was , you guessed it , as John Bender .
Fortunately for Nelson , he never seems to have trouble finding work ; that next Bender - esque role , however , continues to elude him .

Jon Heder , AKA Napoleon Dynamite
Much like the boy wizard who inspired this feature , it 's probably a little early to be declaring Jon Heder forever Napoleon Dynamite , but based on his small body of work thus far , it certainly gets closer to becoming true every year .
For all intents and purposes , " Napoleon Dynamite " should have never become the pop culture phenomenon that swept the nation in the summer of 2004 , but after earning strong buzz at Sundance several months earlier , the quirky high school comedy became the year 's official Little Indie That Could .
Though the film 's script was certainly original enough to warrant attention , it was Heder 's performance as the geek chic title character that made it so oddly enjoyable .
Donning a wardrobe consisting of outdated specs and half - worn moon boots , as well as the now iconic burnt - orange , lopsided afro , Heder created a character so incredible dorky that he would have fit right in with the Lambda Lambda Lambdas .
Heder certainly made the most of his 15 minutes of fame by booking as many gigs as possible over the next few years – including some pretty high - profile films alongside the likes of Reese Witherspoon ( " Just Like Heaven " ) and Will Ferrell ( " Blades of Glory " ) – but even without the hair and costume , it was virtually impossible to look at him and not think of Napoleon Dynamite .
The fact that his acting skills are somewhat limited to playing the dork / loser / doofus only makes his chances of escaping typecasting even less likely , but there 's still time to prove us wrong .

Ralph Macchio , AKA The Karate Kid
It ’s easy to imagine Ralph Macchio sitting at home , drinking Scotch in his boxers and watching “ The Outsiders ” over and over again , wondering what his career would ’ve been like if his next movie had n’t been “ The Karate Kid . ”
It ’s not that the decision to appear in a film about a teenager who learns to defend himself with the aid of a wizened Japanese karate instructor was a bad move .
It ’s just that …well , have you looked at the cast of “ The Outsiders ” ?
Tom Cruise , Matt Dillon , Diane Lane , Rob Lowe , Patrick Swayze , Emilio Estevez …geez , even C. Thomas
Howell is remembered for more than one role !
At first , Macchio tried to expand his palate , tackling the Robert Johnson inspired “ Crossroads , ” but when he dared to play Daniel - San for two “ Karate Kid ” sequels as well , it became hard to think of him as anyone else .
But here ’s the thing : Macchio really was n’t that memorable an actor to begin with .
This is perhaps most evident with his lone high - profile role of his post - “ Kid ” career , playing Billy Gambini in “ My Cousin Vinny . ”
Be honest , now : how often have you come across the film on cable and found yourself thinking , “ Oh , that ’s right : I forgot Ralph Macchio was in this ” ?
If you look at his credits for the past several years , they ’re rather paltry , and two of the most high - profile gigs – “ Entourage ” and “ Head Case ” – have found him playing himself .
Dare we suggest that this may be where his greatest strength as an actor lies ?

Jim Varney , AKA Ernest
One of the greatest yet ultimately saddest moments in the recorded history of actor Jim Varney came with a segment that the NBC Nightly News did about him in 1984 .
At the time , Varney had yet to do a single one of his famed “ Ernest ” movies , but he ’d done a plethora of commercials which had earned him considerable regional fame , and during the segment ( which you can see for yourself right here ) , the man delivers Shakespearean dialogue in a manner which instantly dismisses any theory that he was , as an actor , a mere one - trick pony .
Unfortunately , the world rarely saw him outside of his Ernest guise , and if truth be told , Varney did n’t try all that hard to get away from it , doing nine “ Ernest ” movies , a TV series , and more commercials than you ’d ever want to try and count .
He popped up in several other films during his career , but the only one of real note was his performance as Jed Clampett in “ The Beverly Hillbillies , ” and even that was ultimately playing to the Southern stereotype that he ’d already perfected .
We ’d be remiss if we did n’t also remember him for his voiceover work as Slinky Dog in the “ Toy Story ” films ( though we ’re already sad at the thought of the 3rd film without him ) , but that ’s but a slight recollection .
To virtually everyone , Jim Varney was Ernest P. Worrell …and always will be .

Mark Hamill , AKA Luke Skywalker
Mark Hamill may not have had much in the way of cinematic credits when he was introduced to the world as Luke Skywalker , future Jedi , in " Star Wars , " but he'd sure as heck done his time on the TV circuit , appearing on everything from " The Partridge Family " to " The Streets of San Francisco , " even playing a guy named Doobie Wheeler on " The Texas Wheelers . "
But when you 're the star of the greatest space opera of all time , you 've got to expect a certain amount of blowback , and Hamill got it in spades .
Despite starring in the fondly remembered " Corvette Summer " with Annie Potts and being directed by Samuel Fuller in the critically acclaimed " The Big Red One , " things just were n't happening for the guy outside of the " Star Wars " universe … well , unless you consider being third - billed to Kristy McNichol and Dennis Quaid in " The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia " to be happening , that is .
Post - " Return of the Jedi , " Hamill did a few straight - to - video features before realizing that he might well find more luck off the camera and in the recording booth .
Having already worked for Hanna - Barbera in the early ' 70s , it was a quick transition for Hamill to return to the world of voiceover acting , and it was a move that paid off in a big way .
Whether you 've known it or not , you 've heard his dulcet tones providing voices for " The Adventures of Batman & Robin " ( The Joker ) , " Spider - Man " ( Hobgoblin ) , " Avatar : The Last Airbender " ( Ozai ) , and " Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go ! " ( The Skeleton King ) , among dozens of others .
Good for him , we say .
But the truth of the matter remains : when you see his face , Mark Hamill is still Luke Skywalker .

Robert Englund , AKA Freddy Krueger
You would n't think that a man whose true face is buried under a ton of burned - flesh makeup would be sufficiently recognizable to be typecast .
Leave it to Mr. Englund , however , to manage it , anyway .
In the days before he portrayed the child - murdering , claw - wielding Freddy Krueger , he 'd narrated the classic surfing flick , " Big Wednesday , " and done a fair amount of movie and TV work , most notably as the Visitor named Willie in " V. "
After the first " Nightmare on Elm Street " flick , however , it appeared that Englund had finally found his wheelhouse : the horror industry .
His is an interesting case , since it seems pretty clear that he never really tried to escape from the legacy of Freddy Krueger .
If you look back at his resume , he basically just dived headlong into the fray of the frightening , first taking the opportunity to direct his own horror film ( " 976 - EVIL " ) , then appearing as the title character in a remake of " Phantom of the Opera , " playing the Marquis de Sade in " Night Terrors , " and showing up in such semi-classics as " The Mangler , " " Wishmaster , " " Urban Legend , " and " Strangeland . "
Englund has n't played Mr. Krueger since 2003's " Freddy vs. Jason , " but nor has he dared to step outside of the realm of the macabre .
We do n't anticipate that will change anytime soon .

Juliette Lewis , AKA Generic White Trash
Dear , sweet Juliette , why did you do it ?
As the ' 80s ended and the '90s began , you were doing so well with your acting career , showing off your versatility by turning in performances in both comedies ( " National Lampoon 's Christmas Vacation " ) and dramas ( " Cape Fear " ) , and you were really on our radar as an up - and - coming actress to keep an eye out for .
But then it happened : you went white trash on us .
First , there was Adele in " Kalifornia , " where you played opposite Brad Pitt and turned in a performance where we truly believed you were sweet as pie but as dumb as a box of rocks .
Then , you decided to take on Oliver Stone 's " Natural Born Killers , " and we came to know you as Mallory Knox , who was like a pissed - off , take - no - shit version of Adele .
Honey , when you do two characters that similar to each other that close together , that 's how people are going to remember you .
Not that you did n't try to escape your destiny , of course , but apparently your " Natural Born Killers " co-star , Robert Downey Jr. , neglected to tell you that " you never go full retard , " because that 's exactly what you did in " The Other Sister . "
We 've never forgiven you for that , you know .
Oh , but of course you know , because since then , you have n't really tried to step very far outside of your box , have you ?
" Old School , " " Starsky and Hutch , " even " Catch and Release , " they 've all been characters who were less than brilliant and far from highly educated .
Hey , whatever works for you , Juliette .

Kermit the Frog
It 's tough being a little frog with big dreams , but clearly , over the years , Kermit has demonstrated that he knows how to make the Rainbow Connection .
But behind the scenes , his personal life must be fraught with insecurity .
Here 's a guy that started out as a bit player on “ Sesame Street ” and eventually moved on to hosting his own variety show .
After that , the movies beckoned , but he 's never really been able to do much of anything outside of play Kermit the Frog .
It 's the one role he cannot escape , and it 's not for a lack of trying .
While he embraced his most famous persona in the first few Muppet movies , he attempted to tackle more serious roles such as Bob Cratchit in " The Muppet Christmas Carol , " Captain Abraham Smollett in " Muppet Treasure Island , " and the Scarecrow in the utterly dire " The Muppets ' Wizard of Oz . "
It seemed the harder that Kermit tried to break away from his own personality , the less successful the results , and people became disenchanted with the franchise .
He 's not been seen too often as of late , but let 's all hope that he has n't turned to alcohol and drugs , like many a frustrated performer before him .
It ai n't easy bein ' green , indeed .

ESCAPED TYPECASTING
Harrison Ford , Once Known As Han Solo / Indiana Jones
Not many actors get the opportunity to battle back against typecasting by playing different characters in two of the most successful motion picture franchises of all time , but you 've got to admit : it worked out pretty damned well for Harrison Ford .
For a guy who was all but ready to give up the glory of acting for a life in carpentry , it must 've seemed thoroughly unreal for Ford when he picked up the role of the smuggler and mercenary known as Han Solo and subsequently saw " Star Wars " go through the roof .
After that , he did n't have much choice but to move forward in his career as a professional thespian , but aside from his role as Colonel Lucas in Francis Ford Coppola 's " Apocalypse Now , " most of his work was in grade - B films .
( Look , I like " Force 10 from Navarone " as much as the next guy , but it ai n't high art . )
Good thing , then , that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas decided to bring him about to play the serial - inspired action hero in " Raiders of the Lost Ark . "
In between playing Han Solo and Indiana Jones , Ford became another sci-fi icon by playing Rick Deckard in Ridley Scott 's " Blade Runner , " but after wrapping " Temple of Doom , " he clearly decided to cure his case of sequel - itis , earning his first Academy Award nomination for playing Detective John Book in " Witness . "
It soon became apparent that Ford was a bankable actor no matter who he was playing , and once that happened , any possibility of typecasting was gone … well , unless you consider " action hero " to be typecasting .
It 's still not easy to accept the words " Harrison Ford " and " comedy " in the same sentence , but given the success of his performances as Jack Ryan , Dr. Richard Kimble , and President James Marshall , just to name a few , you sure can't say that the man 's locked into any one character .
Sigourney Weaver , OKA Ellen Ripley
" Alien " was n't Sigourney Weaver 's first film , but for all practical purposes , it might as well have been .
To look at her IMDb listing , the only other credits to her name at the time were as one of Alvy Singer 's unnamed dates in " Annie Hall " and as…well , actually , her role in the 1978 film " Madmen " was apparently so small as to not even have a character name .
( That , or no one who works for IMDb has ever seen it , a theory which seems more probable when you realize that almost no one else in the film is listed with a character name . )
The fact that she 's since done three sequels to " Alien , " even earning an Academy Award nomination for her performance in the second film of the quadrilogy , makes it all the more surprising that she 's not more consistently referred to as Sigourney " Ripley " Weaver .
Her solution ?
She mixed it up .
A lot .
By the time she got around to making " Aliens , " she 'd already done a comedy with Chevy Chase ( " Deal of the Century " ) , worked alongside Mel Gibson in Peter Weir 's " The Year of Living Dangerously , " and participated in the stellar ensemble of Peter Yates ' " Eyewitness . "
( Never seen it ?
It also stars William Hurt , Christopher Plummer , James Woods , and Morgan Freeman ! )
Of course , it also did n't hurt that she found herself playing a part in the multi-million dollar success story of " Ghostbusters " during that pre -" Aliens " time frame .
Looking at her credits , it 's clear that Weaver has never been afraid to switch from one genre to the next , providing top - notch dramatic and comedic performances at the drop of a hat .
Yes , we 're always happy to see her fighting back against her acid - blooded alien nemeses , but she 's such a strong actress that , really , we 're happy to see her anywhere .
Tim Curry , OKA Dr. Frank N. Furter
By all counts , playing cinema 's most famous singing and dancing cross-dressing alien should have kept Tim Curry from ever working again .
It was the perfect fusion of actor and character , and he's so well known for the role , that to this day it seems impossible for anyone else to play the part without falling short somewhere along the way .
It remains the role for which he is most famous .
But Curry defied the odds by being a damn fine actor , and transforming himself into a wide variety of different characters over the years , and proving just how versatile he really was .
He can sing and dance obviously , but he can also tackle serious drama when it comes his way .
Look no further than his role as Darkness in Ridley Scott 's " Legend , " a part that required him to act from beneath mounds of makeup and costume , and yet he does a fantastic job in a role that most actors would 've been overwhelmed by .
In the very same year he brought the Devil to life , he also gave us Wadsworth , the butler in " Clue , " who , in an unusual move for a butler , was arguably the film 's lead .
In the '90s Curry often played smaller character roles in a wide variety of films ranging from " The Hunt for Red October " to " The Shadow " to " Oscar . "
One of the great roles of his long career was that of the sleazy Rev. Ray Porter in 1988 's rarely seen " Pass the Ammo , " a movie for which a DVD release is long overdue .
These days he can mostly be found doing loads of voice work for all manner of animation .
The multitalented Curry does n't appear to show any signs of slowing down , and for that we should all be grateful .

Julie Andrews , OKA Mary Poppins / Maria
There was a time when Julie Andrews was sugary , syrupy sweet – the virgin queen of the silver screen .
It was around the time she starred in two hugely popular musicals , " Mary Poppins " and " The Sound of Music . "
She made one movie in between them , the criminally underrated and nearly forgotten " The Americanization of Emily , " and afterwards starred in stuff like " Hawaii " and " Star ! , " but never really broke the sudsy stereotype until she married director Blake Edwards and he started casting her in his movies .
The two that really helped her shed her '60s screen personas were " 10 , " in which she played the girlfriend of a philandering Dudley Moore , and most especially " S.O.B. , " which echoed her frustrations with her career , and in which she bared her breasts for the world to see – a hugely bold maneuver for someone of her standing at that time of her life .
Of course , perhaps the greatest role of her career was that of Victoria Grant , in Edwards ' gender - bending musical comedy " Victor / Victoria , " a movie that pretty much wrapped up everything Andrews was good at into one hilariously entertaining package .
In recent years she 's found another outlet for her talents : providing a voice for the Queen in the " Shrek ' movies .

Sean Connery , OKA James Bond
You know how James Bond can be put in the most impossible situation and still escape ?
By the time the third Bond film , " Goldfinger , " launched a worldwide spy craze in 1965 , Connery had gone from a little - known television actor to a level of recognition rivaling Mickey Mouse in the space of three years , and his chances of transcending 007 seemed about as likely as Mickey taking the lead in " Macbeth . "
( A part Connery had actually played on TV . )
He turned in strong performances in Alfred Hitchcock 's 1964 romantic thriller , " Marnie , " and Sidney Lumet 's ultra - gritty 1965 military prison drama , " The Hill , " but the actor who had once personally disarmed Hollywood gangster Johnny Stompanato was stymied by his own skill at embodying the role of the suave super - assassin .
Still , by 1972 Connery had left Bondage – apparently for good – after six films .
He began experimenting with facial hair onscreen .
He donned a turban for a role as an Arab chieftain in " The Wind and the Lion . "
He allowed his balding head to appear onscreen for his role in John Huston 's " The Man Who Would Be King . "
The hair grew even thinner when he played a disillusioned Robin Hood opposite Audrey Hepburn in Richard Lester 's " Robin and Marian . "
By 1983 he was a hugely bankable , fully bald star in his own right and far enough away from typecasting that he was ready to shave and re-don his toupee in the appropriately titled non-canonical Bond film , " Never Say Never Again . "
The movie was n't so hot , but it was cool .
The toupee came off .
The mustaches and beards returned , and so did Connery 's aging tough - guy roles with megahits like " The Untouchables . "
In movies , image may not be everything , but it 's a lot .

SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE TWO ...
Peter Sellers ( Inspector Clouseau )
When the idea for this list first started being bandied about amongst the Bullz - Eye writers , one of the first names I threw out as a candidate was Peter Sellers , and while everyone seemed to agree he was a worthwhile candidate , we could n't really decide on whether or not he'd been Forever Typecast , or if he 'd escaped typecasting .
The truth is somewhere in between .
Ask most any Joe on the street who Peter Sellers played , and you 'll likely 9 times out of 10 hear the same answer : Inspector Jacques Clouseau .
There 's something to be said for that public perception , and no doubt the fact that he played the role five times ( six of you count the posthumous release of " Trail of the Pink Panther , " in which his performance was comprised of outtakes and flashbacks from the previous films ) contributes to the stigma .
Nevertheless , many either have n't seen or they 've forgotten the cache of work he amassed before , during and after the times he played Clouseau .
Who can forget his Clare Quilty in Kubrick 's " Lolita , " or all three roles he played Stanley 's next film , " Dr. Strangelove ? "
The '60s also saw him in fare like " What 's New Pussycat ? , " " The Party " ( in which he played a bumbling Indian ) , " The Magic Christian , " in which he co-starred with Ringo Starr , and the counter - culture comedy " I Love You , Alice B. Toklas . "
The '70s clearly were n't an easy ride for Sellers , which is no doubt why he kept returning to the safety of Clouseau , although he still managed to find other things to do such as " Murder By Death " and a comedy take on " The Prisoner of Zenda . "
Finally , in ' 79 , he seemingly beat Clouseau with his Oscar - nominated performance in Hal Ashby 's sublime comedy , " Being There , " and he passed away shortly after .
While many may only remember Sellers for one part , there 's an entire subculture of fans devoted to every role of his but Jacques Clouseau .

A little piece of Internet history has now been laid to rest , as CompuServe was shut down for good just before this Fourth of July weekend .
After some 30 years of service , CompuServe 's new owner has finally pulled the plug , leaving us to reminisce about the days when the Internet was young and we were still using modems whose speed was measured in baud .
Most of us remember CompuServe fondly as one of the main Internet services from the 80s and 90s , and associate it with some of our first dabblings in the online world .
Along with Prodigy , CompuServe offered a data connection to people across the globe , a connection that few had previously had at home .
It set an early example for companies like AOL and even Apple 's eWorld that launched in the early - to - mid 90s .
AOL eventually became the new hotness and ended up acquiring CompuServe 's online services in 1997 , vowing to keep CompuServe online and operational as a separate service from AOL .
That was then , though , and this is now .
As AOL 's online services became increasingly irrelevant in today 's broadband world ( as evidenced by Time Warner 's recent decision to spin off AOL ) , CompuServe — eventually renamed CompuServe Classic — was kept around as a nostalgic throwback to the Internet days of yore .
It comes as no surprise , then , that AOL decided finally to close the doors on CompuServe this month .
In fact , it 's surprising that CompuServe managed to stay alive for this long .
Did anyone still use it in 2009 ?
( If you did , please tell us why in the comments ! )
CompuServe users are still allowed to use their e-mail addresses on AOL 's system for no charge , but the rest of the service and software is going the way of the dodo .
As pointed out by Basex analyst David Goldes , the most current version of CompuServe 's client software dates back to 1999 for Windows NT 4.0.2 .
Vintage stuff .
With that , we bid farewell to CompuServe and to all the memories we had of the once - great service .
So long , CompuServe , and thanks for all the fish !

You know the international financial crisis has implications in every aspect of global life when the pope decides to weigh in .
Today Benedict XVI issued his third encyclical focusing on the economy .
It is widely seen as directed at G - 8 leaders gathering in Italy this week .
The pope speaks about the need to use the economy to aid the poor and care for the environment , but he also supports globalization as a way to relieve poverty and backs the idea of a free market .
Here are some excerpts from the encyclical , titled “ Charity in Truth ” that deal with the economy , business and finance :
The Church has always held that economic action is not to be regarded as something opposed to society .
In and of itself , the market is not , and must not become , the place where the strong subdue the weak .
Society does not have to protect itself from the market , as if the development of the latter were ipso facto to entail the death of authentically human relations .
Admittedly , the market can be a negative force , not because it is so by nature , but because a certain ideology can make it so .
It must be remembered that the market does not exist in the pure state .
It is shaped by the cultural configurations which define it and give it direction .
Economy and finance , as instruments , can be used badly when those at the helm are motivated by purely selfish ends .
Instruments that are good in themselves can thereby be transformed into harmful ones .
But it is man ’s darkened reason that produces these consequences , not the instrument per se .
Therefore it is not the instrument that must be called to account , but individuals , their moral conscience and their personal and social responsibility .
…
The economy needs ethics in order to function correctly — not any ethics whatsoever , but an ethics which is people - centered .
Today we hear much talk of ethics in the world of economy , finance and business .
…
When we consider the issues involved in the relationship between business and ethics , as well as the evolution currently taking place in methods of production , it would appear that the traditionally valid distinction between profit - based companies and non-profit organizations can no longer do full justice to reality , or offer practical direction for the future .
In recent decades a broad intermediate area has emerged between the two types of enterprise .
It is made up of traditional companies which nonetheless subscribe to social aid agreements in support of underdeveloped countries , charitable foundations associated with individual companies , groups of companies oriented towards social welfare , and the diversified world of the so - called “ civil economy ” and the “ economy of communion ” .
This is not merely a matter of a “ third sector ” , but of a broad new composite reality embracing the private and public spheres , one which does not exclude profit , but instead considers it a means for achieving human and social ends .
Whether such companies distribute dividends or not , whether their juridical structure corresponds to one or other of the established forms , becomes secondary in relation to their willingness to view profit as a means of achieving the goal of a more humane market and society .
It is to be hoped that these new kinds of enterprise will succeed in finding a suitable juridical and fiscal structure in every country .
Without prejudice to the importance and the economic and social benefits of the more traditional forms of business , they steer the system towards a clearer and more complete assumption of duties on the part of economic subjects .
And not only that .
The very plurality of institutional forms of business gives rise to a market which is not only more civilized but also more competitive .
…
Finance , therefore — through the renewed structures and operating methods that have to be designed after its misuse , which wreaked such havoc on the real economy — now needs to go back to being an instrument directed towards improved wealth creation and development .
Insofar as they are instruments , the entire economy and finance , not just certain sectors , must be used in an ethical way so as to create suitable conditions for human development and for the development of peoples .
It is certainly useful , and in some circumstances imperative , to launch financial initiatives in which the humanitarian dimension predominates .
However , this must not obscure the fact that the entire financial system has to be aimed at sustaining true development .
Above all , the intention to do good must not be considered incompatible with the effective capacity to produce goods .
Financiers must rediscover the genuinely ethical foundation of their activity , so as not to abuse the sophisticated instruments which can serve to betray the interests of savers .
Right intention , transparency , and the search for positive results are mutually compatible and must never be detached from one another .
If love is wise , it can find ways of working in accordance with provident and just expediency , as is illustrated in a significant way by much of the experience of credit unions .

Richard Dawkins launches children 's summer camp for atheists
Godless alternative : Richard Dawkins is subsidising an atheist summer camp in Somerset to introduce children to a different way of thinking
The author of controversial book The God Delusion is helping to launch Britain 's first summer retreat for non-believers .
Richard Dawkins is subsidising the camp which will offer children aged eight to 17 the chance to sing along to John Lennon 's Imagine and have lessons in evolution .
The five - day camp , based in Somerset , promises to be ' beyond belief ' - the event 's motto - and will rival traditional faith - based breaks run by the Scouts and church groups .
As well as traditional camp pursuits such as trekking and tug - of - war attendees will be given lessons in moral philosophy and evolutionary biology as well as debating otherworldly activities such as crop circles and telepathy .
There will even be a £ 10 prize for the child who can disprove the existence of the mythical unicorn .
And instead of finishing up the day with a toasted marshmallow and round of Kim - bi - ya budding atheists will belt out ' Imagine there 's no heaven ... and no religion too . '
Dawkins said the camp was designed to ' encourage children to think for themselves sceptically and rationally . '
The event has been held in America for 13 years and was set up in the UK by Samantha Stein , a postgraduate psychology student from London .
The 23 - year - old said the 24 places available were now taken and she hoped to expand next year after receiving hundreds more inquiries .
She said the camp , to be held from July 27 to July 31 , was not intended to convert children but to introduce them to a different way of thinking .
Camp atheist : Children will debunk crop circles and sing John Lennon
' It is not about changing what they think , but the way that they think .
' There is very little that attacks religion , we are not a rival to religious camps .
' We exist as a secular alternative open to children from parents of all faiths and none . '
The theme of the camp is evolution , to coincide with the Darwin 200th anniversary celebrations this year .
The programme includes canoeing , drama , nature walks , singing and swimming .
There will also be philosophical and scientific discussion for children who will be taught about evolution and that ethical behaviour is not dependent on religious belief and doctrines .
Christian organisations which run summer camps include the Church Pastoral Aid Society , an evangelical group which operates 100 holiday schemes ' giving young people a chance to meet Jesus Christ ' .
Polytope Models .
A variety of models are availabe to view : regular polyhedra , regular polychora , truncted polytopes , edge - truncated polytopes , snub ( ? ) polytopes , tori ( duoprisms ) , Cayley grahs ( omnitruncated polytopes ) , etc .
My favorite is the bitruncated 120 - cell .
Viewing Options .
The scroll wheel ( or arrow keys ) zoom in and out , and SHIFT + ARROW pans for those hard - to - reach shots .
Full - screen is buggy and can be turned on but not off .
Motion .
The models float around ( rotating with six degrees of freedom ) with nearly constant velocity .
The motion can be controlled with all three mouse buttons ( each fixing a pair of axes of the 3 - sphere ) ; spacebar toggles the brakes , which are on by default .
To get some funky motion , or just keep a model in one place , you can enable a spring tying the model to a " center " positon .
If the model moves too fast or too slowly , try slowing down or speeding up .
Flying .
In flying mode , the right mouse button controlls speed and the left mouse button steers direction .
It helps to zoom in , and maybe turn off faces ( f ) and fatten the edges (+ ) .
Style Options .
Both solid and line - art rendering are available ( see style menu or press ' h ' ) .
Vertex and edge - drawing can be toggled .
Drawing thickness can be adjusted , and fog can be added to aid depth perception .
Camera .
Models can be viewed in either mono or stereo .
Jenn now allows motion and depth - of - field blurring .
Screen - shots can be taken with extended exposure time and increased rendering quality .
The accumulation buffer also provides high - contrast viewing and color - reversing
Saving .
( when compiled with libpng support )
Images can be saved to color or grayscale png images ( jenn_capture.png ) .
Jenn3d can make very large images ( &ge 1 GigaPixel ) by tiling the images .
But Beware !
large high - quality images take alot of time and disk space , e.g. 1 day and 100 Megs .
For high quality images like that above , and those on wikipedia , I usually take a picure double - sized and downsample by a factor of two .
Exporting .
You can save 3D mesh models to .STL files with the ' export ' button .
Note that toggling between high / low quality in Jenn3D changes the output mesh density ( try viewing in wireframe style to see this ) .
For 3d - printing ( stereolithography ) you might want to increase the minimum tube radius ( after version 2008:03:13 ) .
The added radius is not shown in Jenn3D ( still on the to - implement queue ) , so you 'll have to view with your favorite STL file viewer to get it right .
Some users have reported good results with Magics and 3dconverter .
Let me know about how exporting works for you .
Bugs .
Libpng does not seem to work ( even compile ) under Cygwin .
Jenn can usually switch to fullscreen mode ( ' f ' ) but not back .
This is really a bug in the Glut library , and apparently has no fix . :(
Scroll wheel does not seem to work in MacOS or Windows .
This is apparently a flaw in the Glut library .

Used games have been a hot topic for a while now .
Many believe that used games are nothing more than an excuse by retailers to boost profit margins .
And it ’s widely known that developers have lost a lot of money over used games , with overall sales figures taking a big hit .
But now , Visceral Games has revealed something regarding used games in relation to their title that will shock the gaming community .
EA ’s Glen Schofield , also studio manager for the the Dead Space team at Visceral Games , has revealed some surprising new data .
According to Schofield , twice as many people have played Dead Space as bought it .
What we mean by that is despite selling approximately 1.5 million copies , over 3 million unique users have played the game according to data collected from 360 and PS3 owners who have logged online .
Those who never take their consoles online are impossible to count .
Schofield explains it in more detail :
“ We looked at how many we sold .
We also looked at — we did n’t have online which is one of the big features that you need to have to kind of keep it in the house a little bit longer these days .
But then we also did studies on sort of how many unique users there were on the PSN network and Xbox Live .
And realized , you know what , there ’s over three million people that have played Dead Space .
Maybe we ’ve only sold 1.5 million or whatever the number is .
But there ’s something there because that means that , ok , there were a lot of used sales .
So there ’s a lot of people when I go out and talk to [ them ] … it seems that everybody has played it or heard about it or whatever . ”
The number of used copies of Dead Space may be due to limited replayability , as the title had no multiplayer or co-operative mode .
One of the hosts for EA ’s official podcast asked the question if adding online was key .
Schofield responded with the following :
“ I think it ’s bang for the buck is really what we ’re looking at right now these days and going : ‘ OK , we came out at 60 bucks and so did some of these other games that had online that maybe people could play for 50 hours , right ?
Or they had tons and tons of PDLC [ paid downloadable content ] so they could play it for 40 , 50 hours again .
Or we were up against Fallout , which was a 50 - hour game to begin with .
So , we did n’t look at it and say we have to have online .
What we said we ’ve got to be bang for the buck .
Some people could get through our game in 10 hours or so , so we learned . ”
Do you believe if Dead Space had either co-op or multiplayer , that new sales would have been much higher than used sales ?

Oh sure , you purchased some expensive backup and restore package that 's serving you quite well and you do n't need a replacement .
What 's that ?
It is n't serving you well ?
That 's odd .
The expensive stuff is supposed to be awesome and failure free - after all , that 's why you paid so much for it , right ?
Cover Your Assets : Backup and Restore are major pain points for any business ; ease yours inexpensively .
The truth is there 's no perfect software backup solution .
However , there is a method that comes close to perfect : Disk - to - disk file copy .
Do you think that it 's too simple to be effective ?
Think again .
Even in the largest enterprises , many system administrators , frustrated by backup and restore failure , resort to such primitive measures .
It 's cheap , reliable , fast and  hey , wait  what happened to the old adage , " Cheap , reliable , fast ; choose any two ? "
That old saw went out with the introduction of fast and inexpensive Serial ATA ( SATA ) hard drives , which retail for about $ 50 for one with a 500 GB 32 MB cache .
Redundancy is the key to safety in the computer world .
For maximum safety , always have at least two of whatever it is you need for mission - critical operations .
Data integrity is mission - critical regardless of the type of business you own .
Think about it :
Your financial and human resource records define and protect your business .
Your customer lists , contracts , documentation , spreadsheets , letters and other documents are also irreplaceable  thus making good backups , and the ability to restore backed - up files , imperative .
Getting Started
For each server system that must be backed up , buy two large disk drives  the larger , the better  even if a single drive 's capacity exceeds your needs tenfold .
A large drive allows you to make daily backups without overwriting the previous day 's copy .
Install the disk drives into the server system , format and mirror the drives for maximum redundancy .
Internal drives are faster than external ones regardless of speed or architecture .
Backing up over a network connection is slow and might cause connectivity problems unless your backup network is isolated .
Similarly , backing up to USB drives is painfully slow and therefore not recommended on server systems .
Backup Scheduling
Once you 've installed your drives and your system is back online , you 'll need to setup your backup schedule .
Windows and Linux have very different options for copying files , scripting and scheduling repetitive tasks so I 'll address these tasks generically .
First , setup backup folders on your new drive .
( You 'll see only one drive since the other is a mirror copy . )
If you have enough space for a complete daily backup on the new drive , create a folder for each day of the week , including Saturday and Sunday if there 's a possibility of new files or data on those days .
Next , select the files you want to backup .
Unless you 're an experienced shell scripter , you 'll probably want to back everything up in certain folders to the new drive .
Script your backup to recursively copy files to the new disk .
Here is a very simple example for Windows systems :
XCOPY D : Files E: Monday /Q /E /O
This command tells the system to copy all files from the source , D : Files , to the destination , E : Monday , without listing the files being copied ( / Q ) , copying all directories and subdirectories - empty ones too ( / E ) and preserve the ownership information ( / O ) .
On Linux , the equivalent command looks like this :
# cp - Rp / Files / Backup / Monday
As root , this command copies all files from / Files to / Backup / Monday recursively ( - R ) and preserve permissions ( - p ) .
Finally , setup your backup schedule to run nightly or at your server 's lowest usage time .
Run a test backup or two to see how long it takes for the backup .
The amount of time it takes to perform the backup will give you a clue as to when it should take place .
For example , you do n't want the server to be sluggish due to a backup when employees or customers login to the server in the morning .
Schedule your backups to start and complete during the hours of least use .
Restoring Files
Unless you have a complete disaster and must recover all files from a backup , you 'll likely need to restore only a few files at a time .
Since you 're using disk - to - disk backup , you should copy only the files to restore them  never move the files .
Moving a file removes it from the backed up location permanently .
Permanent Backups
If you have files that must be kept permanently or one that you wish to preserve , backup to optical media ( CD or DVD ) .
Always use the highest quality media , which might cost you two or three times more than cheap media , but your data will be safe .
Permanent backups , whether on disk , optical media or tape should be taken to another site for maximum safety and data loss prevention due to weather , fire , theft or earthquake .
Some backup strategies require remote site storage on a nightly basis .
No backup strategy is perfect regardless of price but disk - to - disk copy has advantages over almost every other type : speed , low price , ease of use , and reliability and safety .
Almost everyone believes that their backup strategy is solid and their backups are working until disaster strikes .
Do n't assume your backups are working .
It 's a very costly assumption .
Remember , when designing and implementing any backup strategy that no one has ever been fired for having a good backup .

Target sued , accused of dumping toxic waste TOXIC WASTE
California Attorney General Jerry Brown , 20 counties and the city of Los Angeles on Monday sued retail giant Target Corp. for illegally dumping bleach , paints , oven cleaners and other toxic materials into the state 's landfills .
The complaint , filed in Alameda County Superior Court , claims the Minneapolis - based chain 's 200 California stores improperly disposed of damaged , returned and past - due chemicals , resulting in more than 300 notices of violations from local environmental health inspectors over the last eight years .
In one 2008 incident , the suit claims , an employee at a San Joaquin County Target told county inspectors that the store routinely dumped hazardous substances , including pesticides , into the facility 's trash compactor .
The suit seeks damages of $ 25,000 per violation and for Target stores to comply with California 's hazardous waste codes .
Attorneys for five Bay Area counties - Alameda , Contra Costa , San Mateo , Santa Clara and Solano - signed on to the complaint .
" It 's an issue of how these big companies deal with what is essentially hazardous waste - they can't just throw it in the trash , " said Scott Gerber , spokesman for the California Department of Justice .
" This state has laws about how these wastes are dealt with , and this company has not been following these laws . "
Under California codes , hazardous waste must be disposed of using a licensed hazardous waste hauler who transports it to a specified hazardous waste facility .
Target released a statement saying it is " disappointed " in the complaint after the company participated in talks with state and local attorneys and provided access to its California stores and distribution centers over the last three years .
" We continue to believe that further review of our practices will lead to the conclusion that our program not only meets but surpasses the requirements of California law , " the statement said .
Target is not the only big retailer that California attorneys have accused of illegally dumping noxious chemicals into local landfills .
The attorney general 's office also announced Monday that it had reached an $ 8.65 million settlement with Kmart over similar charges .
Officials said investigation found that Kmart had failed to account for most of the hazardous waste it generated between 2002 and 2007 .

The former chancellor of City College of San Francisco went on unpaid leave from his post as head of a Washington , D.C. , education lobby Thursday after he was charged with misusing $ 150,000 in college funds .
Philip Day , 63 , who faces eight felony charges for allegedly using taxpayer funds for political donations and personal expenses , requested the leave from the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators because he feared his case would be a distraction , the association 's chairman , Dave Gruen , wrote in an e-mail to the organization .
Day , City College 's Chancellor from 1998 to 2008 , was charged Wednesday with diverting taxpayers ' funds to political campaigns for ballot measures that would benefit community colleges .
He also was accused of using taxpayers ' money to finance a slush fund that paid for alcohol for parties , alumni parking tickets and his $ 1,800 - per - year membership at the City Club of San Francisco .
The district attorney 's office began its investigation of Day in response to a Chronicle story on campaign - finance irregularities in a successful $ 246.3 million City College bond campaign in 2005 , San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris said .
City College spokesman Larry Kamer said the college has not yet decided whether to take any action against Day 's co-defendants , Administrative Services Officer Stephen Herman , charged with seven felonies , and Associate Vice Chancellor James Blomquist , accused of one felony .
Day did n't respond to requests for comment .
Jim Collins , lawyer for Blomquist , said he believed his client " has never done anything intentionally wrong . "
Herman 's lawyer , Michael Sweet , said : " He 'll be proven innocent . "
The three educators are supposed to surrender on their arrest warrants by Tuesday .
The charges were filed at a time when City College is being buffeted by the economic downturn .
In an effort to close a $ 25 million deficit , college trustees have discussed raising money by naming classes after donors willing to pay $ 6,000 to save such courses as Financial Accounting , Human Biology and Elementary French .
The charges of financial impropriety lodged against Day cast " a shadow over the institution , " said Trustee Steve Ngo .
" I am shocked and disgusted and angry that this may have gone on with Chancellor Day at the helm , " he said .
Trustee John Rizzo said he was surprised by the allegation of the slush fund .
" We had never heard about it .
Our internal investigation did not reveal it , " he said , referring to an investigative report the board ordered in response to the Chronicle stories .
But Trustee Lawrence Wong defended Day , whom he called " probably the best chancellor we 've had . "
The three educators may have broken the law , Wong said , but " none of what was in the complaint ... was for personal gain . "
Current chancellor Don Griffin was on vacation and unavailable for comment .
In the past week , the discoveries of two very different and amazing underground temples were in the news .
But they are not the only ones .
1. The Lupercale
Just last week , the first pictures of a recently - discovered underground grotto in Rome were released .
The chamber is 26 feet high and 24 feet in diameter .
The discovery was made about a year ago as workers were repairing the remains of Emperor Augustus ' palace on the Palatine , a hill in Rome .
Archaeologists believe it is the original Lupercale , the site where legend says the founders of Rome , Romulus and Remus , were nursed by a wolf after having been abandoned by their parents , the war god Mars and mortal priestess Rhea Silvia .
The chamber is partly filled with debris , but the ceiling mosaic gives a glimpse of the majesty the temple had when it was in use 2,000 years ago .
2. The Temples of Damanhur
In 1978 , Oberto Airaudi and a few friends began excavating the ground under the alpine hill in Italy on whch they lived .
They dug for 16 years in secret , as they had no permit for the project .
When authorities demanded to see the dig in 1992 , they were astonished to find nine ornately - decorated chambers , with a total volume approaching 300,000 cubic feet !
Although the Italian government seized the temples for a time and was going to destroy them , a retroactive permit was eventually issued .
Airaudi ( who prefers the name Falco ) and his colleagues continue building the underground temples to this day , with plans for bigger and better underground chambers to come .
More on the Damanhur and other temples , after the jump .
Falco 's organization , the Federation of Damanhur , runs tours of the Temples of Humankind complex , a two - day affair with a day of " preparation "  and a day of viewing .
The temples are not dedicated to any deity , but to humankind .
They were built for meditation and spiritual renewal .
See more photos of the temples of Humankind at the official website .
3 . The Underground Temple at Hampi
The city of Hampi in Karnataka , India is a UNESCO World Heritage site as a grouping of Hindu monuments .
One of these is the Underground Temple , believed to have been built in the 13th century and used until Muslim attacks left the city in ruins in the 16th century .
This temple of Siva is underneath the water table , and the inner sanctum is usually flooded .
However , tourists are welcome to go as far down the passageway as possible .
4. The Hypogeum at Hal Saflieni
The Hal Saflieni Hypogeum in Malta is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the oldest underground temple we now know of .
Its 500 square meters spread over three levels of halls , chambers , and passageways carved out between 3600 and 2500 BC .
It was rediscovered in 1902 by a stonemason who was building houses over the temple .
The Hypogeum is open to tourism , with a limit of 80 visitors a day , so reservations should be made far in advance .
See more pictures at Malta Temples .
5 . The Osireion
The Osireion is a false tomb connected to the Seti I temple at Abydos in Egypt .
It is the mythical burial tomb of the ancient Egyptian god Osiris .
Seti I reigned in the 13th century BC .
The Osireion was built below the water table and was flooded much of the time before its 20th century excavation .
It was discovered during an excavation in 1902 , but not fully explored until 1926 .
Part of the Osireion is open to the surface now , but originally had limestone roofs below ground level .
This photo by Ernesto Graf shows a section that is both exposed and flooded .
The Obama administration continued its push for a legal workforce Wednesday with an announcement that federal contractors and subcontractors would soon be required to verify that their employees are eligible to work in the U.S .
Beginning Sept. 8 , the government will award contracts only to companies that enroll in E - Verify , an online program that uses federal databases to check whether employees are in the country legally and authorized to work .
Businesses receiving money under the federal stimulus program also will be subjected to the rule , adopted under President George W. Bush but never implemented .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced plans to throw out a rule that would have allowed the federal government to use mismatched Social Security data to find illegal immigrants in the workplace .
The “ no - match ” rule had been on hold since October 2007 , when a federal judge in San Francisco decided that punishing companies that did n’t clear up discrepancies between names and Social Security numbers would cause “ irreparable harm to innocent workers . ”
Groups that filed the lawsuit against the government argued that some mistakes are just mistakes and not proof of fraud .

“ The idea is to make sure that we are providing employers with a system of employee verification that is accurate , respects the laws of privacy and is truly a good and strong model to maintain a legal workforce , ” said Homeland Security spokesman Matt Chandler .
Separately , the Senate passed an amendment Wednesday that would mandate the use of E - Verify by federal contractors and subcontractors .
Napolitano ’s move comes one week after her department notified more than 650 businesses nationwide of pending audits of their employment records .
The department also recently issued guidelines for immigration agents to go after employers rather than just workers .
Supporters of E - Verify said the expansion of the effort to federal contractors and subcontractors would help crack down on illegal immigrants in the workforce and could help stem the flow of migrants across the border .
Critics said mandating the program for federal contractors would only slow the country ’s economic recovery .

Randel Johnson , vice president of labor , immigration and employee benefits for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , said Wednesday that although some employers had n’t had any problems with E - Verify , others had received inaccurate information from the government ’s database .
“ It should be rolled out slowly and tested rather than being applied to the employer community immediately , ” he said .
The chamber filed a lawsuit in 2008 to prevent the government from implementing the contractor requirement , arguing that the president did not have the authority to mandate a voluntary program .
Other business groups praised the administration for Wednesday ’s move but said more needed to be done , such as legalizing undocumented workers .
Advertisement
“ We believe , of course , that there has to be a mechanism to verify the legal work status of employees , ” said Beto Cardenas , executive counsel to Americans for Immigration Reform , a Houston - based coalition of businesses .
“ But we also believe that immigration reform has to be brought . ”
American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney Jenny Chang Newell called the decision to abandon the no-match rule “ a victory for all American workers . ”
The ACLU was a plaintiff in the suit that prompted the ruling in San Francisco two years ago .
But Newell said she had concerns about the E - Verify requirement and its potential to cause discrimination and unlawful firings based on inaccurate databases .
“ Rather than punishing American workers for errors in the government ’s own databases , the administration should enforce the workplace rights of all workers , ” she said .

The International Mathematical Olympiad ( IMO ) consists of a set of six problems , to be solved in two sessions of four and a half hours each .
Traditionally , the last problem ( Problem 6 ) is significantly harder than the others .
Problem 6 of the 2009 IMO , which was given out last Wednesday , reads as follows :
Problem 6 .
Let be distinct positive integers and let be a set of positive integers not containing .
A grasshopper is to jump along the real axis , starting at the point and making jumps to the right with lengths in some order .
Prove that the order can be chosen in such a way that the grasshopper never lands on any point in .
Of the 500 - odd participants in the Olympiad , only a half - dozen or so managed to solve this problem completely ( I do n’t have precise statistics yet ) .
I myself worked it out about seven hours after first hearing about the problem , though I was preoccupied with other things for most of that time period .
I thought that this problem might make a nice “ mini-Polymath ” project to be solved collaboratively ; it is significantly simpler than an unsolved research problem ( in particular , being an IMO problem , it is already known that there is a solution , which uses only elementary methods ) , and the problem is receptive to the incremental , one - trivial - observation - at - a - time polymath approach .
So I would like to invite people to try solving the problem collaboratively on this blog , by posting one ’s own comments , thoughts , and partial progress on the problem here .
To keep with the spirit of the polymath approach , I would however like to impose some ground rules :
Everyone who does not already know the solution , and has not worked on the problem already , is welcome to jump in and participate , regardless of mathematical level .
However , in order not to spoil the experiment , I would ask that those of you who have already found a solution not to give any hint of the solution here until after the collaborative effort has found its solution .
( At that point , everyone is welcome to give out their solutions here . )
For instance , I will not be participating in the project except as a moderator .
For similar reasons , I would ask that competitors at the actual 2009 IMO refrain from commenting substantively on the problem on this thread until after the collaborative effort has succeeded .
( I know this may require some significant restraint , but I suspect the problem will become too easy if we get comments along the lines of “ This was a tough problem !
I tried X and Y and Z , and they did n’t work ; I tried W also but ran out of time .
I hear that someone solved the problem using U , though . ”
Of course , after the collaborative effort has succeeded , you are more than welcome to share your own experiences with the problem . )
Participants should avoid explicitly searching for solutions to this problem on the internet ( I would imagine spoilers would become available in a few days ) .
If you do accidentally find such a solution online , I would ask that you recuse yourself from the rest of the collaboration , until after they have found a solution also .
( In particular , posting links to a solution is strongly discouraged until after the collaborative effort has succeeded . )
In a similar vein , extensive searching of the mathematical literature should only be undertaken if there is a consensus to do so on this thread .
Participants are also discouraged from working too hard on this problem “ offline ” ; if you have a potentially useful observation , one should share it with the other collaborators here , rather than develop it further in private , unless it is “ obvious ” how to carry the observation further .
Actually , even “ frivolous ” observations can ( and should ) be posted on this thread , if there is even a small chance that some other participant may be able to find it helpful for solving the problem .
Similarly , “ failed ” attempts at a solution are also worth posting ; another participant may be able to salvage the argument , or else the failure can be used as a data point to eliminate some approaches to the problem , and to isolate more promising ones .
Participants should view themselves as contributing to a team effort , rather than competing with each other ( in contrast to the actual IMO ) .
The point is not to obtain bragging rights for being the first or quickest to solve the problem ( which has , after all , already been solved ) , but instead to experimentally test the hypothesis that a mathematical problem can be solved by a massive collaboration , without requiring serious effort on behalf of any one of the participants .
( See Tim Gowers ’ essay “ is massively collaborative mathematics possible ? ” for more discussion . )
To make it easier to reference comments in this thread , I would ask commenters to number their comments ( so that the first comment be labeled 1. , the second comment be labeled 2. , and so forth . )
Unlike the actual IMO , there is no artificial time limit on this exercise , though if there is insufficient participation , or the collaborative effort grinds to a halt , I may at my discretion close the experiment and give out solutions after a reasonable time period .
The real obstacle to health care reform is becoming clearer by the day .
It ’s the country ’s patchwork system of services , a hodge - podge of private for - profit entities with their own special interests to protect .
And here ’s the kicker : Much of it has nothing to do with actual delivery of medical care .
Insurance companies have been spending millions of dollars lobbying Congress , particularly the Senate , to kill the public option plan .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce would like to see a proposal mandating employer insurance coverage shot down .
Both objectives are now in sight as “ moderate ” Democratic senators cave in to their demands .
But it ’s not over .
Pharmaceutical companies have yet to weigh in .
Look for their campaign – and it ’s going to be a big one – to begin when Congress gets back from their recess in September .
See Bloomberg ’s report today on drug companies ’ $ 100 million ad campaign on health overhaul .
Not surprisingly , pharmaceutical companies do n’t like the idea of allowing Medicare – or a government - based public option plan – to negotiate lower drug prices .
Nor do they appreciate an option that wold allow the purchase of prescription meds from Canadian companies .
Watch for hard and sharp attacks on both of these proposals .
The campaign is being run by The Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) , the Washington - based lobbying arm representing 28 drug makers , including Pfizer and GlacoSmithKlein .
The industry did cut a deal with the Obama administration to discount brand - name drugs for Medicare recipients who fall into coverage gaps .
It will supposedly lower drug costs by $ 80 billion over 10 years .
PhRMA will be trying to get two basic messages across .
One is that re-importation of drugs is “ a safety issue ” that could put patients in the U.S. in jeopardy .
“ We will have to fight that because we think that is the wrong thing to do from a patient standpoint , ” Merck & Co. CEO Richard Clark told Bloomberg .
We should find it comforting that it has absolutely nothing to do with money , making sure investors get their 10 percent , and guaranteeing that execs get their multi-million - dollar bonuses .
It ’s purely a safety issue .
The second message is that negotiating lower prices will lead to fewer research projects and therefore negatively impact medical progress .
This is why real health care reform is falling victim to a thousand cuts .
If 10 people are holding a document , and each one is pulling in a different direction , it gets torn apart .
It ’s beginning to sound like that will be the fate of the country ’s latest , greatest effort to give everybody access to health care .
Last weekend the New York Times Magazine published a beautiful set of photos of abandoned buildings and such , as a chronicle of the end of the gilded age .
Now they 've pulled them for probably being Photoshopped .
Fakery !

Scientists yesterday announced a breakthrough that could transform research into a range of incurable diseases but spark a dramatic increase in the number of monkeys used in experiments .
Researchers have developed a technique to create genetically modified monkeys that suffer from human illnesses .
Experimenting on these monkeys , they believe , will advance our understanding and treatment of incurable conditions such as Parkinson 's disease and multiple sclerosis .
However , the scientific breakthrough has caused consternation among groups opposed to animal experiments because the development will almost certainly lead to a sudden increase in the number of primates used in medical research at a time when there are calls for fewer monkeys to be used in experiments .
The development also raises the prospect that we will be able to apply the technique to humans – another primate .
This could help families affected by inherited disorders such Huntington 's disease and cystic fibrosis by permenantly eradicating their defective genes from future generations .

The breakthrough was achieved by a team of scientists in Japan led by Erika Sasaki of the Central Institute of Experimental Animals in Kawasaki and Professor Hideyuki Okano of Keio University School of Medicine .
Their study , published in the journal Nature , used marmoset monkeys , the smallest member of the primate group .
The " transgenic " monkeys were created by inserting a gene from a jellyfish into their embryos to make them glow under ultraviolet light – a standard test to see if the technique worked .
When the monkeys became adults they passed on this transgenic trait to a subsequent generation of offspring .
This " proof of principle " suggests that other genes could also be manipulated to create animals that mimic human disorders .
This is already possible in mice .
" The expression of an introduced gene was discovered not only in the first generation of common marmosets after introduction , but also in a second .
This is the first case ever established in the world than an introduced gene was successfully inherited to the next generation in primates , " Professor Okano said .
" Until now , the use of mice and rats has played an important role in life science research of transgenic animals but to conduct research on human illnesses , experiments with primates , animals markedly closer to humans functionally and anatomically than rodents , have become necessary , " he said .
The scientists managed to inject the jellyfish gene into 80 marmoset IVF embryos which were transferred into 50 surrogate mothers .
Seven animals became pregnant and four of them gave birth to five live babies .
All five offspring were transgenic animals carrying the jellyfish gene , which caused the production of a green fluorescent protein in the skin of the monkeys which made their hands glow under ultraviolet light .
Most importantly , the scientists demonstrated that the jellyfish gene had become incorporated into the reproductive cells of two of the five marmosets – the sperm of a male and the eggs of a female – both of which subsequently produced a second generation of marmosets carrying the transgenic gene .

It is this breakthrough that could now lead to the establishment of breeding colonies of transgenic monkeys that are each specifically engineered with genes that simulate the symptoms of human disorders to allow them to be used as experimental models , just as transgenic mice have been used in their millions over the past 20 years .
" However , in many cases , research results obtained in mice cannot be directly applied to humans because of the many physiological , anatomical and histological difference between mice and humans , which are evolutionarily distinct , " Professor Okano said .
" For this reason , research using primates as experimental animals that more closely resemble humans in function and anatomy is required , " he said .
The sentiment was echoed by Kieran Breen , director of research and development at the Parkinson 's Disease Society .
" This is potentially very exciting for the future of research into the cause of Parkinson's .
Because non-human primates are much closer to humans than mice genetically , the successful creation of transgenic marmosets means that we will have a new animal model to work with , " Dr Breen said .
However , animal welfare organisations yesterday condemned the research on the grounds that it will lead to an increase in the use of primates at a time when many European countries are trying to reduce the numbers used in scientific experiments .
" It is of high scientific and ethical concern that the creation of transgenic marmosets should be hailed as a success .
These experiments will only increase the number of non-human primates subjected to experiments around the globe , " said Carol Newman of the Dr Hadwen Trust for Humane Research .
The creation of the first transgenic mouse in the 1980s led to an dramatic increase in the use of laboratory mice during the 1990s .
In 1990 , there were less than 50,000 experiments involving transgenic mice in Britain – a mere 1.5 per cent of the total – but by 2007 the number of transgenic mice used in experiments grew to more than 1.1 million , according to Home Office statistics .
Why are these experiments important to science ?
Q. What have the scientists done ?
A . They introduced a jellyfish gene into the DNA of marmoset monkeys when they were embryos .
When these monkeys became adults they produced offspring that also carried the foreign gene – the first time a " transgenic " primate has produced transgenic offspring .
Q. But have n't scientists already created transgenic monkeys ?
A. Yes , in 2001 the world 's first transgenic monkey , called Andi , was created using the jellyfish gene .
But the gene was not incorporated into his sperm .
Q . Why is it important to pass on transgenic traits to offspring ?
A. Scientists want to establish breeding colonies of transgenic monkeys that are each created as biomedical models of human disorders such as Parkinson 's disease or diabetes .
If the trait is passed on through normal breeding it avoids the enormous expense of creating each transgenic animal from scratch .
Q . Why was the jellyfish gene used ?
A . It is purely a " marker " that allows scientists to see quickly whether their technique has worked .
The gene from the jellyfish produces a green fluorescent protein that glows under ultraviolet light .
By shining UV light on the animals , scientists can immediately see whether they have successfully introduced the foreign gene into the animal .
Q. Is the breakthrough a cause for celebration ?
A . It could soon lead to the creation of better and more accurate animal " models " of human disease because monkeys are closer to humans than mice .
It means that medical researchers could test new drugs and treatments and gain a better understanding of incurable human disorders .
Opponents argue , however , that animals are not a good model of human illnesses , and the research will only lead to more primates being used in experiments .
Q . Are there any other implications of the research ?
A. Being able to manipulate the reproductive cells of primates will inevitably raise the question of whether we can do the same – safely – in humans .
This " germline " gene therapy is illegal in Britain because it was considered too dangerous .
But if it can be shown to be safe in our closest animal relatives , there could be calls to reconsider its use to eliminate inherited conditions permanently from affected families .
Ferrari's threat to quit Formula 1 over plans for a budget cap and two - tier championship in 2010 will appear shocking to many - that , after all , is the idea .
To those more familiar with the sport 's intricate politics , though , the biggest surprise may well be that it took them so long to say it .
F1's history is littered with examples of Ferrari threatening to pull out if they did not get their way over some rules row or other .
In the late ' 80s , in one of the most notorious , they went as far as building their own IndyCar to underline their point .
Yet they remain the only team to have competed every year since the start of the F1 world championship in 1950 .
That is why few people within F1 will think there is any realistic chance Ferrari will not be on the grid next year .
That is not to say , however , that Ferrari 's threat is not serious , nor that this is not a serious situation .
In both cases , it is .
The new rules proposed for 2010 have got everyone in F1 exercised - and every single team opposes at least one of the two main changes .
Max Mosley , the FIA president ( pictured ) , has forced through regulations that a ) introduce a voluntary £ 40 m budget cap ; and b ) give greater technical freedom to those teams who choose to operate within it .
The rules are framed - deliberately - to give a significant performance advantage to those teams who do choose to accept the FIA limits , with initial estimates suggesting said advantage is up to three seconds a lap .
Ferrari - along with other major teams such as McLaren - Mercedes , Toyota and BMW - accept the need for costs to come down .
They have already reduced their spending significantly , and are working on other proposals to ensure they continue to do so .
But they are not ready to meet Mosley at his £ 40 m mark - even though driver salaries and marketing are not included in that cap .
They do not want to make hundreds of employees redundant ; they do not think it is any of the FIA 's business to tell a major corporation how to spend its money ; and they do not want the FIA poking around in their accounts .
What makes this such a delicate situation , though , is that not all the teams are approaching it from the same position .
Ferrari want neither the cap nor the two - tier championship .
All the other teams are implacably opposed to two sets of rules , but are more malleable - to a greater or lesser extent - on the subject of a cap , although many believe the figure should be higher .
And Williams , Brawn and Force India - the teams with the smallest budgets - are all believed to be behind the £ 40 m limit .
In theory , this plays into the hands of Mosley and his partner - in - arms , F1 commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone .
Their modus operandi for ruling F1 has long been divide and conquer , and on the face of it they have the teams where they want them .
If the teams are not united , one might think , how can they hope to win a stand - off ?
Mosley 's argument is that the budget cap is the only way F1 can survive the credit crunch relatively unscathed .
He believes several of the major car manufacturers are poised to quit the sport at the end of the year - with Toyota , BMW and Renault the hottest candidates - and he says F1 is out of reach to new teams if it does not become more affordable to run a competitive car .
The FIA accepts the two - tier championship is an imperfect solution , but says it is a necessary , temporary evil while F1 makes itself fit for purpose .
But the risk is that , by pressing ahead with his plans , Mosley 's claim of potential manufacturer withdrawals becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy - one precipitated by his plans for change , not by the companies themselves .
There is also the wider question of the future direction of F1 .
In this , the teams - represented by their umbrella organisation Fota - and the FIA have diametrically opposed philosophies .
Fota 's position was summed up eloquently by my colleague Mark Hughes in Autosport magazine last week :
" Yes , the teams should get a greater share of the revenue , no the sport should not be owned by a venture capital company that squeezes half the sport 's profit out of it , no the traditional venues should not be priced out of the championship , no it should not be so stupidly expensive for fans to attend a grand prix , no F1 should never be about spec cars or engines , yes F1 should be represented in North America , no it should n't be going to places where no - one wants to come and watch . "
Usually , the way these things play out is predictable .
Mosley comes up with an extreme suggestion that provokes the teams into action .
They argue for a bit .
Mosley waters down his position a little .
The teams grumble a bit but accept it .
And everyone goes away until the next political crisis - usually precipitated by another FIA initiative - starts the whole process again .
But this time it might be different .
For one thing , the teams have in recent years been getting increasingly aggravated by Mosley 's constant changing of the rules .
They want stable regulations and a level playing field .
For another , the teams remain determined to keep Fota together in the face of Mosley and Ecclestone 's politicking - and if they can manage that then Mosley has to listen .
But most significant of all is the position of Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo as chairman of Fota .
Until very recently , Ferrari were at loggerheads with the other teams and more often than not in Ecclestone and Mosley 's camp on most political battles .
But not any more .
Now , Mosley finds Montezemolo on the other side of the battlefield and it is almost certainly not a comfortable feeling for either man .
These two are political heavyweights , neither of whom is used to losing , and it is going to be fascinating to see who comes out on top .
For all his grandstanding , Mosley knows F1 cannot afford to lose Ferrari - not when surveys suggest that a third of all fans at grands prix are there to watch them .
So the question is , what is better for F1 ?
A championship without Ferrari - and Toyota - with a grid filled out by privateers such as Prodrive and USGP , run to a formula for essentially standard cars with rules manipulated on the whim of the FIA ?
Or fewer new teams in a more transparent championship with more stable rules and a parachute down to a more affordable budget over a number of years ?
There will be a number of meetings over the coming weeks , there is a deadline of 29 May for teams to enter next year 's championship , and we can expect many more public utterances from the parties involved .
Eventually , almost certainly , a compromise will be reached , one that keeps Ferrari on board .
But things might get bloody before F1 gets there .
Internal Temperature Cooking Chart
Learn how to read and use an Internal Meat and Cooking Thermometer .
Cooking thermometers take the guesswork out of cooking , as they measure the internal temperatures of your cooked meat , poultry , seafood , baked goods , and / or casseroles , to assure that a safe temperature has been reached , harmful bacteria have been destroyed , and your food is cooked perfectly .
Always follow internal cooking temperatures to be safe !
What is the Perfect Cooking Temperature for
Beef – Pork – Poultry – Fish and Seafood – Baked Goods ?
Great cooks use a cooking thermometer as their guide – NOT a clock .
A cooking or meat thermometer should not be a sometime thing .
A cooking thermometer can be used for all foods , not just meat .
It measures the internal temperature of your cooked meat , poultry , seafood , breads , baked goods , and / or casseroles to assure that a safe temperature has been reached and that harmful bacteria ( like certain strains of Salmonella and E. Coli O 157:H7 ) has been destroyed .
Foods are properly cooked only when they are heated at a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria that cause food - borne illness .
Use it every time you prepare foods like beef , pork , poultry , roasts , hams , casseroles , meat loaves , egg dishes , and even your baked goods .
If you do n’t regularly use a thermometer , you should get into the habit of using one .
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture , internal temperature is the only way to gauge whether food is sufficiently cooked .
USDA research reveals that the “ color test ” can give consumers misleading information about the safety of the foods they are preparing , since cooked color varies considerably .
For example , freezing and thawing may influence a meat ’s tendency to brown prematurely .
This is the type of cooking and meat thermometer that I prefer and use in my cooking .
I get many readers asking what cooking / meat thermometer that I prefer and use in my cooking and baking .

Beef , Veal , and Lamb Internal Temperature Chart :
Fahrenheit and Celsius Cooking Temperatures
For roasts of lamb , beef , or veal : place the thermometer midway inside the roast away from bone .
Residual Heat or Carry - Over Cooking : Remember , the steak will continue to cook as it sets .
The temperature will rise 5 degrees F. to 10 degrees F. internal temperature .
So , pay attention to how long you let the cooked meat sit before serving .
Carry - over cooking is caused by residual heat transferring from the hotter exterior of the meat to the cooler center .
As a general rule , the larger and thicker the cut of meat , and the higher the cooking temperature , the more residual heat will be in the meat , and the more the internal temperature will rise during resting due to carry - over cooking .
This means the meat must be removed from the heat at an internal temperature lower than your desired final internal temperature , allowing the residual heat to finish the cooking .
Roasts – Steaks – Chops Degree of Doneness Internal Core Temperature Internal Description Extra-rare or Blue ( bleu ) 80 to 100 degrees F

There is much you need to know to wisely direct your life .
At some point , an event may occur that you cannot personally witness .
Suppose the consequences of the event affect you — without first - hand knowledge of the event , will you be aware of it ?
Will you be able to react to it ?
You will want to know what happened .
You may not immediately want to know what someone else thinks or feels about what happened .
That may come later .
You first want someone to tell you clearly and with minimal subjectivity what happened with no opinion or impression attached .
You live in a second - hand world .
You need someone to observe the world first - hand when you cannot .
Who will you trust to faithfully do that for you ?
Sociologist C. Wright Mills described this half a century ago in the book The Politics of Truth :
The first rule for understanding the human condition is that men live in second - hand worlds .
They are aware of much more than they have personally experienced , and their own experience is always indirect .
The quality of their lives is determined by meanings they have received from others .
Everyone lives in a world of such meanings .
No man stands alone directly confronting a world of solid facts . … [ I ] n their everyday life they do not experience a world of solid fact ; their experience itself is selected by stereotyped meanings and shaped by readymade interpretations .
Their images of the world , and of themselves , are given to them by crowds of witnesses they have never met and never shall meet .
Yet for every man these images — provided by strangers and dead men — are the very basis of his life as a human being .
Your information needs may be summed up by three questions :
How does the world work ?
Why does it work that way ?
What will be the impact on me ?
The answers reflect the raw data of empirical observation and a neutral explanation of phenomena eventually followed by analyses laced with points of view .
Those “ crowds of witnesses ” offer that information in many forms — books , movies , art , advertising , television , music , and the various means by which journalism and pseudo - journalism are distributed .
You first need to know what happened .
But does n’t it increasingly seem that your principal sources are also those who did n’t witness the event first - hand either ?
Does n’t it seem as if your first notice of what happened comes from a second - hand source who is not a witness at all ?
Is that source someone using the pretense of a witness , someone who imbues that initial report with analysis laced with a point of view , pre-coloring and presaging your first impression ?
Which do you need first — a subjective point of view or one as objective as possible ?
Reflect on your information needs .
( Not your wants — that ’s a different post . )
What do you need to know ?
Why do you need to know it ?
Who will credibly tell you ?
Mills ’ analysis of understanding the human condition anticipates the digital world you live in .
Your second - hand world consists of , in Mills ’ words , “ stereotyped meanings and shaped by readymade interpretations . ”
From what source do you not receive pre-digested reports ?
If you want information without a point of view shaping it , perhaps you need Anne .
She is a Fair Witness in Robert A. Heinlein ’s “ Stranger in a Strange Land . ”
Her employer , Jubal Harshaw , is asked to demonstrate her capabilities .
Harshaw points to a building and asks
Anne its color .
Her reply : “ White on this side . ”
In Heinlein ’s fictional world , a Fair Witness has total recall , is fully impartial , and makes no intuitive or analytical leaps beyond what she can witness ( such as assuming the color on the side of the building she cannot see ) .
A Fair Witness is the antithesis of a Spin Doctor .
Anne , the Fair Witness , is a source of unfiltered fact .
You are left to divine the meaning of that fact in a context uniquely yours .
In the midst of this high - noise , low - signal digital information age one S&R writer called “ Shoutworld , ” no Fair Witness appears to exist .
Traditionally “ objective ” sources of information increasingly have colorized what happened through an ideological , self - centered , or selfish lens .
The numbers of those sources who minimize the predigestion of what happened declines daily .
You eventually may find that subjective witness reports are necessary to help you ascertain context , importance , and meaning .
On what basis , however , do you trust their authors ?
If all your information sources tell you what it means before telling you what happened , how certain are you of what , indeed , did happen ?
Some people have requested my slides from the short talk I gave about monoids and monoidal parsing at Hac Phi .
So , here they are .
There will be more to come at the next Boston Haskell User Group in August , where it looks like I 'll be giving two short talks covering monoids .
I may use the monoidal parsing engine from Kata as an example for the advanced talk if I have time and will start to cover parsing larger classes of grammars in general ( regular languages , CFGs / TIGs , TAGs , PEGs , LALR , attribute - grammars , etc. )

I know a lot of people are getting hell - bent over the current discussion on torture ( I certainly have ) .
But certain elements of this discussion have concerned me , mostly the idea that America has lost its ‘ moral compass ’ during the Bush years and through the torture and extraordinary rendition scandal .
To this , I simply respond What moral compass ?
America , in it ’s 220 years of existence has succeeded precisely because it ’s geo-political and economic strategies have no moral element to them .
The short - sightedness of this debate is that the Bush years were some sort of anomaly in the trajectory of American goodness , while the truth is the narrative of America has been one of human rights abuse , economic exploitation , and disregard for the lives of non-Americans .
A small smattering of America ’s ‘ moral compass ’ just from the past 50 years :
• Covertly overthrew President Salvador Allende in Chile and replacing him with Augusto Pinochet who would kill and torture over 100,000 people
• Currently providing over $ 3 billion a year in military aid to Israel while it systemically cleanses greater Palestine of non-Jews
• Currently providing over $ 3 billion a year to Pakistan and Egypt , despite wide - spread human rights abuses and lack of democratic rights
• Spearheaded efforts to impose a UN Blockade to Iraq , leading to an estimated 200,000 deaths in the late 1990’s
• Currently providing over $ 1 billion a year to Saudi Arabia , including $ 3 million dollars of electro - shock devices used to torture inmates and political prisoners
• Funded and headquartered in Georgia the School of the Americas Assassins ( currently named the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation ) , which trained and armed ‘ anti-Communist ’ fighters in Latin America .
These have included dictators and gross human rights abusers such as Bolivia ’s Hugo Banzer and Panama ’s Manuel Noriega .
• Overthrew the democratically elected government of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq in 1953 and replaced it with the dictatorship of the pro-Western Shah
• Funded the Mujahideen in Afghanistan , including Osama Bin Laden , to fight the Soviets in the early 1980s
• Provided Saddam Hussein with the chemical weapons he would use to kill over 100,000 Kurds
And that ’s just a brief list , not including America ’s involvement in Vietnam , the bombing of civilians in Cambodia and subsequent rise of the Khmer Rouge , the use of nuclear weapons against Japan , or the funding and arming of Contra death squads in Nicaragua .

VANCOUVER - Al Jazeera English could soon be headed to a television set in your living room .
At least that ’s the hope of a group of supporters that is lobbying for the station ’s broadcast licence in Canada .
“ Having more independent journalism , having another voice or another option for the Canadian audience to tap into is something that will help democracy , will help shape public opinion , ” said Walied Khogali , coordinator of Canadians for Al Jazeera .
The group is encouraging the public to write the CRTC in support of a broadcast license .
The federal regulator has been receiving public submissions for a 30 - day consultation period , which ends Monday .
By the end of last week , over 1000 submissions had already been received , Khogali said .
Al Jazeera English is currently offered in more than 100 countries .
The station is only available on a handful of stations in the United States , but North Americans , Canadians included , can currently watch the station ’s programming on the Internet via YouTube clips and a live feed .
“ A lot of people watch it online , ” said Khogali .
“ Why should n’t we have that in the comfort of our living rooms ? ”
Supporters say the addition of the channel would offer news and viewpoints currently unavailable on Canadian television , especially a focus on the Global South regions including Africa , Asia and Latin America .
“ As Canadians we are a multi-cultural country and we appreciate unique perspectives on global issues that are happening , ” said Khogali .
The addition of Al Jazeera English would also provide employment for Canadian journalists and feature Canadian news around the world , he said .
“ They have promised to invest resources here to set up a bureau in Canada to cover Canadian content and Canadian stories . ”
In 2004 , the CRTC approved a Canadian licence for the Arabic version of Al Jazeera .
But no distributors picked up the channel because of significant restrictions , including requirements to record every broadcast and ensure nothing was aired that violated hate crime laws , said Khogali .
The Canadian Jewish Congress would like to see similar restrictions imposed for Al Jazeera English , according to the Globe and Mail .
“ I think Al Jazeera has much to prove in terms of its legitimacy , its credibility , ” said Bernie Farber , chief executive officer of the CJC , criticizing what he called “ hate - mongering , ” on the Arabic network .
He added he was not saying this was necessarily the case for the English channel but said it will have to prove itself .
Notions that Al Jazeera English is hateful or unfair are dismissed by supporters , including one prominent Canadian journalist .
Tony Burman , former Editor in Chief of CBC News is now the Managing Director of Al Jazeera English and has been touring the country building support for the network .
" Once people have a chance to watch Al Jazeera and become familiar with the range of programming , the way it handles issues including the Middle East , people will have no reason whatsoever to conclude that this is a biased channel , ” Burman told The Tyee in February .
“ It 's an award - winning channel that a lot of people compare to the BBC and CNN . ”
Garrett Zehr reports for The Tyee .
newswire article reporting global 9.11 investigation | imperialism & war What Did Israel Know in Advance of the 9/11 Attacks ?
author : CHRISTOPHER KETCHAM
It 's no small boon to the U.S. government that the story of 9/11 - related Israeli espionage has been thus relegated : the story does n't fit in the clean lines of the official narrative of the attacks .
It brings up concerns not only about Israel 's obligation not to spy inside the borders of the United States , its major benefactor , but about its possible failure to have provided the U.S. adequate warning of an impending devastating attack on American soil .
Furthermore , the available evidence undermines the carefully cultivated image of sanctity that defines the U.S. - Israel relationship .
These are all factors that help explain the story 's disappearance , and they are compelling reasons to revisit it now .

What Did Israel Know in Advance of the 9/11 Attacks ?
By CHRISTOPHER KETCHAM
On the afternoon of September 11 , 2001 , an FBI bulletin known as a BOLO ­- " be on lookout " -- was issued with regard to three suspicious men who that morning were seen leaving the New Jersey waterfront minutes after the first plane hit World Trade Center 1 .
Law enforcement officers across the New York - New Jersey area were warned in the radio dispatch to watch for a " vehicle possibly related to New York terrorist attack " :
White , 2000 Chevrolet van with ' Urban Moving Systems ' sign on back seen at Liberty State Park , Jersey City , NJ , at the time of first impact of jetliner into World Trade Center
Three individuals with van were seen celebrating after initial impact and subsequent explosion .
FBI Newark Field Office requests that , if the van is located , hold for prints and detain individuals .
At 3:56 p.m. , twenty - five minutes after the issuance of the FBI BOLO , officers with the East Rutherford Police Department stopped the commercial moving van through a trace on the plates .
According to the police report , Officer Scott DeCarlo and Sgt. Dennis Rivelli approached the stopped van , demanding that the driver exit the vehicle .
The driver , 23 - year - old Sivan Kurzberg , refused and " was asked several more times [ but ] appeared to be fumbling with a black leather fanny pouch type of bag " .
With guns drawn , the police then " physically removed " Kurzberg , while four other men ­- two more men had apparently joined the group since the morning ­- were also removed from the van , handcuffed , placed on the grass median and read their Miranda rights .
They had not been told the reasons for their arrest .
Yet , according to DeCarlo 's report , " this officer was told without question by the driver [ Sivan Kurzberg ] , 'We are Israeli .
We are not your problem .
Your problems are our problems .
The Palestinians are the problem . ' "
Another of the five Israelis , again without prompting , told Officer DeCarlo ­- falsely ­- that " we were on the West Side Highway in New York City during the incident " .
From inside the vehicle the officers , who were quickly joined by agents from the FBI , retrieved multiple passports and $ 4,700 in cash stuffed in a sock .
According to New Jersey 's Bergen Record , which on September 12 reported the arrest of the five Israelis , an investigator high up in the Bergen County law enforcement hierarchy stated that officers had also discovered in the vehicle " maps of the city with certain places highlighted .
It looked like they 're hooked in with this " , the source told the Record , referring to the 9/11 attacks .
" It looked like they knew what was going to happen when they were at Liberty State Park . "
The five men were indeed Israeli citizens .
They claimed to be in the country working as movers for Urban Moving Systems Inc. , which maintained a warehouse and office in Weehawken , New Jersey .
They were held for 71 days in a federal detention center in Brooklyn , New York , during which time they were repeatedly interrogated by FBI and CIA counterterrorism teams , who referred to the men as the " high - fivers " for their celebratory behavior on the New Jersey waterfront .
Some were placed in solitary confinement for at least forty days ; some were given as many as seven liedetector tests .
One of the Israelis , Paul Kurzberg , brother of Sivan , refused to take a lie - detector test for ten weeks .
Then he failed it .
Meanwhile , two days after the men were picked up , the owner of Urban Moving Systems , Dominik Suter , a 31 - year - old Israeli national , abandoned his business and fled the United States for Israel .
Suter 's departure was abrupt , leaving behind coffee cups , sandwiches , cell phones and computers strewn on office tables and thousands of dollars of goods in storage .
Suter was later placed on the same FBI suspect list as 9/11 lead hijacker Mohammed Atta and other hijackers and suspected al - Qaeda sympathizers , suggesting that U.S. authorities felt Suter may have known something about the attacks .
The suspicion , as the investigation unfolded , was that the men working for Urban Moving Systems were spies .
Who exactly was handling them , and who or what they were targeting , was as yet uncertain .
It was New York 's venerable Jewish weekly The Forward that broke this story in the spring of 2002 , after months of footwork .
The Forward reported that the FBI had finally concluded that at least two of the men were agents working for the Mossad , the Israeli intelligence agency , and that Urban Moving Systems , the ostensible employer of the five Israelis , was a front operation .
Two former CIA officers confirmed this to me , noting that movers ' vans are a common intelligence cover .
The Forward also noted that the Israeli government itself admitted that the men were spies .
A " former high - ranking American intelligence official " , who said he was " regularly briefed on the investigation by two separate law enforcement officials " , told reporter Marc Perelman that after American authorities confronted Jerusalem at the end of 2001 , the Israeli government " acknowledged the operation and apologized for not coordinating it with Washington " .
Today , Perelman stands by his reporting .
I asked him if his sources in the Mossad denied the story .
" Nobody stopped talking to me " , he said .
In June 2002 , ABC News ' 20/20 followed up with its own investigation into the matter , coming to the same conclusion as The Forward .
Vincent Cannistraro , former chief of operations for counterterrorism with the CIA , told 20/20 that some of the names of the five men appeared as hits in searches of an FBI national intelligence database .
Cannistraro told me that the question that most troubled FBI agents in the weeks and months after 9/11 was whether the Israelis had arrived at the site of their " celebration " with foreknowledge of the attack to come .
From the beginning , " the FBI investigation operated on the premise that the Israelis had foreknowledge " , according to Cannistraro .
A second former CIA counterterrorism officer who closely followed the case , but who spoke on condition of anonymity , told me that investigators were pursuing two theories .
" One story was that [ the Israelis ] appeared at Liberty State Park very quickly after the first plane hit .
The other was that they were at the park location already " .
Either way , investigators wanted to know exactly what the men were expecting when they got there .
Before such issues had been fully explored , however , the investigation was shut down .
Following what ABC
News reported were " high - level negotiations between Israeli and U.S. government officials " , a settlement was reached in the case of the five Urban Moving Systems suspects .
Intense political pressure apparently had been brought to bear .
The reputable Israeli daily Ha'aretz reported that by the last week of October 2001 , some six weeks after the men had been detained , Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and two unidentified " prominent New York congressmen " were lobbying heavily for their release .
According to a source at ABC
News close to the 20/20 report , high - profile criminal lawyer Alan Dershowitz also stepped in as a negotiator on behalf of the men to smooth out differences with the U.S. government .
( Dershowitz declined to comment for this article . )
And so , at the end of November 2001 , for reasons that only noted they had been working in the country illegally as movers , in violation of their visas , the men were flown home to Israel .
Today , the crucial questions raised by this matter remain unanswered .
There is sufficient reason ­- from news reports , statements by former intelligence officials , an array of circumstantial evidence , and the reported acknowledgment by the Israeli government -­ to believe that in the months before 9/11 , Israel was running an active spy network inside the United States , with Muslim extremists as the target .
Given Israel 's concerns about Islamic terrorism as well as its long history of spying on U.S. soil , this does not come entirely as a shock .
What 's incendiary is the idea -­ supported , though not proven , by several pieces of evidence ­- that the Israelis did learn something about 9/11 in advance but failed to share all of what they knew with American officials .
The questions are disturbing enough to warrant a Congressional investigation .
Yet none of this information found its way into Congress 's joint committee report on the attacks , and it was not even tangentially referenced in the nearly 600 pages of the 9/11 Commission 's final report .
Nor would a single major media outlet track the revelations of The Forward and ABC News to investigate further .
" There were n't even stories saying it was bullshit " , says The Forward 's Perelman .
" Honestly , I was surprised " .
Instead , the story disappeared into the welter of anti-Israel 9/11 conspiracy theories .
It 's no small boon to the U.S. government that the story of 9/11 - related Israeli espionage has been thus relegated : the story does n't fit in the clean lines of the official narrative of the attacks .
It brings up concerns not only about Israel 's obligation not to spy inside the borders of the United States , its major benefactor , but about its possible failure to have provided the U.S. adequate warning of an impending devastating attack on American soil .
Furthermore , the available evidence undermines the carefully cultivated image of sanctity that defines the U.S. - Israel relationship .
These are all factors that help explain the story 's disappearance , and they are compelling reasons to revisit it now .
Torpedoing the FBI Probe
All five future hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77 , which rammed the Pentagon , maintained addresses or were active within a six - mile radius of towns associated with the Israelis employed at Urban Moving Systems .
Hudson and Bergen counties , the areas where the Israelis were allegedly conducting surveillance , were a central staging ground for the hijackers of Flight 77 and their fellow al - Qaeda operatives .
Mohammed Atta maintained a mail - drop address and visited friends in northern New Jersey ; his contacts there included Hani Hanjour , the suicide pilot for Flight 77 , and Majed Moqed , one of the strongmen who backed Hanjour in the seizing of the plane .
Could the Israelis , with or without knowledge of the terrorists ' plans , have been tracking the men who were soon to hijack Flight 77 ?
In public statements , both the Israeli government and the FBI have denied that the Urban Moving Systems men were involved in an intelligence operation in the United States .
" No evidence recovered suggested any of these Israelis had prior knowledge of the 9/11 attack , and these Israelis are not suspected of working for Mossad " , FBI spokesman Jim Margolin told me .
( The Israeli embassy did not respond to questions for this article . )
According to the source at ABC News , FBI investigators chafed at the denials from their higher - ups .
" There is a lot of frustration inside the bureau about this case " , the source told me .
" They feel the higher echelons torpedoed the investigation into the Israeli New Jersey cell .
Leads were not fully investigated " .
Among those lost leads was the figure of Dominik Suter , whom the U.S. authorities apparently never attempted to contact .
Intelligence expert and author James Bamford told me there was similar frustration within the CIA : " People I 've talked to at the CIA were outraged at what was going on .
They thought it was outrageous that there had n't been a real investigation , that the facts were hanging out there without any conclusion . "
However , what was " absolutely certain " , according to Vincent Cannistraro , was that the five Israelis formed part of a surveillance network in the New York - New Jersey area .
The network 's purpose was to track radical Islamic extremists and / or supporters of militant Palestinian groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad .
The former CIA counterterrorism officer who spoke anonymously told me that FBI investigators determined that the suspect Israelis were serving as Arabic - speaking linguists " running technical operations " in northern New Jersey 's extensive Muslim communities .
The former CIA officer said the operations included taps on telephones , placement of microphones in rooms and mobile surveillance .
The source at ABC News agreed : " Our conclusion was that they were Arab linguists involved in monitoring operations , i.e. , electronic surveillance .
People at FBI concur with this " .
The ABC News source added , " What we heard was that the Israelis may have picked up chatter that something was going to happen on the morning of 9/11 " .
The former CIA counterterrorism officer told me : " There was no question but that [ the order to close down the investigation ] came from the White House .
It was immediately assumed at CIA headquarters that this basically was going to be a cover - up so that the Israelis would not be implicated in any way in 9/11 .
Bear in mind that this was a political issue , not a law enforcement or intelligence issue .
If somebody says we do n't want the Israelis implicated in this ­- we know that they 've been spying the hell out of us , we know that they possibly had information in advance of the attacks , but this would be a political nightmare to deal with . "
The Israeli " Art Student " Spies
There is a second piece of evidence that suggests Israeli operatives were spying on al - Qaeda in the United States .
It is writ in the peculiar tale of the Israeli " art students " , detailed by this reporter for Salon.com in 2002 , following the leaking of an internal memo circulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration 's Office of Security Programs .
The June 2001 memo , issued three months before the 9/11 attacks , reported that more than 120 young Israeli citizens , posing as art students and peddling cheap paintings , had been repeatedly ­- and seemingly inexplicably -­ attempting to penetrate DEA offices and other law enforcement and Defense Department offices across the country .
The DEA report stated that the Israelis may have been engaged in " an organized intelligence gathering activity " , but to what end , U.S. investigators , in June 2001 , could not determine .
The memo briefly floated the possibility that the Israelis were engaged in trafficking the drug ecstasy .
According to the memo , " the most activity [ was ] reported in the state of Florida " during the first half of 2001 , where the town of Hollywood appeared to be " a central point for these individuals with several having addresses in this area " .
In retrospect , the fact that a large number of " art students " operated out of Hollywood is intriguing , to say the least .
During 2001 , the city , just north of Miami , was a hotbed of al - Qaeda activity and served as one of the chief staging grounds for the hijacking of the World Trade Center planes and the Pennsylvania plane ; it was home to fifteen of the nineteen future hijackers , nine in Hollywood and six in the surrounding area .
Among the 120 suspected Israeli spies posing as art students , more than thirty lived in the Hollywood area , ten in Hollywood proper .
As noted in the DEA report , many of these young men and women had training as intelligence and electronic intercept officers in the Israeli military -­ training and experience far beyond the compulsory service mandated by Israeli law .
Their " traveling in the U.S. selling art seem [ed ] not to fit their background " , according to the DEA report .
One " art student " was a former Israeli military intelligence officer named Hanan Serfaty , who rented two Hollywood apartments close to the mail drop and apartment of Mohammed Atta and four other hijackers .
Serfaty was moving large amounts of cash : he carried bank slips showing more than $ 100,000 deposited from December 2000 through the first quarter of 2001 ; other bank slips showed withdrawals for about $ 80,000 during the same period .
Serfaty 's apartments , serving as crash pads for at least two other " art students " , were located at 4220 Sheridan Street and 701 South 21st Avenue .
Lead hijacker Mohammed Atta 's mail drop was at 3389 Sheridan Street -- approximately 2,700 feet from Serfaty 's Sheridan Street apartment .
Both Atta and Marwan al - Shehhi , the suicide pilot on United Airlines Flight 175 , which smashed into World Trade Center 2 , lived in a rented apartment at 1818 Jackson Street , some 1,800 feet from Serfaty 's South 21st Avenue apartment .
In fact , an improbable series of coincidences emerges from a close reading of the 2001 DEA memo , the 9/11 Commission 's staff statements and final report , FBI and Justice Department watch lists , hijacker timelines compiled by major media and statements by local , state and federal law enforcement personnel .
In at least six urban centers , suspected Israeli spies and 9/11 hijackers and / or al - Qaeda­connected suspects lived and operated near one another , in some cases less than half a mile apart , for various periods during 2000­01 in the run-up to the attacks .
In addition to northern New Jersey and Hollywood , Florida , these centers included Arlington and Fredericksburg , Virginia ; Atlanta ; Oklahoma City ; Los Angeles ; and San Diego .
Israeli " art students " also lived close to terror suspects in and around Dallas , Texas .
A 25 - year - old " art student " named Michael Calmanovic , arrested and questioned by Texas - based DEA officers in April 2001 , maintained a mail drop at 3575 North Beltline Road , less than a thousand feet from the 4045 North Beltline Road apartment of Ahmed Khalefa , an FBI terror suspect .
Dallas and its environs , especially the town of Richardson , Texas , throbbed with " art student " activity .
Richardson is notable as the home of the Holy Land Foundation , an Islamic charity designated as a terrorist funder by the European Union and U.S. government in December 2001 .
Sources in 2002 told The Forward , in a report unrelated to the question of the " art students " , that " Israeli intelligence played a key role in helping the Bush administration to crack down on Islamic charities suspected of funneling money to terrorist groups , most notably the Richardson , Texas - based Holy Land Foundation , last December [ 2001 ] " .
It 's plausible that the intelligence prompting the shutdown of the Holy Land Foundation came from " art student " spies in the Richardson area .
Others among the " art students " had specific backgrounds in electronic surveillance or military intelligence , or were associated with Israeli wiretapping and surveillance firms , which prompted further concerns among U.S. investigators .
DEA agents described Michael Calmanovic , for example , as " a recently discharged electronic intercept operator for the Israeli military " .
Lior Baram , questioned near Hollywood , Fla. , in January 2001 , said he had served two years in Israeli intelligence " working with classified information " .
Hanan Serfaty , who maintained the Hollywood apartments near Atta and his cohorts , served in the Israeli military between the ages of 18 and 21 .
Serfaty refused to disclose his activities between the ages of 21 and 24 , including his activities since arriving in the U.S.A. in 2000 .
The French daily Le Monde meanwhile reported that six " art students " were apparently using cell phones that had been purchased by a former Israeli vice consul in the U.S.A .
Suspected Israeli spy Tomer Ben Dor , questioned at Dallas - Fort Worth Airport in May 2001 , worked for the Israeli wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping company NICE Systems Ltd. ( NICE Systems ' American subsidiary , NICE Systems Inc. , is located in Rutherford , New Jersey , not far from the East Rutherford site where the five Israeli " movers " were arrested on the afternoon of September 11 . )
Ben Dor carried in his luggage a print - out of a computer file that referred to " DEA Groups " .
How he acquired information about so - called " DEA Groups " ­- via , for example , his own employment with an Israeli wiretapping company -­ was never determined , according to DEA documents .
" Art student " Michal Gal , arrested by DEA investigators in Irving , Texas , in the spring of 2001 , was released on a $ 10,000 cash bond posted by Ophir Baer , an employee of the Israeli telecommunications software company Amdocs Inc. , which provides phone - billing technology to clients that include some of the largest phone companies in the United States as well as U.S. government agencies .
Amdocs , whose executive board has been heavily stocked with retired and current members of the Israeli government and military , has been investigated at least twice in the last decade by U.S. authorities on charges of espionage - related leaks of data that the company assured was secure .
( The company strenuously denies any wrong - doing . )
According to the former CIA counterterrorism officer with knowledge of investigations into 9/11 - related Israeli espionage , when law enforcement officials examined the " art students " phenomenon , they came to the tentative conclusion that " the Israelis likely had a huge spy operation in the U.S. and that they had succeeded in identifying a number of the hijackers " .
The German daily Die Zeit reached the same conclusion in 2002 , reporting that " Mossad agents in the U.S. were in all probability surveilling at least four of the 19 hijackers " .
The Fox News Channel also reported that U.S. investigators suspected that Israelis were spying on Muslim militants in the United States .
" There is no indication that the Israelis were involved in the 9/11 attacks , but investigators suspect that the Israelis may have gathered intelligence about the attacks in advance , and not shared it " , Fox correspondent Carl Cameron reported in a December 2001 series that was the first major exposé of allegations of 9/11 - related Israeli espionage .
" A highly placed investigator said there are ' tie-ins ' .
But when asked for details , he flatly refused to describe them , saying , 'evidence linking these Israelis to 9/11 is classified .
I cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered .
It 's classified information . ' "
One element of the allegations has never been clearly understood : if the " art students " were indeed spies targeting Muslim extremists that included al - Qaeda , why would they also be surveilling DEA agents in such a compromising manner ?
Why , in other words , would foreign spies bumble into federal offices by the scores and risk exposing their operation ?
An explanation is that a number of the art students were , in fact , young Israelis engaged in a mere art scam and unknowingly provided cover for real spies .
Investigative journalist John Sugg , who as senior editor for the Creative Loafing newspaper chain reported on the " art students " in 2002 , told me that investigators he spoke to within FBI felt the " art student " ring functioned as a wide - ranging cover that was counterintuitive in its obviousness .
DEA investigators , for example , uncovered evidence connecting the Israeli " art students " to known ecstasy trafficking operations in New York and Florida .
This was , according to Sugg , planted information .
" The explanation was that when our FBI guys started getting interested in these folks [ the art students ] ­- when they got too close to what the real purpose was ­- the Israelis threw in an ecstasy angle " , Sugg told me .
" The argument being that if our guys thought the Israelis were involved in a smuggling ring , then they would n't see the real purpose of the operation " .
Sugg , who is writing a book that explores the tale of the " art students " , told me that several sources within the FBI , and at least one source formerly with Israeli intelligence , suggested that " the bumbling aspect of the art student thing was intentional . "
When I reported on the matter for Salon.com in 2002 , a veteran U.S. intelligence operative with experience subcontracting both for the CIA and the NSA suggested a similar possibility .
" It was a noisy operation " , the veteran intelligence operative said .
The operative referred me to the film Victor , Victoria .
" It was about a woman playing a man playing a woman .
Perhaps you should think about this from that aspect and ask yourself if you wanted to have something that was in your face , that did n't make sense , that could n't possibly be them " .
The intelligence operative added , " Think of it this way : how could the experts think this could actually be something of any value ?
Would n't they dismiss what they were seeing ? "
U.S. and Israeli officials , dismissing charges of espionage as an " urban myth " , have publicly claimed that the Israeli " art students " were guilty only of working on U.S. soil without proper credentials .
The stern denials issued by the Justice Department were widely publicized in the Washington Post and elsewhere , and the endnote from officialdom and in establishment media by the spring of 2002 was that the " art students " had been rounded up and deported simply because of harmless visa violations .
The FBI , for its part , refused to confirm or deny the " art students " espionage story .
" Regarding FBI investigations into Israeli art students " , spokesman Jim Margolin told me , " the FBI can not comment on any of those investigations . "
As with the New Jersey Israelis , the investigation into the Israeli " art students " appears to have been halted by orders from on high .
The veteran CIA / NSA intelligence operative told me in 2002 that there was " a great press to discredit the story , discredit the connections , prevent [ investigators ] from going any further .
People were told to stand down .
You name the agency , they were told to stand down " .
The operative added , " People who were perceived to be gumshoes on [ this matter ] suddenly found themselves hammered from all different directions .
The interest from the middle bureaucracy was not that there had been a security breach but that someone had bothered to investigate the breach .
That was where the terror was " .
Choking off the press coverage
There was similar pressure brought against the media venues that ventured to report out the allegations of 9/11 - related Israeli espionage .
A former ABC News employee high up in the network newsroom told me that when ABC News ran its June 2002 exposé on the celebratory New Jersey Israelis , " Enormous pressure was brought to bear by pro-Israeli organizations " -- and this pressure began months before the piece was even close to airing .
The source said that ABC News colleagues wondered , " how they [ the pro-Israel organizations ] found out we were doing the story .
Pro- Israeli people were calling the president of ABC News .
Barbara Walters was getting bombarded by calls .
The story was a hard sell but ABC News came through the management insulated [ reporters ] from the pressure " .
The experience of Carl Cameron , chief Washington correspondent at Fox News Channel and the first mainstream U.S. reporter to present the allegations of Israeli surveillance of the 9/11 hijackers , was perhaps more typical , both in its particulars and aftermath .
The attack against Cameron and Fox News was spearheaded by a pro-Israel lobby group called the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America ( CAMERA ) , which operated in tandem with the two most highly visible powerhouse Israel lobbyists , the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( itself currently embroiled in a spy scandal connected to the Defense Department and Israeli Embassy ) .
" CAMERA pep - pered the shit out of us " , Carl Cameron told me in 2002 , referring to an e-mail bombardment that eventually crashed the Fox News.com servers .
Cameron himself received 700 pages of almost identical e-mail messages from hundreds of citizens ( though he suspected these were spam identities ) .
CAMERA spokesman Alex Safian later told me that Cameron 's upbringing in Iran , where his father traveled as an archeologist , had rendered the reporter " very sympathetic to the Arab side " .
Safian added , " I think Cameron , personally , has a thing about Israel " - - coded language implying that Cameron was an anti-Semite .
Cameron was outraged at the accusation .
According to a source at Fox News Channel , the president of the ADL , Abraham Foxman , telephoned executives at Fox News ' parent , News Corp. , to demand a sit - down in the wake of the Cameron reportage .
The source said that Foxman told the News Corp. executives , " Look , you guys have generally been pretty fair to Israel .
What are you doing putting this stuff out there ?
You 're killing us " .
The Fox News source continued , " As good old boys will do over coffee in Manhattan , it was like , well , what can we do about this ?
Finally , Fox News said , ' Stop the e-mailing .
Stop slamming us .
Stop being in our face , and we 'll stop being in your face -- by way of taking our story down off the web .
We will not retract it ; we will not disavow it ; we stand by it .
But we will at least take it off the web . ' "
Following this meeting , within four days of the posting of Cameron 's series on Fox News.com , the transcripts disappeared , replaced by the message , " This story no longer exists " .
What did Mossad know and tell the U.S. ?
Whether or not Israeli spies had detailed foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks , the Israeli authorities knew enough to warn the U.S. government in the summer of 2001 that an attack was on the horizon .
The British Sunday Telegraph reported on September 16 , 2001 , that two senior agents with the Mossad were dispatched to Washington in August 2001 " to alert the CIA and FBI to the existence of a cell of as many as 200 terrorists said to be preparing a big operation " .
The Telegraph quoted a " senior Israeli security official " as saying the Mossad experts had " no specific information about what was being planned " .
Still , the official told the Telegraph , the Mossad contacts had " linked the plot to Osama bin Laden " .
Likewise , Die Zeit correspondent Oliver Schröm reported that on August 23 , 2001 , the Mossad " handed its American counterpart a list of names of terrorists who were staying in the U.S. and were presumably planning to launch an attack in the foreseeable future " .
Fox News ' Carl Cameron , in May 2002 , also reported warnings by Israel : " Based on its own intelligence , the Israeli government provided ' general ' information to the United States in the second week of August that an al - Qaeda attack was imminent " .
The U.S. government later claimed these warnings were not specific enough to allow any mitigating action to be taken .
Mossad expert Gordon Thomas , author of Gideon 's Spies , says German intelligence sources told him that as late as August 2001 Israeli spies in the United States had made surveillance contacts with " known supporters of bin Laden in the U.S.A .
It was those surveillance contacts that later raised the question : how much prior knowledge did Mossad have and at what stage ? "
According to Die Zeit , the Mossad did provide the U.S. government with the names of suspected terrorists Khalid al - Mihdhar and Nawaf al - Hazmi , who would eventually hijack the Pentagon plane .
It is worth noting that Mihdhar and Hazmi were among the hijackers who operated in close proximity to Israeli " art students " in Hollywood , Florida , and to the Urban Moving Systems Israelis in northern New Jersey .
Moreover , Hazmi and at least three " art students " visited Oklahoma City on almost the same dates , from April 1 through April 4 , 2001 .
On August 24 , 2001 , a day after the Mossad 's briefing , Mihdhar and Hazmi were placed by the CIA on a terrorist watch list ; additionally , it was only after the Mossad warning , as reported by Die Zeit , that the CIA , on August 27 , informed the FBI of the presence of the two terrorists .
But by then the cell was already in hiding , preparing for attack .
The CIA , along with the 9/11 Commission in its adoption of the CIA story , claims that Mihdhar and Hazmi were placed on the watch list solely due to the agency 's own efforts , with no help from Mossad .
Their explanation of how the pair came to be placed on the watch list , however , is far from credible and may have served as a cover story to obscure the Mossad briefing [ See Ketcham 's sidebar story -- " The Kuala Lumpur Deceit " ] .
This brings up the possibility that the CIA may have known about the existence of the alleged Israeli agents and their mission , but sought , naturally , to keep it quiet .
A second , more troubling scenario , is that the CIA may have subcontracted to Mossad , given that the agency was both prohibited by law from conducting intelligence operations on U.S. soil , and lacked a pool of competent Arabic - fluent field officers .
In such a scenario , the CIA would either have worked actively with the Israelis or quietly abetted an independent operation on U.S. soil .
In his 9/11 investigative book , The Looming Tower , author Lawrence Wright notes that FBI counterterrorism agents , infuriated at the CIA 's failure to fully share information about Mihdhar and Hazmi , speculated that " the agency was shielding Mihdhar and Hazmi because it hoped to recruit them " .
The two al - Qaeda men , Wright notes , " must have seemed like attractive opportunities ; however , once they entered the United States they were the province of the FBI ... "
Wright further observes that the CIA 's reticence to share its information was due to a fear " that prosecutions resulting from specific intelligence might compromise its relationship with foreign services " .
When in the spring of 2002 the scenario of CIA 's domestic subcontracting to foreign intelligence was posed to the veteran CIA / NSA intelligence operative , with whom I spoke extensively , the operative did n't reject it out of hand .
The operative noted that in recent years the CIA 's human intelligence assets , known as " humint " ­- spooks on the ground who conduct surveillances , make contacts , and infiltrate the enemy ­- had been " eviscerated " in favor of the NSA 's far less perilous " sigint " , or signals intelligence program , the remote interception of electronic communications .
As a result , " U.S. intelligence finds itself going back to sources that you may not necessarily like to go back to , but are required to " , the veteran intelligence operative said .
" We do n't like the fact , but our humint structures are gone .
Israeli intel 's humint is as strong as ever .
If you have an intel gap , those gaps are not closed overnight .
It takes years and years of diligent work , a high degree of security , talented and dedicated people , willing management and a steady hand .
It is not a fun business , and it 's certainly not one without its dangers .
If you lose that capability , well organizations find themselves having to make a pact with the devil .
The problem [ in U.S. intel ] is very great " .
If such an understanding did exist between CIA and Mossad with regard to al - Qaeda 's U.S. operatives , the complicity would explain a number of oddities : it would explain the CIA 's nearly incoherent , and perhaps purposely deceptive , reconstruction of events as to how Mihdhar and Hazmi joined the watch list ; it might even explain the apparent brazenness of the Israeli New Jersey cell celebrating on the morning of 9/11 ( protected under the CIA wing , they were free to behave as they pleased ) .
It would also explain the assertion in one of the leading Israeli dailies , Yedioth Ahronoth , that in the months prior to 9/11 , when the Israeli " art students " were being identified and rounded up , the CIA " actively promoted their expulsion " .
The implication in the Yedioth Ahronoth article was that the CIA was simply being careless , not trying to spirit the Israelis safely out of the country .
At this point we can not be certain .
Israeli spying against the U.S. is of course hotly denied by both governments .
In 2002 , responding to my own questions about the " art students " , Israeli embassy spokesman Mark Regev issued a blanket denial .
" Israel does not spy on the United States " , Regev told me .
The pronouncements from officialdom are strictly pro forma , as it is no secret that spying by Israel on the United States has been wide - ranging and unabashed .
A 1996 General Accounting Office report , for example , found that Israel " conducts the most aggressive espionage operation against the United States of any U.S. ally " .
More recently , a former intelligence official told the Los Angeles Times in 2004 that " [ t ] here is a huge , aggressive , ongoing set of Israeli activities directed against the United States " .
It is also routine that Israeli spying is ignored or downplayed by the U.S. government ( the case of convicted spy Jonathan Pollard , sentenced to life in prison in 1986 , is a dramatic exception ) .
According to the American Prospect , over the last 20 years at least six sealed indictments have been issued against individuals allegedly spying " on Israel 's behalf " , but the cases were resolved " through diplomatic and intelligence channels " rather than a public airing in the courts .
Career Justice Department and intelligence officials who track Israeli espionage told the Prospect of " long - standing frustration among investigators and prosecutors who feel that cases that could have been made successfully against Israeli spies were never brought to trial , or that the investigations were shut down prematurely " .
The Questions That Await Answers
Remarkably , the Urban Moving Systems Israelis , when interrogated by the FBI , explained their motives for " celebration " on the New Jersey waterfront a celebration that consisted of cheering , smiling , shooting film with still and video cameras and , according to the FBI , " high - fiving " ­- in the Machiavellian light of geopolitics .
" Their explanation of why they were happy " , FBI spokesman Margolin told me , " was that the United States would now have to commit itself to fighting [ Middle East ] terrorism , that Americans would have an understanding and empathy for Israel 's circumstances , and that the attacks were ultimately a good thing for Israel " .
When reporters on the morning of 9/11 asked former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the effect the attacks would have on Israeli - American relations , he responded with a similar gut analysis : " It 's very good " , he remarked .
Then he amended the statement : " Well , not very good , but it will generate immediate sympathy [ for Israel from Americans ] " .
What is perhaps most damning is that the Israelis ' celebration on the New Jersey waterfront occurred in the first sixteen minutes after the initial crash , when no one was aware this was a terrorist attack .
In other words , from the time the first plane hit the north tower , at 8:46 a.m. , to the time the second plane hit the south tower , at 9:02 a.m. , the overwhelming assumption of news outlets and government officials was that the plane 's impact was simply a terrible accident .
It was only after the second plane hit that suspicions were aroused .
Yet if the men were cheering for political reasons , as they reportedly told the FBI , they obviously believed they were witnessing a terrorist act , and not an accident .
After returning safely to Israel in the late autumn of 2001 , three of the five New Jersey Israelis spoke on a national talk show that winter .
Oded Ellner , who on the afternoon of September 11 had , like his compatriots , protested to arresting officer Sgt. Dennis Rivelli that " we 're Israeli " , admitted to the interviewer : " We are coming from a country that experiences terror daily .
Our purpose was to document the event " .
By his own admission , then , Ellner stood on the New Jersey waterfront documenting with film and video a terrorist act before anyone knew it was a terrorist act .
One obvious question among many comes to mind :
If these men were trained as professional spies , why did they exhibit such outright oafishness at the moment of truth on the waterfront ?
The ABC network source close to the 20/20 report noted one of the more disturbing explanations proffered by counterintelligence investigators at the FBI : " The Israelis felt that in some way their intelligence had worked out ­- i.e. , they were celebrating their own acumen and ability as intelligence agents " .
The questions abound : Did the Urban Moving Systems Israelis , ready to " document the event " , arrive at the waterfront before the first plane came in from the north ?
And if they arrived right after , why did they believe it was a terrorist attack ?
What about the strange tale of the " art students " ?
Could they have been mere hustlers , as they claimed , who ended up repeatedly crossing paths with federal agents and living next door to most of the 9/11 hijackers by coincidence ?
Did the Israeli authorities find out more about the impending attacks than they shared with their U.S. counterparts ?
Or did the Israeli spies on the ground only intercept vague chatter that , in their view , did not warrant breaking cover to share the information ?
On the other hand , did the U.S. government receive more advance information about the attacks from Israeli authorities than it is willing to admit ?
What about the 9/11 Commission 's eliding of reported Israeli warnings that may have led to the watch - listing of Mihdhar and Hazmi ?
Were the Israeli warnings purposely washed from the historical record ?
Did the CIA know more about pre-9/11 Israeli spying than it has admitted ?
The unfortunate fact is that the truth may never be uncovered , not by officialdom , and certainly not by a passive press .
James Bamford , who in a coup of reporting during the 1980s revealed the inner workings of the NSA in The Puzzle Palace , points to the " key problem " : " The Israelis were all sent out of the country " , he says .
" There 's no nexus left .
The FBI just can't go knocking on doors in Israel .
They need to work with the State Department .
They need letters rogatory , where you ask a government of a foreign country to get answers from citizens in that country " .
The Israeli government will not likely comply .
So any investigation " is now that much more complicated " , says Bamford .
He recalls a story he produced for ABC News concerning two murder suspects -- U.S. citizens ­- who fled to Israel and fought extradition for ten years .
" The Israelis did nothing about it until I went to Israel , knocking on doors , and finally found the two suspects .
I think it'd be a great idea to go over and knock on their doors " , says Bamford .
The suspects are gone .
The trail is cold .
Yet many of the key facts and promising leads sit freely on the web , in the archives , safe in the news - morgues at 20/20 and The Forward and Die Zeit .
An investigator close to the matter says it reminds him of the Antonioni film " Blow - Up " , a movie about a photographer who discovers the evidence of a covered - up murder hidden before his very eyes in the frame of an enlarged photograph .

( Adds details on flu vaccine companies , background )
WASHINGTON , July 12 ( Reuters ) - The United States will spend another $ 1 billion on ingredients for an H1N1 vaccine , U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on Sunday .
“ There ’ll be another $ 1 billion worth of orders placed to get the bulk ingredients for an H1N1 vaccination .
Congress has agreed with the president that this is the number one priority , keeping Americans safe and secure , ” Sebelius said on CNN .
Sebelius has said plans were on track for a mid-October vaccination program , although it was not certain Americans would be offered the vaccine for the so - called swine flu .
“ We are aggressively working on , first of all , testing the virus strains to get a vaccination ready .
It needs to be safe so testing and clinical trials will start this month .
We ’ll know a lot more by the end of the summer and it needs to be effective , ” she said .
The World Health Organization may issue guidance as soon as Monday on whether an H1N1 swine flu vaccine will be offered alongside the seasonal flu vaccine .
Vaccine makers Sanofi-Aventis SASY .PA , Novartis NOVN.VX , Baxter BAX.N , GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L , Solvay SOLB.BR and AstraZeneca's AZN.L MedImmune subsidiary have finished making seasonal flu vaccines for this year .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has scheduled a July 23 advisory panel meeting to discuss clinical trials of the vaccines against the H1N1 influenza virus and the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice wills meet July 29 .
“ FDA is working with the scientists at NIH ( National Institutes of Health ) to make sure that we have a safe and effective strain and then we ’re getting ready to make sure that we have a vaccination program , ” Sebelius said .
Health experts estimate at least 1 million people have been infected with H1N1 in the United States , and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 211 deaths .
It often takes weeks or months to collect data on flu deaths .
About 36,000 people die each year from the seasonal flu in the United States alone , and 250,000 to 500,000 die globally .

The man who gunned down abortion provider George Tiller is now saying that similar attacks are planned :
The man charged with murdering a high - profile abortion doctor claimed from his jail cell Sunday that similar violence was planned around the nation for as long as the procedure remained legal , a threat that comes days after a federal investigation launched into his possible accomplices .
A Justice Department spokesman said the threat was being taken seriously and additional protection had been ordered for abortion clinics last week .
But a leader of the anti-abortion movement derided the accused shooter as “ a fruit and a lunatic . ”
Scott Roeder called The Associated Press from the Sedgwick County jail , where he ’s being held on charges of first - degree murder and aggravated assault in the shooting of Dr. George Tiller one week ago .
“ I know there are many other similar events planned around the country as long as abortion remains legal , ” Roeder said .
When asked by the AP what he meant and if he was referring to another shooting , he refused to elaborate further .
John Cole makes exactly the right point about this “ ticking time bomb ” scenario :
Since there is no doubt that we have a history of anti-abortion domestic terrorism , and since we know that evangelicals already support torture for everyone , when do we get to start waterboarding this guy ?
Does he have any children whose testicles can be crushed ?
Will we keep him up for weeks on end in stress positions in extremely cold rooms to get him to break ?
Beat him ?
All the right made a very good show of how shocked and appalled they were when this man killed Dr. Tiller , so surely they will not object .
So when do we get to start torturing this guy ?
And of course , the answer should be “ NEVER . ”
Torture is wrong .
Torture is immoral .
Torture is evil .
Torture is illegal .
Torture does more violence to our values than it does to the individual being tortured .
Torture is unreliable .
Torture is counter - productive - everything someone says after being tortured should be treated as suspect .
If we do n’t torture this guy , why not ?
Are squeamish Americans only cool with torturing brown people ?
Update : Conservative Conor Friedersdorf agrees :
Forgive me for reiterating a point I ’ve made before , but now that the guy who killed that abortion doctor is claiming he knows that more anti-abortion terrorist attacks are coming , the logic of the “ enhanced interrogation technique ” crowd really does suggest that he ought to be put on the waterboard , slammed into the wall , shackled naked in stress positions , etc .
And it is equally evident that this guy wo n’t be tortured — and rightfully so — because even though lives are at risk , it seems plain as day that torture is wrong when it is an American in custody , even when the American is charged with murder and making explicit threats , whereas some of the foreigners we tortured turned out to have been guilty of nothing except being rounded up by bounty hunters .
Update 2 : As does Jeff Fecke :
In working on Rails 3 over the past 6 months , I have focsed rather extensively on decoupling components from each other .
Why should ActionController care whether it's talking to ActionView or just something that duck - types like ActionView ?
Of course , the key to making this work well is to keep the interfaces between components as small as possible , so that implementing an ActionView lookalike is a matter of implementing just a few methods , not dozens .
While I was preparing for my talk at RubyKaigi , I was trying to find the smallest possible examples that demonstrate some of this stuff .
It went really well , but I noticed a few areas that could be improved even further , producing an even more compelling demonstration .
This weekend , I focused on cleaning up those interfaces , so we have small and clearly documented mechanisms for interfacing with Rails components .
I want to focus on ActionView in this post , which I 'll demonstrate with an example .
$ :.push " rails/activesupport/lib " $ :.push " rails/actionpack / lib " require " action_controller " class Kaigi < ActionController :: Http include AbstractController :: Callbacks include ActionController :: RackConvenience include ActionController :: Renderer include ActionController :: Layouts include ActionView :: Context before_filter : set_name append_view_path " views " def _action_view self end def controller self end DEFAULT_LAYOUT = Object.new.tap { |l| def l.render (*) yield end } def _render_template_from_controller( template , layout = DEFAULT_LAYOUT , options = {} , partial = false ) ret = template .
render ( self , {} ) layout. render ( self , {} ) { ret } end def index render : template => " template " end def alt render : template => " template " , : layout => " alt " end private def set_name @name = params [ : name ] end end app = Rack : : Builder.new do map ( " / kaigi " ) { run Kaigi.action ( : index ) } map ( " / kaigi/alt " ) { run Kaigi.action ( : alt ) } end.to_app Rack :: Handler :: Mongrel.run app , : Port => 3000
There 's a bunch going on here , but the important thing is that you can run this file with just ruby , and it'll serve up / kaigi and / kaigi / alt .
It will serve templates from the local " / views " directory , and correctly handle before filters just fine .
Let 's look at this a piece at a time :
$ :.push " rails/activesupport/lib " $ :.push " rails/actionpack / lib " require " action_controller "
This is just boilerplace .
I symlinked rails to a directory under this file and required action_controller .
Note that simply requiring ActionController is extremely cheap -- no features have been used yet
class Kaigi < ActionController :: Http include AbstractController :: Callbacks include ActionController :: RackConvenience include ActionController :: Renderer include ActionController :: Layouts include ActionView :: Context end
I inherited my class from ActionController : : Http .
I then included a number of features , include Rack convenience methods ( request / response ) , the Renderer , and Layouts .
I also made the controller itself the view context .
I will discuss this more in just a moment .
before_filter : set_name
This is the normal Rail before_filter .
I did n't need to do anything else to get this functionality other than include AbstractController : : Callbacks
append_view_path " views "
Because we 're not in a Rails app , our view paths have n't been pre-populated .
No problem : it 's just a one - liner to set them ourselves .
The next part is the interesting part .
In Rails 3 , while ActionView : : Base remains the default view context , the interface between ActionController and ActionView is extremely well defined .
Specifically :
A view context must include ActionView : : Context .
This just adds the compiled templates , so they can be called from the context
A view context must provide a _render_template_from_controller method , which takes a template object , a layout , and additional options
A view context may optionally also provide a _render_partial_from_controller , to handle render : partial => @some_object
In order to use Action View : : Helpers , a view context must have a pointer back to its original controller
That 's it !
That 's the entire ActionController <=> ActionView interface .
def _action_view self end def controller self end
Here , we specify that the view context is just self , and define controller , required by view contexts .
Effectively , we have merged the controller and view context ( mainly just to see if it could be done ;) )
DEFAULT_LAYOUT = Object.new.tap { |l| def l.render (*) yield end }
Next , we make a default layout .
This is just a simple proc that provides a render method that yields to the block .
It will simplify :
def _render_template_from_controller( template , layout = DEFAULT_LAYOUT , options = {} , partial = false ) ret = template .
render ( self , {} ) layout. render ( self , {} ) { ret } end
Here , we supply the required _render_template_from_controller .
The template object that is passed in is a standard Rails Template which has a render method on it .
That method takes the view context and any locals .
For this example , we pass in self as the view context , and do not provide any locals .
Next , we call render on the layout , passing in the return value of template .render .
The reason we created a default is to make the case of a layout identical to the case without .
def index render : template => " template " end def alt render : template => " template " , : layout => " alt " end private def set_name @name = params [ : name ] end
This is a standard Rails controller .
app = Rack : : Builder.new do map ( " / kaigi " ) { run Kaigi.action ( : index ) } map ( " / kaigi/alt " ) { run Kaigi.action ( : alt ) } end.to_app Rack :: Handler :: Mongrel.run app , : Port => 3000
Finally , rather than use the Rails router , we just wire the controller up directly using Rack .
In Rails 3 , ControllerName.action ( :action_name ) returns a rack - compatible endpoint , so we can wire them up directly .
And that 's all there is to it !
Note : I 'm not sure if I still need to say this , but stuff like this is purely a demonstration of the power of the internals , and does not reflect changes to the public API or the way people use Rails by default .
Everyone on the Rails team is strongly committed to retaining the same excellent startup experience and set of good conventional defaults .
That will not be changing in 3.0 .

In the kitchen since the age of 11 and having loads of fun with it .
Allan Donald , the former South African fast bowler , has said bowlers must be allowed to " prepare " the ball - ball - tampering , in other words - to redress the balance between bat and ball and protect the " dying breed " from increasingly lifeless pitches .
Speaking to Cricinfo on Friday , Donald was asked if he would recommend legalising ball tampering .
He said : " The ICC would shoot me for saying it but , with the wickets that we play on and the dying breed fast bowlers are becoming on these flatter wickets , I would say we do need some sort of defence mechanism , something to fall back on to say ' Right , we can do this .
We can now prepare this ball to go ' . "
Donald , currently the Warwickshire coach , knows , though , that his plea is likely to fall on deaf ears .
" That [ legalising ball - tampering ] quite simply would never happen , " he said .
Ball tampering was a raging issue in the 1990s , a period that coincided with Donald 's rise as leader of the South African bowling attack .
He agreed that bowlers had altered the condition of the ball in various ways to get prodigious reverse swing .
" There is no doubt guys tampered with the ball , " he said of the fast bowlers of his time .
He recalled one incident in the mid-1990s when he saw a former fast bowler pick a little chunk of leather live on the television during a Test match against England .
" The guy was just chipping away with his nails and I could n't believe how he could get away with it , " Donald said .
" The commentator , a famous former player , said " Steady on " , but he [ bowler ] denied it later .
Let 's not kid ourselves , there is no question it still goes on . "
To get reverse swing , one must rough one side of the ball while polishing the other .
" One [ popular ] way to do it is to get the ball into the dirt , " Donald said , a method easily practised on rough subcontinent surfaces where the ball , especially the white one , soon gets scuffed up .
" Even the red ball , in places like India , we found , did not take too long to reverse . "
England also used reverse swing to win back the Ashes at home in 2005 .
" Yes , I remember [ Andrew ] Flintoff and [ Simon ]
Jones do it beautifully to swing it both ways especially in Old Trafford by chucking the ball into the foothold . "
Donald is n't the first fast bowler to make this case ; in the mid-1990s , Sir Richard Hadlee had also asked for ball - tampering to be legalised .
" As long as the bowlers or fielders use whatever means they have on their persons , I do n't see anything wrong with it .
I 'm talking about the use of a finger nail to scratch the ball , not bottle tops or those sorts of things , " Hadlee wrote in a newspaper column at the time .
Donald agreed the best method , if the ICC relented , was to rip the ball without artificial help .
" I would n't bite it , " he said with a chuckle .
" One way is if the ball gets scuffed on one side , and there is a tiny little chunk that is missing , you pick it up and just keep that side dry and keep working on it , while shining the other side very heavily without putting any moisture .
The whole team needs to keep track of this and should know the ball is reversing and they need to shine one side .
The bowler , because he is bowling , should keep his wet hands on this side while keeping the other side dry .
That 's all you need . "
BURMA ’s isolated military junta is building a secret nuclear reactor and plutonium extraction facilities with North Korean help , with the aim of acquiring its first nuclear bomb in five years , according to evidence from key defectors revealed in an exclusive Herald report today .
The secret complex , much of it in caves tunnelled into a mountain at Naung Laing in northern Burma , runs parallel to a civilian reactor being built at another site by Russia that both the Russians and Burmese say will be put under international safeguards .
Ringing alarm bells ... the junta 's leader , General Than Shwe .
Two defectors were extensively interviewed separately over the past two years in Thailand by the Australian National University strategic expert Desmond Ball and a Thai - based Irish - Australian journalist , Phil Thornton , who has followed Burma for years .
One was an officer with a secret nuclear battalion in the Burmese army who was sent to Moscow for two years ’ training ; the other was a former executive of the leading regime business partner , Htoo Trading , who handled nuclear contracts with Russia and North Korea .

" The bottom - up revolution is fueling tremendous change in politics , commerce , and how people relate to each other .
Rob Kall 's book Bottom - Up provides a powerful guide to how organizations can understand and tap bottom - up 's power . "
Craig Newmark , founder of Craigslist
People are starting to to take notice of Fred Jerome ’s new book , Einstein on Israel and Zionism .
I reviewed the book here a couple months ago , but now it has gotten the attention of David Billet at The New Republic and Adam Kirsch at Tablet .
Both are apparently Zionists , and both seem unwilling to grapple with the important issues the book raises .
Billet and Kirsch take similar approaches in their reviews – they want to keep the parts of Einstein they like , and ditch the rest .
One of the most powerful parts for me of reading Jerome ’s book was seeing Einstein ’s own progression from ardent cultural Zionist to disillusioned critic as he watched Jabontinsky ’s revisionist Zionism come to fore .
By the end of the book Einstein has become a strong proponent of a binational state in historic Palestine out of the belief that a system of unequality between Jews and Arabs will only lead to unending conflict .
In their reviews , Billet and Kirsch highlight the early Einstein to defend Israel ( " The case for Israel has seldom been better put " ) , while discounting Einstein ’s eventual conclusions .
They refer to his call for equality between Jews and Palestinians as " naive " and " illogical , " and asset that Einstein could n’t possibly understand the situation on the ground from his ivory tower .
As Billet explains , " his dogmatic , abstract principles never yielded to the inconstant , brutal , human realities that the physicist is spared . "
Instead of wrestling with the reasons for Einstein ’s change of heart , Billet and Kirsch simply come up reasons why they do n’t even have to take his ideas seriously .
In addition , both reviewers attack Jerome for attempting to twist Einstein ’s words to carry out his " sloppy agitprop . "
Evidently Jerome ’s real sin is that he is critical of Israel without being apologetic for it .
Kirsch says that Einstein at least had the saving grace of considering himself a Zionist – " Einstein has one advantage over his new editor : his reservations about Israel were voiced from the standpoint of his unquestionable commitment to Zionism . "
Of course this is the litmus test you have to past before you can criticize Israel .
One irony of reading Einstein on Israel and Zionism is seeing that Billet and Kirsch ’s criticisms were just as prevalent during Einstein ’s lifetime .
The book documents Einstein ’s own debates with members of the Jewish community who tried to tell him he did n’t understand the issue and that he was hurting the community .
Einstein responded by saying that , rather than shaming the community , his call for equality was holding up Judaism ’s greatest ideals .
If only he was around today to remind Billet and Kirsch .
National Australia Bank has confirmed that it will abolish fees on overdrawn accounts from October 1 .
The move will apply to all NAB personal transaction and savings accounts , the bank said today .
'' These fees currently impact on around 700,000 NAB personal transaction or savings account customers a year , '' NAB said .
'' The (y ) also generate the most customer complaints to the bank of any bank fee and result in more customer complaints to the bank than any other matter . ''
Overdrawn account fees are charged when a customer 's personal transaction or savings account is overdrawn .
For some banks these fees can be as high as $ 40 to $ 50 on each occasion .
NAB said it already had cut overdrawn accounts fees in 2008 from $ 50 to $ 30 .
Perhaps the most ubiquitous reason to take a turn on the blender diet is having one ’s wisdom teeth removed .
I unwittingly took a trial run myself , getting all four wisdom teeth out about a year before I broke my jaw .
Luke from Tuna Cupcake went through it himself last fall and managed to make it fun – beyond the requisite painkillers – by testing out this awesome milkshake and then generously sharing the results with JWS :
When I was little , our neighbour grew these prize - winning pumpkins .
They were MASSIVE .
And every year , the vines would grow under the fence and a good number of pumpkins would grow in our yard .
And by ‘ a good number ’ , I ’m talking like 20 - 30 .
Needless to say , we had a problem with hooligans smashing pumpkins in our neighbourhood .
We also had an absurd number of Jack - O - Lanterns , which led to an absurd number of smash Jack - O - Lanterns in our driveway .
That said , it also meant that we had easy access to pumpkin for eating .
My mom makes delicious pumpkin pie that starts with a real pumpkin and not some crap from a can .
And oh , the difference it makes .
I definitely have a heart - on for all things pumpkin .
A few months back , I posted that I ’d had my wisdom teeth out and was trying to find interesting things to eat , Connor from Hold the Beef recommended a pumpkin pie shake .
I got the recommendation at about 8:30 am and was at the grocery store 10 minutes later , buying up all the ingredients .
Not only until I got home and got to talking Emily did it hit me that an actual pumpkin pie is pretty blendable ( and in my case , soft enough to eat as - is , but I was pretty paranoid for the first couple of days ) .
So we decided to try a delicious experiment : concocted shake vs. blended pie .
Note : Months and months passed ( and I healed fully from my wisdom teeth ordeal ) before I actually got around to finishing this post .
So rather than relying on faded memories , I invited my friend Pam over for a Saturday night of milkshakes .
Pumpkin Pie Shake
Connor pointed to a recipe on another Toronto food blog , Closet Cooking .
I knew I needed it before I even saw the recipe , but once I saw the picture and the comments , well , that cemented the deal .
As far as smoothies / shakes go , this one is fairly complicated .
You ’re mixing all the flavours of the pie , which gives you total control over the final product , but honestly , it ’s a bit of work for a milkshake .
Especially since I had to grind cloves .
Closet Cooking ’s Recipe ( Source )
2 cups vanilla frozen yogurt
¼ cup milk ( I needed more , to make it drinkable without a straw )
1/3 cup pumpkin puree ( I used canned )
¼ teaspoon vanilla
½ teaspoon cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ginger
1/8 teaspoon cloves
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoon gingersnap cookies ( crumbled for the topping , I did n’t use these )
Blend it all together and you get : a delicious shake that tastes like the idea of pumpkin pie in milkshake form .
Delicious , subtle flavours .
Downside : you can definitely tell that there was no crust involved .
You may get some semblance of that if you mix the gingersnap cookies in , but the recipe calls for them solely as a garnish .
Blended Pumpkin Pie
This is definitely the simpler option .
My process :
Throw some milk , frozen yogurt , and pumpkin pie into a blend and GO .
From 10 ingredients down to three .
This is how I like to cook .
From the first sip , you can definitely tell this is an actual pumpkin pie in milkshake form .
To my mind , that ’s a great thing .
Some part of me just loves knowing that I ’m drinking pie crust .
The… grit ( is that the word ? ) it adds might not be for everyone , but it brings a smile to my face .
The downside : your shake is really going to vary based on the pie you used .
If you ’re using your mom ’s homemade pie , you ’ll likely love the shake .
The first pie I made with it was pretty mildly spiced , and the shake was delicious .
When Pam and I did our taste test , we found the spice a bit overpowering .
In later attempts , it was hard to mask the spice of the Sara Lee pie without diluting the pumpkin- ey - ness more than I wanted .
The End Result
Based on the taste test Pam & I did in February , the Pumpkin Pie Shake from Closet Cooking came out the clear winner .
If you ’re trying to impress someone with your pumpkin - pie - shake - making skills , it ’s definitely the way to go .
Having control over the spices means you can make it a bit more delicate than the blended pie option , and you can prepare a consistent shake every time .
You really do get the idea of pumpkin pie in milkshake form , versus a blended pumpkin pie and everything that entails .
The one issue : 1.3 of a cup of pumpkin puree leaves the majority of a can left for some other purpose …
I ended up throwing mine out .
Thinking back to my days on a soft food diet , though , I ate a whole lot more of the blended pumpkin pie shakes ( an entire pie ’s worth , in fact ) .
They were just so easy , what with three ingredients ( four if you ’re adding protein powder – I did and enjoyed it ) .
And there ’s something satisfying about throwing some pie in the blender and drinking it down .
If you ’ve got access to a delicious pumpkin pie but ca n’t down it in its soft - but - solid form , give it a shot !
But as with anything , the quality of your ingredient dictates your results .
Future experiments : Check out the list on Closet Cooking ’s recipe - I ’m pretty excited to try out some more pumpkin pie-flavoured goods and use up this can of pumpkin puree !

Al Gore on Tuesday compared the battle against climate change with the struggle against the Nazis .
The former vice president said the world lacked the political will to act and invoked the spirit of Winston Churchill by encouraging leaders to unite their nations to fight climate change .
He also accused politicians around the world of exploiting ignorance about the dangers of global warming to avoid difficult decisions .
Speaking at Britain's Oxford University at the Smith School World Forum on Enterprise and the Environment , sponsored by the Times of London , Gore said , " Winston Churchill aroused this nation in heroic fashion to save civilization in World War II . "
He added , " We have everything we need except political will , but political will is a renewable resource . "
Gore admitted that it was difficult to persuade the public that the threat from climate change was as urgent as the threat from Nazi Germany .

Latvia is in recession after several years of boom
Latvia 's economy contracted 18 % in the first three months of the year , compared with a year earlier , as the country 's recession accelerated .
The slide in the manufacturing and services sectors continued in the first quarter , the statistics office said .
The Latvian economy , driven by consumer demand , was hit hard last year amid the global economic downturn .
In December the International Monetary Fund approved a 7.5 bn - euro ( £ 6.7 bn ) rescue package for Latvia .
Output fell across all sectors of the Latvia economy during the first quarter of the year .
The biggest drop was seen in hotels and restaurants , with activity down 34 % on the same quarter in 2008 .
" [ The decline in GDP ] was a bit worse in the early 90s , but we saw during the last few days that it was going to be a deep fall and it was deeper than expected , " said Andris Vilks , chief economist for SEB Latvia .
End of growth
Latvia continues to have one of the most troubled economies in the European Union ( EU ) .
Its Finance Ministry has said it expects GDP to fall 13 % this year .
Latvia joined the EU in 2004 and its economy grew at an average of 10 % per year , for four consecutive years .
However , most economists believe the speed of that growth is the reason why it is contracting so sharply now .
Separately on Monday , Latvia gained EU approval to shore up the country 's second - largest bank JSC Parex with another state capital injection .

Meth and the Bible .... A Combo Located on a dead end road
Bob Chapman | June 10 , 2009
On Friday , we had the latest edition of the FDIC “ Friday Night Financial Follies ” as regulators on Friday shut down Bank of Lincolnwood , a small bank in Illinois , marking the 37th failure this year of a federally insured bank .
More are expected to succumb amid the pressures of the weak economy and mounting loan defaults .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was appointed receiver of the failed bank , based in Lincolnwood , Ill. , which had about $ 214 million in assets and $ 202 million in deposits as of May 26 .
All of Bank of Lincolnwood 's deposits will be assumed by Republic Bank of Chicago , based in Oak Brook , Ill. , which also agreed to buy about $ 162 million of the bank 's assets ; the FDIC will retain the rest for eventual sale .
Bank of Lincolnwood 's two offices will reopen on Saturday as branches of Republic Bank of Chicago .
The FDIC estimates that the cost to the deposit insurance fund from the failure of Bank of Lincolnwood will be $ 83 million .
In a step that would substantially increase the price tag for Bernard L. Madoff 's long - running Ponzi scheme , lawyers for a group of his victims are asking a federal bankruptcy judge to reject the way their losses in the fraud are being calculated .
The customers insist that , by law , they should be given credit for the full value of the securities shown on the last account statements they received before Madoff 's arrest in mid-December , even though the statements were bogus and none of the trades were ever made .
According to court filings , those account balances add up to more than $ 64 billion .
After months of private negotiations and Internet arguments , lawyers for these customers formally put the issue before the federal bankruptcy court in New York in a lawsuit filed late Friday evening , less than a month before the deadline for filing claims for compensation .
The approach they seek would produce a significantly higher tally of cash losses than the formula being used by the court - appointed trustee overseeing the claims process for the Securities Investor Protection Corp. , a government - chartered agency financed by the brokerage industry .
The trustee , Irving H. Picard , is calculating investor losses as the difference between the total amount a customer paid into the scheme and the total amount withdrawn before it collapsed .
Customers who qualify are eligible for up to $ 500,000 in immediate compensation from SIPC .
Those whose eligible losses exceed that amount would divide up the assets recovered by the trustee .
Credit card holders who might have used tax refunds to pay down balances apparently spent the money elsewhere as the recession deepened in the first quarter .
That 's one conclusion that may be drawn from data showing the delinquency rate for bank - issued credit cards rose 11 percent in the first three months of the year , according to credit reporting agency TransUnion .
The delinquency rate - card holders who are three months past due - jumped to 1.32 percent this year , from 1.19 percent in the first three months of 2008 , TransUnion said .
The average total debt on bank cards also rose , jumping to $ 5,776 from $ 5,548 last year .
Balances typically rise in the first quarter , as holiday spending comes due , said TransUnion 's Ezra Becker .
The credit card delinquency rate remains well below the 5.22 percent for mortgages in the first quarter , meaning card holders are trying hard to keep their payments current .
It 's too early to tell how changes in credit card regulations will affect payment rates , Becker said .
- The biggest price swings in Treasury bonds this year are undermining Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’s efforts to cap consumer borrowing rates and pull the economy out of the worst recession in five decades .
The yield on the benchmark 10 - year Treasury note rose to 3.90 percent last week as volatility in government bonds hit a six - month high , according to Merrill Lynch & Co. ’s MOVE Index of options prices .
Thirty - year fixed - rate mortgages jumped to 5.45 percent from as low as 4.85 percent in April , according to Bankrate.com in North Palm Beach , Florida .
Costs for homebuyers are now higher than in December .
Government bond yields , consumer rates and price swings are increasing as the Fed fails to say if it will extend the $ 1.75 trillion policy of buying Treasuries and mortgage bonds through so - called quantitative easing , traders say .
The daily range of the 10 - year Treasury yield has averaged 12 basis points since March 18 , when the plan was announced , up from 8.6 basis points since 2002 , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
The trend of employment in the U.S. strengthened in May for the first time in 16 months , a report said Monday .
The Conference Board said its May employment trends index rose 0.2 % to 89.9 from April 's revised level of 89.7 that was originally reported as 89.5 .
The May index was down 20 % from a year ago .
In May , the percentage of firms not able to fill positions right now , the percentage of consumers who think jobs are " hard to get " , real business sales and job openings showed improvement .
The privately owned Federal Reserve has subjected us to a 22 - month period of massive excess liquidity .
The present increase in liquidity , formerly known as M3 , which is no longer published because it ’s not cost efficient , or there is n’t sufficient interest in the figures , says the Fed , is growing at about 18 % .
The major purpose for the US Treasury and the Fed to commit to an increase in spending of $ 14.8 trillion is to bail out banking , Wall Street and the insurance industry , all of which turned prudent investment into a casino .
The method chosen to deal with a financial crisis caused by unsustainable debt created by excess liquidity is to create more money and credit and channel it to the financial sector to reflate their balance sheets , which are debt infested with toxic CDO and ABS debt .
The rich on Wall Street , banking and insurance are deleveraging with the taxpayer taking all the risk , as the public gets very little in return .
We are surrounded by financial zombies , which we keep alive after they almost destroyed our financial system .
Major inflation is the result as wages barely rise and the loss of purchasing power is borne mostly by the poor and the lower middle class .
Ever since free trade , globalization , offshoring and outsourcing began about 1980 wages have not kept up with inflation .
Production gravitated to the low wage third world exacerbated by massive condoned illegal immigration .
This was accompanied by cronic overcapacity that made conspicuous consumption relatively inexpensive .
That was joined by much easier credit .
Twenty - three months ago we saw an implosion as a result of these policies , which is still with us .
Without this continuation of debt the system cannot continue to function and the downward spiral feeds on itself .
Everyone is looking for a bottom soon .
That is n’t going to happen , stimulus or no stimulus .
Handing money to citizens is n’t the answer .
In this case 90 % has gone to reduce debt .
The first step to recovery is to drastically cut government spending and to lower corporate and individual taxes .
Get rid of the Federal Reserve , which is directly responsible for this mess and erect tariffs on goods and services .
If we can accomplish that the recovery will begin , but it wo n’t be easy .
It will take years to accomplish .
As a result of flawed fiscal and economic policies nations are facing record deficits .
Some like England have been put on negative credit watch , which could lead to a downward re-rating .
The US , Japan and others are following close behind .
In fact down grades could come before the end of the year .
Interest rates are already moving higher and have been since the beginning of the year .
Downgrades would bring even higher rates .
The Chairman of the Fed , Ben Bernanke , would have us believe along with other , so - called experts , that monetary easing will come in time to head off hyperinflation .
Unfortunately that cannot happen .
The minute money and credit is withdrawn from the system it will collapse .
The underlying deflationary drag is too great and that drag will take years to diminish .
How can our Fed Chairman and our Treasury Secretary think for a moment that they ’ll just be able to turn the tap off when their current orgy of spending ends ?
Politicians unfortunately see this , as only they would , as an opportunity to purchase votes by making sure the spending continues .
It will be interesting to watch over the next several years , as many nations scramble in the bond markets to raise money to keep their economies going .
There is no telling at this point how high interest rates are going to go .
Our President tells us of trillion dollar plus deficits are far as the eye can see .
Those deficits assume 3 % growth rates in GDP , which is not going to happen and the end of the Bush tax cuts .
Deficits will be much larger than the Congressional Budget Office estimates , if due to nothing more than exploding entitlement expenditures .
This plan involves the perpetual rolling of $ 5 trillion in Treasury paper much of which is held by foreigners plus the new debt incurred , plus the interest on the existing debt .
Do you really believe foreigners are going to fund such deficits indefinitely ?
We do n’t think so with a falling dollar .
The dollar is falling again and interest rates are rising and they both are going to continue to do so , as gold and silver go higher .
The minute the Fed began creating money out of thin air to fund Treasury sales , plus buy Treasuries out of the market , plus buy Agency securities and toxic junk to the tune of $ 2.2 trillion for openers , you had to know the game was over .
It ’s all - downhill from here .
This week 30 - year fixed rate mortgages could hit 5 - 3/4 % .
Last week we heard the VAT , Value Added Tax , may be on the way .
It ’s the most vicious of all taxes and you do not want to experience it .
It would help solve the problem , but your standard of living will drop 20 % if it is enacted .
Such taxes cannot come until 2011 because 2010 is an election year .
Such taxes will exacerbate the depression .
In the end cutting spending is the only answer .
Mr. Obama speaks of the importance of living within our means and not spending money we do not have on things we do not need .
Obviously the president has n’t been told we are in a depression .
The less the public spends the deeper the depression gets .
That said Mr. Obama engages in profligate federal spending to deaden the pain and essentially to prolong the financial and economic agony .
Then comes the creative destruction with government deciding who should survive and who should fail by edict .
Some call it crony capitalism and favoritism , we call it taking care of fellow Illuminists .
The way Wall Street tells us we need hands on help from Wall Street and banks , which led to this disaster .
The president wants economic advisers who are theoreticians .
All paper has to be marked to a real market price to clean out the bad assets .
Government should not be giving free loans to hedge - funds and private - equity firms , so they will buy assets they would not normally buy .
Due to electronic trading , which has led to major trading off established exchanges , and into the dark pools we do not know who is doing what .
A net flow of information so that the investors and transparency is nearly gone .
Bank holding companies , which own the Fed , can see in advance what their clients are interested in buying and front run those orders in their own accounts .
If they make major mistakes they just get bailout out by the Fed .
There is no transparency .
We only find out what went on when somebody slips or in some way something gets exposed .
Transparency , oversight and accountability do not exist .
Most everything important is done in secret .
A good example was six months ago when Bloomberg News attempted to force the Fed to reveal the details on more than $ 2 trillion in loans that went to banks , including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs .
The Fed told the court to take a hike and said it was a state secret .
We have no word as well who made the short - dated , out - of - the money bets in March of 2008 that Bear Stearns would fail .
Those bids paid off in the millions , or why Lehman was allowed to fail and AIG was saved , etc .
Not one banking or Wall Street executive owned up to what really happened to cause the crisis .
They are totally lacking in honesty , integrity and decency .
As it now stands we ’ll never know the true inside story of what really went on .
We have seen no civil or criminal charges against any of these crooks .
Not even investigations .
Whatever happened to RICO ?
Over the past 25 years our financial industry has descended into darkness and corruption and the people who caused it are getting away scott free .
Our Treasury Secretary Geithner ’s ill - fated trip to China and our president ’s recent journey to Germany was humiliating .
Crowds as well as the German government were demanding the return of their gold .
The US has been giving platitudes to the Germans when the Germans know their gold has been sold or leased .
Leasing is tantamount to selling .
This story has not been broken in the mainstream media , but in time it will be and when it is propaganda will not deflect the ultimate outcome .
The president and Larry Summers think they can restore confidence and trust in the economy with lies and propaganda , but they are deluding themselves .
The stock , bond and capital markets are dependent on confidence , but they are more dependent upon the deplorable state of the foundation on which our economy rests .
In 22 months the Fed and the Treasury have accomplished very little except bailing out their fellow elitists in the financial industry with taxpayer debt .
The mantra that the worst is over is simply more lies similar to those we ’ve heard over and over again .
Thus far the smoke and mirrors and the “ Working Group on Financial Markets have managed to create a 35 % to 50 % bear market correction in the averages .
Our president , a professional con man and street hustler promises he will always tell you the truth about the challenges we face .
Trust him and you will find yourself somewhere out in left field .
Thus far all we have seen is a papering over of the financial system .
Our Treasury and Fed offer the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility , the Public Private Investment Program , the phony stress test and TARP .
The commitment to domestic and foreign financial entities is already at $ 14.8 trillion .
There is no discussion of building a new better system that rewards prudent risks , allocates capital where it is really needed , not in the hands of banking and Wall street .
It would as well be a great idea if the SEC and the CFTC started protecting the investors and stop collaborating with Wall Street and Washington to manipulate markets .
When will the rescues of the financial sector end – when it has bankrupted us all ?
They are the ones who caused all this .
We now have Government Motors at the former General Motors and Chrysler that has been given away to Illuminist Fiat .
Is every company , bank and brokerage house in America to be bailed out indefinitely ?
When we do this , we are generally trying to understand the potential consequences of various responses to a given situation .
This sort of exercise is a form of risk assessment , and it is a very important tool for making decisions about events that could impact the future .
Sometimes the consequences are minor .
If I choose not to take an umbrella to work and it rains , there is probably a small consequence .
If I choose to pass a car on a blind hill , the consequence may be severe , and may extend to other people .
I spend a lot of time playing " What if ? "
It is an important aspect of my line of work , but we all do this to some extent .
I do it when I am driving - " What if that car at the next intersection pulls out in front of me ? " - when I am working " What if that high pressure line ruptures ? " - and at home - " What if I wake up and find the house is on fire ? "
I also spend a lot of time pondering the question " What if there are energy shortages in the near future ? "
What If I 'm Wrong About Peak Oil ?
I guess it was my training as a scientist that instilled in me the position that conclusions are tentative .
( I was two years into a Ph.D. in chemistry before I decided the job prospects were better for a chemical engineer ) .
They are subject to revision as additional data come in , and you have to always be willing to consider that your preconceptions may be wrong .
But acknowledging that I could be wrong has to go hand - in - hand with the consequences of being wrong .
I have formulated a lot of “ what if ” questions around timing and consequences of peak oil .
My view on peak oil is that it presents an enormous challenge for humanity , that global oil production will peak within 10 years ( if it has n’t peaked already ) , and that there is no easy solution .
I see spiking oil prices and the subsequent fallout as a prelude to what lies ahead .
These views have influenced my profession , where I have chosen to live , what I read , and what I say to others .
Fear of peak oil has influenced some people not to attend college , or to quit their jobs and move away to remote locations .
It has even caused some people to decide against having children .
But what if I am wrong about the timing / consequences of peak oil ?
How would that impact me ?
For me , this one has low consequences .
If I am wrong and we have adequate oil supplies for the next 40 years , then perhaps I live a more frugal life than I might have otherwise .
I prefer to walk , ride a bike , or take a train instead of hopping into a car to drive some place .
When I drive , I probably drive a smaller car than I would have otherwise .
I grow some of my own food .
Then again , I have always been frugal , so perhaps I would have done all of these things regardless .
The one thing that it may have impacted upon in a major way is my interest in energy .
But if I am right , then I have plans in place to manage the impact as well as I can .
Those plans start with minimizing my energy consumption .
It is my small insurance policy .
If the worst case turns out to be right , then there is n't a lot I can do except try to make sure my family and I are in circumstances that minimize the risk .
Further , I have done a lot of work that is aimed at improving our energy security in the years ahead .
That work includes promoting renewable energy technologies that I think can make a long - term contribution , but also arguing for conservation , and better utilization of our own natural resources .
So if I am correct , then I have chosen to work on things that have the potential to mitigate the consequences .
But what if the other side is wrong ?
Government agencies devoted to monitoring our natural resources often reassure us that there is plenty of oil for decades to come .
But what if the government , industry , etc. turn out to have missed the mark on peak oil ?
In that case I think we will be in for a lot of trouble .
If the peak comes quickly and the decline is steep , I believe we will be wholly unprepared .
There is not a cheap , easy substitute for oil .
Much higher prices will be inevitable in such a situation .
Industries - such as the airline industry - wo n't be prepared and we will see perhaps entire sectors go bankrupt .
While I do believe that over time we can transition to natural gas vehicles ( and I do n’t think the situation with natural gas is as dire ) , that will take some time .
If the government is wrong and the peak happens much sooner than expected , we will be in for a very difficult transition period .
In other words , their consequences of being wrong are much worse than my consequences of being wrong .
If they are wrong , people may starve during a difficult post - peak transition .
If I am wrong , we move to a healthier , more sustainable lifestyle .
What If I am Wrong on Global Warming ?
Another question I think a lot about is " What If I am Wrong on Global Warming ? "
I come down on the side that human activity is contributing to global warming , yet the scientist in me reminds me that " conclusions are tentative . "
But each camp has elements that feel – all too often with religious fervor - that the other side ’s position will lead to either environmental or economic devastation .
So we get a lot of vitriol in this discussion , which I do n't like .
If the Al Gore contingent is correct , then we are facing some very major problems .
As I have written before , I do n't expect us to be able to rein in carbon dioxide emissions , so I see a future with ever higher atmospheric CO2 , and potential environmental devastation if Al Gore is correct .
On the other hand are those who believe that human activities play little or no role in global warming .
They view the opposition as putting global economies at risk by putting a price on carbon emissions .
While I think environmental devastation is a much worse consequence than economic stagnation , the impact of that could be pretty severe as well .
What I would prefer to see – instead of two opposing camps dug into bunkers and tossing verbal grenades at each other – are more open minds on both sides .
I would like to see the sides posing the question “ What if I am wrong ? ”
Another good question to ask in these sorts of debates is “ Is there any evidence that would convince me that I am wrong ? ”
I do n't know what scientists will say when they look back at this issue a hundred years from now , but I do n't want to see the debate squelched by those who shouted the loudest .
In conclusion , I never discount the possibility that I could be wrong about any number of things .
I would say that precious few of my views are embedded in granite .
That 's why I write ; to discuss , debate , learn , and change my mind when reason dictates that .
But before you decide to respond to this essay with a strongly worded opinion , ask yourself the question “ What if I am wrong ? ”

You ’ve written your goals down for the year .
You ’ve identified the little steps you want to take to achieve the goals and you feel positive that this time you will be able to attain your goals .
It ’s time that you finally you get around achieving those goals .
None of the above steps are going to ensure you have success in reaching your goals .
They are great ones to work towards a goal , but there are many further processes that will need to be completed as well to ensure that you reach your dreams .
One critical process that will help you with achieving your aims is to evaluate and check your progress every day .
The best time for this is in the evenings just before going to bed .
Consider this preparation time spent to help you with the next day ’s tasks .
This is the time when you acknowledge your successes , review your goals , focus on what you wish to happen in your future and make plans to accomplish them .
Specifically you want to know what you will be doing the following day to work towards your goals .
If one of your main goals is to lose weight then you will reflect on how much exercise you managed to fit into your busy day , how well you stuck to that healthy eating plan you had set up for the day and how you felt about yourself all round .
Read
Then you plan the next day ’s steps to move towards your goals .
What activity could you fit in to help you work a bit further ?
Where could you improve your skills and how could you swap that packet of choc-chip cookies that you like to reward yourself with , with something that was n’t a food item .
Would you have time for a soothing massage maybe ?
On the other hand if your goal is to grow a business on the internet , then your checks and balances would be quite different .
You would determine how many articles you managed to write , how much traffic that brought into your site .
You would check your statistics to see how many people signed up to your newsletters and if anybody bought your eBook .
You would check your progress on your next eBook and make a note of the content you would develop for it .
After all of the evaluation you would decide on what to do the next day to bring you closer to your goal of a successful business .
Many small steps that are easily achievable will make you reach your goal more easily .
But it ’s not only making those small steps that ’s important .
It is also vitally important that you check your progress every day .
This helps keep you focused on your goals .
It makes you see that you are making progress which is always immensely encouraging and it ensures that you do not wander off the path .
For so much time in our lives we occupy ourselves with activities that kind of fall in our way .
We spend hours browsing shops without having any idea what we want to buy .
When we see it we know we will want it is our reasoning .
It ’s the same with surfing the internet .
We get stuck in a loop of reading a mountain of articles that are kind of interesting but add no value to our day or what we wish to achieve ourselves .
With so much information and so many stimuli constantly hitting our conscious mind we find it increasingly difficult to focus on what is good for us and what would add to where we want to be .
By focusing every evening on what our day delivered to us and what we made of it , and working on what we want to do the next day , we start training ourselves to be more selective in terms of the experiences we want to have and the goals we want to achieve .
There is no doubt about it : just planning a renovation can be time - consuming and stressful — hunting down a contractor , pursuing construction
There is no doubt about it : just planning a renovation can be time - consuming and stressful — hunting down a contractor , pursuing construction permits , securing the financing .
Here are some remodeling prep tips from home repair expert Mike Holmes , star of HGTV’s “ Holmes on Homes , ” and of the recently launched Holmes : The Magazine to Make It Right , to help you get started .
Plan : Know your needs
Do your homework .
Start with a list of preferences for such items as lighting , flooring , and appliances–and include brand names .
This will keep you and your general contractor on the same page about the costs and quality of the work .
The more details you can provide the better .
Put your ideas on paper — make sketches and draw up floor plans to discuss with your contractor .
Budget : Control spending
Do n’t just nail down products you want your contractor to use but also call around for estimates for how much they cost to install .
Factor these in along with miscellaneous expenses such as dining out or booking a hotel room when and if construction makes the space temporarily unlivable .
This leads to a realistic budget .
A good rule of thumb is to set aside 10 - 15 percent more than you figure your renovation will cost .
Hire :
Ask the right questions
Important questions to ask the contractor include :
What warranty do you offer , and what does it cover ?
May I see a copy of your business license
Are you going to acquire the correct permits for the job or will I ?
For the complete guide to renovating your home step by step , consult the February 2011 issue of Holmes Magazine , on newsstands January 11 .

Industry Minister Tony Clement says he will consider intervening in the auction of Nortel assets on grounds of Canada 's overall interest .
He said this afternoon that he would vet the Nortel sale after Tuesday 's court approval of the transaction .
Clement said it would be inappropriate for him to " checkmate " the process before U.S. and Canadian courts issue a ruling .
" We 'll see what the courts say about the bid , whether it's an acceptable bid according to the court - sponsored process , " he told reporters during a break in a conference on shipbuilding .
After the court decision , " the issue will come up as to whether this is a bid that is acceptable to the government of Canada under the Investment Canada rules , " Clement remarked .
The government will vet the deal to see if the investment by the buyer of Nortel assets is high enough to be " a net benefit to Canada , " as required under foreign investment legislation , he said .
Also , Clement noted , " RIM ( Research in Motion ) has raised the national security issue as well . "
Earlier today , the Swedish company Ericsson said it is confident that its $ 1.13 billion ( U.S. ) purchase of Nortel Networks Corp .'s wireless business will be completed , and is planning to ask Ottawa to help finance the deal .
Hans Vestberg , Ericsson 's chief financial officer , said that he expects the purchase to be approved by bankruptcy courts and receive the necessary regulatory approvals .
His comments came one day after Waterloo - based RIM , maker of the popular BlackBerry , renewed its call on Ottawa to intervene in the deal after complaining last week that it had been shut out of a court - supervised bidding process .
" On the RIM claims , there are some regulatory issues left to be defined , " said Vestberg during a conference call with analysts and reporters .
" However as we can see it right now ... we 're confident that we will see this go through . "
He also said that , while the particulars of how the deal will be financed have yet to be worked out , the Swedish telecom equipment giant is planning to explore the possibility of a loan from Export Development Canada .
" We will sit down with the Canadian government and see if we can get financing from them . "
European rival Nokia Siemens Networks ' original bid for Nortel 's wireless unit included a $ 300 million ( U.S. ) loan from EDC , which Nokia Siemens said reflected the fact that much of Nortel 's equipment is exported to foreign markets .
Nortel filed for bankruptcy protection in January , but is now in the process of breaking itself apart after failing to restructure .
The business Ericsson has agreed to buy sells telecom equipment to wireless carriers using the increasingly out - of - favour CDMA standard , including Bell Canada Inc. and Telus Corp. in Canada .
It also includes a business focused on a next - generation wireless technology dubbed Long Term Evolution , or LTE .
The prospect of a foreign company buying a piece of Nortel , once Canada 's top technology company , initially drew relatively little interest .
But the issue heated up last week after RIM accused Nortel of blocking it from the court - supervised auction – a charge Nortel has disputed .
It 's believed that RIM had been eager to bid on both the wireless business and certain patents relating to Nortel 's LTE technology that were n't included in last Friday 's auction .

RIM said on Sunday that it is still interested in acquiring " certain Nortel assets " and called on Ottawa to intervene .
" The government has the authority and responsibility to protect vital Canadian interests , " RIM said in a statement that echoed overtures last week from RIM co-CEO Jim Balsillie .
Ericsson 's purchase of the Nortel division , which generated about $ 2 billion in revenue last year , is scheduled to be approved by U.S. and Canadian bankruptcy courts tomorrow during a joint hearing .

You could n't say we did n't see this coming : Charlotte Allen 's May 17 Op - Ed article on her dislike of outspoken atheists ( think Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins , pictured to the right in that order ) has gone viral , sitting at No. 4 on list of most e-mailed latimes.com stories as of 2:45 p.m. today .
As expected , there has been plenty of atheist blowback in the blogosphere .
The most pointed criticism comes from Hemant Mehta , proprietor of Friendly Atheist .
He writes :
Here ’s why I ca n’t stand Jews .
They ’re boring .
They keep complaining about being oppressed .
They keep talking about the same damn things all the time -- Holocaust this and Israel that .
They always claim they ’re victims .
They only constitute a small percentage of Americans -- probably because they can’t win over any converts .
They still complain about how state Constitutions bar them from holding office -- really , only six of them do -- even though the Supreme Court has said those provisions are unenforceable .
They want affirmative action for their kind -- one representative from the “ pity - poor - me ” school of Jews even said they need “ safe spaces ” at colleges !
They assume everyone who does n’t agree with them is “ beyond stupid . ”
They never want to take on the serious arguments that theologians have made in favor of the Christian god .
Some Jews think Jesus never even existed .
So what do they know ?
They ’re not rational .
They ’re just angry .
Angry because they think the world is unfair to them .
Angry that someone forced them to go to church as a child .
Some Jews are so angry , they sued the government to prevent a Christian prayer from being spoken at President Obama ’s inauguration .
The gall !
Now … if I actually believed that , I ’d be called every name in the book .
And rightfully so .
Those are ignorant , bigoted , hateful remarks .
They ’re also wildly stereotypical and extremely inaccurate .
When Charlotte Allen says the exact same things about atheists , however , she gets published in the Los Angeles Times .
Biology professor PZ Myers , whose adroit defenses of science against attacks by creationist - types have made me a somewhat regular reader of his blog Pharyngula , bore a good share of Allen 's anger .
Allen wrote :
Then there 's P.Z. Myers , biology professor at the University of Minnesota 's Morris campus , whose blog , Pharyngula , is supposedly about Myers ' field , evolutionary biology , but is actually about his fanatical propensity to label religious believers as " idiots , " " morons , " " loony " or " imbecilic " in nearly every post .
The university deactivated its link to Myers ' blog in July after he posted a photo of a consecrated host from a Mass that he had pierced with a rusty nail and thrown into the garbage ( " I hope Jesus ' tetanus shots are up to date " ) in an effort to prove that Catholicism is bunk -- or something .
Myers ' response , which he filed under his blog category " Kooks " :
Her opening is clear .
She thinks we 're " crashing bores " .
A hint for Ms. Allen : never start an essay by declaring your subject to be boring .
Either your readers will stop at that point , or they 'll read on and discover that despite your claim , you seem to be concerned enough to write on at excessive length about something that is supposedly boring .
...
Then there is an incoherent middle where she just flames on about how mean atheists are ( I call them all horrible names , you see ) , never seeming to notice that all she is doing is spouting angry vitriol about atheists .
Gripe , gripe , gripe .
The only time she even tries to state what the position of theists might be is in her closing paragraph , and again , she 's oblivious to the problem with her position .
...
There simply is n't anything to engage in Allen 's howl of outrage .
I'm a little surprised that something so shallow and empty could get published in the LA Times at all , especially with Charlotte Allen 's track record .
My only previous encounter with her was an astonishing rant in the Washington Post , in which she flatly claimed that women were dumber than men .
Seriously .
While claiming there was no difference in average intelligence .
Look for more response in the form of letters to the editor and possibly a Blowback in the coming days .
We 're also interested in what you have to say , so feel free to join the discussion by leaving a comment below .
Updated Tuesday at 5:22 am :
The original misspelled Hemant Mehta 's last name and incorrectly said Myers had filed his response to Allen under the category " Gooks , " not " Kooks . "
Thanks to readers for pointing out these errors , and apologies to Mehta and Myers .

RANDALL " RAAAAAAANDY " FRANKLIN
1982 - 2016
Randy " RAAAAAAAANDY " Franklin passed away on November 14 , 2016 in a tragic recreational watersports accident .
This website is dedicated to the memory of his standup comedy , acting and Vines .
We can only hope his entuiasm for life continues in all his RAAAAAAANDY heads and his team at laughyourdickoff.com .
A couple of years ago , were you to have swung by Westside Grocery in the town of Mendota on a Thursday or a Friday , you probably would have had to linger for a while in the sizzling Central Valley heat .
The little store was so busy that the line of customers waiting to cash paychecks and make purchases would often spill out the door and halfway down 7th Street .
But now the paychecks have dried up , along with the farmland in these parts , thanks to a cruel confluence of drought , environmental regulation and years of political neglect .
On a recent end - of - week visit to the market , I found the place empty , save for two jobless men loitering inside and the owner , Joseph Riofrio , and his teenage son , who stood behind the front counter hoping for customers .
Over the next hour , half a dozen or so folks trickled in .
A couple bought snacks .
Most , though , had stopped by to take care of their utility bills -- many of them delinquent .
Westside Grocery doubles as a Pacific Gas & Electric payment center .
“ People do n’t know where they ’re going to get the money , ” said Riofrio , shuffling through a stack of orange PG&E ; past - due notices .
“ Some are paying with pennies and dimes . ”
Advertisement
Riofrio ’s own business has fallen off 60 % in the last six months .
Mendota ( population 9,870 ) has gotten a lot of attention of late , what with its unemployment rate now topping 40 % .
The state secretary of Food and Agriculture showed up here last month .
So did Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who has called on President Obama to issue a federal disaster declaration for Fresno County .
But what Riofrio and others will tell you is that , despite the surge of interest in this region , the crisis did not materialize suddenly .
Rather , the people of Mendota and their neighbors -- in Kerman , Firebaugh , San Joaquin and a handful of smaller burgs -- are the victims of a long and painful slide .
This is California ’s Detroit .
The 47 - year - old Riofrio , whose grandfather settled in Mendota in the early 1940s and started the grocery , has watched the area mature from a temporary outpost for migratory labor to a permanent home for tens of thousands of farmhands and others .
Along with this transformation has come a rise in Latino political power .
( Riofrio himself serves on the City Council . )
And though unemployment has always been high and poverty severe , for a time a vibrant rural culture was being forged out of the fields .

“ You saw the establishment of a real working - class community , ” said Don Villarejo , an agricultural policy consultant and a longtime observer of Mendota and nearby towns .
But the realities of water shortages -- and water politics -- have taken a huge toll .
Riofrio says that things began to slip away about five or six years ago .
That ’s when he began noticing the effects of farmers in the 600,000 - acre Westlands Water District fallowing and permanently retiring more and more cropland as a way to cope with too little irrigation and major drainage problems that have led to salty soil .
About a year and a half ago , well before Mendota started making headlines , things had gotten bad enough that Riofrio stopped selling fresh milk at his store .
Too few could afford it anymore .
In the last few months , the downward spiral has greatly accelerated .
Farmers in Westlands , who ’ve yanked about 100,000 acres out of production since 2000 , say they may now be forced to idle as many as 150,000 more for lack of water .
The issues at play are complicated .
They ’re also fraught with bad blood .
Farmers are set to receive only 3.7 million acre -feet of water this year from federal and state plumbing systems -- about 2 million acre - feet less than in a normal year .
Some environmentalists , however , have been quick to accuse the growers of overstating the problem .
They say farmers have extra water stored both above and below ground and have gotten supplies transferred from other locations .
Advertisement
The environmentalists ’ instinct to dig in on this point is understandable .
Many of the giant growers in Westlands have been less than honorable over the decades , gaming the system to claim more than their fair share of cheap , federally subsidized water .
And there is something rather unseemly about the way the growers are using the plight of poor farmworkers to help aid their own cause .
The truth is , though , not every farm has access to multiple sources of water , resulting in a crazy patchwork of dusty and well - irrigated dirt that ’s hard to miss these days as you drive across California ’s interior .
And if environmentalists tend to distort the problem , so do many farmers , blaming what ’s happening mainly on a series of court decisions and federal agency actions that have reduced pumping and diverted river flows in order to protect fish .
State officials say that the environmental rulings are responsible for about 25 % of the current mess , while the rest is due to drought .
What ’s critical for policymakers to keep in mind is that , in the end , none of this squabbling matters .
It ’s simply a distraction from the one thing they should be focused on :
The people of Mendota are suffering terribly -- and steps need to be taken right away to bring them relief .
Advertisement
First , U.S. officials have to resist pressure from environmental groups and others and allow , at least temporarily , for the partial lifting of the fish protections .
It wo n’t completely solve things , but it will help .
It will also send a crucial signal of support to Riofrio and his customers , who are fast becoming a more endangered species than Chinook salmon or delta smelt .
Second , and most important , federal , state and local officials need to coordinate on a long - term economic development strategy -- and put some serious dollars behind it .
This must go way beyond the $ 260 million in federal stimulus money that ’s been promised by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to patch up ailing irrigation infrastructure across the state .
The real question is what emerges after the almonds , tomatoes and cantaloupes disappear .
What happens as ever more Central Valley farmland is retired , as is inevitable ?
What does the future look like for the northwest corner of Fresno County ?
Will the usual solution -- building a new prison -- be all that ’s conceived ?
Or can the sun - baked San Joaquin Valley become a hub of solar power and alternative energy , as some have suggested ?
If so , who will prepare workers for this new field ?
“ The people ... of Mendota will require the assistance of knowledgeable and culturally sensitive rural economic development specialists , ” Villarejo concluded in a report for the California Institute for Rural Studies .
“ On - the - ground demonstration strategies will be needed , ” along with “ the development of human capital at the community level . ”
The trouble is , Villarejo wrote those words way back in 1996 , in the aftermath of an earlier drought , and little , if anything , has been done to realize that vision .

“ We are part of a multibillion - dollar agricultural juggernaut that feeds the nation , ” Riofrio said .
“ But we ’ve gotten chewed up and spit out . ”
After I left Westside Grocery , I headed over to San Joaquin .
The food bank was handing out 1,250 boxes of rice , beans and macaroni .
Also available were chicken and bags of peaches , plums and cucumbers -- farm products for needy farmworkers , who queued up down the block , just as they once did outside Riofrio ’s shop .
Right now I desperately wish I were in Iran .
It ’s a great story with the whiff of history .
It ’s impossible to be sure , but Ahmadinejad ’s victory looks extraordinarily suspicious .
If he won by that margin , he would be the most popular Iranian president ever — which he certainly is n’t .
And it seems exceptionally unlikely that he won in Moussavi ’s hometown , as the government claims .
That ’s the problem with dictators — they do n’t just try to steal a squeaker of an election , they try to steal a landslide .
In the process they lose plausibility and legitimacy .
Gary Sick has an excellent analysis on his blog .
He calls it “ Iran ’s Political Coup , ” and many Iranians see it that way , too .
Indeed , Wikipedia ’s entry on military coups was altered to include June 13 , 2009 as the Iranian coup , as gleeful Iranians immediately pointed out .
Gary writes :
The willingness of the regime simply to ignore reality and fabricate election results without the slightest effort to conceal the fraud represents a historic shift in Iran ’s Islamic revolution .
All previous leaders at least paid lip service to the voice of the Iranian people .
This suggests that Iran ’s leaders are aware of the fact that they have lost credibility in the eyes of many ( most ? ) of their countrymen , so they are dispensing with even the pretense of popular legitimacy in favor of raw power … .
However this turns out , it is a historic turning point in the 30 - year history of Iran ’s Islamic revolution .
Iranians have never forgotten the external political intervention that thwarted their democratic aspirations in 1953 .
How will they remember this day ?
It will be fascinating to see how forcefully the government is challenged by students , the losing candidates and prominent figures like Rafsanjani .
The Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Khamenei , is older and less credible now than ever , and less able to award legitimacy .
But at the end of the day , as I saw at Tiananmen 20 years ago , when Might and Right do battle , it ’s often prudent to bet on Might , at least in the short run .
It ’s interesting that the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran has specifically warned of the risk of a “ Tehran Tiananmen . ”
It has been several years since I was last in Iran , and I want to get back .
Last year I had trouble getting a visa , but I ’ll try again .
EA can't have all the fun turning great books into video games .
Tracy Fullerton wants to turn Henry David Thoreau 's classic into one too .

Walden : The Game is also in the works .

In 1854 , Henry David Thoreau published the results of what would be one of the most famous experiments of American life .
He went to the woods near Walden Pond in Concord Massachusetts to live a life of ascetic purity .
He aimed to live alone , with the minimal requirements of life .
He would remove himself from society to think and to appreciate life .
( Read Thoreau 's Walden here . )
That 's tough material to adapt into a video game , and not material the most cynical critics and fans of games would expect .
But at the conclusion of a panel about the potential of documentary - style video games yesterday at the Games For Change festival in New York City , USC associate professor and influential video game educator / designer Tracy Fullerton revealed that she was , on the side , working with some colleagues to develop Walden : The Game .
Advertisement
" We were attempting to recreate the tenets of the philosophy , " she said .
" Within the mechanics of the game , we want to have the player re-enact the experiment of living that Thoreau took on when he went to live at Walden Pond . "
The game will also recreate the events that occurred while Thoreau was there .
Here 's an excerpt from Walden that articulates Thoreau 's goals :
I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately , to front only the essential facts of life , and see if I could not learn what it had to teach , and not , when I came to die , discover that I had not lived .
I did not wish to live what was not life , living is so dear ; nor did I wish to practice resignation , unless it was quite necessary .
I wanted to live deep and suck all the marrow of life , to live so sturdily and Spartan - like as to put to rout all that was not life , to cut a broad swath and shave close , to drive life into a corner , and reduce it to its lowest terms , and , if it proved to be mean , why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it , and publish its meanness to the world ; or if it were sublime , to know it by experience , and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion .

Fullerton told Kotaku that the project is very early .
She 's worked on it with a small team on and off for about a year and has no idea of when it will come out .
One of the chief challenges the developers face , she said , is of player expectation .
Gamers expect a reward - based gameplay system .
Do this to unlock that .
But such material gain — or even simulated material gain — is contrary to Thoreau 's experience at Walden , and certainly contradictory to what the writer hoped to achieve during his sojourn from society .
" We need to break game player 's expectations , " Fullerton said .
For those who would be skeptical that a Walden video game is achievable , it 's worth noting Fullerton 's credentials as an adviser to such celebrated and artistically experimental USC - based game projects as Jenova Chen 's Cloud and flow .

If someone can make this work , Fullerton is not a bad candidate at all .
Yesterday I wrote how Anthony Wesley , who hails from Canberra , Australia , grabbed this shot of a new dark spot near the south pole of Jupiter
It 's left to bigger minds ( and bigger telescopes ) than mine to sort out what caused it but while the blogosphere has been buzzing , JPL has been observing .
Preliminary image showing a black mark in Jupiters South Polar Region ( SPR ) .
Weather , moon shadow or huge meteor / asteroid / comet impact ?
Image captured by Anthony Wesley on 19th July 2009 at 1554UTC from Murrumbateman AustraliaInitially , some speculated it could be weather .
Here is what weather on Jupiter looks like .
In this quasi - true - color view of Jupiter 's Little Red Spot , generated using a New Horizons - LORRI mosaic in the red and green channels and a Hubble Space Telescope 410 nm map in the blue channel , the " LRS " appears with distinctly redder color than the south tropical disturbance to the north or the small oval to the southeast .

Here 's what JPL now sees .
Image shows a large impact shown on the bottom left on Jupiter 's south polar region captured on July 20 , 2009 , by NASA 's Infrared Telescope Facility in Mauna Kea , Hawaii .
This image was taken at 1.65 microns , a wavelength sensitive to sunlight reflected from high in Jupiter 's atmosphere , and it shows both the bright center of the scar ( bottom left ) and the debris to its northwest ( upper left ) .
Credit : NASA / JPL / Infrared Telescope FacilityIt 's definitely a scar ... and exactly 15 years after the first impacts by the comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 .
Shoemaker - Levy 9 was a comet that broke into pieces before it hit Jupiter in 1994 .
Like that event , it 's hard to know if this was a comet or an asteroid because they 're both small , both primordial and both relatively plentiful around Jupiter .
The new infrared images show the impact point was near the south polar region , with a visibly dark mark and brighter upwelling particles in the upper atmosphere in near - infrared wavelengths , along with a warming of the upper troposphere with possible extra emission from ammonia gas detected at mid-infrared wavelengths .
" It could be the impact of a comet , but we do n't know for sure yet , " said Glenn Orton , a scientist at JPL .
" It 's been a whirlwind of a day , and this on the anniversary of the Shoemaker - Levy 9 and Apollo anniversaries is amazing .
" Leigh Fletcher , a NASA postdoctoral student at JPL who worked with Orton during these latest observations and Tweeted about the developments as they happened said , " Given the rarity of these events , it 's extremely exciting to be involved in these observations .
These are the most exciting observations I 've seen in my five years of observing the outer planets ! "
Worst Environmental Problem ?
Overpopulation , Faculty Says
Saturday , April 18 , 2009
Overpopulation is the world ’s top environmental issue , followed closely by climate change and the need to develop renewable energy resources to replace fossil fuels , according to a survey of the faculty at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry ( ESF ) .
Just in time for Earth Day ( April 22 ) the faculty at the college , at which environmental issues are the sole focus , was asked to help prioritize the planet ’s most pressing environmental problems .
Overpopulation came out on top , with several professors pointing out its ties to other problems that rank high on the list .
“ Overpopulation is the only problem , ” said Dr. Charles A. Hall , a systems ecologist .
“ If we had 100 million people on Earth — or better , 10 million — no others would be a problem . ”
( Current estimates put the planet ’s population at more than six billion . )
Dr. Allan P. Drew , a forest ecologist , put it this way : “ Overpopulation means that we are putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than we should , just because more people are doing it and this is related to overconsumption by people in general , especially in the ‘ developed ’ world . ”
“ But , whether developed or developing , ” said Dr. Susan Senecah , who teaches the history of the American environmental movement , “ everyone is encouraged to ‘ want ’ and perceive that they ‘ need ’ to consume beyond the planet ’s ability to provide . ”
The ESF faculty pointed to climate change as the second most - pressing issue , with the need to develop renewable energy resources to replace fossil fuels coming in third .
“ Experimenting with the earth ’s climate and chemistry has great risks , ” said Dr. Thomas E. Amidon , who invented a process for removing energy - rich sugars from wood and fermenting those sugars into ethanol .
“ This is a driver in climate change and loss of biodiversity and is a fundamental problem underlying our need to strive for sustainability . ”
Rounding out the top 10 issues on the ESF list are overconsumption , the need for more sustainable practices worldwide , the growing need for energy conservation , the need for humans to see themselves as part of the global ecosystem , overall carbon dioxide emissions , the need to develop ways to produce consumer products from renewable resources , and dwindling fresh water resources .

It is 2084 , 20 years after the second al - Qaeda attack on the United States , which killed over 100 times as many as the first .
The nuclearized areas in the eastern and central U.S. that were struck have shown some signs of recovery – the administration of President Jeremy Lin has hopefully referred to these as " green shoots " – but many scientists outside the government are less optimistic .
They say these areas will be uninhabitable for at least three generations , perhaps more .
In the chaos that followed 11 /11 , then - president Carolyn Anders ’ declaration of martial law – prefigured by the USA PATRIOT Act and subsequent legislation overwhelmingly passed by Congress – was largely ignored , as the federal government nearly ceased functioning and local authorities took operational control of police , military , and emergency functions .
Her former position as postmaster general did not inspire confidence , to say the least , but President Anders rose to the task , dispatching federal troops to California after that state refused to comply with the requirements of the Second PATRIOT Act , which " temporarily " suspended the Bill of Rights until such time as the " national emergency " passed .
Declaring the " secessionists " to be " terrorists , " a designation that included then - governor Alfredo Alvarez and the leadership of his California Party , then - president Anders issued a top - secret presidential " finding " that has just been released under the Revived Freedom of Information Act , and as part of the discovery process in a lawsuit launched by the governor ’s wife and continued by his family over the years .
As it wound its way through the courts , and finally to the U.S. Supreme Court , the suit revealed – slowly and painstakingly , like pulling teeth – how the government amassed " evidence " identifying Alvarez and his cohorts as terrorists in league with a " foreign power , " and how the government , including the CIA and the the Department of Homeland Security , targeted and conducted surveillance of those deemed " enemies of the state . "
The historic Supreme Court decision , which absolved Alvarez of the charge of high treason , is considered a setback for the Neo-Federalists and President Lin , who claim the national emergency still exists , and they therefore have the obligation , and not just the right , to ignore it .
The suit sought exoneration for Alvarez and demanded compensation to his descendants , but the court ’s decision went much further .
It retroactively censures former president Anders , the iconic " female Lincoln , " as one Neo -Federalist hagiographer characterized her , for having " usurped the Constitution " and set up " a lawless regime " – setting the stage for a series of legal challenges to the domestic surveillance program in operation since 11/11 .
Reaction to the Court ’s decision was muted .
A great many people have simply disappeared , over the years , and no one dares ask where – above a whisper , that is .
Because you never know who is listening .
No one wants to draw too much attention to themselves , aside , that is , from a few marginal dissidents who have n’t already fled to Canada .
For years , rumors of secret detention camps have run rife and a number of photos purporting to prove their existence have surfaced , but none has so far been verified .
The passage of " anti-rumor " legislation has done much to stifle research in this area .
A recent series on the camps was interrupted , mid-publication , by a visit from Homeland Security , which closed down the Web site of the Ron Paul Memorial Foundation , on which several leaked government documents identified the sites and some formerly prominent individuals housed therein .
The reports , dismissed as " urban myths " by government officials , have persisted for years – in spite of the Anti-Rumor Security and Terrorist Abatement Act , which makes it a federal crime ( punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a 100,000 amero fine ) to perpetrate " rumors and other unverified or harmful information " demonstrably " inimical to public order . "
One such account , published in Canada and distributed underground in the U.S. , The Diary of Ann Smythe , has become a modern classic , albeit an outlawed one .
It tells the story of one Ann Smythe , whose father , once the attorney general of the state of California , suddenly and inexplicably disappeared one day while returning from a fishing expedition in the northern part of the state .
Ann decides to find her father , or , at least , to discover what happened to him by befriending and eventually seducing a high Homeland Security official , whom she agrees to marry in return for access to secret government files .
She tracks her father down to an isolated stretch of desert tucked in between the Rocky Mountains , where he and a number of other high - level " enemies of the state " are detained .
How she gets there and what she finds constitute much of the narrative , but since the story is so well - known , I wo n’t go into those details here .
What ’s interesting about the Smythe volume is its insight into the legal basis for her father ’s incarceration .
Smythe , you see , was a lawyer , and a very good one , like her father .
Indeed , her mother , too , was a lawyer , until she was disbarred after failing to pass a Homeland Security background check .
Having grown up in a family of lawyers and carried on the tradition herself , Ann took a keen interest in the court proceedings that preceded her father ’s imprisonment , and her waspish humor regarding the arguments made by government lawyers is one of the highlights of her Diary .
" The Governor , " averred federal prosecutors , " in the act of naming his party after a particular state had already declared his treasonous intent , and the federal government had no obligation to wait until he put his subversive design into practice .
As a leading member of that party , and in his capacity as attorney general , Dennison Smythe was a key figure in an organized insurrection against the authority of the federal government . "
As nuclear fallout continued to rain down on the eastern and central U.S. , these words echoed with some resonance in the chambers of the secret Homeland Security Court hastily convened after the siege of Sacramento : the armed guards , toting submachine guns , standing outside the door doubtless added weight to this prosecutorial rhetoric , but Ann was not impressed .
" By this ‘ legal ’ standard , " she remarked , " Governor Alvarez ’s proclamation declaring April 11th ‘ California Avocado Day ’ made him guilty of sedition . "
Ann ’s bitter analysis of how we came to live in such a country is rooted in her understanding of the legal precedents set by the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations , with the former pioneering the subversion of the original Constitution in a series of actions precipitated by the so - called Scary Memos , still classified , which authorized unprecedented domestic surveillance of ordinary citizens who had not committed any crime .
If the full scope of these activities – revealed , in part , during the Obama administration – had ever come to light , Ann argues , the resulting political firestorm might have nipped the creeping authoritarianism of the post - 9/11 years in the bud .
Yet then - president Obama and his Justice Department defended , and even expanded , the secretive methods of their immediate predecessors , and , more importantly , continued to shield dubious intelligence - gathering programs from public view .
So when 11/11 occurred and seven U.S. cities went up in a puff of smoke , the legal and political precedent had already been set , and it took little effort on the part of the White House ’s Office of Legal Counsel to come up with a credible - enough - sounding legal rationale for what was , essentially , a presidential dictatorship .
The database of over 6 million files on American citizens deemed " a threat or potential threat " to " public order " was humming less than an hour after the first nuclear " accident " went off at the old Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York .
Even as the national and international media were reporting a massive nuclear accident , which was likened to " Chernobyl times ten , " Homeland Security officials were already compiling lists of individuals to be " temporarily detained " under direct orders from then - president Anders .
This came out at the Alvarez trial , as the earliest known such list surfaced because it had the governor near the top .
As President Lin continues to ignore the Court ’s decision and adamantly refuses to apologize to the Alvarez family , the regionalist tensions that seemed to have quieted down in recent years have once again flared up , on occasion violently .
The recent riots in Sonoma county , where the so - called " Guerneville secessionists " held a joint convention with the recently outlawed Cascadian League , are just the tip of the iceberg .
When several local political figures of some prominence , including the local head of President Lin ’s own Democratic - Republican Party , showed up at that " subversive " conclave and found themselves under assault from the local " vigilance committee " set up by the Department of Homeland Security , it radicalized large segments of the local population and gave impetus to the more radical secessionists who have so far managed to stay one step ahead of the Feds .
The reemergence of this movement , ironically , gives the present administration the tools to re-energize its " anti-terrorist " campaign and crack down on pockets of " subversion , " not only in California but also in Texas , New Hampshire , Washington state , and throughout the South , where secessionist activity has a history .
Ann Smythe was an acute observer of the political scene , as well as an avid scholar of constitutional law , and her account of how dictatorship came to America is worth quoting , because it shows when and why the seeds were planted that eventually sprouted into a tyranny whose tendrils have invaded the life of every American :
" So why did we allow it ?
How did we let them get away with it ?
We had a Constitution , once , and yet it blew away like so much nuclearized dust in the wake of 11/11 .
That does n’t explain anything , however , because , after all , we did n’t have to go along with it .
There might have been leaders of foresight and courage who could have stood up to the encroachments of government spies and secret lists – and there were such leaders , fewer than we might have expected , but some .
They were struck down , one by one , in well - coordinated smear campaigns sparked by anonymous revelations and ‘ leaks ’ of information gleaned by the government ’s extensive surveillance .
" Anyone could have seen this coming .
A report [ .pdf ] issued by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice on July 10 , 2009 , documented the existence of intelligence - gathering and ‘ other intelligence activities ’ that went far beyond the law , and it soberly averred that ‘ the collection activities pursued under the ’ Bush administration ’s ‘ presidential surveillance program ’ and ‘ under FISA , following the PSP ’s transition to that authority , were unprecedented collection activities .
We believe the retention and use by [ intelligence - gathering ] organizations of information collected under the PSP and FISA should be carefully monitored . ’
" As indeed it was – by successive presidents and their loyal henchmen , who kept careful track of each and every bit of dirt on their political enemies , which just so happened to have been picked up in ‘ random ’ sweeps conducted by the National Security Agency and other departments .
" One by one , the would - be and potential leaders of the opposition were destroyed , politically and personally , by the leaking of embarrassing details , improprieties both personal and financial .
The government - subsidized - and - sympathetic media , which thrived on scandal in any event , was more than glad to trumpet their humiliation far and wide , relentlessly and gleefully reporting the ‘ news ’ with a knowing smirk .
" At last , there were none left to stand against them – for who among us is without some secret ‘ vice , ’ some private pleasure that stands condemned by a significant segment of the American public ?
An affair , an embarrassing phone conversation , ‘ exotic ’ online surfing patterns , a photo capturing a moment one would wish to remain private – these were the weapons that struck down anyone who might have had the independence of mind and the gravitas to rally others around them to defy the usurpers when they finally stormed the last bastions of the old constitutional order . "
Not that they were giants in those days , by any means .
The inspector general ’s report cited by Ann also informs us that " during the many PSP briefings to members of Congress , no one ever suggested that the NSA should stop the program . "
Now that the Neo-Federalist faction of the Democratic - Republicans has succeeded in foisting the scheme of holding a constitutional convention on the party , and that party seems headed for reelection this November – the tactic of knocking all " third parties " off the ballot on technical grounds having proved quite effective – the coup first launched by the Bush administration in the winter of 2001 has culminated , all these years later , in the final death agony of the American republic .
Whether a swift end would be merciful or not , I can not decide .
Cavs / Magic Preview
It ’s always funny to hear pundits say that one team ca n’t beat another in a seven - game series .
In most cases , those teams can spring the upset , but that does n’t mean that they will .
Such is the case in the Eastern Conference Finals where the Orlando Magic will try to upend the Cleveland Cavaliers .
No team has been more impressive in the postseason than the Cavs .
They swept both the Pistons and the Hawks , and seem destined for the Finals .
They have the best player in the league in LeBron James , a sharpshooting sidekick in Mo Williams and a host of players willing to fill their respective roles .
Simply stated , they look unstoppable right now .
Conversely , the Magic struggled at times in their seven - game series against the Celtics , though that might have more to do with Boston ’s defense and championship pedigree than anything the Magic were doing wrong .
This Cavs / Magic series would be a lot more interesting if Jameer Nelson were healthy , but Rafer Alston has been a decent stopgap at point guard , and Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis are proving to be nice complements for big man Dwight Howard .
The Magic are built like the Rockets were in the Hakeem Olajuwon era in that they have a center that demands a double team and have surrounded him with a number of players who can make teams pay from the perimeter .
The problem is that Howard is n’t nearly the passer or the free throw shooter that Olajuwon was , so he ’s not a great option in crunch time .
The Magic have a tendency to fall in love with the long ball and do n’t have a guy who can get to the rim on a consistent basis .
But if Orlando is knocking down their threes ( as they were in Game 7 of the Boston series ) , they ’re nearly unstoppable .
The biggest challenge in upsetting the Cavs is how to deal with LeBron .
Can Turkoglu stay with him ?
No. Lewis ?
Probably not .
Mickael Pietrus has the athleticism to bother LeBron , but he ’s not known as a lockdown defender .
Orlando actually won the season series , 2 - 1 , but both wins were at home .
LeBron averaged more than 30 points per game against the Magic , but Orlando did a pretty nice job of making him work for his points , holding him to 43 % from the field .
If that trend continues , and no one else steps up for the Cavs , the Magic have a real shot .
Unless Ben Wallace discovers the Fountain of Youth , Howard should have his way inside .
He ’ll have to earn many of his points from the free throw line because the Cavs have a number of bigs who will no doubt use their fouls to keep Howard from getting easy dunks .
LeBron will probably draw Turkoglu , which is bad news for the former Most Improved Player .
Lewis is really going to have to step up in this series , as he ’ll likely draw Anderson Varejao ( or possibly Zydrunas Ilgauskas ) defensively .
Other than Howard , that ’s the only position where the Magic have a distinct advantage over the Cavs .
It will be a good sign for the Magic if LeBron is forced to switch from Turkoglu to Lewis and back — that means that whoever he ’s not guarding is having an impact offensively .
Some experts are picking the Cavs to sweep , but if the Magic play well , this series can definitely go the distance .
Orlando was prone to spurts of poor play in the Boston series , but they wo n’t be able to get away with that against the Cavs .
Keep an eye on Cleveland ’s shooting percentage and the Magic ’s long range accuracy .
Those two stats are a good gauge of Orlando ’s chances .
Cleveland fans should n’t underestimate how important this series is for the Cavs ’ chances of re-signing LeBron next summer .
If the Cavs flame out before the Finals , the LeBron to NY / NJ rumors are bound to heat up again .

A deadly car bomb has exploded in a crowded market in the southern Iraqi town of Bathaa , killing at least 28 people , say officials .
Dozens of people were reported to have been injured in the mid-morning attack .
The area has been the scene of fierce fighting in the past between rival Shia militia factions .
The attack comes weeks before US forces are due to withdraw from towns and cities in Iraq , leading to concerns that violence could escalate .
Police say the bomb was in a parked car in the town of Bathaa in Dhiqa province , about 320 km ( 200 miles ) south - east of Baghdad .
" There was a big explosion , it was an awful incident " said Farhan Fadel , 31 , who suffered a broken leg and injured abdomen in the blast .
Hassan Ali , a 44 - year - old grocer , said some of his friends were killed or injured .
" There was smoke everywhere , " the AFP news agency quoted him as saying .
There were conflicting reports about casualty figures , with official sources withdrawing their initial statement that 30 people had been killed .
Bathas 's mayor , Ali Fahad , said the casualties were being taken to a hospital in Nasiriya , about 30 km away .
" Children and women are among the dead , " he said .
US withdrawal
Overall , attacks have fallen sharply in Iraq .
But a number of recent blasts in the south have raised fears that sustained violence could return to the area .
The BBC's Nicholas Witchell , in Baghdad , says that because Bathaa is in a Shia area , Sunni insurgent groups linked to al - Qaeda will inevitably be suspected of being behind the blast .
The US plans to withdraw its troops from Iraqi cities and major towns by 30 June , and is due to end combat operations across Iraq by September 2010 , leaving Iraqi security forces to cope alone .
There are concerns that insurgents may try to take advantage of the withdrawal , although the country 's leaders say Iraqi forces are capable of handling internal security without US support , says our correspondent .

A popular way for ticket camera manufacturers to “ get their foot in door ” and quiet opposition of speed cameras in a city is to mention that the cameras will be installed in school zones .
After all , what politician wants to be seen as being against “ improving ” the safety of children ?
What the ticket camera companies fail to mention is that they intend to use the school zone cameras to make it easier to push them through everywhere else later .
They also do n’t mention that many of these school zone speed cameras are in use 24/7 , 365 days a year — even if school is n’t .
As NBCWashington.com points out , that ’s what has been happening in Montgomery County , Maryland :
Some speed cameras in Montgomery County , Md. , are snapping pictures and issuing tickets in school zones — even though classes have been out for more than a month .
Every time a speed camera flashes , someone gets a $ 40 speeding ticket in the 25 mph school zone in front of Bethesda - Chevy Chase High School .
Michele Rosen of Silver Spring received a traffic - camera ticket on a recent Saturday .
She plans to appeal . [… ]
Rosen believes the reduced speed zone is not well marked .
She questions the need for the lower speed limit when school is not in session .
Apparently she was n’t the only one who was upset with this scheme :
There has been some grumbling about “ after hours ” use of school zone cameras and some changes are about to happen .
“ The laws for speed cameras will change as of October 1 , ” said Lucille Baur , a spokesperson for Montgomery County Police .
Well , at least they eventually did the right thing .
But wait a minute , what ’s this :
Baur said the operational hours for speed cams in school zones will be reduced to Monday - Friday from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m .
The new hours will be put in place throughout the year , whether or not school is in session .
I guess some people never learn .
We ’ve been doing a lot of Hibernate work at Terracotta recently and that naturally includes a fair amount of performance testing .
In Hibernate , you can grab those stats using the Statistics object for a SessionFactory via getStatistics ( ) .
There are all sorts of tasty morsels inside this class to get factory - wide counts and per-entity / query / cache / etc stats .
Cool stuff .
We noticed however while doing some perf testing that the code inside the Statistics Impl is a bit problematic from a concurrency point of view .
The basic gist of the class is just a set of stat counters .
I can simplify the pattern to this without much loss of detail :
public class Statistics Impl implements Statistics , Statistics Implementor { private long queryExecutionCount ; public synchronized void queryExecuted ( String hql , int rows , long time ) { queryExecutionCount ++ ; // ... bunch of other stat collection } public long getQueryExecutionCount ( ) { return queryExecutionCount ; } public synchronized void clear ( ) { queryExecutionCount = 0 ; // ... clear all other stats } }
That ’s basically what ’s in this class but it ’s repeated a couple dozen times for other counters and there are Maps used for per-item counts of a few kinds of items .
There are several problems here from a concurrency point of view :
Coarse - grained lock – the entire class shares a single lock via synchronized methods .
That means that every counter in every thread is contending for that same lock .
The impact of this is that when you turn on statistics collection in Hibernate , you immediately introduce a big old stop - the - world contention point across all threads .
This will have an impact ( possibly a very significant one ) on the very stats you are trying to collect .
It ’s entirely possible that the scale of your application or other bottlenecks mean that your application is not actually seeing this as a bottleneck , but it should scare you at least a little .
At the very least here , we could be used fine - grained locking to avoid creating contention between different kinds of statistics .
There are also collections in here that collect stats on a per-query , per-entity , per-collection , etc basis .
Those could actually have fine - grained locks per-entity as well ( but they do n’t ) .
Dirty reads – you ’ll notice that while writes to the counters are synchronized , the reads are not .
Presumably this was done for performance .
Unfortunately , it ’s also quite broken from a memory model point of view .
These reads are not guaranteed to see writes from any other thread , so the values you ’re seeing are possibly stale .
In fact , it ’s possible that you are never seeing any of the counter updates .
In practice , the synchronization on puts is probably causing the local caches to get flushed and on the hardware we ’re running , you do seem to see values that are in the ballpark at least .
But the Java memory model makes no guarantee that this will work on all architectures or at any point in the future .
Race condition on clear ( ) – the common way that the stats are used is with some gui or other monitor sitting in a loop and periodically reading some ( or all ) of the stats , then calling clear ( ) .
Because time passes between the read of the first stat and the clear , you will lose all updates to the stats during the course of the reads .
You may be willing to neglect a few lost updates , but consider that in many cases the monitor thread may iterate through every entity , collection , and query updated since the last loop ( potentially hundreds of reads ) .
In the cases where per-item stats are looked up , the gets ( ) are actually synchronized as well when finding the stat in a Map .
Those gets are synchronized against all other puts happening in the system .
So the scope of that “ read all stats ” part of the monitor code may actually be quite large and you will lose all updates made between the beginning of that and the clear ( ) , which distorts the next set of stats to an unknown degree ( more activity == more distortion ) .
[ UPDATE ]
Dirty long read – As Peter mentioned in the comments , the values being read here are longs and since longs and doubles are 64 - bit values , dirty reads of them are not guaranteed to see atomic writes from other threads .
So you could see different 32 - bit chunks that were not written together .
Reads / writes of shared doubles and longs should always be done with synchronized or volatile to address this issue .
I certainly understand that stats are seen as best - effort and that the existing Hibernate code supports pre-1.5 Java and does not have access to Java 5 concurrency utilities like Atomic classes and concurrent collections , but even so I think there are things that could be done here to make stats collection a lot more accurate and less invasive .
Things like fine - grained or more concurrent locking ( with volatile , AtomicInteger , or ReentrantReadWriteLock ) would go a long way towards fixing visibility while increasing concurrency .
In our Terracotta integration , I suspect we will be using some byte - code instrumentation to clean up these classes ( we already assume Java 1.5 + so that is a constraint that we are happy to break ) .
As it is , we do n’t currently trust the stats in the first place and second we are actually seeing the single lock showing up as a hot spot in performance tests .
I hope that the next version of Hibernate ( which I think is dropping pre-1.5 support ? ) can make some improvements as well .
Chances are you 've heard or read about Google 's phone management system Google Voice , but you 're not really sure what it does .
There 's a good reason for this aura of mystery .
Google Voice got its start as a phone service called GrandCentral , which the search giant bought in 2007 .
It 's been in beta ever since -- but unlike other Google betas that are open to the general public , this one was limited to former GrandCentral users and a select group of industry elite .
But now Google is opening up the service to a limited number of new users , many of whom I 'm sure will be as impressed as I am with Google Voice 's power and elegance .
Even better , Google Voice is free -- at least for now .
It 's likely that Google will need to monetize the service at some point , either via subscription fees , advertising , or some sort of newfangled revenue scheme .
But for the lucky few using the service today , there 's no charge .
The Basics
Google Voice provides a single phone number , such as 415 - 555 - 1212 , for all your cell , home , and work numbers , and lets you manage your voice services online .
Unlike a landline service , a Google Voice number is n't tied to a geographical location .
Unlike a cellular service , it 's not linked to a specific handset .
And unlike a VoIP line , it 's not matched with an IP address .
Rather , it 's tied to you .
So if you move , change jobs , or switch wireless carriers , your Google Voice number stays with you .
One drawback : you can't port your current number to Google Voice , although that option may be added in the near future , the company says .
This is n't a Skype - type service either .
You do n't use your computer to make phone calls , and there 's no additional software or hardware to install or buy .
( You can , however , use the Click2 Call feature from the Google Voice website to place calls . )
Is it perfect ?
No , it 's got a few quirks , and the myriad of configuration options can be confusing at times .
But Google 's onto something big here .
A service that helps manage the multiple phone lines in our lives should have universal appeal .
Google Voice provides a powerful suite of communications tools , including the ability to :
Forward calls from your Google Voice number to one or more phones , or directly to voicemail .
Based on who 's calling , you can select which of your phones will ring .
Receive text ( SMS ) alerts when you get a call .
Transcribe voicemails , which Google Voice will send as email and / or text messages to your cell phone .
Listen to voicemail messages as they 're being recorded - a great throwback to the home answering achine .
Screen callers by asking for and recording their names .
Block annoying callers by playing a number - not - in - service recording when they call .
Vary personalized greetings by caller .
Record phone conversations and listen to them in your Google Voice inbox .
Switch phones during a call .
Use the free GOOG 411 service to say the name and location of a business , and have your call connected for free .
Phone U.S. numbers for free .
Getting Started
Since Google Voice is a browser - based service , you wo n't need to install software on your Mac or Windows PC ( or mobile phone ) to get started .
Like most Google apps , Voice has a clean , no - frills interface that 's easy to learn .
The Settings page provides easy access to the rich set of phone tools .
Power Struggle Ends Volkswagen to Acquire Porsche
Volkswagen is planning to purchase all of sports carmaker Porsche , which has run into massive financial problems linked to its overly ambitious plan to take control of VW .
The attempted takeover , which had been financed using loans , ultimately failed because of the credit crunch and ensuing liquidity problems that almost saw Porsche go bankrupt .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Two companies that have received billions of dollars in aid from the U.S. government have been kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) .
According to a statement released Monday , General Motors , which filed for bankruptcy on Monday , will be replaced by Cisco Systems ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) ; Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) will be replaced by The Travelers Companies ( TRV , Fortune 500 ) .
The changes in the Dow will go into effect on on June 8 , according to Dow Jones .
GM shares opened for trading on the New York Stock Exchange after a brief delay Monday morning , but the NYSE says the shares will be delisted before trading begins Tuesday .
GM has the right to appeal that decision .
GM stock plunged to 75 cents per share on Friday , its lowest level since the Great Depression .
Shares of Citigroup dipped below $ 1 per share in early March but were trading above $ 3 on Monday .
General Motors became ineligible for inclusion in the benchmark indicator when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday .
" The parlous state of GM has left us with no choice but to remove it from The Dow , " said Robert Thomson , managing editor of The Wall Street Journal and editor - in - chief for all of Dow Jones , in a written statement .
" A bankruptcy filing immediately disqualifies a stock regardless of a company 's history or its role as a cultural icon . "
The company taking the place for the bankrupt automaker is tech bellwether Cisco Systems , which is based in San Jose , Calif . , and makes networking equipment .
" We were reluctant to remove Citigroup at the height of the financial frenzy , but it is clear that the bank is in the midst of a substantial restructuring which will see the government with a large and ongoing stake , " said Thomson .
Thomson left the door open for the financial giant to be put back on the Dow when it stabilizes .
" We genuinely hope that once the bank has refashioned itself that we will again be able to consider it for inclusion - Citigroup is a renowned institution , not only in this country , but around the world . "
GM ends an 83 - year run as a component of the Dow .
The automaker was added to the index twice , first for 18 months in 1915 and then again on Aug. 31 , 1925 , according to the release from Dow Jones .
The only current company with a longer history as a component of the index is General Electric ( GE , Fortune 500 ) .
GE was initially included in the Dow in 1896 but was removed after a few years of fitful stops and starts .
In 1907 it was relisted .
GM 's absence from the Dow marks the auto industry 's waning power and influence .
And its replacement -- a technology heavyweight -- is representative of larger industrial evolutions .
Cisco's " communications and computer - networking products are vital to an economy and culture still adapting to the Information Age - just as automobiles were essential to America in the 20th Century , " Thompson said .
Citigroup joined the Dow in 1997 , as Citicorp .
Ironically , Travelers merged with Citicorp to form Citigroup in 1998 , creating what was then termed a " financial supermarket . "
Citigroup spun off Travelers in 2002 .
At the time of the 1998 merger , Travelers was a member of the Dow 30 .
Dow Jones decided to add another financial company to the index in order to re-calibrate the index .
When the Dow let go of American International Group in September , it replaced the insurance company with Kraft Foods ( KFT , Fortune 500 ) because the financial sector was in so much turmoil .
" The selection of Travelers , a property and casualty insurance company , is intended to restore the financials industry to full representation in The Dow , " said Thomson .
Dow Jones said the changes wo n't cause any disruption in the level of the index .
A divisor is used to calculate The Dow from its components ' prices , which prevents any distortion in the Dow .
" In our judgment , the stocks until now helped the Dow Jones industrial average tell the daily story of the stock market , " said John A. Prestbo , editor and executive director of Dow Jones Indexes , in the written statement .
" The extraordinary conditions of the severe bear market and recession kept these stocks relevant and representative for a longer period than might have been the case in more normal times . "
Later Monday , rating agency Standard and Poor 's released a statement saying GM will be removed from its S&P 500 index after the close of trading on Tuesday .
Its replacement is DeVry ( DV ) , a post - secondary education provider based in Oakbrook Terrace , Ill .
CNNMoney 's Julianne Pepitone and CNN's Drew Trachtenberg contributed to this report .
If it is said that lapis lazuli is as old as hills , nothing wrong with it .
Because of its matchless beauty and associated powers , this royal blue stone has been widely used for various purposes in almost all the well - known human civilizations .
Babylonians , Egyptians , Chinese , Romans , Indians and many others used that stone even thousands of years back .
The stone was also reckoned as sapphire in ancient times , and aside from jewelry and healing purposes , the stone was widely used in various forms for decorative purposes .
The remnants of lapis lazuli tiles can still be seen in many ancient tombs in Egypt , Syria , Iran and Iraq .
It ’s true that in ancient times lapis lazuli could hardly be seen in the folk life , and it was only limited to royal families and spiritual heads that used lapis lazuli for various purposes .
It is said that Cleopatra used pulverized lapis lazuli as eyeshade , and similarly many other renowned personalities of different ages have been using that stone for different purposes , but mainly for its healing powers .
Lapis lazuli is known as the stone of truth and friendship .
It brings harmony and peace in the life of the wearer and similarly , there are many other powers which are associated with that stone .
Lapis lazuli has also been widely used for decorative purposes
In the tombs of Ur that are located near the Euphrates River , over 6000 lapis lazuli statuettes of different objects like deer , rodents , birds , beads , dishes and cylinder seals have been found .
No doubt , the stone which has been used in them came from the mines in northern Afghanistan .
Lapis lazuli with its matchless beauty and unique blue color is also known as the stone of the sky as well as a royal stone that has been serving the royals even in their tombs .
In a game - changing move , Internode is offering consumers the widely available , easy - to - choose plan with a huge 30 - gigabyte ( GB ) data quota and other complicated decisions removed from the equation .
Internode Easy Broadband is a radically different broadband plan to Internode 's traditional plan table which offers a wide - but sometimes confusing - array of prices , speeds , DSLAM network types , DSLAM coverage tables and data quotas .
Internode managing director Simon Hackett said Internode Easy Broadband was totally different to anything else his company had offered .
" It 's to solve the problem of decision paralysis , " he said .
" For a long time , I 've been chewing on the notion of living in a different world where broadband is easy .
Internode Easy Broadband is designed to appeal to people who do not want to grapple with complex choices - it's a single plan that delivers a great value proposition for a very reasonable $ 49.95 per month , with no complications to sort through . "
" More than 70 per cent of people sign up with us because we 've been recommended by someone , but many customers of the largest broadband retailers have n't heard of Internode unless one of their technically astute friends tells them about us .
With Internode Easy Broadband , choosing Internode ceases to be a technical choice - or a technical challenge .
One plan , one price … great value… easy . "
" Choosing Internode Easy Broadband is just like its name - easy .
It 's the plan we want everyone to hear about . "
Internode Easy Broadband eliminates confusing choices .
Internode automatically selects the most appropriate DSLAM network for each customer 's location .
The quota is large enough for most customer requirements - especially since it includes the full range of Internode unmetered downloads .
The minimum speed supplied for Internode Easy Broadband is a guaranteed 1.5 megabits per second .
Full - throttle ADSL2 + speeds are provided wherever direct Internode - direct ADSL2 + coverage is available .
As Internode builds more DSLAMs , customers will automatically migrate to ADSL2 + speeds .
Internode Easy Broadband offers better value than comparable retail broadband plans offered by Telstra and Optus .
It also provides better value than the same price point in Internode 's existing plan table .
To allow customers to make a direct comparison of value for money , the Internode Easy Broadband plan counts both downloads and uploads in the 30 GB data quota , in the same way its major rivals do .
As with existing Internode plans , access to unmetered content such as broadband downloads to TiVo media devices and the extensive Internode streaming radio service , adds even more value to the plan .
Mr. Hackett said Internode Easy Broadband was an additional plan to Internode 's traditional broadband range .
" Our existing plan table will continue to give a wide range of choices and download - only data quotas to our customers who want them , " he said .
" Internode Easy Broadband provides an extra option and a simple life for many new customers .
Existing customers are also welcome to move to the Internode Easy Broadband plan if they wish to do so . "
Rugby , though , likes to do things differently .
For while some aspects of the game have been modernised beyond recognition by 15 years of professionalism , there is a lingering whiff of 19th century paternalism in its governance .
Ultimate power still resides with the IRB Council , a 28 - strong body in which the eight traditional powers of rugby – the old Five Nations countries plus Australia , South Africa and New Zealand – hold most of the power with their 16 seats .
And it is the Council which has the last word on where the tournaments will be staged .

筆者は3年前、ITproで「ついに Windows開発から離れた『闘うプログラマー』」というコラムを書きました。Windows NTのアーキテクトで、ドキュメンタリー「闘うプログラマー」の主人公であるデイビット・カトラー（David Cutler）氏が2006年7月をもって，Windows OSの開発部門を離れたという記事です。実はこれは誤報でした。今回はこのことをお詫びしたいと思います。
3年前のコラムでは、カトラー氏がWindows OSの開発部門からオンラインサービス「 Windows Live」の開発部門に異動したことを指して「 Windows OS の開発現場を離れた」と表現していました。当時の筆者にとってWindows OSとは、カトラー氏が設計したWindows NTの系譜を引き継ぐ「 Windows Vista 」 と「 Windows Server 2008 」のことでした。Windowsと付いていても、単なるオンラインアプリケーションの集合体に過ぎないWindows Liveは 「 Windows OSではない」と思っていました。「離れた」と書いたのはこのためです。
しかしカトラー氏 がWindows Live部門に異動して 「改めて開発を始めたもの」は、やはりWindows OSでした。
「 Windows Azure 」 の開発を主 導
カトラー氏は2006 年秋に 、Windows Live部門で 「 Red Dog」という開発コード名を持つ新しいプロジェクトを開始しました。このRed Dogには後に製品名が付き、それが2008年10月末の開発者会議「PDC（Professional Developers Conference ） 2008」で大々的に発表されました。つまりRed Dogとは 「 Windows Azure 」だったのです。
Windows Azureは、クラウドコンピューティング時代のマイクロソフトの生命線を握る「OS」です。第三者にPaaS（プラットフォーム・アズ・ア・サービス）として提供するだけでなく、「
Exchange Hosted Services」のようなマイクロソフトのSaaS（ソフトウエア・アズ・ア・サービス）の基盤になることも決まっています。しかもカトラー氏は、Windows Azureの中でもキモ中のキモであるハードウエア抽象化機構の「ファブリック・コントローラ」やP2P（ピア・ツー・ピア）ベースの分散ストレージ「 Azure Storage」の開発に初期からかかわっていました。
1942年3月生まれで67歳になるカトラー氏は、途絶えることなく一貫して、マイクロソフトの一番大事な「
Windows OS 」の開発現場にいたのです。筆者の3年前のコラムは完全な誤報でした。読者やカトラー氏に心からお詫びしなければなりません。
マイクロソフトはクラウドコンピューティングのために「クラウドOS 」と「クラウドDB」を新規に開発している、その開発にカトラー氏にかかわっている---。筆者はこのことを、2008年5月に米国のマイクロソフトウォッチャーであるメアリー・ジョー・フォーリー（Mary Jo Foley）氏が発行した著書「 Microsoft 2.0」（日本語版は翔泳社発行の「マイクロソフト
ビル・ゲイツ不在の次の10年」）を読むまで知りませんでした。
そして同じフォーリー氏が2009年2月に公開したカトラー氏のインタビュー記事「 Red Dog : Five questions with Microsoft mystery man Dave Cutler」を読むまで 、Red Dogの開発がカトラー氏の異動直後の2006年秋から始まっていたことに気付きすらしませんでした。
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - With U.S. unemployment at a 20 - year high , some Americans are working for free while looking for a job , but experts are split over whether it is a sign of dedication or desperation .

Unpaid job seekers can keep their resumes fresh by boosting their experience and learning new skills , experts say , but others warn businesses may take advantage of the jobless and that it is illegal for commercial companies not to pay workers .
Dana Lin , 22 , is one of the 14.7 million unemployed workers in the United States .
She lost her marketing job at a technology company near San Francisco in April and since then has been working for free for about five hours a week for Internet company Jobnob.com .
“ Every company has thousands of people applying for each job , and I realized I needed more appeal , ” said Lin , a graduate of Cornell University .
Since being laid off , she has applied unsuccessfully for about 50 jobs .
“ In some cases companies might be getting the better end of it ( by having unpaid workers ) , ” she said .
“ But it ’s nice to have something occupy yourself with and when speaking to prospective employers it ’s nice to say ‘ I have n’t just been sitting around all day , I ’ve actually been doing something . ’ ”
It ’s not only the unemployed taking on free work .
Some employed people are being asked by bosses to go without pay .
British Airways last month asked its British - based employees to volunteer for up to a month ’s unpaid work .
Some companies and U.S. state and city governments have made staff take unpaid furloughs , but some employees still work anyway to keep up or because they are worried about losing their job .
Ross Eisenbrey , vice president of the Washington D.C. - based Economic Policy Institute , warns that while people can volunteer time for non-profit groups and government , it is illegal for commercial companies to not pay workers .
“ It ’s not just a bad idea , it ’s illegal , ” Eisenbrey .
“ The law says ( companies ) may not suffer or permit employees to work for less than the minimum wage .
“ The more desperate people get , they will do things like this to try and make themselves more appealing to an employer , ” he said .
“ The short - term prospects for most of the unemployed are very bad .
They are n’t going to be made much better by working off the books or working for nothing . ”
BUILDING TALENT PIPELINE
Job seeker Lin started working with Jobnob.com , a website that tracks salaries , after the company held its first so - called “ happy hour ” -- to link unemployed people with mostly start - up businesses that have work but are unable to pay .
“ The job seekers have time , ” said Julie Greenberg , co-founder of Jobnob.com .
“ It ’s really dangerous for them because once you are unemployed for a few months , there ’s this proverbial white space on your resume that ’s growing . ”
“ They immediately see the benefits , they need references , they need to keep their skills sharp , a lot of people are learning new skills , ” she said .
“ I do n’t think there ’s anybody who feels taken advantage of because they understand that ... we wish we had revenue , we wish we could pay you . ”
Greenberg said more than 300 job seekers attended the first two “ happy hours ” and more such events have been planned .
Alexandra Levit , workplace expert and author of “ How’d You Score That Gig ? ” recommended volunteering at non-profit organizations to gain or build experience .
“ I think you have to be careful that you ’re not undervaluing yourself .
If you do have the experience , then you should be paid for it , ” Levit said .
“ I absolutely think companies are taking advantage . ”
Madeline Laurano , principal analyst at workplace research and advisory firm Bersin and Associates , argued that the recession - spurred trend of working for free is a great way for companies to build a “ talent pipeline ” to tap when the economy recovers .
“ Employers need to think about the same strategies that they would if they were hiring someone who was getting paid .
You still want a quality person , ” Laurano said .
“ Job seekers also need to think the same way , ‘ I still want to invest my time in a company I believe in , that I can grow and learn from . ’
“ The argument that people are making is , is it desperation or dedication , ” she said .
“ It ’s not necessarily volunteering at a homeless shelter , but it ’s contributing that might also bring you some benefits in the long run . ”
Some 28,000 years ago in what is now the British territory of Gibraltar , a group of Neandertals eked out a living along the rocky Mediterranean coast .
They were quite possibly the last of their kind .
Elsewhere in Europe and western Asia , Neandertals had disappeared thousands of years earlier , after having ruled for more than 200,000 years .
The Iberian Peninsula , with its comparatively mild climate and rich array of animals and plants , seems to have been the final stronghold .
Soon , however , the Gibraltar population , too , would die out , leaving behind only a smattering of their stone tools and the charred remnants of their campfires .
Cannon Beach Residence is designed by Nathan Good Architect with sustainability in mind .
It is located on the Oregon beach and provides more energy that it consumes .
That is possible because of 5kWh rooftop photovoltaic system and 12 - inch - thick concrete walls .
There are also solar - thermal tubes that provide hot water and a ground - source heat pump that warms and cools the air .
The house is L - shaped and wrapped around Sitka spruce that ’s 38 inches in diameter .
Recycled materials were used during construction and the house is designed to last multiply generations .
It perfectly blends into the forested hillside thanks to its sedum - sprouting green roof .
One side of the house has views of Haystack Rock while the other – views of the beach .
A lot of windows provide the house with plenty of the natural light .

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has defended his " completely free " re-election as Iran 's president , amid violent clashes on the streets over claims of election fraud .
Mr Ahmadinejad condemned the outside world for " psychological warfare " against Iranians during the election .
Thousands have protested against the result , burning barricades on the streets of Tehran and clashing with police , who responded with tear gas .
Reformist candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi urged his supporters to avoid violence .
Mr Ahmadinejad is due to hold a news conference on Sunday , followed by a huge victory rally .
' Down with the dictator '
Speaking on national television , Mr Ahmadinejad praised the Iranian people for choosing to " look toward the future " rather than returning to the past .

" This is a great victory at a time and condition when the whole material , political and propaganda facilities outside of Iran and sometimes ... inside Iran , were total mobilised against our people , " he said .
He blamed " foreign media " for instigating a " full - fledged fight against our people " .
" Nearly 40 million people took part in a totally free election , " he said .
BBC Iranian affairs analyst Sadeq Saba says the margin of the win was so wide that it made a lot of people suspicious .
He says given the high turnout , it was expected that Mr Mousavi would have won at least half of the votes .
Jon Leyne
Reporting from Tehran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has always seen himself as more than just a politician .
Sometimes he speaks , and is treated , more like a seer prophesying the death of capitalism and liberal democracy .
With this victory , however secured , he will feel emboldened in this global vision .
At home , many Iranians will fear a clampdown on society and cultural life .
Mr Ahmadinejad knows that many even within the political establishment oppose him , which might increase his tendency towards authoritarianism .
All those young people who were out campaigning against him so recently will be nervous about their future , and even more disillusioned with the Islamic Republic .
Then there is foreign policy and the nuclear issue .
How can US President Barack Obama open negotiations with a president whose legitimacy and human rights record is even deeper under question ?
It is a political earthquake that will shake Iran , and could shake the world .
In quotes : Reaction to result Tension looms after Iran result
Millions of people , especially the young , voted for change through the ballot box and by peaceful means and now there is shock and disappointment , our analyst says .
The official result gave Mr Ahmadinejad a resounding 63 % of the vote against 34 % for Mr Mousavi and brought the worst violence seen in Tehran for a decade , correspondents said .
The BBC's John Simpson saw secret policemen being attacked and chased away by protesters , which he says is extremely rare .
Some of the protesters in Tehran wore Mr Mousavi 's campaign colour of green and chanted " Down with the dictator " , news agencies report .
Four police motorbikes were set on fire near the interior ministry , where votes had been counted , our correspondent says .
One BBC
News website reader , Xenia , went to Vanak Square in Tehran to express anger and said police fired plastic bullets .
" They fired tear gas to scare us away , but it would only be temporarily .
We would hide in some corner and then re-emerge angrier than ever . "
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says clashes continued late into Saturday evening and there are reports that a number of reformist leaders have been arrested .
Ayatollah 's call
Mr Mousavi urged calm in his website statement .
" The violations in the election are very serious and you are right to be deeply hurt , " he said .
" But I firmly call on you not to subject any individual or groups to hurt . "
Mr Mousavi earlier said the election was a " charade " .
" I personally strongly protest the many obvious violations and I 'm warning I will not surrender to this dangerous charade .
" The result of such performance by some officials will jeopardise the pillars of the Islamic Republic and will establish tyranny . "
Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who wields ultimate power , urged all Iranians " including yesterday 's competitors " to support the re-elected president .
He described the count as a " real celebration " , praised the high turnout of 85 % and called for calm .
" Enemies may want to spoil the sweetness of this event ... with some kind of ill - intentioned provocations , " the ayatollah said .
Mr Mousavi had been hoping to prevent Mr Ahmadinejad winning more than 50 % of the vote , in order to force a run-off election .
Our correspondent , Jon Leyne , says the result has been greeted with surprise and with deep scepticism by many Iranians .
The figures , if they are to be believed , show Mr Ahmadinejad winning strongly even in the heartland of Mr Mousavi .
Our correspondent says Mr Ahmadinejad will feel emboldened in his global vision - one that foresees the death of capitalism - while at home many Iranians will fear a clampdown on society and cultural life .
Surge of interest
There had been a surge of interest in Iran 's presidential election , with unprecedented live television debates between the candidates and rallies attended by thousands .
There were long queues at polling stations on Friday , with turnout reaching 85 % .
Four candidates contested the election , with Mohsen Razai and Mehdi Karroubi only registering about 1 % of the vote each .
Iran is ruled under a system known as Velayat-e Faqih , or " Rule by the Supreme Jurist " , who is currently Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
It was adopted by an overwhelming majority in 1979 following the Islamic revolution which overthrew the autocratic Western - backed Shah .
But the constitution also stipulates that the people are the source of power and the country holds phased presidential and parliamentary elections every four years .
All candidates are vetted by the powerful conservative - controlled Guardian Council , which also has the power to veto legislation it deems inconsistent with revolutionary principles .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Sarah Palin's not a quitter , she wants the public to know .
Sarah Palin 's attorney said there is no legal reason that compelled her to resign as governor .
" I am not a quitter .
I am a fighter , " Palin told CNN on Monday while on a family fishing trip , on the heels of her Friday bombshell announcement that she was resigning as Alaska 's governor .
Palin did her interview standing on the shores of Dillingham , Alaska , wearing waders .
She granted 10 - minute interviews to CNN and three other news networks Monday .
She resigned because of the tremendous pressure , time and financial burden of a litany of ethics complaints in the past several months , she said .
The complaints were without merit and took away from the job she wanted to do for Alaskans , Palin said .
The decision to resign a year and a half before her term ends , and her rambling , often - disjointed resignation speech Friday , fueled days of debate among political analysts .
Watch Palin explain her decision »
Speculation has run rampant that Palin , the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2008 , will seek the presidency in 2012 .
When pressed about her future , Palin would say only that she would work in public service .
She did not rule out a run for the White House or any other political office .
Palin is to leave the governor 's office in late July .
The days since her resignation had been exhilarating and she loved being in Dillingham , a town of only a few thousand people and no cell phone service , Palin said .
On Monday , her personal lawyer also spoke about her resignation .
No legal " bombshell " or personal scandal lies behind Palin 's resignation , but off - color jokes by talk - show host David Letterman contributed to her decision to step down , Thomas Van Flein said .
The governor needed a break after being " on duty now for two and a half years solid , " he said .
" There is no bombshell .
There is no shoe to drop .
There are no investigations of any type that I 'm aware of -- no IRS audit , no federal investigation , no state investigation , " Van Flein told CNN .
" There is no legal reason in terms of a legal problem that compelled the governor to resign . "
Friday was " deliberately chosen " for the announcement because of its proximity to the July Fourth holiday , Van Flein said : " She declared her independence from politics as usual . "
Palin reiterated that statement in her interview .
Rep. Les Gara , an Anchorage Democrat and a frequent Palin critic , said everyone was " wildly surprised " by Palin 's announcement .
" A lot of us were pretty disappointed in the concept that she can't finish out a governor 's term , " Gara said .
Palin 's resignation speech was " kind of similar to everything that has gone wrong since the governor has gotten back from her vice presidential campaign , " Gara said .
" When she came into office , everything was about openness and transparency , and now everything 's about excuses , " he said .
But Rep. Jay Ramras , a Fairbanks Republican who leads the state House Judiciary Committee , said when it comes to public opinion , " The concrete has n't set up yet . "
" Those that seem to have responsibilities to manage businesses that manage people seem to be much less tolerant of what she did , " Ramras said after attending Independence Day events over the weekend .
Those people consider her " a quitter , " he said .
" And then there 's another group , where Gov. Palin has been successful in being able to imply -- and certainly these people have inferred -- that she was a victim . "
The 45 - year - old governor had faced intense scrutiny since Sen .
John McCain picked her out of relative obscurity to be his running mate last year .
Though her acceptance speech drew rave reviews , her subsequent shaky performance in network news interviews , the drama surrounding her 18 - year - old daughter 's pregnancy and two ethics probes into her earlier firing of the state 's public safety director dogged her throughout the rest of the campaign .
" In my opinion , she was the national campaign for Republicans last fall , " Van Flein said .
" I know John McCain was the candidate , but the decision was really about Sarah Palin and could she take on Obama .
That was a lot of weight on her shoulders to carry that campaign , and they almost pulled it off . "
As Election Day neared with McCain trailing in the polls , campaign aides began sniping at Palin as a " diva " who ignored top advisers and lacked " fundamental understanding " of key issues in the race .
The McCain - Palin ticket ultimately lost to Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden last November .
Van Flein also said Palin would remain involved in public service , with no other decisions made at this point .
But Gara said it was clear to him that Palin has her eye on another bid for national office .
Watch reaction to Palin 's decision »
" We can all guess , " he said .
" My guess is the governor wants to be president , and that 's what she should have said at her press conference . "
Palin thought she would stop being a " lightning rod " once she returned to Alaska , but " it never really did simmer down , " Van Flein said .
Ethics complaints from critics led to her paying back taxes on state per diem funds she received while living at her home in Wasilla , outside Anchorage ; another investigation led to her paying about $ 8,100 in travel expenses for her children .
Van Flein said the state 's ethics process , which Palin signed into law , has been " abused " to harass her and may lead Alaskans to ignore more serious allegations .
And he said Letterman 's early June joke about one of her daughters being " knocked up " by New York Yankees outfielder Alex Rodriguez " demonstrated to her that there 's some sort of disconnect here . "
" When people do n't accept normal bounds of decency making jokes like that about children , maybe this is not good for the state right now , " Van Flein said .
" And maybe somebody else who is not the subject , and whose family is not the subject of this scrutiny , can move the state forward . "
Letterman said the joke was aimed at Palin 's older daughter , Bristol , who had a son with her high - school boyfriend in December .
However , Palin was in New York traveling with her 14 - year - old daughter Willow at the time , and she accused Letterman of making jokes about sex with an underage girl .
The CBS " Late Show " host ultimately apologized , saying " If you have to explain the joke , it 's not a very good joke . "
Despite leaving office about two - thirds of the way through her term , Palin " is not a quitter , " Van Flein said .
He added that she " already accomplished her major goals , " including winning legislative approval for a massive natural gas pipeline .
But Ramras , who calls himself " a pro-development , conservative Republican , " called that assertion " crazy . "
Though the pipeline project won approval in the state Legislature , Alaska has yet to establish a " durable and predictable " financial structure that will get producers to commit to the plan .
" Anyone who thinks we 've started anything is delusional .
...
What she did was she created a Gordian knot and then handed it off to someone else , " he said .
CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report .

Typical cases of structure damage show portions of or whole buildings collapsing , but this is the first time that I see a building perfectly toppled .
The 13 - story building is part of the Lotus Riverside complex in suburban Shanghai .
The cause of this epic structural fail is under investigation , but first sources claim that an error on construction and unstable soil conditions are the probable causes .

Iranian security forces yesterday threatened a " decisive and revolutionary confrontation " with opposition demonstrators if protests continued against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who claimed victory in the country 's presidential elections .
The threat from the Revolutionary Guards signalled that the powerful conservative force could intervene directly to end the political crisis .
Protests continued yesterday despite several deaths over the weekend and increasingly violent methods used by the police and the pro-regime Basij paramilitaries .
As Iranian officials and the state media stepped up their allegations of British involvement in the protest movement , the British embassy in Tehran began evacuating the families of members of staff , and the Foreign Office advised against non-essential travel to Iran .
The parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , called for a " revision " of diplomatic ties with the UK in the light of what he alleged was British meddling , an allegation denied on Sunday by the foreign secretary , David Miliband .
British diplomats warned , however , that a further worsening of the bilateral relationship was likely in the next few days in view of Tehran 's allegations .
The pro-government Fars news agency quoted a former member of a conservative Islamic student movement as saying : " If Britain continues its blatant intervention and malevolence , Iranian students will close down the British house of spies in Iran , like they did the US house of spies . "
The European Union , represented by the Czech government , summoned Iran 's chargé d'affaires and " categorically rejected " all allegations of interference , and the Italian embassy said it was available to offer humanitarian aid to injured demonstrators .
At least 17 protesters have been killed so far , according to official figures .
A video showing the death of a young female demonstrator , Neda Agha Soltan , who was shot dead by a sniper on Saturday , was widely circulated in Iran and around the world .
The image has helped to instil fear in opposition ranks but some observers predicted that it might also galvanise the wavering protest movement in the weeks ahead as it mourns her death .
Following the bloodshed on Saturday , the turnout for demonstrations yesterday was much smaller than last week .
Only a few hundred protesters gathered in Tehran 's vast Haft - e - Tir Square and they appeared to be outnumbered by riot police firing teargas and Basij militiamen on motorbikes armed with rifles , as helicopters flew overhead .
Gunmen were visible at windows of government buildings around the square , as well as policemen with cameras taking pictures of the demonstrators .
The judiciary has threatened to set up special courts to try dissidents .
The government backlash against the protesters intensified as the regime acknowledged serious problems with the 12 June elections .
The guardian council , a group of 12 conservative clerics tasked with investigating the vote , said that more votes had been cast in 50 electoral districts than there were registered voters .
However , a council spokesman insisted that such " discrepancies " would not overturn the president 's election .
Alongside the riot police , the government 's principal weapon against the demonstrators has been the Basij militia , a paramilitary subsidiary of the Revolutionary Guard .
Yesterday the 125,000 - strong Revolutionary Guard corps threatened to intervene directly to quash the protests .
A statement on its website said the demonstrators should " be ready for the decisive and revolutionary confrontation with the IGRC , Basij and other security forces " .
The intelligence department of the police issued a statement of its own urging Iranians to help police officers identify " the main elements who have been behind the recent riots " , while a member of the judiciary said special courts should be set up to try them .
In an attempt to stifle protests before they began yesterday , Haft - e - Tir Square was ringed by police and Basij , who were stopping pedestrians to question them and scrutinise their identity papers .
Any groups of more than three people were stopped on suspicion of joining an illegal protest .
Police could be seen filming from the surrounding rooftops and from cars and motorbikes , in a apparent move to identify protest leaders .
Police armed with rifles could be seen at the windows of government buildings around the square .
However , demonstrators succeeded in gathering on the north side of the square where they chanted Allahu Akbar ( God is Great ) before the police fired teargas .
As the crowd scattered they were sheltered by locals in their homes and offices in a gesture of solidarity .
" I'm was badly beaten by the riot police on Saturday , " said Mostafa , a 25 - year - old university graduate .
" I can still feel the pain but the pain does n't matter – what matters for me is that they got to my spirit .
I 'm here in Haft - e - Tir Square to take my spirit back from this government .
To get back my vote and the blood of whole innocent people who were killed by this government . "
The police also put on a significant show of force around the university , stopping and questioning students .
A young man was pushed to the ground and hit with batons as he tried to escape .
A young woman was also attacked but her cries for help were ignored by the crowd , which appeared depressed and helpless .
Leili , a 32 - year - old artist , said : " They were thinking that they could stop people claiming their rights after their brutal attack and killing people on Saturday but they are wrong , people will not easily pull back .
" We are still here although we do n't have anything , not even a newspaper to cover what 's happening , and they have rifles and everything .
This is a big ' no ' to the supreme leader . "
Not long ago , Buckeye Firearms Foundation filed a lawsuit to stop the City of Cleveland from prosecuting law - abiding gun owners under local ordinances that restrict gun ownership and concealed carry .
The lawsuit also asked the Court to declare 20 local ordinances unconstitutional on the grounds that they conflict with state preemption of firearm laws .
So what is Cleveland 's response ?
A callous shrug .
They do n't care what the law says .
They do n't care what the courts say .
They plan to stall and go on enforcing their illegal ordinances as long as humanly possible .
But we 're fighting back .
Buckeye Firearms Foundation has filed a motion in opposition to the city 's request for a stay because Ohio 's gun owners cannot afford another three , four , or five years of Cleveland 's rogue behavior .
Please understand .
This is n't just a disagreement about the law .
This is an all - out battle between individual gun owners and a big city government run amok .
And Cleveland is not alone .
Many other cities in Ohio are ignoring state law and enforcing illegal and unconstitutional ordinances .
The situation is unacceptable .
We cannot allow cities to create conflicting laws to infringe your rights .
You do n't even have to be arrested to be affected .
Many people are unable to buy standard capacity magazines or other perfectly legal parts because manufacturers wo n't ship to hostile cities .
We will not be bullied .
But we are in a fight against the full resources of one of America 's largest cities .
We must win .
Cities around Ohio are watching to see the outcome .
If we do n't win , those cities will be emboldened to continue infringing your rights and encouraged to make up any laws they choose on a whim .
Worse , if President Obama or U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder decide to make their move against gun owners , cities around Ohio will take the cue to drop the hammer on gun owners ... not because it will accomplish anything , but just because they can .
WE NEED YOUR HELP IMMEDIATELY .
Buckeye Firearms Foundation , Inc. has very limited resources and no big corporate donors .
We need funding now to wage this battle and win .
The future of gun rights in Ohio may depend on the outcome .
I know we ask a lot of you .
I know the economy is bad .
We 're David and they 're Goliath .
But we CAN win with your help .
Will you continue to stand by us ?
After all the progress we 've made , please do n't let us slip backward because of one city that has gone power mad .
Can you donate $ 100 or $ 75 or even $ 50 ?
Give as generously as you are able .
Any amount will help .
Your donation to the Foundation is tax - deductible .

Thank you for your generous support .
Together we can teach Cleveland a lesson and send a powerful message to cities around Ohio that they MUST obey the law and that they work for US , the citizens of Ohio .
Yours for Freedom ,
Jim Irvine
P.S. We have more than one battle on our hands .
Buckeye Firearms Foundation has also been asked to work on cases coming before the Supreme Court of the United States .
We needs funds , a lot of funds , to get this vital work done .
Your dollars will not only affect Ohio , but the future of America .
Please , dig deep .
P.P.S. Do n't assume other gun owners will help us .
The fact is , most people will read this , shrug , and go back to sleep .
Do n't be one of those gun owners who let other people fight their fights for them .
Be one of those gun owners who stands firm and will not back down .
Stand with us .
We need YOU .
And we need you now .

JavaFX meets TaranFX .
JavaFX is built on top of a mature Runtime that gives developer ’s amazing features .
Java being in market since several years , they now have a more sophisticated API .
Update : This Blog post is Winner of Java Blogging Contest .
So what is JavaFX Hype all about ?
I first got to hear about JavaFX more than a year back when I attended Sun Tech days .
It was n’t very mature at that time and failed to catch my attention .
It was this year in Feb , when I saw a momentum and maturity in this platform , which encouraged me to take my steps further .
JavaFX gives developers an amazing feature - Rich API which will help them build scalable , fully integrated , Rich Graphics , Animated applications for the web .
The beauty of JavaFX lies in the fact that its base ( JVM ) is already installed on all computers ( 90 % ) .
When I first saw the API , I was amazed that it had so much pre-built into the API .
e.g .
All the common transitions like fading , scrolling , perspective animations are built - in .
All you need is the idea and you can be all set to make the most powerful web application .
Being a Java at heart , you can always integrate it with existing java applications .
Imagine a Live graphic
Rich market - watch client talks directly to a EJB server to fetch live quotes and prepare animated graphs of statistical data and analytics to help you invest for future .
The feature I loved the most was , “ applications are draggable to desktop ” .
Since apps run in JVM of local machine , though they open in browser , they can be dragged and dropped to desktop without interrupting any operation or performance .
Here is What I intend to Cover :
1. Example : How to Code Web Gallery in Javafx
i. Basic Overview

The Code

b. JavaFX vs. Flash
c. Conclusion
iii .
Animated Transitions and Full Image load :
a. Key Observations
b. Conclusion
3. Verdict
i. Pros and Cons .
Let ’s start with an example .
1. Example : How to Code Web Gallery in JavaFX
Before we start , you can have a Quick look at what we are going to achieve over here .
It ’s a decent web gallery inspired by one of them demoed on Javafx site .
I took that gallery and re-wrote most of it to achieve the following :
1. Redesign UI to match my taste and site ’s theme .
2. Optimize the code to max possible .
I did the latter to Benchmark JavaFX ’s capabilities , as described in a later section .
For now let ’s look at the basics of JavaFX application design .
Before we start , Let ’s look at what did I make .
The Gallery is a JavaFX Frontend GUI with a backend supported by java Flickr API .
On Load , Flickr is queried with REST API as http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.people.getPublicPhotos&user_id=24847938@N07&api_key={apiKey}&per_page={thunbLayout.count}
HereI am sending request to Flickr to return me all public Photos for the user_id specified and per page show me {thunbLayout .
count} many results per page using my unique API key .
This metaData when loaded , loads the 1st page of thumbnails .
On selection via keyboard or mouse click on a pic , it opens for medium size and fizes the aspect ratio on load .
While image is loaded , it is animated with Fade transition effect built into JavaFx .
Let ’s look at the code and things will get more clearer .
ii .
The Code
Before we start , lets get you familiar with Jargons .
a. Basic Animation Terminologies :
Like Flash , JavaFX uses the generalized concept of Animations by using standard animation industry jargons .
The First thing to learn is using Stages and Scenes .
Stage is the main / core Placeholder for your JavaFX application .
Scene is an independent widget which fits into Stage .
Multiple Scenes can be put inside stage but there will be only one stage per application .
b. The Basic Code :
JavaFX made it really easy to code .
Here is the code syntax :
[ code lang= ” javascript ” ]
var stage = Stage {
title : “ Taranfx Gallery ”
width : 840
height : 520
visible : false
style : StageStyle .TRANSPARENT
scene : bind scene
}
function run ( ) {
initUI ( ) ;
stage.visible = true ;
// Set focus to background by default
bgRect.requestFocus ( ) ;
}
[ / code ]
Here , run ( )
Method is the default main method inside Main .fx class .
So setting stage to visible , and getting the focus , does the job !
Now Let ’s create scene for our thumbnails :
[ code lang= ” javascript ” ]
var scene : Scene = Scene {
width : 840
height : 520
content : Group {
content : bind stageContent // defined below inside initUI ( )
clip : Rectangle {
width : bind layout .
width
height : bind layout .
height
arcWidth : 20
arcHeight : 20
}
}
fill : Color .
TRANSPARENT
} ; [ / code ]
And Instantiate the UI components :
[ code lang= ” javascript ” ]
function initFrontUI ( ) {
descTxt = Text {
x : bind layout .
thumbX
y : bind layout.descTxtY
font : bind layout.descFont
wrappingWidth : bind ( layout.thumbGroupW – 10 )
content : bind description
fill : Color .
WHITE
smooth : true
textOrigin : TextOrigin.TOP
clip : Rectangle { // calculations for layout
x : bind descText .x
y : bind ( descText.y – 2 )
width : bind ( layout.width – 20 )
height : bind ( layout.thumbGroupY – descTxt.y – 17 )
}
}
stageContent = [
backRect , titleBar , nxtButton , bckButton , exitButton ,
descTxt , thumbGroup , pageBttnGroup ,
fullView , progressBar , fiv.saveBttn //names are self explanatory , last one is save button inside Scene Full Image view .
] ;
getImageData( ) ; // Call Flickr REST API using standard Java Flickr API .
Loads list of thumb image src , description , etc .
} [ / code ]
c. Transitions :
Now look at how Transitions are created .
To achieve the animation effect , you have to play with the javafx.animation .
Timeline , javafx.animation .KeyFrame .
Again , these are generic words used in animation industry ( same with Flash ) .
If you are new to animation , let me define it for you .
Timeline is the time scale of the animation which consists of number of frames through which animation will move .
KeyFrame is the frame with concrete data i.e.
Initial or final state of the animation and in - between the frames happens the transition that creates animated illusion .
The animation used , when you select a thumbnail to view fullImage , is demonstrated below :
[ code lang= ” javascript ” ]
var tL: Timeline = Timeline {
rate : bind tLRate with inverse
keyFrames : [
KeyFrame {
time : 1s
values : [ opacity => 1.0 tween Interpolator .
LINEAR ]
canSkip : true
}
]
} ;
…
function fadeEffect ( ) {
if( visible ) { // javafx.scene .Node.visible , if current stage is visible , its set true .
tL.time = 0s ;
tLRate = 1.0 ;
opacity = 0.2 ;
visible = true ;
} else {
tL.time = 2s ;
tLRate = - 2.0 ;
opacity = 1.0 ;
}
tL.play ( ) ;
}

Animations are so easy to code .
I just loved it .
I do n’t trust any hypes , statistics till I test them on my own .
Proceed with the next section and you will know what convinced me here .

2. Benchmarking the JavaFX ( Gallery example ) :
i. Hardware used :
Notebook : Dell XPS
Processor : Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2 Ghz @ 800 Mhz FSB
RAM : 2.5GB
Graphics : Standard Intel extreme
( I have a Nvidia notebook as well but I wanted to test it on the onboard graphics to check how bad can it get . )
Tools : Netbeans 6.5 , VisualVM 1.1
ii .
Invocation & Startup :
JavaFX startup is pretty heavy for initial 10 seconds .
During this interval ,
It is supposed to load a large number of underlying classes .
The main loader is com.sun.javafx.runtime.main.Main.class , packaged inside the distributable Jar .
In a web browser , actual invocation starts from the javascript from URL “ http://dl.javafx.com/1.2/dtfx.js”.
This Javascript looks for “ Javafx ” method inside the HTML < script > tag .
In this tag , information about the “ JAR to load ” is present .
JAVAFX runtime Main.class takes over the control and loads the Projectname_browser . jnlp which invokes the actual jar user classes i.e. com.taranfx .* in this case .
Before loading your Main class i.e. com.taranfx .Main.fx , it loads all the base underlying classes to support the Javafx features .
a. Observations :
My application had import for around 200 classes and 20 classes were defined under com.taranfx .*.
The Total classes loaded after the start - up was nearing 4000 .
If you look at the graph above , loaded classes for first peek was 2500 .
This is the point where JavaFX started reading my com.taranfx .* package .
This means , at all times for JavaFX to start empty , it will need 2500 runtime classes .
During this time , ( almost 6 seconds ) , CPU utilization is max .
On my Dual core it was able to eat upto 70 % CPU though it was using only 7 mb of heap .
If you look at the CPU graph , the second peek was incurred when my classes started executing .
This was the time when Request for Flickr REST API was being generated .
During this , CPU utilization of 27 % , Heap size of 12 mb was observed .
The third CPU peek came when response from Flickr was received , and images were starting to appear .
Loading of 50 images ( 10 in a row x 5 in a column ) took peek utilization of 25.5 % .
As clear from Memory utilization graph , Images were being loaded and heap size was increasing in steps till 20 mb of which roughly 13 mb was being used .
Immediately after this , a substantially GC call reduced the memory overhead .
( after this watever memory increase you see is because of my further operations in GUI , we will consider them in next section )
.
b. JavaFX vs. Flash
Now , I had a similar application in Flash ofcourse pretty different in layout , etc but similar functionality .
Let ’s compare those statistics with JavaFX .
It was roughly 40 % at first peak with RAM usage of 4 mb , and then 20 % second peek with 10 mb , and 3rd peek 29 % with 19 mb RAM .
c . Conclusion :
All the performance statistics were pretty close to Adobe Flash but were mostly on the higher side which is but obvious because its VM 🙂
.
iii .
Animated Transitions and Full Image load :
So after loading of thumbnails is over , next comes the main application .
Navigating quickly between images as it prepares requests for each of the image to be downloaded for preview .
Let ’s discuss the Performance of the application during power user usage .
Since the application has lots of animations specially Fade transitions ,
We will compare how well are those can run on our machines .
Please note , I have chosen animation mainly as fade as it needs alot of CPU juice to run smoothly .
Infact , smooth fading was far from reality in Swing .
So let ’s see how well JavaFX handles this in new refined JVM .
Let ’s now look at the profiling :
a. Key Observations :
Refer to the CPU , the first wave peek you see is at approx .
15 seconds from when all thumbs were loaded .
This peek was incurred due to my first click , which triggered the very first transitioning of fading all 50 thumbnails screen to Full Image preview ( class ) .
Fading was very smooth and what a surprise it took just 19 % of my CPU .
Are you kidding me JavaFX ?
Fading involves a number of interpolated frames during the transition time ( set to 2 seconds ) and frame rate of decent 20 fps was observed ( I used a screen capture tool that auto - detects frame rate of the screen , it gave 20.3 fps )
Moving on , I became a power user ( clicking madly on all images and then returning back ) at full pace .
Clicked images were being loaded in background threads while new images being licked were having fading transitions , one by one being put to backround thread queue to load images from flickr .
As expected , it resulted in good CPU utilization , though transitions still remained smooth as before .
CPU was n’t kicked much it ranged between 30 to 60 % which is pretty expected , no surprises .
But one thing impressed me , Heap Usage .
It did n’t eat much of the Heap .
At start , Heap size was 20 MB ( 15 mb used ) , it then raised only to 25 mb after 40 seconds of power user activity .
GC was n’t kicked more than once and it reduced Used heap from 20 to 15 mb making it less hungry for more Heap .
I must admit , memory management was pretty good .
Now let ’s look at the other part , the most active Threads .
Java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run( ) ate most of the CPU .
Because of high number of requests , large no of threads got created , and for obvious reasons , this had to be the highest usage .
Second highest is javax .
swing .
SystemEventQueueUtitlities , which is a old class from the generation of swings exposing some generic UI utilities .
This involves the fading , and other graphical operations .
Third was sun.rmi.transport.tcp.TCPTransport , this was for TCP connection to Flickr .
The CPU usage for this thread is during translation of TCP requests from Java to right to your OS protocol stack .
b. Conclusion
I ’m still left astonished if this was possible inside VM !
The Ability of Graphics ( atleast for 2D ) is brilliant .
Later on when I took the same test to Nvidia platform , I did see noticeable differences .
The Fade effect had risen from bare 20 fps to 28 fps .
3 . The VERDICT !
The Pros :
– Solid API with bundled inbuilt features for almost anything you will need .
– Brilliant Graphics Rendering ( 2D )
– Low on CPU usage than previous generation of JavaVMs .
– Comparble performance for generic RIA .
– Excellent memory management .
( it ’s not just standard VM memory management , there ’s more to it . )
– OpenSource : A More open approach to RIA in the industry as compared to Flash , Silverlight like AJAX .
– Universal Language for Desktop , mobiles , other portables .
The Cons :
Nothing in the world is without Cons , even JavaFX has it :
– Graphics and multimedia are powerful on JavaFX , but it runs in JVM and not the real system , hence graphics can never be as powerful as native applications like Adobe Flash .
The high complexity advanced 2D , 3D graphics will suffer significant performance hits inside VM .
Such aplications will have more floating point calculations and More frequent memory allocation / de- allocations which will choke VM .
( Though , for low complexity 2D , jaavaFX might beat Flash )
– Another -ve is for Video and High definition :
The mediaplayer ( via API ) in JavaFX is able to attain a decent framerate of 24/25 fps and CPU utilization goes to peak during this playback over SD ( Standard definition ) .
Now if you are looking for HD content to go via JavaFX , it ’s not possible at this time .
I used the same hardware as in the benchamark .
CPU utilization goes to peak to achieve that framerate for SD .
For Playing 720 p and 1080 p HD content , VM came to the knees , failed to provide any tolerable frame rates .
Definitely , needs lot of improvement in this sector .
May be Sun can develop native APIs to interact for each Nvidia CUDA , ATI graphics Kernel for each platform to accelerate this .
This could encourage 3d gaming in JavaFX .
( though this is very hard to do and maintain keepin platform independence in mind . ) .
– A big challenge awaits javafx to reduce Load times .
To load startup classes , it takes 10 - 20 seconds depending upon the application and CPU you are using .
Flash is much faster at this .
Definitely I found my effort worth while after days of playing with JavaFX .
I can proudly say it will stand as a clear challenger to Flash ( provided few things improve , specially load times ) .
From the past trend of Sun , it has innovated in every field of Java and will continue to do so .
And now that It ’s with Oracle and Larry Ellison , I do n’t have a doubt about its future .
Future could be JavaFX .

A dog runs along the beach after sunset in Cardiff , California December 5 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Mike Blake
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - A flea - bitten dog rescued from a squalid backyard is to be reunited with her owners 1,000 miles away -- nine years after she disappeared .
The dog , Muffy , was found sleeping on a tattered piece of cardboard in a backyard in Melbourne with a bad skin condition and matted coat by the RSPCA after an anonymous call .
RSPCA Victoria spokesman Tim Pilgrim said Muffy was found to have been microchipped which did not fit at all with the circumstances so they decided to try to track down the dog ’s owners whom they found in Brisbane .
“ It ’s amazing that the original owners had microchipped her as it was n’t that common nine years ago and it is amazing that she had come 2,000 km from home , ” Pilgrim told Reuters .
“ We are advising people to get their pets microchipped so we can have some more happy endings like this one . ”
He said Muffy was believed to have been at that house in Melbourne for about one year after being found as a stray but no one knew where she had been for the previous eight years .
Muffy will be flown home to Brisbane next week to be reunited with her owners who were delighted to hear that their lost pet had finally been found .
Once I 've stopped rubbing my back and feeling like a complete idiot I transfer my attention to them , trying to banish self - pitying thoughts that my interference will probably spell their doom , and lift a few frames to see how they 're getting on .
They have supplies of nectar , honey and pollen , as well as some patches of the dark brood cells that will shortly become new worker bees .
Things are looking good .
There are boxes perched on top for them to store honey in , barred from the queen 's egg - laying activities by a grid that she 's too big to squeeze through .
They 're still empty , but I 'll transfer leftover stores from the now - defunct colony next week in the hope that they 'll start to build up a surplus for me before the end of the summer .
While the motion control technology announced at E3 this year appeared to be in an early alpha prototype stage , Sony Computer Entertainment may be ahead of the gang .
According to president of marketing , Peter Dille :
“ We ’re having conversations with the third - party community .
The dev kits have started to go out to the third parties as well .
They ’re working on the tech .
They could n’t be more excited about it . ”
With this news , SCE may actually meet their Spring 2010 deadline for a product release with this new motion control technology .
And with the PlayStation Eye already on the market , is already one step close to an outing of motion control .

THE Hill newspaper Roll Call ( which is part of The Economist Group ) reports that the Employee Free Choice
Act might be dead this year , and its chances are unlikely to improve all that much in 2011 .
Tom Harkin , a Democratic senator from Iowa , gives the rundown .
We ’ve got the healthcare bill ; we ’ve got appropriations bills , and we ’re lacking two senators that we need right now .
Nothing is happening on that right now .
If the health - care bill stalls , historians will look back on the summer of 2009 and wonder :
Why did n't the Democrats focus on this ?
Why were so many weeks spent trying to suss out support for " card check " , something that the party generally supports but hardly a reason it won in 2008 ?
Why did cap - and - trade legislation come to the floor before health - care reform ?
In both instances , wavering Democrats , many from states and districts where some political distance from the president is a nice thing to have , were cajoled into taking stands that would hurt them at the polls .
The pressure added up ; it became much braver to support a broadly written health - care reform bill .
The party failed to push back against its interest groups .
In retrospect , the cap - and - trade vote may be remembered like the Republicans ' 2005 vote to intervene in the case of Terri Schiavo — as the moment they blew their political capital to appease their base .

Enlarge By Danny Johnston , AP Little Rock police inspect the scene of a shooting outside a military recruitment office that left one soldier dead and another wounded Monday .
A Muslim convert who said he was against the U.S. military pleaded not guilty Tuesday to capital murder in connection with the shooting of two soldiers outside an Arkansas recruiting center .
One soldier died in the attack Monday , police said .
Abdul Hakim Mujahid Muhammad , 23 , was ordered held without bail at a hearing Tuesday in Little Rock .
He is charged in the death of Pvt. William Long , 23 , of Conway , outside the Army Navy Career Center in Little Rock .
" This individual appears to have been upset with the military , the Army in particular , and that 's why he did what he did , " Little Rock Police Lt. Terry Hastings said .
" He has converted to ( Islam ) here in the past few years , " Hastings said .
" We 're not completely clear on what he was upset about .
He had never been in the military .
" He saw them standing there and drove up and shot them .
That 's what he said . "
Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula , 18 , of Jacksonville was wounded in the shooting and in stable condition , Police Chief Stuart Thomas said .
The suspect , who is from Little Rock , was previously known as Carlos Bledsoe , Thomas said .
The soldiers wore fatigues , had recently completed basic training and volunteered to help attract others to the military , Thomas said .
He said the gunman targeted the military but was not believed to be part of a broader scheme .
Interviews with police showed that Muhammad " probably had political and religious motives for the attack , " the police chief said .
Thomas said Muhammad would be charged with first - degree murder , plus 15 counts of committing a terroristic act .
He said those counts result from the gunfire occurring near other people .
Hastings said the attacker pulled up in a car outside the Army - Navy recruiting office around 10:30 a.m. and fired at the soldiers outside .
According to the Associated Press , the vehicle was stopped on Interstate 630 a short time later , and the suspect was taken into custody .
Police found an assault rifle in the vehicle .
Jim Richardson , the manager at a drug store around the corner from the Army - Navy center , said people at the store did n't realize anything was amiss until they heard sirens outside .
" Nobody heard any gunshots , " Richardson said .
Lt. Col. Thomas Artis of the Oklahoma City Recruiting Battalion , which oversees the Little Rock office , said the victims were not regular recruiters .
He said they were serving two weeks in the Little Rock office .
As part of the Hometown Recruiting Assistance Program , the soldiers were sent to " talk to friends , folks in the local area .
They can show the example , ' Here 's where I was , and here is where I am , ' " Artis said .
Artis said neither of the soldiers had been deployed for combat .

LOS ANGELES 
A federal judge on Thursday sentenced the owner of a marijuana dispensary to a year in prison , a sign that providers of medical marijuana still face the possibility of jail time despite the Obama administration ’s promise not to prosecute them if they comply with state law .
In imposing his sentence on Charles C. Lynch , who ran a dispensary in the surfing hamlet of Morro , Judge George H. Wu said the changed federal policy did not directly affect his ruling .
But the judge talked at length about what he said were Mr. Lynch ’s many efforts to follow California ’s laws on marijuana dispensaries and the difficulty the judge had finding a loophole to avoid sending him to prison .
“ I find I can not get around the one - year sentence , ” Judge Wu said of federal sentencing laws .
The judge said he had reduced the sentence from a mandatory five years because Mr. Lynch had no criminal record or history of violence , and did not fit the strict definition of a “ leader ” of a criminal enterprise .
Mr. Lynch , 47 , was convicted last summer on five federal counts in connection with the running of his dispensary and the selling of medical marijuana to customers under 21 .

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Yes , two Great Depressions linked in a mysterious time - warp : Bank robbers and robber banks .
Back in the dark days of the first Great Depression John Dillinger was admired , a dapper Robin Hood .
Banks were the real villains .
Dillinger , Bonnie and Clyde , " Pretty Boy " Floyd , and " Machine Gun " Kelly were the " American Idols " of their day -- " Public Enemies " to the FBI .
But folk heroes to an angry public who cheered when Dillinger destroyed bank records during holdups .
Yes , good ol '
John cared for the little guy , our " stand - in , " a secret way of getting back at the crooks running America 's banks .
Imagine him storming into a bank in a three - piece suit sporting a Tommy gun .
In broad daylight !
A real man .
He leaps over a counter confronting a scared teller , gently taps a stack of bills with his gun barrel : " That 's your money , mister ? "
He nods .
" We 're here for the bank 's money , not yours .
Put it away . "
Banks were easy pickings for Dillinger , strategies he picked up in the slammer : " They ain't tough enough , smart enough , or fast enough .
I can hit any bank I want , any time .
They got to be at every bank , all the time . "
And he cleaned up , till a friend ratted on him .
Today it 's far worse .
Back in the 1930s we got a flood of new laws and regulations protecting small investors and consumers .
Today we just got Obama 's proposed new legislation that 's already being watered down by Wall Street lobbyists .
How ?
Easy .
Because today 's new Dillingers are inside the system , officers and bureaucrats running the banks , regulators , monetary system , government .
The usual suspects : " Pretty Boy " Paulson and his Goldman Gang , " Helicopter Machine Gunner " Bernanke , " Bonny " Dodd and " Clyde " Geithner .
They 're the new " Public Enemies , " calling the shots from inside , robbing us blind , costing us trillions .
Worse yet , the new president loves the new Dillinger Gang .
Like the Depression - era masses , he 's mesmerized by the bank robbers , and hired them !
Modern Dillingers own the banks , and government
How bad is it ?
Real bad : Remember former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt , who stood up for the little guy in the '90s ?
The guy who once attacked banks with this comment : " America 's investors have been ripped off as massively as a bank being held up by a guy with a gun and a mask . "
Well , he 's inside too , just hired as a " policy adviser " by Wall Street 's Goldman Gang , just weeks after Goldman hired away the top staffer on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee .
The pattern 's obvious : Wall Street 's arming itself with vast lobbying firepower to kill off much of the proposed regulations , just as they did during the Enron and mutual fund scandals reform movement earlier this decade .
And that , my dear friends , is why today 's Wall Street conspiracy of banks and lobbyists , their well - paid pals in Congress and throughout the federal bureaucracies and regulators , plus their Trojan Horses in the White House , will continue driving America straight into the third meltdown Robert Shiller warns about :
Our " vulnerability to bubble thinking is greater than it 's ever been ...
We recently lived through two epidemics of excessive financial optimism ... the dot-com and the subprime ... we are close to a third episode . "
The rapidly - approaching " third episode " became painfully obvious in reading Black Swan author Nassim Taleb 's idealistic " Ten Principles for a Black Swan- proof World " in the Financial Times .
Idealistic , yes , but drenched in satire .
Satire because we know the new Dillinger Gang , the Goldman Conspiracy and their allies all across Wall Street , could never steal as much money from taxpayers in Taleb 's utopian " Black Swan - proof " world .
So Wall Street will surrender nothing , and , therefore , every one of Taleb 's 10 Black Swans remains intact , a time bomb , a disaster waiting to happen .
Here 's why :
BS - 1 . Do n't give the recovery to the same idiots who created the mess
Taleb was more colorful : " People who were driving a school bus blindfolded ( and crashed it ) , should never be given a new bus . "
There were so many drivers it is " irresponsible and foolish to put our trust in the ability of such experts to get us out of this mess . "
But we have .
And they will fail to create a " Black Swan - proof world . "
BS - 2 . Nothing should ever become too big to fail
Get rid of losers early , while small , warns Taleb .
Unfortunately , bankers are so greedy they 're already spending millions on lobbyists and political donations to do just the opposite .
They love " big . "
So count on endless loopholes undermining new regulations .
BS - 3 . Stop socialization of losses and privatization of gains
Taleb warns :
We 've " managed to combine the worst of capitalism and socialism .
In France in the 1980s , the socialists took over the banks .
In the U.S. in the 2000s , the banks took over the government . "
Only a naive idealist would expect them to surrender this Black Swan :
After the next crash Wall Street will dump their losses on taxpayers ( again ) .
BS - 4 . Incentive bonuses are increasing America 's financial risks
You would n't give incentives to the manager of a nuclear plant , says Taleb .
Incentives risk financial safety .
" Bonuses do not accommodate the hidden risks of blow - ups .
It is the asymmetry of the bonus system that got us here .
No incentives without disincentives : capitalism is about rewards and punishments , not just rewards . "
Sadly , Wall Street greed demands huge bonuses .
So no changes : This Black Swan also remains as a WMD .
BS - 5 . High - leveraged debt increases the danger of a massive meltdown
While past equity bubbles were " mild , " future " debt bubbles are vicious . "
Add highly leveraged debt , as we 're doing now with bailouts and stimulus spending , and you get " wild and dangerous gyrations and leaves no room for error . "
But the Gang can't see it .
BS - 6 . No more derivatives ... nobody understands these WMDs
Taleb warns :
" Do not give children sticks of dynamite , even if they come with a warning .
...
Derivatives need to be banned because nobody understands them and few are rational enough to know it .
Citizens must be protected from themselves , from bankers selling them ' hedging ' products , and from gullible regulators who listen to economic theorists . "
BS - 7 . ' Restoring confidence ' is for Ponzis , politicians and economists
Rumors are part of life , " governments can not stop the rumors . "
If you hear rhetoric about " restoring confidence " from politicians or economists , they 're hiding something .
BS - 8 . Do not give an addict more drugs if he has withdrawal pains
What a great metaphor : " Using leverage to cure the problems of too much leverage is not homeopathy , it is denial .
The debt crisis is not a temporary problem , it is a structural one .
We need rehab . "
And yet , Obama 's new bank regulatory reform package gives Wall Street access to an endless supply of their favorite drugs : derivatives , debt and bonuses .
BS - 9 . Never count on Wall Street advice or management for retirement
Wall Street hates Taleb for saying this : Markets are not " storehouses of value , " they lack " the certainties that normal citizens require . "
But this Black Swan is Wall Street 's " cash cow . "
They make hundreds of billions delivering advice and skimming money under the guise of managing our assets .
They 'll never give up this opportunity to steal our money .
BS - 10 .
Let entrepreneurs , not bankers , take risks and run America
Taleb the idealist : " Finally , this crisis cannot be fixed with makeshift repairs , no more than a boat with a rotten hull can be fixed with ad - hoc patches .
We need to rebuild the hull with new ( stronger ) materials . "
Before Obama 's reforms Taleb offered his own :
We must help " what needs to be broken break on its own , converting debt into equity , marginalizing the economics and business school establishments , shutting down the ' Nobel ' in economics , banning leveraged buyouts , putting bankers where they belong , clawing back the bonuses of those who got us here , and teaching people to navigate a world with fewer certainties . "
Do this and " we will see an economic life closer to our biological environment : smaller companies , richer ecology , no leverage -- a world in which entrepreneurs , not bankers , take the risks and companies are born and die every day without making the news .
In other words , a place more resistant to black swans . "
Remember Taleb's 10 Black Swans , because any one could trigger a disaster .
Yet sadly and unfortunately , we already know Wall Street refuses to rebuild its rotting hull .
Wall Street hates change .
And is now , like the Titanic before it , on a collision course that will sink the good ship , the USS Utopia and its cargo of 10 beautiful black swans , steaming into the great fog banks hiding a massive iceberg ... the Great Depression 2 .

Link of the day - Talent Is Overrated : What Really Separates World - Class Performers from Everybody Else
COLORADO SPRINGS , Colo . ( AP ) - A county clerk in Colorado has a simple response to staff cuts caused by budget shortfalls :
Just do n't answer the phones .
El Paso County officials complain that the staff of the county Clerk and Recorder 's office stopped answering calls last months .
Instead , recorded messages refer all callers to the assessor 's and treasurer 's offices .
County Clerk Bob Balink had to lay off 19 staffers late last year because of budget cuts .
Treasurer Sandra Damron said her 17 employees have been " slammed " with calls .
" We did n't know he was n't answering the phones , " she told The Gazette of Colorado Springs .
County Assessor Mark Lowderman told the newspaper that the clerk 's office did n't give him any warning that callers were being referred to his office .
Lowderman and Damron say the policy is a disservice to people who have business with the clerk 's office but can't visit in person or do n't have Internet access .
Balink did n't immediately respond on Tuesday to an Associated Press e-mail seeking comment .

A court in military - ruled Burma will deliver its verdict in the trial of Aung San Suu Kyi on Friday , her lawyer says .
The charges could see the democracy leader jailed for up to five years .
Burma 's junta has sparked international outrage for prosecuting the Nobel peace laureate for breaching the rules of her house arrest after an American man swam uninvited to her lakeside house in May .
" The verdict will be given this coming Friday .
We are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst , " defence lawyer Nyan Win said after the trial wrapped up with a final reply by Suu Kyi's legal team .
Judges Thaung Nyunt and Nyi Nyi
Soe indicated to the court at the notorious Insein prison , where Suu Kyi is being held , that sentencing was expected on the same day , Nyan Win said .
" We have a good chance according to the law , but we cannot know what the court will decide because this is a political case , " said Nyan Win , who is also the spokesman for her National League for Democracy .
" If she is released unconditionally she will be home on that day - if not , the sentence will be together with the verdict . "
The verdict is widely expected to be guilty , given the previous form of Burma 's courts , which have handed down heavy sentences to dozens of dissidents over the past year .
But the Suu Kyi case has been repeatedly delayed since it started on May 18 amid signs that the regime is trying to quell the storm of international outrage over its treatment of the opposition leader .
U2 singer Bono publicly announced during a concert in Dublin on Monday that Suu Kyi had been named Amnesty International 's ambassador of conscience for 2009 , the rights group 's highest honour .
Diplomats from Thailand , Japan , Singapore and the United States attended Tuesday 's hearing , a Myanmar official said on condition of anonymity .
Most of the trial has taken place behind closed doors .
Critics have accused the junta of trying to keep Suu Kyi locked up ahead of elections next year , and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led calls for her release at an Asian security conference last week .
Suu Kyi has been in jail or under house arrest for 13 of the last 19 years since the junta refused to recognise the NLD 's landslide victory in Burma 's last national elections , in 1990 .

The solar plane has the wingspan of a Boeing 747
It has the wingspan of a Boeing 747 but weighs less than a small car – and could be the first plane to fly around the world powered entirely by the sun .
This is the Solar Impulse , unveiled in Switzerland , which its inventor hopes will revolutionise air travel and reduce its impact on the environment .
Prospective passengers might need some convincing , however , that it is capable of staying up in areas where the sun picks and chooses its moments , ie , Britain .
Not adventurer Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg , though , they are the pilots of this ground - breaking craft , making them possibly the bravest in the world .
Bertrand Piccard and co-pilot Andre Borschberg are set to begin tests
They are planning to prove the airplane ’s viability with a round - the - world trip , although the scheduled take - off date , 2012 , suggests they are in for a few more turbulent test flights .
He said : ‘ Yesterday it was a dream , today it is an airplane , tomorrow it will be an ambassador of renewable energies . ’
The plane , part of a £ 70 million project , will fly day and night using almost 12,000 solar cells , rechargeable lithium batteries and four electric motors .
The engines provide just 40 horsepower so the plane will take off at 22 mph , accelerating at altitude to an average flight speed of 44 mph .
The Solar Pulse was unveiled in Switzerland
Unlike the first nonstop round - the - globe balloon trip which Mr Piccard co-piloted in 1999 , the solar flight will have to make stops to allow for pilots to switch over and stretch after long periods in the cramped cockpit .
The first test flights will be later this year , with a complete night voyage planned for 2010 .
Mr Piccard , 51 , who comes from a family of adventurers , said : ‘ It will be like the Wright brothers .
‘ We will start one metre above the ground , then three metres , then five metres .
When that works , we ’ll be able to take it to altitude . ’
But the solar plane cannot fly in bad weather because the solar panels are needed for day flying and for charging the 400 - kilogram lithium batteries that power the plane by night .
Mr Borschberg said : ‘ We ’ll certainly avoid stormy situations .
We ’ll avoid rain as well , because you cannot collect energy in this weather .
So the challenge for the team will be to find a path that is favorable . ’
Mr Piccard says the plane should also serve as an inspiration for inventors and manufacturers of everyday machines and appliances .
‘ If an aircraft is able to fly day and night without fuel , propelled solely by solar energy let no one come and claim that it is impossible to do the same thing for motor vehicles , heating and air conditioning systems and computers . ’

Right wing and left wing movements , when viewed from a public policy angle , may appear utterly inconsistent and contradictory .
Right wing movements nowadays appear and / or profess to favor little government involvement in financial affairs , but do n’t seem to be too keen on civil liberties or a smaller military .
Left wing movements appear to focus on civil liberties , and a more humble military , while supporting government intervention in financial affairs .
How , may one ask , does this make any sense ?
Well , none of the above definitions actually look at the root of these ideologies which in my opinion are rather emotional inclinations more than anything else .
I recently posted a comment to The confusion between right and left which explains it :
Left vs. Right Ideologies
Socialism vs. capitalism are economic concepts of societal organization .
As such they are objective and scientific .
But left vs. right ideology emerges from emotional tendencies and then guides one ’s political actions and decisions .
Whether one leans toward one or the other rather seems to be rooted in one ’s childhood upbringing , and the role that authority figures have played in one ’s life .
Thus it needs to be analyzed as such :
Left wing sentiment is rooted in the feeling of guilt and a resulting pity for weakness .
As a corollary that means pity for the poor , pity for minorities , pity for the elderly and the disabled , etc .
This naturally means that left ideas oppose power and strength as an end in itself ( but not necessarily as a means to ends that satisfy their pity for the weak ) .
It also means that left wingers have a high tolerance for the notion of surrendering one ’s body to earthly pleasures , which most people consider a weakness .
One could reasonably argue that left wing thinking , as a tendency , is the projection of a rather maternal upbringing , mostly stressing instincts that prevail on the female side rather than the male side , such as caring , kindness , forgiveness , weakness , dependency .
These are attributes that go way back to the beginnings of the human species and while they are becoming less and less relevant on a practical level in today ’s advanced world , they still play a role in the psychology of the human mind .
( This is not to generalize , just to point out general psychological tendencies in the different genders of the human species , of course always duly accounting for exceptions to the rule . )
Right wing sentiment is rooted in the feeling of fear and the admiration of strength as a perceived necessity to combat it .
As a corollary this means admiration of military and the glorious nation state .
It also comes with a high relevance assigned to strength through discipline and the rejection or at least a curbing of indulgence in earthly pleasures .
At times it may be expedient for right wingers to pull the “ fiscal discipline ” card , just another corollary of the idea of discipline in the minds of many people .
Right wing sentiment leads , as a tendency , to a rejection of protection for the weak and / or minorities , and a general animosity to indulgence and pleasures .
One could reasonably argue that right wing thinking , as a tendency , is the projection of a rather paternal upbringing , mostly stressing instincts that prevail on the male side rather than the female side , such as strength , discipline , order , and independence .
Important :
What I am pointing out above are the extreme ends of the spectrum .
Moderate left and right ideas can be placed anywhere between those two extremes .
Now , whether one supports state control of the economy depends on one ’s premises .
If the overall mood is such that the economy should be regulated to curb the actions of the powerful successful industrial tycoons , for the supposed benefit of the weak and poor workers , then a leftist ideology is rather likely to support such policies , while a right wing one would lean toward rejecting it .
( It is certainly fair to compare the current mood with this scenario . )
If , however , the mood is such that the currently powerful and rich have attained their status by state means , and that free markets enable poor people to rise to the ranks of wealthy ones , then a leftist ideology may actually favor less government involvement while right wingers may support the opposite .
( This scenario can be more or less compared to the mindset that generally prevailed during The Age of Enlightenment and arguably during the founding days of the United States . )
Nor do left and right wing ideas have their roots in conservatism vs. progressivism .
The left wingers of the Cuban revolution are today referred to as conservatives because they want to keep the current system in place .
The same applies to virtually all radical subversive left wing movements that tried to establish a socialist or theocratic utopia .
My point being , left and right ideologies first and foremost emerge out of emotional considerations .
How their supporters stand on specific matters of public policy largely depends on the overall conditions and mood that prevails in public opinion .
Libertarianism
( Non-political ) Libertarianism is completely indifferent to right or left wing ideologies .
It does n’t need emotions to justify its proposals .
Its method rests on logic and evidence , and as a result the recognition of universal human rights derived from consistent and universal ethics .
It is in its fundamentals not a pre-conceived ideology , but a scientific world view .
A libertarian will endorse changes to his views wherever one convinces him on logical grounds .
He will never cling to creeds for their own sake or to merely manage his anxiety about existing societal problems .
He views them as a means to attain a better society .
Libertarianism is to economics and politics what Galileo ’s theories were to geology , what Einstein ’s Theory of Relativity was to physics , or what Darwin ’s discoveries were to biology .
It really has nothing at all to do with political ideologies .
While the right wing ideologue will oppose leftist welfare proposals on the grounds that they are “ liberal bleeding heart socialist ” ideas , the libertarian will simply point out that he , too , shares the objective of lifting the poor out of their current predicaments and helping them enter the ranks of the middle class , but that the leftist proposals will actually accomplish the exact opposite of the desired outcomes .
While the left wing ideologue will oppose right wing militaristic ventures on the grounds that they are harmful to the many weak nations we occupy , the libertarian will argue that he shares the objective of having a strong defense , but that spreading militarism across the globe will actually weaken your security , harm your troops , and attain the opposite of the ends sought .
It is hard to tell how long it will take for all the false ideas that still prevail in economic and societal matters to be rejected by the majority .
But whoever truly opens up his mind , sets aside emotional and preconceived notions , and begins approaching important questions from first principle , will never again listen to the proponents of those false ideas the way he used to .

Athletes Who Would Make Great Politicians …
by The Man No One Came To See in Uncategorized
With the rise of Sarah Palin in this past election cycle , I started to wonder what the qualification were required to be a politicians .
I used to think you had to be a charismatic , intelligent , confident , and relatively popular , but Sarah Palin revealed that a lack of intelligence is not a hindrance for a politicians .
So if you remove intelligence , we look for charismatic , confident , and popular people .
That opens up a completely new set of people , and i immediately thought of NBA players .
Think about it , these guys go out onto the floor in front of thousands of people and put on a show .
They are use to dealing with the media all the time and encountering fans .
NBA stardom breeds political juggernauts .
I have compiled a list of five NBA players who would make great politicians .
1. Shaquille O’Neal - Democrat
When you think of the most charismatic players in the NBA , you mind has to come immediately to Shaq .
The ‘ Big Aristotle ’ has entertained and enlightened fans across the country .
But Shaq is not all fluff , he has serious experience with helping the common man .
Shaq is an honorary U.S. Deputy Marshall for his work helping stop sexual predators on the Internet and has trained with the L.A. Police Academy .
While in Miami , he witnessed a hate crime on the streets and tracked the suspects and gave their location to the cops so they could apprehend them .
Without a doubt Shaq has the law and order credentials for political office .
He has also worked to alleviate the hardship felt by citizens of Orlando during the current recession .
He plans on buying mortgages of families who ca n’t afford their mortgage and sell them back at a more affordable rate .
Shaq has all the aspects of a good politicians and if push comes to shove , he is over seven feet tall and about 350 pounds so he always has the upper hand in negotiations .
Potential Offices : Sheriff of Broward County , Florida , Governor of Florida , Governor of New Jersey , his home state .
2. Sir Charles Barkley - Independent
In the NBA , Sir Charles was known for his tenacity and ability to defy the odds as a 6 ’ 4 ” power forward .
He is one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history and an ambitious person who has set his sights on political office over the last decade .
In 1995 , he was discussing running for Governor in Alabama in 1998 .
He has always been outspoken and at an education summit he declared , “ I ’m serious .
I ’ve got to get people to realize that the government is full of it .
Republicans and Democrats want to argue over stuff that ’s not important , like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration …
When I run — if I run — we ’re going to talk about real issues like improving our schools , cleaning up our neighborhoods of drugs and crime and making Alabama a better place for all people . ”
Sounds like a politician , does n’t it ?
Barkley , a registered Republican , endorsed Obama early in the election cycle .
Barkley is not without his flaws .
He has an admitted gambling problem that left him with millions of dollars in debt to bookies .
He also had a DUI where he said he was racing to get oral sex from a prostitute .
We have politicians with worse record than that .
Potential Office : Already said he is running for governor of Alabama in 2014
3. Lebron James - Democrat
Lebron is Ohio ’s patron saint .
He is the biggest and most marketable star in the NBA .
He has spent his entire life in Ohio and is trying to give back to the people who helped him along the way .
He has the statewide appeal because he was Mr. Basketball for Ohio three years in a row .
100 % of Ohio residents can identify him which is more than any politician can say .
Lebron is also a staunch Democrat , he donated $ 20,000 to the Obama campaign and organized a huge viewing party at the Cavaliers stadium for Obama ’s half - hour infomercial near the end of the campaign .
His national prominence and charisma makes him a great candidate .
( We will forget the part about him not going to college… ) .
Potential Office : Anything he wants / is eligible for in Ohio
4. Grant Hill - Democrat
Grant Hill fits the mold of a politician more than the previous three .
He graduated from prestigious Duke University ( Duke fucking sucks by the way ) and has no real legal problems throughout his career .
He does have some political experience , he actively supported John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008 .
He also has a strong connection with the Clinton family , his mother was Hilary ’s roommate while they attended college , and Grant got a call from President Clinton the day he was drafted .
Hill has also served as a public health advocate after his near death encounter with MRSA .
Hill is a prominent fundraiser for Obama and continues to be very active in politics as his career progresses .
Potential Office : Governor of Arizona or Florida
5. Michael Jordan - Democrat
Any discussion of Michael Jordan needs to start out under the assumption that he is the greatest to ever play the game .
He is as confident as any player to ever play the game but he does not come off as arrogant .
He developed one of the biggest sports brands and marketed himself so well that he is now estimated to be worth 450 million dollars .
That large amount of personal wealth immediate makes him a viable candidate .
Another thing that makes him a political powerhouse is his god - like status in Illinois and North Carolina ( Go Heels ) .
No one is more popular in those states than Jordan .
His skill at marketing himself would make him a campaigning machine and a political threat to his opponent .
Potential Offices : Anything he wants in NC or Illinois
With politicians these day , i could go for some change in the ranks , maybe an influx of dunking and jump shots would spice up Capitol Hill

THE IG FARBEN building in Frankfurt has a history .
This is where Zyklon B gas , used at Auschwitz , was invented and Dwight Eisenhower later worked .
Now it is part of an € 1.8 billion ( $ 2.5 billion ) building project at Frankfurt 's Goethe University .
Not for Goethe 's 35,000 students the grotty campuses of others : the “ House of Finance ” has a marble floor inspired by Raphael 's fresco “ The School of Athens . ”
Thousands of less coddled students recently staged protests across Germany against their conditions .
“ Back education , not banks ” , demanded protesters fed up with overcrowded lecture halls , crumbling campuses , tuition fees and a chaotic conversion from the traditional diploma to a European two - tier degree system .
German universities are underfunded by international standards ( see chart ) .
Professors juggle scores of students ; at top American universities they nurture a handful .
In switching to the bachelors - masters degrees prescribed by Europe 's standardising “ Bologna process ” , many universities tried to cram bachelors degrees into just six terms .
Only six German universities are among the top 100 in the Shanghai rankings ( Munich is highest , at 55th ) .
Just 21 % of each age cohort gets a degree ; the OECD average is 37 % .
A high - wage country with few natural resources cannot afford sub - par universities , as Chancellor Angela Merkel often says .
On June 4th the federal and state governments approved an € 18 billion plan to create more university places , boost funding for research and cultivate a small group of elite institutions .
It is “ a signal that research and education are being taken seriously , ” says Margret Wintermantel , head of the German Rectors ' Conference .
In the past , universities were interchangeable , and most students chose one close to home .
But since the early 1990s budget cuts have encouraged them to compete and specialise .
Their state paymasters began to link cash to professors ' publications and their ability to attract outside money .
The government 's new “ excellence initiative ” goads them to differentiate still more , showering € 1.9 billion on research programmes and nine “ top universities ” with promising “ future concepts ” .
That brought a “ big change in mentality ” , says Werner Müller - Esterl , Goethe 's president .
Some striking students object to the idea of rewarding research over teaching and of exalting some universities over others .
Yet universities are starting to serve students better .
All get at least some money based on the numbers they attract .
Many go beyond entrance exams to select students .
This , plus the introduction of tuition fees and rankings that gauge teaching as well as research , has led to a change in culture with more competition and “ a performance orientation , ” says Frank Ziegele of CHE , a think - tank that produces a set of rankings .
Goethe University is in the vanguard .
Last year it became a “ foundation university ” , loosening its ties to the state of Hesse , and expanding its freedom to hire and manage staff , and to raise money from private sources .
“ We can now pay competitive salaries , ” says Mr Müller - Esterl .
The university has hired 50 new professors , including some from foreign rivals .
No longer a state agency , the university now finds it easier to raise money from private donors who want to know how it will be spent .
Mr Müller - Esterl hopes the university will build its puny € 125 m endowment up to € 5 billion - 6 billion .
But Goethe is not immune to German ailments .
Along with other western German universities , it is bracing for an influx of 275,000 extra students , caused by a minor baby boom and a one - year reduction in courses of study at high schools .
Part of the government 's package is meant to help universities cope with this “ student mountain ” , which will peak in 2011 - 13 , but Mr Müller - Esterl says it is not enough .
The main gap in university financing is not the contribution of the state , which matches America's , but in private funding and fees .
Tuition fees , as the student protests suggest , are politically explosive .
Hesse 's conservative government introduced them but retreated in the face of protests .
That put a check on Goethe University 's leap for independence .
Most western German states allow tuition fees of a meagre € 500 per term , but universities “ ca n't plan long term because they do n't know if the next government will take it away , ” says Ms Wintermantel .
Nor did universities get extra money for the Bologna process , a source of much angst .
The diploma of 8 - 12 terms was a German brand , “ like Oktoberfest , ” says Bernhard Kempen , head of the German Association of University Professors .
Students who obtain bachelors degrees in some disciplines , such as information technology , do not learn enough to get good jobs .
But there is a shortage of places in masters programmes , says Mr Kempen .
Students ' mobility among institutions , one of Bologna 's goals , has fallen because study programmes are more intense and universities do not give credit for one another 's coursework .
Competition is fine , but professors grumble that they spend too much time on grant applications .
Still , these pressures push German universities in the right direction .
World rankings tend to underrate them , partly because non-English - speaking laboratories are penalised .
They would do better if research at non-university institutes like the Max Planck Society were brought into academies , adding teaching to research .
That is happening : an example is the merger of Karlsruhe University and the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe to form Karlsruhe Institute of Technology , modelled on MIT .
“ In ten to 15 years a few universities will have a place in the top international league , ” says Matthias Kleiner , head of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft , which funnels money to research .
Perhaps Goethe University will be among them .
Piracy has taken a hefty toll on Ubisoft , according to company head Yves Guillemot , but the developer and publisher say they are hard at work on a tool that should help reduce the negative impact .

" Altogether on console , the piracy is low , " Guillemot said .
" On the PC the piracy is quite a lot .
We are working on a tool that would allow us to decrease that on the PC starting next year and probably one game this year . "
Guillemot did n't say what that solution would be , but it since he talked about it as if it were a new tool and not an existing form of digital rights management , like SecuRom , it stands to reason that it may be an internal solution .

The topic of piracy came up during Ubisoft 's quarterly earnings call after Guillemot pointed to it as part of the reason that their DS games have n't been selling well .
He said that piracy on Nintendo's DS is strong , though oddly not as bad on the DSi , and that the company has learned that they can reduce the impact of illegal copies of the game by including physical extras like figurines , with their titles .
The increase in piracy on the DS started in Spain , Guillemot said , where they say " sales going down at a very strong level " last year .
That then seemed to move to other countries this year , increasing the most after the month of March with continued impact this summer .

" We see it coming country by country . " he said .
" We see when we put other things with the product ( people ) go and buy the game .
We need to make sure that the value is better when they buy the box then when they download ( the game ) from the Internet . "
Guillemot said that Ubisoft is working on the problem both internally and with Nintendo 's help .

" Nintendo has been able to slow down piracy a lot in Japan , " he said .
" They are now putting pressure to make sure it decreases in many other countries .
We think we will be able to solve this matter . "
Ubiosoft was so concerned with piracy on the Playstation Portable they started to retreat from that platform , Guillemot said .
But there are now " new ways to control piracy " on the PSP , he said , and the company is reinvesting in the platform .
In a move that will stir the heart and pants of any true - blooded Sony fan , Media Molecule has announced that this Thursday will see the arrival of a Team ICO pack in LittleBigPlanet , including stickers , items and costumes based on the studio's classic PlayStation 2 games , ICO and Shadow of the Colossus .
Tomorrow , Media Molecule will be showing off the Colossus side of the pack , but today it has shared with us some new Sackboy costumes that will allow LittleBigPlanet players to create their very own Ico or Yorda .
Make sure you take a look at them , but try not to fap too hard , especially if you 're at work .

Searching for something for your Jewish grandmother ?

| POLITICO Staff RNC pulls game selling offensive items
A Republican National Committee online game that challenges players to spend trillions of dollars was taken down today after reports that it offered some objectionable items for sale – including sexually explicit , anti-Semitic and anti-Latino items .
The game was designed to drive home to Young Republicans how much could be purchased with the $ 3.4 trillion President Obama requested in his budget by asking players to charge everyday items to their “ Obama Card . ”

But it turns out some of the items for sale were n't so kosher .
Searching for something for your Jewish grandmother ?
Type in the word “ Jew ” and you ’ll find the book “ The Jews and Their Lies ” for sale right next to “ Cool Jew : The Ultimate Guide for Every Member of the Tribe . ”
Interested in reading about Latinos ?
A search on the website turns up “ The Latino Threat ” or , for something less ominous , “ Latino Talent . ”
And while the words “ gay ” and “ vagina ” are banned search terms , yielding a response of " Bad word ! " , homosexual will find you the book “ Loving Homosexuals as Jesus Would . ”
RNC spokeswoman Gail Gitcho said the website pulls its inventory from Amazon.com , but developers did n’t realize that Amazon stocked potentially offensive items .
“ It ’s unfortunate that someone would spend the time , and go to great lengths , to abuse and exploit this website feature that was designed to give taxpayers the opportunity to see if they could spend $ 3.4 trillion – like President Obama did with his budget , ” Gitcho said .
“ Profanity blockers were included since the site ’s launch .
However , the website feature has been taken down until additional , stricter search filters have been added . ”
While the launch page for the Obama Card game ( motto : " Life costs nothing " ) is still online , clicking " Enter " now pops up a server error message .
The liberal website Americablog was one of the first to report on the GOP website and searched all kinds of naughty words , including bondage and escorts , which yielded suggested purchases including handcuffs , how - to - books and Astroglide .

Dolphin - assisted therapy helps disabled children
A 350 - pound dolphin named Matteo tickles a toddler with his snout , sparking a burst of giggles .
The disabled child hitches a ride on Matteo ’s belly while gleeful parents snap photos .
The dolphin expels water through its blowhole and rests its head gently on the girl ’s shoulder while her parents silently plead for results .
It ’s a scene Kirsten “ Kiki ” Kuhnert has watched thousands of times .
She used to be one of those moms who prayed for miracles at the side of a dolphin therapy center pool , thinking : Maybe this will make my child talk .
Maybe some day he ’ll walk .
“ I have seen kids speak their first word , mothers cry because their autistic son looked at her in the eye or kissed her , ” Kuhnert said .
“ Every day a little miracle .
“ How big a miracle is in the eye of the beholder . ”
Kuhnert , a single mom from Key Biscayne , Fla. , has dedicated the past 15 years of her life to raising funds for dolphin - assisted therapy , a controversial behavior - modification treatment for severely disabled children .
Struck by tragedy as a young mother of a 2 - year - old , the Germany native turned her heartbreak into a calling .
Convinced that swimming with the animals paired with intensive speech or physical therapy helps with autism , Down ’s syndrome , cerebral palsy and other debilitating ailments , Kuhnert spends her days snapping orders at therapists and trouble - shooting emergencies at a therapy center at the Seaquarium in Willemstad , Curacao .
She makes phone call after phone call raising money to get children to treatment , at $ 7,000 or more for just two weeks of care .
But , these days , she is hardly ever by the pool , rarely with the children .
The memories of the son she lost sting too much .
___
A MOM’S MISSION
It was June 18 , 1994 .
Kuhnert was the married mother of two kids from an upper - class family in Germany who made her living in sports event marketing .
That June day , the family had gathered at the country club to celebrate her infant daughter Kira ’s christening , when suddenly they realized they had lost sight of Tim , Kuhnert ’s 2 - year - old .
“ We looked for 15 minutes , ” she remembers .
“ He was 15 yards away behind a hedge , in an unsecured swimming pool .
This is where they found him .
He was lifeless . ”

RAMALLAH , occupied West Bank ( IPS ) -
The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel has accused the Israeli security forces of deliberately shackling Palestinian prisoners in a painful and dangerous manner , amounting to a form of torture .
The report , “ Shackling as a Form of Torture and Abuse , ” based on the evidence of over 500 prisoners , was released in advance of the UN International Day in Support of Torture Victims Friday , 26 June .
It follows a report published in May by the UN Committee Against Torture that had criticized the continued mistreatment of Palestinian prisoners by Israel .
The UN report also condemned Israel ’s refusal to allow access to a secret detention centre known only as Facility 1391 .
The report by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel ( PCATI ) states that Israel ’s various security agencies , chiefly the Israeli army and the General Security Services ( GSS ) , also known as the Israeli Security Agency ( ISA ) , shackle Palestinian prisoners against accepted international standards .
The shackling is not done for restraining purposes or for preventing a detainee from escaping or endangering themselves , says PCATI .
“ The shackling is done for invalid and irrelevant reasons , which include causing pain and suffering , punishment , intimidation , and illegally eliciting information and confessions , in violation of domestic law , High Court of Justice rulings and international law , ” says the report .
Some of those shackled have suffered permanent damage to their limbs — and human rights groups say shackling is only one of the routine forms of torture meted out to Palestinian prisoners .
Israeli rights group B’tselem in its 2007 report “ Absolute Prohibition , The Torture and Ill - Treatment of Palestinian Detainees ” asked , “ Does the State of Israel respect the absolute prohibition against torture and ill - treatment ?
The answer to this question would seem to be no . ”
“ In recent years , Israel has officially admitted several times that in ‘ ticking - bomb ’ cases , the interrogators of the ISA employ ‘ exceptional ’ methods of questioning , including ‘ physical pressure . ’ ”
Together with other rights groups , PCATI successfully petitioned the Israeli High Court of Justice in 1999 asking that certain forms of physical abuse be outlawed .
These included abusive shackling , severe beatings and shaking , covering prisoners ’ heads with hoods coated with excreta , extreme changes of temperature , and painful binding to chairs , amongst others methods .
An exception was made in the case of “ ticking - bombs ” such as potential suicide bombers .
“ The problem , however , is that the interrogators are given a lot of leeway as to their interpretation of what constitutes a ticking - bomb , ” said PCATI ’s Yohav Loef .
“ The courts tend to accept the interpretation of the interrogators , and their application of the exception to the rule of when force can be used , over that of Palestinian detainees , ” Loef told IPS .
Wassam Ahmed from the Al - Haq human rights organization agrees with Loef .
“ Torture and abuse of Palestinians by both the arresting Israeli soldiers and the interrogating officers is rife . ”
“ Actually the Israeli courts have rubber - stamped the abuse of these detainees by leaving such a wide margin for interpretation of the ‘ ticking - bomb ’ rule .
It is the regular exception swallowing the rule , ” Ahmed told IPS .
“ Any investigations into alleged abuse of the prisoners is carried out by the security services themselves , hardly an independent inquiry , ” added Ahmed .
Prior to PCATI ’s 1999 court petition , the 1987 Landau Commission was appointed to examine ISA interrogation methods .
A two - part report was released several months later , but only the first part was made public .
“ They obviously had something to hide .
The bottom line was that various methods of ‘ physical pressure ’ were permitted , ” Loef told IPS .
Meanwhile , in early May the UN Committee Against Torture held hearings in Geneva to review Israel ’s compliance with the Convention Against Torture ( CAT ) .
Ten independent experts from the committee said they found credible submissions from Israeli groups that Palestinian detainees are systematically tortured despite the banning of such practices by the Israeli Supreme Court in 1999 .
The committee also criticized Israel ’s refusal to allow the Red Cross access to the secret Facility 1391 , dubbed Israel ’s “ secret Guantanamo Bay . ”
Facility 1391 , a largely underground bunker reportedly some 100 km north of Jerusalem , is used to interrogate non-Palestinian Muslims and Arab prisoners from neighboring countries .
Top Hizballah officials , who were kidnapped during the eighties from Lebanon by the Israeli military , were held in this facility for years , as were Lebanese prisoners from the 2006 Israeli war on Lebanon .
The interrogation methods carried out by the Israeli army in 1391 are allegedly far harsher than those carried out by the ISA in Palestinian detention centers .
The facility was accidentally discovered in 2002 by Israeli rights group Hamoked as it attempted to trace two missing Palestinian detainees from the West Bank after their families had reported them missing .
Due to overcrowding at facilities where Palestinians are normally held , the two had been sent to Facility 1391 .
It had remained a secret up until 2002 because the families of Arabs from surrounding countries are not able to trace family members to the same degree that Palestinians can use the Red Cross to find family members in other facilities .
Israel has refused to identify the exact location of 1391 , and denied to the UN committee that any prisoners are currently being held there .

Enlarge By Jeff Haynes , Reuters President Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan talk to schoolchildren in Chicago in December 2008 , when Duncan was the superintendent of Chicago schools .
New research from a Chicago civic group takes direct aim at the city 's " abysmal " public high school performance — and puts a new spin on the academic gains made during the seven years that Arne Duncan led the Chicago schools before he was named U.S. Education secretary .
The Civic Committee of The Commercial Club of Chicago , a supporter of Duncan and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley 's push for more control of city schools , issued the report June 30 .
It says city schools have made little progress since 2003 .
Its key findings stand in stark contrast to assertions President Obama made in December when he nominated Duncan as Education secretary .
And though the findings are by no means as explosive , they 're reminiscent of revelations from Houston in 2003 , when state investigators found that 15 high schools had underreported dropout rates under former superintendent Rod Paige , who by then was George W. Bush 's Education secretary .
In December , Obama said that during a seven - year tenure , Duncan had boosted elementary school test scores " from 38 % of students meeting the standards to 67 % " — a gain of 29 percentage points .
But the new report found that , adjusting for changes in tests and procedures , students ' pass rates grew only about 8 percentage points .
Obama also said Chicago 's dropout rate " has gone downevery year he 's been in charge . "
Though that 's technically true , the committee says it 's still unacceptably high :
About half of Chicago students drop out of the city 's non-selective - enrollment high schools .
And more than 70 % of 11th - graders fail to meet state standards , a trend that " has remained essentially flat " over the past several years .
Even among those who graduate , it says , skills are poor :
An analysis of students entering the Chicago City Colleges in fall 2006 showed that 69 % were not prepared for college - level reading , 79 % were not prepared for writing , and 95 % were not prepared for math .
" Performance is very bad , very weak , " says Civic Committee president Eden Martin .
Obama also said Chicago students ' ACT test score gains " have been twice as big as those for students in the rest of the state . "
Again , technically true — ACT data show that Chicago students ' composite score rose 0.9 points from 2002 to 2006 , while Illinois ' score rose 0.4 points .
But Chicago students ' composite score of 17.4 was lower than the statewide average of 20.5 .
Timothy Knowles , who directs the University of Chicago 's Urban Education Institute , says the report highlights " a highly irresponsible state reaction " to the federal No Child Left Behind law .
" In essence , " he says , " many states have lowered ( passing ) scores on standardized tests to create the public appearance they are meeting federal standards .
This practice sells children short — and the states that engage in it are , ironically , leaving themselves behind . "
Knowles says Chicago schools are moving in the right direction , with " some extraordinary new schools " and promising performance from black and Latino students , for instance .
" However , the Civic Committee report reminds us these successes are fragile … and there is unambiguous evidence that Chicago has miles to go before it sleeps . "
Duncan spokesman Peter Cunningham says Chicago schools " made significant gains across a range of indicators " under Duncan .
" While we still have a long way to go , it is absolutely misleading and irresponsible to suggest that there has not been progress . "
Blogger Alexander Russo , who writes about Chicago schools , says the findings show that nearly 15 years into mayoral control , the city school system " is n't nearly as improved as many have been led to believe . "
" What I find particularly appalling is that Duncan and Obama — supposed champions of transparency and using research rather than ideology — have cited Chicago 's inflated test scores , even though they knew the increases were exaggerated . "

( Corrects to remove reference to the New Hampshire ’s bill needing governor ’s signature to become law , 7th paragraph )
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Maine ’s senate passed a bill on Thursday that could make the northeastern U.S. state the fifth in the country to allow gay marriage , but the lower chamber and governor have yet to approve it .
The legislation , which will go to a vote in the state House of Representatives next week , seeks to redefine marriage as the legal union of two people rather than between a man and a women .
It passed the senate by a 20 - 15 margin .
Maine Governor John Baldacci once opposed gay marriage , but said earlier in April he is keeping an open mind on the issue .
Approval in the Democratic - controlled senate of the rural state of 1.3 million people underlines a concerted push for same - sex marriage recognition in New England ’s six states by gay and lesbian advocates .
Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders , a group of lawyers who led the legal fight for same - sex marriage in Massachusetts and Connecticut , has set a target of bringing same - sex marriage to all New England states by 2012 .
In November , Connecticut became the second state to allow legal same - sex weddings after neighboring Massachusetts ’ top court ruled in 2003 that a ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional , paving the way for the first same - sex marriages in the United States the following year .
In a single week in April , Iowa and Vermont also legalized same sex marriage .
And on Wednesday , New Hampshire ’s state senate approved a gay marriage bill , about a month after its House approved it .
It ’s unclear whether New Hampshire Governor John Lynch will veto the legislation .
“ With progress in New Hampshire and a win in Vermont , winning in Maine could put us only one state away from our goal , ” Lee Swislow , executive director of Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders , said in a statement .
Gay marriage legislation has yet to advance in Rhode Island .
Some economists say carving out an economic niche for gay and lesbian weddings -- and the spending that comes with them -- makes sense at a time same - sex marriage has stalled in California and a recession is deepening .
Max Kaiser on Goldman Sachs Employees : " They Should be Taken on Financial Terrorism Charges "
By Ben Cohen
A fantastic rant from a round table discussion on France 24 from financial analyst Max Kaiser , a man clearly very , very angry with Goldman Sachs .
Certainly not something you 'd see on MSNBC / CNN ( via Matt Taibbi ) :
UFC 100 - The Ragdoll Landing Zone Going into UFC 100 , Michael " The Count " Bisbing had managed to build up a full steam of douchebaggery with his pre-fight comments and dick behavior on The Ultimate Fighter reality show .
The crowd was definitely not on his side .
Luckily , if this hurt Bisbing 's feelings , Henderson hit him hard enough in the second round that he got to walk through a tunnel and talk to Jesus personally about it .
Dan 's right hand dropped him like a cartoon .
He hit him so hard that even gravity got scared .
Bisbing hung in mid-air for a moment while gravity screamed at inertia , " Did you see that shit ! ? "
Then , after a high five , the two universal forces quit screwing around and yanked Bisbing 's limp body into the floor .
Henderson was n't done dominating Bisbing and gravity , though .
After the man - shaped sack of bangers and mash landed , Dan flew into the air and came down on Bisbing 's head with Fistos , the forbidden punch of legend .
Henderson went fully horizontal with both feet in the air like some kind of maniac skydiver .
If you were the greatest warrior that ever lived , came across a sleeping enemy and had six hours to plan one ultimate punch , this is the punch you would throw .

There is a shortage of donor organs in the UK Most people have a strong aversion to the idea of receiving a donor organ from a killer , a study suggests .
Those questioned said they would be far happier receiving a transplant from someone with a good moral background , the Cheltenham Science Festival heard .
It follows on from research which found one in three organ transplant patients believe they have taken on some aspects of the donor 's personality .
Around 16 m people are on the UK organ donor register .
Professor Bruce Hood , a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Bristol , tested the effects of information about the morals of a potential donor in 20 students who were asked to imagine they needed a life - saving heart transplant .
Essentially they believe they will somehow take on those characteristics of the donor
Professor Bruce Hood
They were shown pictures of strangers and asked to rate how happy they would be to receive an organ from them .
The students were then shown the photos a second time but told that the person was good or bad .
Negative scores increased dramatically when they were told the donor was a bad person .
When told they were looking at pictures of good people , there was a small increase in positive ratings .
The largest negative effect was for a murderer 's heart .
' Connection ' Professor
Hood told the conference that he had spoken with patients who believe they have taken on a psychic connection with their organ donors , and even their memories and experiences .
" Some of the psychological changes many patients experience have very good physiological explanations , however according to one survey of transplant patients , approximately one in three attribute this change to taking on psychological characteristics of the donor even though conventional science has generally rejected the idea that such transference is possible . "
He added that in one case , a British teenager was forcibly given a heart transplant against her will because she feared that she would be " different with someone else 's heart " .
" This explains the findings that most people were repulsed by the thought of receiving a transplant from a murderer .
" Essentially they believe they will somehow take on those characteristics of the donor . "
Isabel Clarke , an NHS consultant clinical psychologist with an interest in spirituality said the association of ideas can be very powerful .
" There 's quite an emotional punch about the heart and receiving someone 's heart . "
A spokesman for NHS Blood and Transplant said organ donations were done anonymously in the UK so recipients would not know about the personality of the donor .
" We ensure that organs donated for transplant are matched and allocated based on clinical need and criteria including , age , size , blood group and for kidneys , the tissue type .
" Clinical analysis shows that these criteria are most relevant to the successful outcome of a transplant . "

Choosing Web Designers Near
Me company is a big decision and not the kind of decision that you should make on your own .
If you 've never done it before , you need to make sure that you get professional help , because you can't afford to go into a job without the help of a web design company .
In the past , you might have ended up hiring a Web Designers Near Me on your own if you had a good idea of what you wanted .
You might have simply picked up the phone and called someone to ask them for a quote .
Nowadays , that 's still a perfectly fine way to go about things , but now you 're going to be putting your own life and your business at risk if you do n't get help .
The reason why you need to get help from a web design company is simple : no matter how much you know about web design , you are still going to be clueless without someone who has done it all before .
You are going to have a hard time even figuring out what you want , much less how to get it done .
Hiring someone who knows the ropes is going to be worth your while .
There are some people who seem to think that they can get an absolutely terrible web design company for a relatively low price .
But the price you pay is n't actually cheap at all , and you are n't getting a quality product .
You 'll end up spending a lot more money in the long run .
The first thing that you need to do is think about what you 're trying to accomplish .
If you 're a small business , then you need to find a company that can handle jobs as small as you can handle yourself .
But if you have a larger business , you need to find a company that can handle bigger jobs , like company websites .
There are a number of other things that you need to consider before you choose a web design company .
For example , do you have a specific budget in mind ?
If you have a certain amount of money to spend , you might want to spend that money on the best web design companies in town .
But if you want to hire a company that will meet your needs and can take care of them right away , you should stick with those companies that are cheaper .
Even though you might think that you 're making the right choice , it 's important to keep in mind that you can't ever trust a web design company to handle everything for you .
They might be able to do some basic things , but if you have a very difficult website , they might be overwhelmed .
It 's important to hire a company that you know has the knowledge to do the job .
If you want , you can even find independent contractors who can handle the work .
But if you have a large website , you 'll probably want to stick with a web design company because you can be sure that they 'll do a professional job .
And once you get the whole site designed , you can start making it look better .
Of course , if you 're not sure that you want to pay a web design company to design your website , you can just go ahead and do it yourself .
You just need to realize that you 're not going to be able to afford to hire someone who knows what they 're doing .
There are a lot of computer experts who can create a website , but it would take a lot of time for someone who does n't have that skill set .
If you go into a web design company with a lot of experience , you may find that they can create a site that looks better than if you had done it yourself .
But it wo n't be worth it if you end up spending a lot of money to hire someone who did n't know what they were doing .
If you do decide to hire a web design company , make sure that you understand everything that they charge you for .
It 's important to know whether it's a flat fee , or if you have to pay an hourly rate as well .
You should n't let the design company 's charges scare you off , though .
You might find that a good web design company is someone who charges a flat fee because they offer more services than others or something else that you might have in mind .
RIVERSIDE —
A convicted arsonist was sentenced to death Friday for setting a Southern California wildfire that claimed the lives of five federal firefighters as they struggled to defend a rural home from raging wind - driven flames .
Raymond Lee Oyler , 38 , was found guilty in March of five counts of first - degree murder for setting the Oct. 26 , 2006 , blaze about 90 miles east of Los Angeles .
“ After evaluating the same evidence that the jury had heard and going through that , I find that the aggravating circumstances do outweigh the mitigating circumstances , ” Riverside County Superior Court Judge W. Charles Morgan said .
“ In particular , Mr. Oyler set on a mission … to wreak havoc in this county by setting fires by his own design for his own purposes and as proven by the evidence he became more and more proficient , ” Morgan said .
“ He knew that young men and woman would put their lives on the line to protect other people and property and he continued anyway . ”
The firefighters ’ deaths stunned the region and some 10,000 people attended the memorial service for Jason McKay , 27 ; Jess McLean , 27 ; Daniel Hoover - Najera , 20 ; Mark Loutzenhiser , 43 ; and Pablo Cerda , 23 .
Relatives of the victims addressed the court during the sentencing hearing .
“ The damage done to our family can never be repaired , ” said Josh McClean , brother of Jess McClean .
“ He stole something from us that he can not repay .
To sit in the courtroom and watch the defendant smile and wave to his family , that ’s something that we no longer have the opportunity to do . ”
Oyler , a former auto mechanic with a young daughter , was also convicted of 20 counts of arson and 17 counts of using an incendiary device for a rash of blazes in the area that year .
His daughter wept when the sentence was pronounced .
The fatal blaze began on a hillside in the town of Cabazon and spread quickly from a valley floor up the north side of the mountains to the widely dispersed rural community of Twin Pines .
There , the fire overran the crew of U.S. Forest Service Engine 57 as the men tried to defend an unoccupied home at the top of a steep hill .
Three firefighters died there and a fourth died soon after at a hospital .
The fifth died five days later , the same day Oyler was arrested .
The blaze , known as the Esperanza Fire , also destroyed 34 homes and 20 outbuildings and charred nearly 70 square miles of terrain .
If you are migrating over from Windows you know the Ctrl - Alt - Del three finger salute brings up a ulitity that can help you stop out of control or frozen applications .
And then , of course , a second three - finger salute might find your machine rebooting ( for when those apps just do n't want to unfreeze . )
The default behavior for this in Linux to to immediately reboot your machine .
That is fine if you 're not used to hitting that combination every time an application goes postal on your machine .
But if that is what you are accustomed to doing , you might have a hard time adjusting to the difference in behavior .
Think about it , Firefox freezes and you instantly go for Ctrl - Alt - Del only to have your machine instantly reboot .
What kind of work could you lose ?
Fortunately you can prevent or even alter this behavior in Linux .
And doing so only requires you to open up a flat text file in your favorite editor , make a change , and save the file .
Distribution specifics
Some distributions handle this task differently .
And some distributions have changed the way the do this .
So I will show you how to alter this behavior in two different ways which should cover all of the basics .
We 'll start with the older method first .
The original method
Distributions used to handle this even through the /etc / inittab file .
The inittab file is primarily used to handle the run level of your system .
Older distributions also used this file to determine behaviors such as key bindings like Ctrl - alt - del .
If you open up this file and see a line that includes a string like :
ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t1 - a -r now
you know your system uses this file to control this behavior .
The new method
If you do not find an entry like the above in your /etc / inittab file then you will want to take a look at the more modern method of handling this task .
Take a look in the /etc / event.d directory .
In this directory you should see a file called control - alt - delete .
In this file you will see a line that looks like :
exec / sbin / shutdown -r now " Control - Alt - Delete pressed "
That is the line you will alter to change the behavior .
And now , let 's make some changes .
Making the change
Changing this behavior is simple .
What you will do is replace the executable command for reboot with the command you want to use .
Either that or you will comment the command out ( by placing a " # " character at the beginning of the line ) to dis
able the funcationality all together .
Let 's say you want to replace the reboot behavior so that the Gnome System Monitor opens .
This behavior would be more in line with the behavior of Windows .
To make this change the inittab line would look like this :
ctrlaltdel:/usr/bin/gnome-system-monitor
and the control - alt - delete entry would look like :
exec /usr / bin/gnome-system-monitor
Make your changes and save your file .
To make this change take effect .
What about when using GNOME ?
You might find this does n't work in GNOME .
If you are using Metacity as the window manager you will want to issue two commands :
gconftool - 2 -t str -- set /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_9 " < Control >< Alt> Delete "
and
gconftool - 2 -t str -- set /apps/metacity/keybinding_commands/command_9 " gnome-system-monitor "
If you are using Compiz as your window manager you will issue the following commands :
gconftool - 2 -t str -- set /apps/compiz/general/allscreens/options/command9 " < Control >< Alt> Delete "
and
gconftool - 2 -t str -- set /apps/compiz/general/allscreens/options/command9 " gnome-system-monitor "
Other Window managers
There might be instances where an alternative window manager may not bind to this combination .
Most window managers use their own key mappings for binding .
If you find your window manager wo n't bind Control - Alt - Del look up your particular window manager key mapping process and map from there .
Final thoughts
There are instances where you will want to make sure your users have the same experience as they do in Windows .
Take care of this particular behavior and your users will have one less issue to complain about when migrating to Linux .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
You 've seen the iconic picture of a soldier with a cigarette dangling from his mouth , but that could soon be a thing of the past .
The Pentagon is considering a ban on the sale and use of tobacco in the military .
A new study commissioned by the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs recommends a complete ban on tobacco , which would end tobacco sales on military bases and prohibit smoking by anyone in uniform , not even combat troops in the thick of battle .
According to the study , tobacco use impairs military readiness in the short term .
Over the long term , it can cause serious health problems , including lung cancer and cardiovascular disease .
The study also says smokeless tobacco use can lead to oral and pancreatic cancer .
The Defense Department 's top health officials are studying the report 's suggestions and will make recommendations to the Pentagon 's policy team and Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
The study recommends phasing out tobacco products such as cigarettes and cigars over a five- to 10 - year period .
However , the suggested ban does not sit well with many in uniform , including retired Gen.
Russel Honore , best known for coordinating military relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina - affected areas with an ever - present stogie .
He said soldiers at war need to puff .
" When you 're tired and you 've been going days on end with minimum sleep , and you are not getting the proper meals on time , that hit of tobacco can make a difference , " said Honore , who was in charge of the Army 's training programs before he retired .
Other soldiers questioned whether this was a good time to stamp out smoking , given the Army 's concern with a high suicide rate .
" For some , unfortunately , they feel that smoking is their stress relief .
Well if you take it away , what is the replacement ? " said Sgt. 1st Class Gary Johnson .
The Pentagon supports the goal of a tobacco - free military , said spokeswoman Cynthia Smith .
" However , achieving that goal will depend on coincident reductions of tobacco use in the civilian population , " she said .
Dr. Ken Kizer , the author of the study , found that civilians do n't smoke as much as soldiers .
One in three active duty soldiers smoke , he said , adding that among the general population , that number is less than one in five .
The Pentagon banned smoking in buildings on bases years ago .
It has counselors on call to help service members quit .
But while local governments have heavily taxed tobacco , the commissaries often sell it at deeply discounted prices .
" The military sends very mixed signals , " Kizer said .
" This is what 's confusing to people . "
The study found that profits from those tobacco sales -- $ 80 million to $ 90 million -- often pay for recreation and family programs on base .

Here , our democracy is being held hostage by our capitalism .
— Nina McCoy , high school teacher , Martin County , KY
The national broadcast media rarely grapples with the interplay of concentrated wealth and power and the functioning of democracy when it attempts to explain the widespread , stubborn poverty in rural Central Appalachia .
The recent ABC 20/20 program The Hidden America — Children of the Mountains which followed for two years four children growing up in poverty in Eastern Kentucky , drew 11 million viewers .
According to ABC “ thousands offered to get involved and make a difference . ”
This was n’t the first network spotlight on Appalachia ’s children to evoke a strong reaction .
Charles Kuralt ’s Christmas in Appalachia , which aired in December 1964 and focused on eastern Kentucky , lit up the CBS switchboard with offers of help .
Both of these documentaries attempted to interpret a piece of the poverty puzzle by putting faces on poverty and showing how poverty is lived at the level of individual and family relationships .
Inevitably unemployment , lack of education , poor health care , drug addiction , and inadequate housing are the reasons given by the networks for why there is persistent poverty in Appalachia .
What they do n’t attempt to explain is the century - old political / economic famework in which this individual poverty plays out .
University of New Hampshire sociologist Cynthia Duncan , who has spent her career studying rural poverty , refers to this context as “ these larger histories of deliberate underinvestment for control , to maintain vulnerability . ”
Appalachia ’s rural poor have been put under sociological and psychological microscopes many times over the last 150 years .
Basically , two theories have been offered for their poverty .
The culture of poverty theory directs attention inward to the capacities and habits of the poor themselves .
In contrast , a structural theory focuses attention on the relationship between poverty and the corporate economy within Appalachia – especially in its coal regions .
Appalachian sociologist Helen Lewis drew a sharp dividing line between the two theories by stating , “ In simple terms it [ the cause of poverty ] is either fatalism or the coal industry . ”

Kentucky attorney and author Harry Caudill began raising a warning about the region ’s uneasy relationship with the coal industry in his 1963 book Night Comes to the Cumberlands .
Despite some cultural stereotypes that upset regional activists and a good many of his neighbors , Caudill ’s popular book , more than any other vehicle at the time , moved the poverty discussion from folk culture to issues of absentee corporate control of the region ’s land and minerals .
Caudill ’s work opened the door for a flood of young academics and activists to look at the political economy of the region and the cozy relationship between the dominant industry and the public officials shaping economic , tax , and environmental policy .
A theory centering on coal as a major contributor to poverty in the Appalachian coal region looks something like this :
The region ’s immense wealth found in timber and coal has never benefitted local communities because it is owned largely by out - of - state corporate interests , resulting in the region ’s wealth being transferred to urban centers outside the region .
Despite extensive land and mineral holdings , the coal industry historically paid a pittance in taxes , leaving the region deprived of basic municipal services and adequately - funded schools .

After establishing central Appalachia as predominantly a one - industry economy , the coal industry mechanized , destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs and leaving the unemployed with few alternatives but to flee the region or stay and live with intermittent or no formal employment .
To expand profit margins , coal companies increased strip - mining and mountain top removal techniques , further reducing jobs and leaving the region a legacy of economic and environmental ruin .
Taken together , these factors help to explain poor people in a rich land .
This is not to suggest that coal is the only reason for poverty in Central Appalachia .
Poverty is prevalent in areas without extractive industries as well .
In fact , 80 % of the world ’s population exists on less than $ 10 a day so worldwide , prosperity is more of an aberration than poverty .
Legendary urbanist and economist Jane Jacobs suggested that “ to seek the ‘ causes ’ of poverty …is to enter an intellectual dead end because poverty has no causes .
Only prosperity has causes . ”
Even if Jacobs is correct , there are conditions and policies that exacerbate or ameliorate the impact of poverty and to depict poverty without taking into account structural issues related to the political economy is to present what Appalachia historian Ron Eller refers to as “ a pattern of critical but superficial commentary ” about the region .
With even a cursory glance , socioeconomic data on eastern Kentucky paints a dramatic picture of a connection between coal country and poverty .
The two dozen coal producing counties consistently have the highest overall poverty rates , the highest percentage of children in poverty , lowest median income , the lowest high school graduation rates in the state and a substance abuse problem that is eroding the area ’s social and economic fabric .
A more focused look at the history of the eastern Kentucky coal region illuminates in greater detail the impact of coal on the Central Appalachian economy .

Losing the minerals
By the mid 1800s eastern industrialists realized that eastern Kentucky was abundantly rich in timber and coal .
The timber industry moved in first , removing virtually all of eastern Kentucky ’s virgin timber by the early 1900s .
In the 1880s John C.C. Mayo , a Paintsville , Kentucky , school teacher , began buying mineral rights and selling them for three or four times his purchase price , eventually receiving backing from industrialists .
After 20 years Mayo had obtained mineral rights for thousands upon thousands of acres , often persuading landowners to part with their timber and coal for as little as 10 cents an acre or as much as a dollar an acre for the more resistant land owners .
At the time of his death , Mayo was alleged to be the wealthiest man in Kentucky .
Although Mayo is the most famous , there were others buying mineral rights at the time as well and it should be noted that many of these mineral leases were shrouded in controversy from the outset .
Due to a variety of uncoordinated titling processes coupled with unscrupulous land speculation practices , it is said , only half jokingly , that more land was titled in Kentucky than existed .
Additionally , the validity of many conveyances was questioned when mineral buyers possessed mineral deeds “ signed ” with a surface owner ’s mark or X when the surface owner could read and write , raising questions whether the land owner had been involved in the deal at all .
Dubious title or not , with the coming of the railroad , the lease holders began to exploit their leases .
The broadform deed , which allowed large - scale strip mining on leases signed nearly a century before , was finally overturned by Kentucky voters in 1988 .
The citizens ’ group Kentuckians for the Commonwealth led the campaign to restrict the use of these deeds to allow stripping .

Much of the minerals were obtained through a conveyance called the broad form deed .
This type of deed , which would later become the center of great controversy , allowed the mineral owner to extract coal or other minerals by any means “ necessary or convenient . ”
While other states construed the broad form deed to refer only to coal extraction methods existing at the time the deed was executed , Kentucky courts would rule that the broad form deed allowed large - scale , mechanized strip mining , a practice inconceivable in the late 1800s .
This ruling allowed coal companies to destroy surface land even if the surface owner objected .
It took an amendment to the state constitution in 1988 to change this law .
Dependence on King Coal
From its entry into Central Appalachia , the coal industry controlled virtually every aspect of miners ’ lives .
The companies built the coal camps .
They owned the houses miners lived in and frequently the stores where they shopped .
The companies hired the doctors who tended their workers and , until outlawed , they paid miners partially or totally in scrip that could be used only at stores owned by the coal company .
Miners , historians report , were frequently expected to vote as the company wanted .
Dependency and vulnerability go a long way toward fostering loyalty .
This is not to deny the importance of well - documented and frequently corrupt political machines at the county level .
These machines , often dominated by one or two families , used control over federal work and commodity programs along with county job patronage to create a power base .
As long as they did nothing to damage coal ’s economic interests there was little interference from the industry .
In fact , some local political leaders became involved in the coal business so that political and economic interests overlapped .
Coal has always been afflicted with dramatic boom and bust cycles and in the early days even the good times could be precarious .
The 1950s brought an even more dramatic downturn .
The 1950 wage agreement between the coal industry and the United Mine Workers of America allowed the rapid mechanization of the mines , which both sides knew would drastically reduce the number of mining jobs .
For this concession the remaining union miners were to receive increased wages as productivity increased with mechanization .
Because these terms were imposed upon all operators regardless of the size of the operation , the result – and most would say the intended result — was to drive out the small mines , leaving the large companies in control of the market .
The 1950 agreement , combined with the widespread conversion of home heating to oil and gas along with the railroads ’ move to diesel fuel , devastated the Central Appalachian job market .
Kentucky historians Lowell Harrison and James Klotter in A New History of Kentucky report that between 1950 and 1965 mechanization accounted for the loss of 70 % of Kentucky ’s underground mining jobs .
Between 1950 and 1960 there was a net out - migration from Kentucky ’s Appalachian counties of 340,000 people , 32 % of the area ’s population .
A final seismic jolt to mining jobs and the Central Appalachian landscape began in the 1970s as surface mining gained a permanent foothold in coal extraction thanks in great part to a partnership between the industry and the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) .
TVA ’s early accomplishments and the widespread loyalty engendered by those accomplishments were hardly a harbinger of policies to come .
In its early days , TVA hired miners blacklisted for union activity , built dams that averted devastating flood damage estimated at twice the cost of dam construction , planted two hundred million trees , created parks and recreation areas , and brought electricity to homes and factories in rural areas .
Protests of coal strip mining have been going on for nearly 50 years .

As early as the mid 1950s , however , TVA began shaping the path for strip mining ’s dramatic growth in what Appalachian journalist Jim Branscome would later refer to as “ TVA ’s bitter harvest . ”
Reporting in the 1970s for the weekly Mountain Eagle newspaper in Whitesburg , Kentucky , Branscome documented how the agency gave strip mining a foothold in the region by providing long - term contracts for surface mined coal , by its willingness to buy non-union coal , and by building mine - mouth steam plants on or near strip mines .
TVA became the nation ’s largest coal buyer , with 72 % of its coal coming from Kentucky , half of it from strip mines .
Additionally , 83 % of the coal was supplied by a dozen companies , all owned by oil or metal conglomerates .
Many coalfield residents must have felt that the TVA experiment , which historian Henry Steele Commager once called the “ greatest peacetime achievement of twentieth - century America , ” had gone extraordinarily awry .
In 1920 , 784,000 miners in the U.S. produced a little over 658 millions tons of coal .
By 2006 , only 82,595 U.S. miners ( 14,000 in eastern Kentucky ) were needed to produce over 1 billion tons of coal .
While the United Mine Workers of America at one time represented 75 % of U.S. miners , today the union represents about 28.5 % of the nation ’s miners .
There is not one coal miner working under a UMWA contract in Eastern Kentucky .
The Impact of Land Ownership
Land ownership is n’t usually offered as a mitigating factor in Appalachian poverty , but ownership of surface and minerals determines where people live and where they work and whether land is destroyed or preserved , polluted or left pristine .
In Appalachia , ownership is directly related to who has power and how that power is exercised .
A startling example of the power of land ownership occurred in April 1977 when major flooding , exacerbated by strip mining practices , left thousands homeless in southern West Virginia and southeastern Kentucky .
Relief trailers stood empty for lack of land to put them on and the government refused to seize corporate land for this purpose .
Out of this tragedy , however , a region - wide coalition , the Appalachian Alliance , formed and put the question of land ownership high on its agenda .
With support from private foundations and the Appalachian Regional Commission , the Alliance initiated the Appalachian Land Ownership Study in 1979 .
It remains one of the few efforts to explore land ownership patterns and their impacts on economic and community development .
It is the only one that focused on such a broad area of the Appalachian region ( covering 80 counties in 6 states ) , coordinated and carried out by activists , academics , and community residents .
The study was released in April 1981 and the findings were stark :
Of the 13 million acres included in the survey , nearly 75 percent of the surface acres and 80 percent of the minerals were absentee owned .
Forty percent of the land and 70 percent of the mineral rights were held by corporations – mostly coal and other energy companies along with some timber interests .
One percent of the owners controlled 53 percent of the land .
The link between land control and longstanding problems with insufficient local tax revenues and public services became evident when the study revealed that 53 percent of the land generated only 13 percent of the property taxes .
The situation in Martin County , Kentucky , is particularly instructive .
Long one of the poorest counties in the nation , it was here in 1964 that President Lyndon Johnson declared his “ war on poverty ” from Tom Fletcher ’s front porch .
While poverty rates in Martin County have dropped from 56 percent at the time of Johnson ’s visit to 35.8 % in 2007 , it remains one of the nation ’s poorest counties .
Transfer payments represent 39 % of personal income in the county .
Nationally in 2002 , transfer payments amount to 14 % of personal income .
At the time of the Land Ownership Study , not only were Martin County ’s residents poor , local government was starving .
The county ’s largest landowner was Pocahontas - Kentucky , a subsidiary of the Norfolk and Western Railroad , which owned 47,869 acres or one - third of the county ’s surface and over half its minerals .
Despite its vast ownership , however , the taxes the company paid on its surface land would have been about enough to buy one school bus for the county school system .
The tax bill for its mineral holdings – the real wealth in the land — was $ 76 , maybe enough to buy one tire for that school bus — a tire likely needed to replace one worn out from negotiating local roads badly damaged by heavy coal truck traffic .
Despite being the state ’s second leading coal producer , the county had no hospital , no sewage system , an inadequate water system , bad roads , and old school buildings in dire need of repair .
Given these conditions , it ’s not surprising then that in the 1980s some coal county schools assigned homework to be done in class because there were n’t enough books ( outdated books at that ) for students to take home .
Allowing time for homework in class , of course , reduces the time for teaching .
Having the largest property owners virtually exempt from taxation created innumerable problems for school systems .
The land study ’s findings stirred the press across the region .
The Louisville Courier - Journal called for legislation against “ this economic colonialism , ” The Nashville Tennessean called the situation “ an outrage , ” and the Charleston ( WV ) Gazette demanded : “ End the exploitation . ”
Is it any wonder why regional activists and public thinkers puzzle over network news specials on Appalachia that repeat the statistics about poor schools , high dropout rates and poor health , yet never mention this more complete explanation about why these conditions exist ?
Paying the price of others ’ prosperity
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Appalachia has been sacrificed to fuel the nation ’s prosperity and development .
The poverty , the bad health , the drug abuse and bad schools are the costs of coal that are n’t reflected in the price of electricity .
Harry Caudill warned over 45 years ago that these costs are ultimately paid when he advised that the nation “ cannot afford to leave large islands of its own population behind , stranded , and ignored … an anchor dragging behind the rest of America . ”
Unfortunately , stereotypes of mountain residents , often reinforced by television and film images , have hindered a productive response to these external costs .
With stereotypes , utility trumps accuracy .
University of Kentucky historian Ron Eller points out that stereotypes are very useful to those in power because they can be used to justify exploitation of those with little power .
And here lies the rub .
While sacrifice areas are easier to live with if they are invisible , merely shining a light on broken , addicted , poverty stricken lives does n’t illuminate the larger story of how these conditions became widespread and persistent .
Showing these conditions is n’t the same thing as informing the decisions necessary to shape productive energy policy and rural economic development strategies .
The growing economic divide between Appalachia ’s coal counties and nearby cities reflects a growing economic disparity around the nation .
Yet they are n’t the only rural places to be falling behind .
The U. S. Government now recognizes the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota as the poorest community in the nation .
The South is the only region in the nation where low income students account for a majority of public school students .
The colonias of South Texas , home to 400,000 Hispanic Americans , have only recently obtained access to water lines and safe sewage disposal .
The richest 1 percent of Americans possesses more wealth than the combined wealth of the bottom 90 percent .
Appalachia is testimony that unless the uninhibited pursuit of self - interest is tempered by recognition of a common interest , our democracy may well collapse under the weight of intolerable inequities .
With a popularly accessible public discourse on economic , political and environmental issues , perhaps the nation could begin to grapple with the question of its obligation to Central Appalachia and other rural areas in the nation like it , for there are many .
The iPhone has proved extremely popular
The popularity of Apple 's iPhone is continuing to buck the fall in global mobile phone sales , a study has found .
Shipments of the iPhone totalled 5.2 million units between April and June , a six - fold increase on a year earlier , according to Strategy Analytics .
This compares with an industry - wide decline of 8 % to 273 million units .
While sector - wide sales were down for the third consecutive quarter , the rate of decline slowed from the - 14 % recorded in the first quarter of 2009 .
Mixed picture
Apple was not the only manufacturer to see sales rise during the latest quarter .
PHONE MARKET SHARE Nokia 37.8 % Samsung 19.2 % LG 10.9 % Motorola 5.4 % Sony Ericsson 5.1 % Others 21.6 % Source : Strategy Analytics
Shipments at Samsung were up 14 % from a year earlier to 52.3 million units , while LG rose 8 % to 29.8 million .
However , Nokia saw shipments decline 15 % to 103.2 million handsets , Sony Ericsson fell 43 % to 13.8 million , and Motorola shipments dropped 47 % to 14.8 million .
The report came as Motorola reported an unexpected profit for its second quarter ending on 4 July .
The firm made a net profit of $ 26 m ( £ 16 m ) , up from $ 4 m a year earlier , thanks to major cost reductions including 8,000 job cuts so far this year .
Market stabilising
Despite the iPhone 's strong rise in sales , Strategy Analytics said it still has only a 2 % share of the global market .
This compares with the 37.8 % stake held by market leader Nokia .
Samsung remains in second place on 19.2 % , followed by LG on 10.9 % , Motorola on 5.4 % , and Sony Ericsson at 5.1 % .
Strategy Analytics said the global mobile phone market was now " showing signs of stabilisation " .
" The worst of the handset recession may be behind us , " it said .
Egypt's Christians face fresh attacks and legal battles
Concern is growing for Christians in Egypt following another attack on the homes of Coptic Christians .
And a legal battle is taking place in Egypt to overturn a court ruling which denies the right of citizens to change their religious identity on their ID cards .
Former Muslims who have become Christians and who want to change the religion shown on their ID cards have been driven into hiding , along with their families and threatened with death .
" Many Muslim scholars issued a fatwa , saying I must be killed , " says Mohammed Hegazy in the latest edition of World Update on the Persecuted Church by Release International .
" On television , people were saying if they meet me on the streets , they will kill me .
Many fatwas have come up saying I must be killed . "
Mohammed and his wife and daughter are now in hiding .
His wife has been threatened with death because she married a convert to Christianity .
Mohammed took the unprecedented step of going to court to change his religion from Islam to Christianity on his national ID card – but the court ruled against him .
He says he has been arrested and tortured to try to get him to reveal the names of his Christian contacts .
A second convert to Christianity has been driven into hiding after an Egyptian court refused him permission to change his religious status .
According to news agency Compass Direct , a court body , the State Council , declared his request to be a threat to social order and a violation of Sharia law .
Under the strictest interpretations of Sharia El - Gohary is regarded as an apostate who should be put to death .
Extremists have taken it upon themselves to carry out that ‘ sentence ’ .
Maher has been attacked on the street , subject to death threats and driven into hiding .
He says he intends to appeal against the court ’s decision .
" What could be more basic to our very humanity than the freedom to choose our own religion ? " asks Andy Dipper , the CEO of Release International .
" And what right could any court have to deny that basic human freedom ?
Egypt must grant full religious freedom to its citizens , recognise and accept their personal choices - and protect its people from mob rule and vigilantes who consider themselves above the law . "
Meanwhile , in the latest attack against Coptic Christians a mob torched and looted Christian homes and shops after a Muslim student was killed in a fight , according to Religious Intelligence .
Following the funeral of the 19 - year - old , a mob chanting ‘ Allah Akhbar ’ stoned and set fire to the houses of Christians in Meet El Korashy .
The US Commission on International Religious Freedom described the latest incident as " another upsurge of violence against Coptic Christians " , and called on the government to do more to protect them .
According to the Canadian Coptic Association there were more than 70 attacks against Copts in 2008 .
Through its international network of missions Release supports Christians imprisoned for their faith and their families in 30 nations .

Puzzles are a new abstraction for doing register allocation .
This page describes the program representation called elementary form , and shows that doing register allocation in elementary programs is equivalent to solving some types of puzzles .
There are many advantages in this approach : puzzles can be solved in polynomial time , we can convert any program into elementary form , and elementary programs never require more registers than the original program .
When we compile a program , we must find locations to store the values used in that program .
The compiler has basically two options : either it places the values in memory , or it puts them into registers .
Registers in general are better , because they tend to be much faster than memory .
The problem is that they come in small number ...
Thus , register allocation is basically this problem of trying to map registers to variables .
The constraint , in this case , is the live ranges of the variables .
The live range of a variable is the set of program points where that variable is live , that is , it is the set of program points between the instruction that defines the variable , until all the instructions that use that variable .
For instance , here we have a program , without branches , so it is a straight line piece of code , and the live ranges of the variables are the colored bars .
In the right of the figure we have the registers .
Let 's assume that we are targeting an architecture with register pairs .
This means that two small registers combine to form a big register .
For example , register X is formed by register XH , its higher half , and register XL , its lower half .
We may notice that some variables are thick , like B and E .
They must be stored into a big register .
The other variables are thin , and they can be stores into a half .
And here we have a solution for this allocation problem .
The empty bars represent the state of the registers at different times during the program execution .
This solution is optimal , in the sense that we cannot use less than three registers to solve this program .
By the way , this problem is NP - complete ( Lee'07 ) .
That is , if we have a bunch of lines like this , the problem of packing them into registers is NP - complete .
If the lines had all the same width , then we could do this in polynomial time .
But there is a sad thing going on here .
Towards the end of the program , variables a and d , green and red , end up occupying different registers , even though they would fit into the same register .
Because of this , the thick variable E had to be placed into a third register .
Our abstraction allows to solve this problem !
So , what do we propose ?
Well , to facilitate solving the register allocation problem , we propose to do some very aggressive form of live range splitting .
The idea is that , if live ranges are shorter , it is easier to fit them into registers .
So , to do register allocation , we will adopt a different program representation .
We call this representation Elementary - Form .
It is not new : Appel and George used elementary - form in their register allocator based on integer linear programming ( Appel '01 ) .
The good thing about this representation is that live ranges are very , very small .
If you see in the figure , each live range contains at most two program points , where a program point is the point between two consecutive instructions .
Here we have the result of the register allocation .
We are using only two registers , whereas before we needed three .
One curious thing is the allocation of ' a ' .
It starts assigned to register XH , but then , before the second to last instruction , 'a ' is moved to another register , in this case YL .
This allocation is optimal .
We can prove that , if the live ranges are always so small , we can always find the optimal allocation in polynomial time .
Of course , there is no free lunch , and to move variables around registers , sometimes we have to insert some instructions in the target code .
This copy , marked in gray here , was inserted to move variable 'a ' .
In essence , what we are proposing is a new abstraction to deal with register allocation .
We call our abstraction puzzles .
Roughly , we will be producing one puzzle per program instruction .
We have highlighted one puzzle in the figure .
The puzzle board is given by the register bank .
In this example , the board has three areas , each one divided into two columns and two rows .
The pieces of our puzzle are given by the program variables .
For example , the highlighted puzzle has four pieces .
We have some rules about where to put pieces .
The brown piece , representing variable ' B ' , can be placed only on the upper row of the area .
We are free to choose which area though .
The little red piece , representing variable ' d ' , can only be inserted somewhere in the lower row .
The green and orange pieces span both rows .
They occupy only one column though .
The good thing is that we can solve puzzles optimally in polynomial time , even if some areas of the puzzle are initially taken .
Also , any program can be placed into elementary form , and , on the good side , the elementary program will never require more registers than the original program !
A puzzle consists of a board and a set of pieces .
The challenge is to fit all the pieces on the board .
Pieces cannot overlap , and some pieces are already placed on the board .
Every puzzle board has a number of separate areas , where each area is divided into two rows of squares .
We have identified three types of puzzles that are important for register allocation .
We call them Type - 0 , Type - 1 and Type - 2 .
The type of a puzzle is determined by its board , and the shape of its pieces .
Type - 0 puzzles are very simple : each area has only one column .
It contains only three types of pieces , that we will call Y , X and Z .
We can place a X - piece on any square in the upper row , we can place a Z - piece on any square in the lower row , and we can place a Y - piece on any column .
The algorithm to solve type - 0 puzzles is very trivial , so we leave it for the reader as an assignment .
Type - 1 puzzles have areas with two columns , and six different kinds of pieces .
The rules here are similar to type - 0 : X pieces go into the upper row , Z pieces go into the lower row .
However , we have some thicker pieces now .
A piece that spans two columns must be completely inside an area .
This means that we can not put half a piece in an area , and half in another area .
We will describe a linear - time algorithm to solve type - 1 puzzles later .
Type - 2 puzzles have areas with four columns , and nine types of pieces .
The only thing special here is that pieces of width two must be placed either on the first half of an area , or on the second half .
Solving type - 2 puzzles is still an open - problem .
The question that someone may be asking now is what determines the type of a register allocation puzzle ; and the answer is : the bank of registers .
The possibility of grouping registers into pairs , or quadruples gives the number of columns in the puzzle board .
Two registers alias if assigning a value to one can change the other .
In PowerPC we have no aliasing : each register has just one name , so , the register bank of PowerPC produces a type - 0 puzzle .
The same is true about the integer registers in ARM .
On the other hand , consider the floating point registers of ARM .
We have either single precision registers or double precision registers .
Two single precision combine to make a double precision , and then we have the two columns in each area of a type - 1 puzzle .
Type - 2 puzzles are more rare .
An example is found in the floating point bank of Ultra - Sparc .
In Sparc v8 we have single , double and quadruple precision floating point registers .
So , the areas of our puzzle would have four columns .
One point that must be made clear is that each column in an area has a name in the register bank of the target architecture .
So , because in PowerPC we have registers R0 to R31 , that is how the columns in a PowerPC puzzle are called .
In the same way , because in ARM the floating point registers S0 and S1 combine to form the double D0 , that is the name of the columns of the first area of a ARM puzzle .
We can have also hybrid puzzles , and the canonical example is the general purpose register bank of the 32 - bit X86 machine .
This is a hybrid of type - 0 and type - 1 .
The registers AX , BX , CX and DX give the type - 1 part .
Each of these registers is 16 - bits wide , and alias two 8 - bit registers .
For instance , AX alias AL , its lower part , and AH , its higher part .
What about the extended registers : EAX , EBX , etc ?
Those are 32 - bit registers .
So , AX and EAX are aliased , for instance .
Well , for all the purposes , we can treat AX and EAX as the same register , when solving puzzles , because they encompass the same pairs : AL and AH .
The registers BP , SI , DI and SP give the type - 0 part of the puzzle board .
These registers do not contain pairs .
To solve this type of puzzle , we can solve each part in separate .
That is , first we solve the type - 0 part , and after that , we solve the type - 1 part .
We are getting closer of talking about pieces and rows , but before , let 's define elementary - form , for that is where the pieces and rows come from .
Elementary - form is a program representation that is a subset of Static Single Assignment Form ( SSA - form to be short ) .
This representation had been used before .
Not with this name , but the idea was the same .
Maybe some of you will remember a paper that Andrew Appel and Lal George had in PLDI 2000 : the title was Optimal Spilling for CISC Machines with Few Registers .
In that paper they divided the program between each pair of consecutive instructions .
The idea was to allow a variable to be alive at some program points and not at others .
Any program can be converted into elementary form in three steps .
First we convert it to SSA - form .
Second , we convert the program to SSI - form ( Ananian '99 ) .
This is Static Single Information form .
SSI - form was the master thesis of Scott Ananian , from MIT .
The idea was to split the live range of variables when they leave a basic block .
SSI is a subset of SSA - form .
Then , after putting the program into SSI - form we get elementary form by inserting parallel copies between each pair of consecutive instructions , and then doing variable renaming .
Here we have a complete example .
In the left we have the original program .
This is a simple program , with four basic blocks .
Each program point is indicated in red .
In the right we have the same program in elementary form .
So , how do we get from the program in the left to the program in the right ?
First , to convert into SSA - form we had to rename variables that are defined more than once , and we have to insert phi-functions to joy live ranges that converge into the same basic block .
We inserted one phi-functio here , in green .
The next step is to convert the program to SSI - form .
So , every time the live range of a variable branches into two basic blocks , we have to redefine the variable at the beginning of each basic block .
We do this redefinition with pi-functions .
They are the duals of phi-functions .
That is , whereas the phi-function join the live ranges that represent the same variable , the pi-functions split the live ranges that represent the same variables .
The pi-functions , in this example , are colored in blue .
Finally , we add the parallel copies between pairs of consecutive instructions .
Here they are painted in red .
We rename the variables in and out of parallel copies .
After this step , each live range contains at most two program points .
We call the point between two consecutive instructions a program point .
The live range of a variable is the collection of program points where that variable is alive .
In elementary form , each live range includes at most two program points .
We will say that a variable is live - in at an instruction if its live range contains the program point that precedes that instruction .
Live - out if the live range contains the program point after the instruction .
For each instruction we will create a puzzle .
The board , as said before , is given by the register bank .
The pieces are given by the live ranges of the variables alive across that instruction .
If a live range of a variable ends at the instruction , it becomes a X piece .
If it starts at the instruction , then it becomes a Z piece .
If it goes through the instruction , then it becomes a Y piece .
The width of a piece depends on the size of the register necessary to store that variable .
For instance , in ARM the thick pieces would be doubles , and the thin pieces would be floats .
Here we have an example .
A , C and E are double - precision , and the other pieces are single - precision .
This instruction defines two variables , A and b , and these variables produce Z pieces .
The instruction also kills variables C and d , which become X pieces .
To put everything together , on the left we have the program in elementary form , and on the right we have the puzzles produced for this program .
In this example architecture we have only two registers , which are divided into pairs .
The register bank is illustrated in the upper part of the figure .
You may notice that two puzzles have some areas filled already .
This is because of pre-assigned registers .
Some conventions in the target architecture force some variables to be stored in particular registers .
An example is the division instruction in X86 .
Div requires the dividend to be in register AX .
The remainder is stored into AH , and the quotient is stored into AL .
Now , we face the problem of solving type - 1 puzzles .
Well , these are not very complicated puzzles , as each area has only four boxes that must be filled .
This means that the number of patterns in which you can fill an area is not too big .
In this figure we have listed all the different ways to fill up an area .
You may have realized that this figure is indeed a grammar .
This is our visual language for programming type - 1 puzzle solvers .
A program is a sequence of statements , as you can see in the first rule .
Each statement is either a rule 'r ' , or a conditional statement .
A rule is a pattern .
Patterns are determined by the pre-coloring of the area .
The gray boxes mark pre-colored boxes .
If you remember , we have pre-coloring because of the use of fixed registers in the source program .
Before we move on , let me point something out .
Our puzzle solving engine solves one area at a time .
It solves an area by filling it up with pieces .
For the program to work , the area of the pieces must equal the area of the empty boxes .
If the area of the pieces is greater , than we cannot solve the puzzle .
If the area of the pieces is smaller , we do some padding .
That means that we add some size - 1 pieces of type X and Z to the puzzle , until we have the same area .
A rule explains how to complete an area .
It works by pattern matching .
For instance , here at the left we have a rule .
It says that , if the puzzle contains an area where the upper - right corner is already filled , and the puzzle contains a size - 2 Z piece plus a size - 1 X piece , than we can complete the area .
So , we can apply this rule in the situation A , above in the Figure .
But we cannot apply this rule in situation B .
You see , the puzzle in B is solvable , but not by this rule , because the pieces are different , although the pattern is the same .
Also , we cannot apply this rule in situation C .
The problem now is that the patterns do not match .
So , this figure shows our puzzle solving engine .
Again , our algorithm solves one area completely at each time .
A puzzle solving program is a collection of statements .
In this example here , we have a program with two statements .
The second statement is a conditional .
It means that , when visiting an area , first we try to apply the first rule , and then the second .
All the rules in a conditional statement must have the same pattern .
Let 's see how this program does on this example puzzle here .
The solver iterates twice , once for each statement .
First , it tries to apply the rule in statement One .
We can do this in the first incomplete area of the puzzle .
We have an area where the pattern matches , and we have all the pieces that we need .
So , we apply the first rule , we complete the area and remove the pieces from the puzzle .
After we visit all the areas , trying to apply the first statement , if there are still pieces adrift , we go for the second statement .
The second statement matches the second area in the puzzle .
We can not use the first rule of the second statement , because the pieces do not match .
However , we can use the second , and so we do it .
There is no more statements to use , but also there is no more free pieces , and we are done .
What is the complexity of this solver .
Well , we have two loops , first we go over the statements in the solver , and for each statement we have to iterate on the unfilled areas .
But notice that the number of possible statements is bounded .
This implies that the first iteration will happen a constant number of times per puzzle solving program .
Then , the overall complexity is linear on the number of empty areas of the puzzle .
Of course , a program may not be able to solve a puzzle .
The same program used before would not solve this puzzle here .
The pattern in the first statement matches the empty area , but the pieces do not match .
So this program is stuck .
If a statement gets stuck , then we stop the solver , and report that there is no solution .
And here we have our puzzle solving program .
We have fifteen statements , each of which complete an area with a different pattern .
Because each area has four boxes , we can have sixteen different patterns , but one of them , the area complete filled , does not have to be taken into consideration .
So , what is the rationale for ordering the statements like this ?
You see , first we have to try to fill all the areas that have already three boxes pre-colored , then two boxes in diagonal , and so on .
What is this ordering based upon ?
In a way , we solve the most constrained areas first .
The ordering is indeed very important : if you change it , the program may no longer work , as we will show in some examples .
Let 's see how this program works .
On the top here we have a puzzle with three areas , and five pieces .
To solve this puzzle , we must go over each statement in my program .
The first five statements do not match any of the areas , but the sixth does .
We can use statement six to solve the third area , because we have the pieces available .
Statement six only applies in one area , and after applying it , we can move on to the next statement .
Statement seven matches the first area , and we have the big X piece available , so we can fill that area .
Statements 8 , 9 and 10 do not produce any match , but statement 11 does .
We cannot use the first rule , because we do not have the pieces , but we can use the second .
After that , there is no pieces to be placed , and we are done
The next four slides show some subtleties on the ordering of our puzzle solving program .
First , in statement seven you see that we must try to use a size - 2 X piece before we try to use two size - 1 X pieces .
If we did otherwise , we could get stuck , as in this example here .
When we have a size - 2 X piece , it is always better to try to inserted in into an area with the upper row already filled .
This is what statement seven says .
Because we statements seven to ten come before 11 to 14 , this will always happen .
However , if we applied statement 11 before statement seven we could get a stuck puzzle .
The areas with the gray box are more constrained , so they should be solved first .
That is way statements 11 to 14 come before statement 15 .
If that were not the case , we could get unnecessarily stuck , as we show here in the example .
In this case , we should save the Y pieces for the areas with the gray boxes .
Because we did not do this , we got stuck .
Our last counter - example .
This one here is quite subtle .
Statements 11 to 14 are conditionals .
They have three rules each , and these rules really must be applied in the order that they were specified .
For instance , here , we solve the first area with a size - 2 X piece .
If , instead , we had used the size - 2 Y piece , we would get stuck .
So , even though these seem like symmetric arrangements , they are not .
The point is that a size - 2 X piece is more constrained : it cannot move inside an area , whereas the size - 2 Y piece can .
So , we should always try to get rid of size - 2 X pieces before eleminating size - 2 Y pieces .
We do not elaborate much on the theory behind the puzzles , but this theory certainly exists .
Our long paper contains three main theorems dealing with type - 1 puzzles , that we prove in the extended version of the paper .
The first is an equivalence theorem , where we show that puzzle solving is indeed equivalent to register allocation with aliasing and pre-colored registers .
The second theorem states that the program that we use to proof type - 1 puzzles is correct .
The main technique to proof that this theorem is right is based on swaps of pieces .
Basically we assume that the puzzle has a solution , and show how , by swapping pieces we can get from the solution to the solution stated by the puzzle solver .
The third theorem combines the first two to show that we can find an optimal register assignment in time proportional to the number of registers times the size of the program .
Now you may be wondering how spilling plays a role in our abstraction .
Sometimes we do not have enough registers , and then some variables must be sent to memory .
This is called spilling .
In our implementation of the puzzle based register allocator we visit each instruction only once .
If we can solve the puzzle of that instruction , than that is it , and we move on to the next instruction .
However , if we cannot solve the puzzle , we must choose a piece and send it to memory .
Then we must solve the puzzle again .
We repeat this process until we get a solvable puzzle .
The question now is which piece to remove .
Well , first of all , we can not remove X or Z pieces .
These pieces are used in the instruction that underlies the puzzle .
So , we must remove a Y piece , and we choose that one that is the farthest to be used .
This is called the Belady 's heuristics , and it is used in the linear scan register allocator .
Once a piece is removed , we do not have to consider that variable in future puzzles , as long as the variable is not used in any instruction .
If we have to reload a variable , then we keep it in registers , until we have to spill it again , or we no longer need it .
Of course , our approach is a heuristics .
Finding which variables to remove in order to minimize the number of loads and stores in the target program is a NP - complete problem , as we state in another theorem in the paper .
Another point that is important in register allocation is coalescing .
That is , we must try to allocate pieces that represent the same variable into the same register along successive instructions .
That is because if a piece gets assigned to a register in one puzzle , and a different register in the next puzzle , then we will have to insert some copy or swap to keep the program correct .
The problem of finding a register assignment that minimizes the number of copies in the whole program is NP - complete .
However , from one puzzle to the other we can do much better .
If the puzzle contains no pre-coloring , then finding a register assignment that minimizes the number of copies can be done in polynomial time .
If we have pre-coloring , then we do not know the complexity class , and we use a best - effort strategy .
So , in our implementation we traverse the dominator tree of the source program .
The solution of a puzzle is guided by the solution of the previous puzzle .
We call this local coalescing .
We do not do much for global coalescing , that is , minimizing the number of copies in the whole program , because this problem is NP - complete , and we were implementing a fast register allocator .
But there is nothing that prevents a different register allocator of using more advanced strategies and global information to solve the puzzles .
So , lets wrap it up by showing how our running example can be solved using puzzles .
We have seven puzzles , and we solve them in the order indicated by the numbers in gold .
There are two things that we should say here .
First , you see that from one puzzle to the other we can do a good job by assigning registers to pieces in such a way to avoid inserting copies between puzzles .
The second is that , because we do not use global information , we had to insert two new instructions in the program .
This copy in the right basic block , and the swap at the end of the left basic block .
If we were using global information , like the interference graph of variables , we would avoid assigning variable A to register AX , because of the precolored area in puzzles 2 and 3 .
But in this case we would have to build the interference graph , and the algorithm would be a slower .
Now , lets talk about some experiments .
We compared four different register allocators , all of them implemented in LLVM , version 1.9 .
LLVM is a very nice compiler framework .
It is used , for instance , as a JIT compiler in Mac OS 1.5 .
Besides the puzzle solver , the other algorithms that we have used were an extended version of linear scan , a graph coloring algorithm and an exponential time algorithm called PBQP .
The extended version of linear scan is used by LLVM as the default register allocator .
It fast , and produces good code .
It fills roles in the live ranges of variables with other variables , and it backtracks if spills happen .
The other algorithms were implemented by our friends from the university of Sidney : Lang Hames and Bernhard Scholtz .
We have done a lot of testing .
LLVM provides a benchmark suite that , together with SPEC CPU 2000 gave us about 1.3 million lines of C code .
We will be showing the results for SPEC 2000 .
This is about 600 K lines of C code .
LLVM does some inlining , and the assembly code in general tends to be quite big ..
This table shows which types of puzzles we had to deal with .
We call 16 or 32 - bit values long , and 8 - bit values short .
Remember that the long values produce the pieces spanning two columns .
You may notice that SPEC does not use 8 - bit values that often .
A little more than half the puzzles had only long values .
Also , there were many empty puzzles , that is , puzzles which have a board and no pieces .
The board may contain some pre-coloring .
About one third of the puzzles had shorts and longs .
This graph here shows compilation time .
We are comparing the puzzle solver with the extended version of linear scan used by LLVM .
The bars show the time of linear scan , and they are normalized to the puzzle solver .
The blue bar gives the time of the register assignment phase only , while the red bar gives the full compilation time .
On the average , both algorithms have very similar compilation time .
The puzzle solver is less than 2 % slower than LLVM ’s default algorithm .
When considering total compilation time , the difference is about 3 % .
The increase is because of the extra-phase to remove critical edges and to eliminate phi-functions .
Here we compare the static number of loads and stores that each algorithm inserted into the code .
The bars are normalized to the puzzle solver .
The code produced by the puzzle solver had fewer memory accesses than the other algorithms , although the difference with PBQP was very small .
This chart here shows the number of move instructions inserted by the puzzle solver .
On the average we had to insert one move per about each 14 instructions .
The blue part of the bars shows the moves inserted between consecutive puzzles inside the same basic bloc , and the red part shows the moves and swaps inserted during SSA - elimination , when we had to replace phi-functions with move instructions .
This is our last chart .
It compares the execution time of the the code produced by each algorithm .
One thing to notice is that the difference between the algorithms is very small .
This is because the algorithms are already very good , and it is difficult to improve much on performance , given how good they were .
Yet , the puzzle solver is only slower than PBQP , that takes much longer compilation time .
These bars are normalized with GCC - O3 .
One thing that we realized is that the puzzle solver tends to produce faster code in programs that have sparce control flow graph .
For programs with big basic blocks it is very , very good .
For programs with switch statements it does not do so well .
Now , before closing , lets just give a glimpse on the theory of register allocation by puzzle solving .
The interference graph of an elementary program is called an elementary graphs .
Elementary graphs are very simple .
Each connected component of an elementary graph is a clique substitution of P3 .
There is an example here at the right .
The interference graph for our running program is given below here .
Different representations of programs produce different interference graphs .
General programs have general interference graphs .
That is , since the early eighties we know that any graph is the interference graph of some general program .
If we impose some restrictions on our representation , we can get smaller classes of graphs .
For instance , SSA - form programs have chordal interference graphs .
This is known since 2005 .
If the program is in SSI form , than its interference graph is an interval graph .
Interval graphs are a subfamily of the chordal graphs .
Finally , if the program is in elementary form , its interference graph is called an elementary graph .
Elementary graphs are a subfamily of the interval graphs .
This hierarchy is shown in the Figure here .
Register assignment can be modeled by different instances of the graph coloring problem .
The general register assignment problem , that is , given a program , what is the minimal number of registers necessary to compile it , has polynomial solution for SSA - form programs , because coloring chordal graphs is solvable in polynomial time .
If I have pre-colored registers , then the the closer problem is called pre-coloring extension .
I have a graph , with some nodes pre-colored , and I want to extend this coloring to the full graph .
This problem is NP - complete for chordal and interval graphs , but it has polynomial time solution for elementary graphs .
Also , if I have register pairs , the equivalent problem is coloring of weighted graphs with weights of 1 and 2 .
This is polynomial for elementary graphs , but is NP - complete for the other classes .
The combination of these two problems , pre-coloring extension and weighted coloring is polynomial for elementary graphs , and the algorithm is the puzzle solving approach that we gave in this presentation .
The Office - Personas
Just for kicks I wrote a script for The Office .
You can read the whole thing at http://www.defectiveyeti.com/theoffice/TheOffice-Personas.pdf.
I was inspired by two events , both of which took place in March .
The first was an eight - hour Project Management seminar that I attended for work .
At the end of the day I was reviewing my notes and realized I 'd been handed an Office storyline .
The second was the series finale of Battlestar Galactica .
As followers of The Office know , Dwight is a huge Battlestar fan , mentioning the program often .
I half - expected a subsequent episode of The Office to note the end of Battlestar , but it has n't happened yet .
Thus , I decided to write my own .
" Personas " is set around the time in season five of The Office when BSG ended .
Specifically , it falls between " Golden Ticket " ( S05E17 ) and " New Boss " ( S05E18 ) .
In other words :
Andy is on staff .
Toby is back .
Ryan is missing ( supposedly in Thailand ) .
No one in the office is in a relationship , except Jim / Pam ( engaged ) and Andy / Dwight ( mortal enemies ) .
The Charles Miner / " Michael Scott Paper Company " storyline has not yet begun .
One last thing .
Forty pages struck me as pretty long for a 30 minute show , but " E - Mail Surveillance " and " The Carpet " -- the two scripts of The Office I could find online ( at http://www.dailyscript.com/tv.html)--clock in at 44 and 43 pages respectively , so I used those as a guide .
Having never before written a script for an existing show , I figured I 'd stick to precedent .
Anyway , here 's the teaser .
I do n't really plan to do anything with this ( it was more of an exercise than anything else ) , but if you have any feedback I 'd love to hear it .
You can email me at matthewbaldwin@gmail.com .
Update : Someone asked if this contains BSG finale spoilers .
Actually , it contains no BSG spoilers whatsoever , so go nuts .

Enjoy .
The United States welcomed John Pham in 1979 when he was a child and had moved from Vietnam to make a new life .
Now Pham , owner of Ninh Kieu restaurant in Swatara Township , wants to return the favor .
" This country has been good to me , " said Pham , 40 .
" Now the economy here is bad .
Unemployment is up .
I want to give something back to my country and community . "
That something is a bowl of Vietnamese soup , offered for one penny to those who have lost their job in the current economy .
The beef noodle , shrimp or chicken pho ( Vietnamese name for soup ) is served to the unemployed all day Wednesday and from 9 to 11 a.m. and 2 to 4 p.m. Thursday .
Pham said he does n't require proof of a lost job because , " I trust people . "
Pham , who became an American citizen in 1985 , knows what it means to be down on luck .
After moving to the United States from Vietnam , he spent two years learning English .
He eventually headed to Virginia Technical Institute , where he became an electrical engineer .
This self - made man worked as a general contractor , doing everything from carpentry to drywall installation to plumbing .
Later he opened a nail salon and then a Vietnamese restaurant .
Along the way , he faithfully sent money to his parents in Vietnam , rejoicing when they came to the United States in 1997 .
" When I moved to Harrisburg , I saw that the restaurant here was closed , " he said .
" So I rented it and opened my restaurant . "
Ninh Kieu , which seats 65 , serves Vietnamese cuisine , including soups and noodle and rice dishes .
The AV actress
TOKYO ( TR ) – Chisato Shoda is about to have sex with her son — at least , her son for today .
It is between scenes on the set of an incest - genre porn shoot , and this 65 - feature actress , legs crossed and her feet inside blue slippers , is lounging on the sofa in her makeshift dressing room .
The room is one of three on the third floor of a well - worn , multi-story house in Nakano , Tokyo that has been rented by Zeus Collection , a maker of adult video ( AV ) products .
Cans of Wonda coffee and packaged cakes sit on the coffee table .
Shoda ’s cigarette case , adorned in skull imagery , is there too .
Skimpy pink tops with silver sparkles and lace bras wait their turn on hangers off in the corner .
Shoda retrieves a smoke and begins reading bits of dialogue from today ’s script .
Her makeup artist sits patiently in a nearby chair .
Outside her door , the activity in the narrow hallway is brisk : cameras are being moved into place , green cables scrape along the wood floor , and lights , monitors , and bulky microphones are receiving minor adjustments .
For Shoda , the blandness of the setting — not to mention the potential immoral implications — is not an issue .
Quite frankly , she has more important things on her mind ; she has to focus on orgasms .
“ I really concentrate on the scene , ” she explains as she puffs .
“ I have to make it sexually stimulating .
I have to really get inside the role to genuinely make it exciting . ”
Sex with a blood relative
The job of the actress is to bring ecstasy to the screen , to indeed sell it as authentic so as to eliminate any doubt .
To do so , she plays with her mind — perhaps by even drifting off to another location ( or even onto another guy ) — to ensure that her audience is getting a performance they can deem satisfying .
As her male counterparts ( her son and his school mate ) trim their nails and smoke with a few still photographers one floor below , the makeup artist begins applying the finishing touches to Shoda ’s cheeks and forehead with a pink pad .
The crew continues prepping .
Director Tomotsuya Ohmura , outfitted in a beret and olive cargo shorts , surveys the work near the doorway .
“ Today is mother f*cking , ” he laughs .
Momotaro Pictures & Publications , which produces many of the films shot by Zeus , has an extensive catalog dedicated to this theme .
The players are typically mothers in their 30s and their sons , but stepsons , frustrated salarymen , and daughters in nurse uniforms can enter the mix in this ongoing series of productions titled “ Kinshin Sokan , ” or literally sex with a blood relative .
Though the plots are typically exceptionally thin , the crux usually surrounds a mother who is lonely or becomes jealous of her son ’s girlfriend .
The action can get started in a number of ways : the son catching the mother masturbating , the mother catching the son reading a pornographic manga , or the mother simply seducing her son in the kitchen after revealing that he is her “ type . ”
“ Communication is the most important thing ”
Shoda ’s son , outfitted in a black high school jacket with gold buttons , has just started going through a solo scene in which he reads an erotic book to practice the proper way to remove a woman ’s clothing .
Shoda continues relaxing by sending phone mails .
She reaches for another cigarette .
“ Communication with the director is the most important thing , ” she says .
“ We ca n’t make a nice DVD unless the director and the actress have the same vision . ”
It may seem rather ridiculous but the dialogue and timing of the action are rehearsed under the director ’s guidance .
Lines are read multiple times , and something as simple as a door being opened is practiced more than once .
Shoda was recruited through an agency by Momotaro because she is a specialist in this type of fantasy .
The fetish is rooted in an attraction to the mother ’s maturity and an assumed sexual hunger that she has nurtured beyond that of the typical early twenty - somethings that dominate Japan ’s AV industry .
Shoda indeed has an element of refinement ; with her brown hair to her shoulders , she speaks very directly and with soothing confidence .
Beneath Shoda ’s pink cotton top , it is obvious that she has rather large breasts .
But more important , says Ohmura , is that they are real .
This type of maternal role demands such a combination .
“ The viewers , ” he says , “ do n’t like the manufactured look of fake breasts . ”
Such an element may seem trivial , but the actress is the star in Japanese AV .
The whole production centers on her .
Unlike the story of “ Boogie Nights , ” a film depicting the lows and highs of an American porn star in the 70s and 80s , male actors are merely part of the supporting cast in Japan .
“ That would be unheard of here , ” Ohmura says of the possibility of a male being a star .
Given this strong focus , it is up to her to shine bright — especially during the most rapturous moments .
How does she do it ?
“ It depends on the communication with the guy , ” Shoda says , “ and if the concentration is on the mark , I ’ll orgasm .
If the atmosphere is not good between the two players , then it becomes difficult . ”
Leading up to the point of climax , the actor and actress tend to correspond back and forth with very short statements in numbing repetition .
Initially the dialogue is to confirm that there is indeed a mutual attraction .
As the temperature between the two rises , it is to ascertain whether various grabbing or kissing actions are highly pleasing or not .
“ That will get me excited ”
Aki Tomozaki , another actress with an extensive incest resume , says that she needs to set her mind free .
“ I really think of something external that will get me excited , ” says the extremely busty Tomozaki .
“ I really imagine something stimulating , like having sex with my boyfriend .
It is the only way you can do it because the viewer will know if it is not real .
There is so much competition that guys know what the real thing is . ”
An assistant enters Shoda ’s room with a few bottles of water .
She takes a mint from an aluminum case .
It is time for the masturbation scene …
In the hall , staff with white towels around their necks peek past the cracked door leading to the bedroom .
Shoda has just gone inside and begun to remove some of her clothing .
On her back , Shoda begins by reaching between her legs with her right hand .
She then slowly begins stroking herself with her fingers .
Cameras zoom in .
Microphones hang overhead to capture every little slap of flesh .
She ignores all distractions .
Her eyes are nearly shut with her head slowly tilting from side to side .
Moans subtly emanate .
Shoda increases the speed of her movements .
She gradually begins to utter slight screams , her forehead moistening with sweat .
Her son lies on his bed in his adjacent room and reads through an erotic comic , oblivious to what is unfolding .
Shoda then flips herself over so that she is on her knees , rear to the camera .
She reaches back between her legs and continues .
“ Cut ! ” barks Ohmura .
Exhausted , Shoda rolls back over .
Promotional cameramen swing the door open .
She is now slumped onto a striped pillow .
Her green underwear is over her left thigh .
Her bra is pulled down so as to reveal her nipples .
Her right hand is still between her legs as the still cameras circle around her .
Lasting impact
Art , this is not , Shoda admits , but she does get a certain satisfaction if she can make a lasting impact .
“ Selling a lot of DVDs is nice , ” she says .
“ It fills part of that need .
But I ’m really happy if I can see that my appeal is going beyond the lens , if I ’m really capturing the eye of the viewer . ”
The photographers exit .
The next scene starts .
The door opens , and Shoda looks up .
That communication she mentioned earlier is about to commence …

Eunuchs , or castrated men , have played an important part in many cultures throughout the world since ancient times .
They were usually castrated while still young boys in order to smooth their paths into secure government and / or religious positions in places like Egypt , China , India , Byzantium , and the Ottoman Empire .
Others were castrated as adults as punishment for crimes committed that were sexual in nature .
Still others castrated themselves as a result of zealous religious beliefs or fear of sexual temptation .
Here are six noteworthy eunuchs from history .
1. Sporus ( First century CE )
Castration was a big no - no under Roman law ; even slaves were protected against the act .
However , eunuchs could still be purchased from outside the Roman Empire .
Not surprisingly , the notoriously bizarre emperor Nero saw himself above the law and castrated Sporus before he married him .
Little is known about Sporus ' background except that he was a young man to whom Nero took a liking .
Nero considered Sporus to be his wife , and their marriage ceremony included Sporus wearing a bridal veil , Nero providing Sporus with a dowry , and afterwards , a wonderful honeymoon in Greece .
( Nero also married two other men , although they were not castrated because in those marriages , Nero was the wife ) .
It 's possible that Nero used his marriage to Sporus to assuage the feelings of guilt he felt for kicking his pregnant wife , Sabina , to death in 65 AD .
Sporus bore an uncanny resemblance to Sabina , and Nero even called him by his dead wife 's name .
The affair was short - lived , however , because Nero killed himself in 68 AD .
Sporus was not widowed for long .
He soon married Nymphidius Sabinus , who made an unsuccessful bid for emperor that ended with his death at the hands of his opponent 's followers .
Sporus again became involved with another powerful man , Emperor Otho , who was also killed by his enemies .
Sporus then became linked to greedy , gluttonous , and debauched Emperor Vitellius , who later had a villainous idea for a halftime show during one of the gladiatorial combats : he planned for Sporus to dress as a young woman and be raped for the viewing enjoyment of the crowds .
Sporus committed suicide to avoid the humiliation .
2. Origen ( 185 - 254 )
In the early days of Christianity , there was much consternation among believers about the issue of sex .
Many early Christians wanted to renounce all things " worldly "  such as physical pleasure , material goods , and family ties in order to imitate the life of Jesus Christ .
The Gospels , particularly Matthew 19:12 , advised , " For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother 's womb , and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men ; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven 's sake .
He who is able to receive it , let him receive it . "
Most theologians understood this passage to mean that a true Christian should become celibate in the hopes of gaining favor in heaven .
The Greek theologian Origen , however , took this passage to heart and castrated himself .
It is not at all clear why Origen did this since he seemed to be living the life of an unattached and celibate scholar .
One fourth century church historian claimed that he did this so he could teach female students without the fear of temptation .
In any case , it seems the Origen was not alone in his zealous behavior because during a church council that met in 325 in Nicaea , the practice of castrating oneself became prohibited .
3. Peter Abelard ( 1079 - 1142 )
In medieval intellectual circles , Peter Abelard was known as one of the most brilliant theologians and philosophers , and students flocked to study under him at Notre Dame in Paris .
As devoted a scholar that he may have been , the beautiful and intelligent live - in niece of a churchman named Heloise caught his eye .
Abelard asked the churchman if he could move in with him and Heloise , explaining that the commute to Paris from where he was staying was too onerous .
In exchange he offered to tutor the seventeen - year old Heloise .
( Abelard himself was more than twenty years older ) .
The two became intimate , and Heloise was soon pregnant .
They married secretly , as scholars in the Middle Ages like Abelard were supposed to behave like clerics .
In a series of misunderstandings , the churchman thought that Abelard had abandoned Heloise and he became so furious that he hired some men to castrate him , ending the love affair .
Abelard joined a monastery , wrote about his ordeals in a work called History of My Misfortunes , and later resumed teaching and engaging in intellectual debate .
Heloise joined a convent but continued to pine for Abelard in her letters to him .
Their child was raised by family .
Despite their separation , the two lovers are now buried together in PÃ¨re - Lachaise cemetery in Paris .
4. Wei Zhongxian ( 1568-1627 )
Eunuchs were common in imperial China for thousands of years , right up until the end of the Ching dynasty in 1911 .
They often came from very poor families and were castrated as children so they could work in the Emperor 's palace .
Imperial eunuchs often wielded tremendous power because they ran the government bureaucracy and were the only males allowed within the walls of the imperial palace .
Wei Zongxian 's family did not intend for him to be a eunuch .
He was born poor , grew up in circumstances normal for children in his village , married , and fathered a daughter .
Unfortunately , Wei was also a gambler who quickly found himself in debt and was constantly threatened by those to whom he owed money .
Wei decided to have himself castrated at 21 so he could enter the service of the emperor .
For thirty years ,
Wei was clever enough to stroke the right egos and make excellent connections within the palace .
Probably the best career move he made was to befriend the future emperor Tianqi 's wet - nurse , Mistress Ke .
When the young Tianqi came to the throne at fifteen , Wei set about distracting the boy with all kinds of fun activities while he consolidated his power base and became the de facto ruler .
Wei was also the director of the secret police so anyone who opposed him was purged , and shrines dedicated to Wei were erected all over China .
Wei 's situation changed very quickly when the emperor died unexpectedly at the age of twenty - three .
Wei committed suicide and his body was dismembered and the remains displayed in his village as a warning to others .
5. Thomas " Boston " Corbett ( 1832-1894 )
Thomas Corbett is known as one of the men responsible for killing John Wilkes Booth , the assassin of Abraham Lincoln .
He was born in England and immigrated to the United States with his parents when he was seven years old .
While in his 20s , he became a born again Christian and took the name " Boston "  in honor of the city where his metamorphosis took place .
But Corbett had a weakness for prostitutes , and he castrated himself with a pair of scissors to avoid sexual temptation .
Interestingly , the Massachusetts General Hospital records noted that he did not bleed particularly badly externally , but what caused worry was that his scrotum swelled and turned black .
He turned out OK , though .
Later that day he went to a prayer meeting , took a walk , and then enjoyed dinner .
It is perhaps not surprising that Corbett was later locked up at a Topeka mental institution .
He had threatened members of the Kansas House of Representatives with a gun claiming that some of them had been disrespectful during opening prayers .
6. Alessandro Moreschi ( 1858 -1922 )
For roughly three hundred years , castrati ( castrated opera singers ) could be found singing in churches throughout Italy and in the Pope 's choir .
As previously mentioned , castration was prohibited , but parents made many excuses for why their sons had been castrated , blaming it on accidents , medical necessities , and so on .
One historian estimated that at the height of castrati popularity in the eighteenth century , about 4,000 boys were castrated each year in Italy .
Moreschi was the last castrato to sing in the Sistine Chapel choir , and the only one to have had his voice recorded in 1902 and 1904 .
The eighteenth - century castrato Farinelli was the most famous of all castrati with rock star - like popularity .
He sang for royalty , popes , and adoring fans all over Europe , Still Moreschi will probably be better remembered as his singing can still be heard today .
According to Peter Edward , director of PlayStation Home for SCEE , PlayStation Home has gained 7 million users worldwide , with 3 million in Europe alone .
That certainly sounds like an accomplishment but with over 21 million PS3s sold worldwide to date , that number reveals that fewer than one third of PS3 systems have connected to Home .
That ’s a extreemly surprising figure , considering how Edward calls Home “ the starting point for PlayStation 3 online . ”
The shocking stats reveal that so far PS Home has been a failure , fewer than one third of PS3′s are currently connected to the service , a number which should be much higher .
The slow acceptance of PlayStation Home in the PS3 community ’s can be attributed to a number of factors .
One of the biggest was a long - delayed launch that was marred by infrequent updates ; the service received a mixed response from hardcore gamers , and many others have said it “ useless ” .
Since then , Home has expanded quite significantly , with the promise of more to come .
Edward told Gamasutra that we can expect " more games [ to ] support Game Launch from within Home ” ; in the future .
The service show promise as long as Sony continues to develop it into a truly great experience .

Israel 's navy patrols Gaza 's coast and shelled it during Operation Cast Lead The UK has revoked five export licences for equipment to the Israeli navy because of actions during Israel 's Operation Cast Lead in Gaza this year .
The British Foreign office said the exports would now contravene its criteria for arms sales , but denied that it had imposed a partial embargo .
The UK says it does not sell weapons which might be used for internal repression or external aggression .
Israel says its troops complied fully with international law during missions .
The 22 - day operation which ended on 18 January has been widely condemned as disproportionate by critics .
UK sued over Israel arms sales Amnesty details Gaza ' war crimes '
Israelis followed law in Gaza The British government has been challenged by human rights groups and members of the UK parliament over concerns raised by Amnesty International that British - made equipment was used illegally in Gaza .
Amnesty says both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes during the conflict .
In April , the British government issued a statement saying it had not contravened its own guidelines , which it described as " stringent " , but said it was was reviewing existing licences .
On Monday , the Foreign Office said in a statement that it had conducted the review , and found " in a small number of cases Israeli action in Cast Lead would result in the export of those goods now contravening the criteria " .
An unnamed Israeli official said five of 35 contracts for naval equipment had been cancelled .
Media reports quoted Israeli officials as saying these all related to the Saar 4.5 gunboat .
' Not bothered '
In April , the British Foreign Office said there were " credible reports " that the vessels had been used in a " naval fire support role " during Operation Cast Lead .
DIFFERENT DEATH TOLLS
Palestinians killed during Israeli military offensive in Gaza , 27 Dec to 18 Jan - Palestinian claims followed by Israelis claims : Total dead : 1,434 / 1,166 Fighters : 235 / 710-870 Non-combatants : 906 / 295-460 Women : 121 / 49 Children under 16 : 288 / 89 Sources : Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and Israeli Defence Intelligence Research Dept The British Foreign
Office said future decisions would " take into account what has happened in the recent conflict " .
" We do not grant export licences where there is a clear risk that arms will be used for external aggression or internal repression , " it said .
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Israeli public radio : " We 've had many embargoes in the past ...
We can manage .
This should n't bother us . "
Palestinian rights groups say about 1,400 Palestinians died during the operation .
Thirteen Israelis died during the conflict , 10 of them were soldiers serving in Gaza .
Israel said its operation aimed to reduce rocket fire from Gaza aimed at its southern towns .

Today , United States District Court Chief Judge Vaughn
Walker took the government to task for failing to obey his prior orders in Al - Haramain v. Obama ( formerly known as Al - Haramain v. Bush ) , asking the government to explain why he should not sanction the government by holding that the plaintiffs win the warrantless wiretapping lawsuit .
On January 5 , Chief Judge Walker had denied the government 's third motion to dismiss the Al - Haramain litigation and set up a process to allow the Al Haramain plaintiffs to prosecute the case while protecting classified information .
On February 28 , 2009 , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the government 's appeal of that order .
The government did not seek an appeal to the Supreme Court .
Today , the Court noted the government was " continuing to assert legal positions already specifically rejected by the court in previous orders " and " government officials in one or
more defendant agencies , including the NSA Director ... are refusing to cooperate with the court ’s orders . "
Judge Walker ordered the government to show cause as to " why , as a sanction for failing to obey the court ’s orders " the government " should not be prohibited ... from opposing the liability " for spying without warrants and that the " court should not deem liability ... established and proceed to determine the amount of damages to be awarded to plaintiffs . "
A hearing is set for June 3 , 2009 in the San Francisco federal court .
Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , the Oregon chapter of an Islamic charity , sued the Bush Administration for the illegal surveillance of the organization and its attorneys as part of the NSA warrantless wiretapping program .
The case was based on a secret document that was inadvertently disclosed by the government that , according to the plaintiffs , demonstrates that they were subjected to unlawful electronic surveillance outside the scope of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .

The older woman 's entire life savings were hidden inside the mattress A Tel Aviv woman has been searching through Israeli rubbish dumps after she said she accidentally threw away a mattress containing $ 1 m ( £ 700,000 ) .
The woman , identified only as Anat , had bought a new mattress for her mother as a surprise and threw away the old one , Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported .
A search of three landfill sites has so far turned up nothing , said the paper .
When the woman realised her mistake , she rushed out to retrieve the mattress but it had already been taken away .
She hurried to the Hiriya local dump , only to find the mattress had been shipped to one of two larger landfill sites , along with another 3,000 tonnes of rubbish collected that day .

A search of the first site , Ganei Hadas , proved fruitless so she moved onto Efeh , close to the Dead Sea .
Yitzhak Borba , the director of the Efeh site , told Israel 's Army Radio the woman had been " totally desperate " when she arrived .
He was reported to have kept some of his staff on overnight to fend off treasure hunters and help the woman .
But despite being unable to retrieve the mattress and its hidden fortune , " Anat " appeared philosophical about her loss .
" People have to take everything in proportion and thank God for the good and the bad , " she said .
There has been no comment from her mother .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
Iran 's supreme leader gave his blessing to the outcome of the country 's presidential election Sunday despite widespread allegations of fraud , calling the results " a divine miracle , " the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported .
Protests continue Sunday for a second day in Tehran over the results of the presidential election .

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the record voter turnout in Friday 's election showed Iranians value " resistance against oppressors , " the agency reported .
" Pointing to enemies ' massive propaganda campaign to discourage people from taking part in the elections , Ayatollah Khamenei also said there was really a divine miracle behind this elections , given its results that was 10 million higher than any of the previous ones in the 30 - year history of elections in Iran , " IRNA reported .
Official results showed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected with more than 62 percent of the vote .
But the hardline incumbent 's leading opponent , former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Moussavi , has disputed the results , and his supporters have fought in the streets with police and Ahmadinejad 's supporters since the vote .
In a letter published on Moussavi's Web site , the candidate said he has asked the election authority -- Iran 's Guardian Council -- to nullify Friday 's results .
There were conflicting reports on whether Moussavi had been placed under house arrest , but in a statement Iranian police said that the candidate was not under arrest .
Another opposition candidate said he has asked Iran 's Guardian Council -- a body of top clerics and judges that supervises elections -- to investigate .
Former parliament speaker Mehdi Karrubi , who finished in third place with a single - digit percentage of the vote in the official results , asked supporters " to find solutions through legal and civic institutions , " according to his political movement 's newspaper .
Hundreds of regular and riot police were on the streets as civil unrest continued for the second straight day .
But it was non-uniformed activists , on foot and on motorcycles , who appeared to be behind the most violent incidents .
Some residents told CNN that these " militias " were forcing their way into the homes of Moussavi supporters .
CNN reporters in Tehran witnessed men , dressed in plain clothes , combing through streets and alleys for anti-Ahmadinejad protesters .
Armed with clubs , metal batons and baseball bats , they chased protesters , in some cases beating them .
Sunday 's clashes began between police and protesters as Ahmadinejad held a victory rally while opposition supporters claimed ballot fraud .
Riot police fired tear gas and brandished batons to disperse about 100 stone - throwing protesters on Val Asr Street in central Tehran before thousands of flag - waving Ahmadinejad supporters jammed the area to hear his victory speech .
" Elections in Iran are the soundest , the healthiest of their kind , " he told his cheering supporters .
" Some people inside or outside the country ... say that the vote has been disrupted , there has been fraud .
Where are irregularities in the elections ? "
Watch Ahmadinejad call Iran " the most stable country in the world " »
Ahmadinejad insisted the nation was united and stood together against unnamed foreign enemies .
" Each and every Iranian is a nation in itself , a pillar on their own , and they stand in the face of all enemies and resist them , " he said .
Kaveh Afrasiabi , an Ahmadinejad supporter , told CNN that Moussavi risks damaging the reformist cause in Iran unless he can show something to back up his accusations .
" Unfortunately , three days later , Mr. Moussavi has not done that yet , and one wonders why , " said Afrasiabi , an Iranian political scientist and former adviser to Ahmadinejad 's predecessor , Mohammad Khatami .
Afrasiabi said Iran has had allegations of voting irregularities after nearly every election since the 1979 revolution that established the Islamic republic .
But " We 've never had this kind of blanket rejection of the entire process , " he said .
CNN witnessed some confrontations in the streets .
" There was this cat - and - mouse game between the rioters and the police , " said Samson Desta , a CNN producer who was hit by a police baton .
" For the time being , it seems like police have things under control .
But we spoke to a lot of students and they 're saying , ' This is not going to go away .
They may stop us now but we will come back and make sure our voices will be heard . ' "
It was the second day of protests in Tehran .
On Saturday , thousands of demonstrators , shouting " Death to the dictatorship , " and " We want freedom , " burned police motorcycles , tossed rocks through store windows and set trash cans on fire .
Watch angry protesters take to streets »
With handkerchiefs and surgical masks shielding them from tear gas , Moussavi 's supporters clashed openly with police in a rare challenge to the regime .
Foreign reporters were blocked at every turn from covering the demonstration .
And the government reportedly shut down access to networking sites , such as Twitter , making it difficult for information to seep out to the outside world .
Ahmadinejad , who defended his " completely free " re-election , portrayed his win as a victory for the Iranian people over foreign powers on Sunday .
" They believe in a form of democracy that will yield the result that they favor , " he said , referring to media outlets that questioned the election results .
" The era of having a few countries making decisions for the fate of other countries has come to an end . "
Eighty - five percent of the country 's 46 million eligible voters went to the polls Friday -- an unprecedented voter turnout , Iran 's interior ministry said .
When the ballots were counted , the government declared Ahmadinejad the winner -- with 62.63 percent of the vote .
Moussavi received 33.75 percent .
Moussavi disputed the results , blaming " untrustworthy monitors . "
Independent election observers were banned from polling places .
" The results announced for the 10th presidential elections are astonishing , " he said in a statement .
" People who stood in long lines and knew well who they voted for were utterly surprised by the magicians working at the television and radio broadcasting . "
A letter published on Moussavi's Web site said the defeated candidate has asked the election authority , Iran 's Guardian Council , to nullify the results of the election .
There were conflicting reports on whether Moussavi had been placed under house arrest , but in a statement Iranian police said that the candidate was not under arrest .
Moussavi , a former prime minister regarded as a reformist , is credited with successfully navigating the Iranian economy during a bloody eight - year war with Iraq in the 1980s .
And he enjoyed tremendous support among Iran 's youth .
Iran 's population has a median age of 27 .
Ahmadinejad , despite being blamed for Iran 's economic turmoil over the past four years , maintains staunch support in rural areas .
No matter who won , the ultimate power in Iran is with Khamenei , the supreme leader .
The system was set up after Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 when the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammed Reba Phalli was forced into exile .
CNN 's Christiane Amanpour , Samson Desta , Shirzad Bozorgmehr in Tehran and Saeed Ahmed in Atlanta contributed to this report .

Arma II is out in Europe and on Steam .
It is the single most ambitious war game ever to grace a games machine .
It is full of bugs .
Does that mean you should n’t play it ?
Here ’s wot I think .
It seems that many of the games I have the greatest respect for start out as exercises in pure frustration .
I had three or four attempts to crack Eve Online , for example .
My modest talent for Quake III came out of sheer disgust and rage at the people who , when I first started playing , could shoot me in mid air with a railgun and spam ironic smilies in the text chat at the same time .
I ’d teach them to :/
Anyway , Arma II seems like one such familiarly frustrating scenario .
I was bug - eyed with rage through some of the open levels , where repeated battles with unseen assailants left me , or my team - mates , defeated , and restarting a level , again and again .
I was okay with me being rubbish , but what about the three computer - controlled Marines ?
Why were they allowed to die ?
I bitched and griped in the RPS chatroom .
Later I watched with sad amazement as my AI helicopter ride refused to land in the open terrain I ’d directed it to , instead awkwardly placing itself between some trees to deposit my team .
We got out , watched the chopper try to take off , explode , and then spit out the NPC air crew who had just been talking to us .
The pilot stood there , unharmed and stupidly glancing about .
UNKNOWN , MAN , IN FRONT OF , US , said my AI team mate .
I shook my head .
Frustrations with the interface created mess after mess : I ’d jump into a helicopter , and order my team to do the same .
Except one of them gets into a nearby car .
What ?
Only half way across the vast landscape of Chernarus do I realise that he is following us on the ground .
I have to wait for 10 minutes for him to catch up .
There there was the sinking feeling of the sheer arcane complexity of the interface .
Going through menu upon menu in the bootcamp training exercises , I wondered if they pay off could possibly be worth the amount of effort was putting in learning how to play .
There are half a dozen layers of commands for individual units , and I could potentially be controlling many units at any one time .
There was n’t just a hard - as - nails infantry simulation to get to grips with , there was also a strategic - level game , where I ’d be not just commanding military forces , but building them from scratch .
It did n’t help that the UI is foggy , and unclear , and that the strategic map is incredibly clunky and counter - intuitive : entire at odds with how I ’d expect a mouse - driven system work .
Rather than click and context menu , the action takes place where I have the mouse when I select an option on the number menu .
Eugh .
Horrible .
In some ways , it was like being sent back to school .
An illogical school , where they teach lessons inside out .
“ Welcome to Arma II High , where you ’re going to have to learn gaming from scratch , starting with the first person shooter , and building up toward the… PAY ATTENTION , ROSSIGNOL ! “
Bluuh !
I ’ve still barely got to grips with the commander stuff , and I ’m a kind of flailing sadface when playing online , despite having browsed Dslyecxi ’s dizzyingly large “ tactics , techniques & procedures ” guide .
And yet I ’m now hooked .
The main campaign of Arma II , which unfolds piece by piece , sometimes beautifully , sometimes incoherently , is arguably one of the most interesting gaming experiences on the PC .
Running battles through woodlands , interrogating locals , co-ordinating UAV drone strikes , riding mountain bikes , messing about with bombs , helicopters , and stolen Eastern European tractors : the open world military sim begins to cohere , like a formidably layered cake in the Gas Mark 5 oven of your imagination .
The sheer variety of what you get up to is enthralling , and it ’s little more than a sampler of what Arma II as a system , as a wargaming platform , is capable of .
Yes , it ’s messy and ill - judged at times , and recipe is ludicrous , but it is also bold and often brilliant .
The fact that it is total non-linear , and offers multiple paths in a manner than would embarrass most RPGs is one thing , but when you look at the intricacy with which some battles play out – with weather , ordnance , and behaviour all meticulously modelled – it becomes startling .
To get a better idea about that you have to go and have a look at the editor .
Drop in and start setting up scenarios : gone are the impossible scripting tasks of the original games , now you can drop events , units , and parameters directly onto the map .
With these kinds of shortcuts readily available I expect astonishing scenarios to be conjured up in mere hours .
Indeed , we ’ve already seen what people are doing with thousands of AI fighting battles on a single map .
A map that covers over two hundred square kilometers of terrain .
Occasionally with a frustrating or difficult game it ’s a single experience that makes it click , and makes me know why I like it , or why I hate it and must castigate it unto destruction .
But not so with Arma II .
Instead it was a gradual , sedimentary build up of smaller happenings that vindicated the entire thing .
During the campaign this included the introduction of support elements and the escalation of the war , the slow realisation of the enormity of the thing , winning a battle against a much smaller force with just Razor team , seeing my first tank battle , watching attack helicopters in action , seeing the strategic elements build into the game and take advantage of them , delivering an artillery strike correctly , using targeting toys for friendly aircraft , and so on , and on .
While there seems to be something slightly too washed out and shaky about Arma II ’s engine , it nevertheless bags the feel , the overall sense - data of being in a warzone , better than anything else out there .
The crackle and crump of nearby battles seems exactly right , and the sudden confusion and violence of coming under fire is about as harsh as it could be .
Struggling towards an injured member of Razor team , dragging him into cover and patching him up : that ’s a desperate kind of drama that you do n’t get in many other games .
Mechanically the game is variable .
While I hate the UI and almost all of the interface , the feedback of controlling the character is precisely what I want from a game like this – at least once I ’d reduced the default headbob a little .
Throwing myself to the ground as gunfire kicks off , rolling behind cover , and then crawling for the nearest best point to return fire – it all feels grim and hard .
As you play more you realise you can step over low objects – those foe that have foxed gaming protagonists for decades , and even move your gun and head around independently .
All this starts to make you realise – as the gun battles slowly become more and more transparent – that sticky - to - wall cover systems in other games might be more fun , but they are as ludicrously artificial as Mario ’s ability to jump five times his own height .
When you ’re running through woods , or shattered villages , and diving into bushes as bullet zip and snap towards you , the use of cover in Arma 2 feels very real indeed .
Indeed , the sense of adherence to reality , the overall verisimilitude is painfully high , but it ’s nevertheless consistently broken by all kinds of rough edges and randomness , particular in the behaviour of anything that is n’t a human - controlled entity .
There ’s a definite sense that the AI is teetering on the brink of madness , especially when you see tanks flailing about in front of rabbits .
For the most part , however , it holds it together .
An impressive feat , when you consider quite what it has to deal with .
I ca n’t even imagine how you ’d begin programming such a monstrosity .
Yet all this is preface , and almost irrelevant to the main engine of long term enjoyment .
It takes multiplayer to really explain what the appeal of this game is about .
From playing with a friend in the co-op campaign , right through to embarking massive 30 - man operations , this is a game where multiplayer is king .
I ’ve had just a small taste of this so far , but it instantly banishes any idea that the huge and wide - ranging single player campaign is really a useful focus for any review of the game .
While the options for solo , single player gaming really are vast , it ’s only when co-ordinating with other players that you really begin to see why this game ’s predecessors took hold of people ’s entire lives .
Even with the few scenarios that come with Arma II , you ’re able to play through dozens of hours of war in the Chernarus or island Ubtes theatres , with tank battles flattening entire towns .
Many more scenarios are already being produced with that versatile editor .
What ’s more , once you ’re hooked up on voice comms you ’re able to perform far more complex actions that you could hope to do with the AI , as you crudely thumb them around the map .
Tactics become real , rather than implied or imagined .
Board the helicopter , go in low to avoid anti-aicraft fire , bail out because you ’re hit , regroup in woodland , hit the target , cripple enemy AA batteries , get picked up , head to the next waypoint – all splurging , organically , into your game .
It ’s enthralling stuff , and only possible because of other people .
I wholly recommend the co-op missions over the versus type multiplayer too .
Co-ordinating with other people to take on huge AI armies is awesome like little else .
Of course , like plenty of other games I ’ve already sunk lifetimes into – aforementioned Quake III and Eve Online being acute examples – Arma II is a game that rewards practice and organised play .
Dropping in to play a random bout of virtual paintball is okay for cheap kicks , but it can be monstrously frustrating .
I suspect the real rewards are going to come from playing with practiced groups of players who actually attempt to deliver something approximating soldierly behaviour .
That realisation , of course , adds an atmosphere of intimidating inaccessibility for anyone who is n’t being introduced to the game by friends .
I think that barrier will remain , no matter how good the single player element of the game is .
Making the leap beyond mere paddling in the shallows is going to take some gumption .
It wo n’t be for most of us .
I can see the appeal , now , but I am still hesitant .
Arma II game is already divisive : it was always going to be .
It ’s impossible to examine this game without seeing it as a kind of exemplar of some of the larger issues about what is good and bad about PC gaming : the unfinished code , the performance issues , the difficulty of breaking into established communities – all these things will push people away .
But the sheer scope : the raw materials that BIS have forged for gamers to make their own entertainment , their own stories with .
I ca n’t say that ’s a bad thing .
What PC games are is a wide open landscape , and that monstrous , uneven terrain is only getting larger by the day .
Thank fuck for this twisted little peninsula of realism , without it gaming would be a whole lot less interesting .

Move to hand privately - owned Federal Reserve complete regulatory power over entire U.S. economy heralds new form of government
Paul Joseph Watson & Steve Watson

Thursday , June 18 , 2009
President Obama ’s plan to give the privately - owned and unaccountable Federal Reserve complete regulatory oversight across the entire U.S. economy , which is likely to be enacted before the end of the year , will officially herald the beginning of a new form of government in the United States – an ultra-powerful banking dictatorship controlled by a small gaggle of shadowy and corrupt elitists .
The new rules would see the Fed given the authority to “ regulate ” any company whose activity it believes could threaten the economy and the markets .
This goes a step further than the centrally planned economies of the Soviet Union or Communist China , in that the Federal Reserve is not even accountable to the U.S. government , it is a private entity that according to former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan , is accountable to nobody but the banking families that own it .
Obama ’s regulatory “ reform ” plan is nothing less than a green light for the complete and total takeover of the United States by a private banking cartel that will usurp the power of existing regulatory bodies , who are now being blamed for the financial crisis in order that their status can be abolished and their roles handed over to the all - powerful Fed .
According to an Associated Press report today , Democratic leaders have committed to enacting the plan before the end of the year and Republicans in both the House and Senate have indicated that they wo n’t stand in the way of the overhaul .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ The final plan … . is expected to sidestep most jurisdictional disputes and simply impose across the board standards to be applied by all financial regulators , according to administration and industry sources , ” reports the Washington Times .
In other words , the Fed , which is already totally unaccountable to Congress , is to be placed in complete control of the entirety of the U.S. financial system , to do as it wishes without repercussion .
As the LA Times reports , the government , in conjunction with the private Federal Reserve , would effectively have the clout to simply seize and take over any company it desires .
In order to appease those opposed to the plan , such as Sen. Christopher J. Dodd , chairman of the Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs , the Obama administration has agreed to create a “ watchdog ” council of regulators to “ advise the Fed ” .
However , as former chairman Alan Greenspan has most recently pointed out , given that the Fed is an independent entity , and therefore accountable to no one , it will have the power to simply reject and overrule any advice it is offered .
Pointing out the flagrant conflict of interest in empowering the Federal Reserve to essentially regulate itself , Professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin Robert Auerbach writes , “ The Federal Reserve has massive conflicts of interest that make it ill suited for its present regulatory functions and certainly for an expanded regulatory reach .
The officials leading the Fed today preside over an organization that is run in substantial part by the bankers they regulate .
Bank regulation begins at its 12 district Federal Reserve Banks , each governed by a nine - member board of directors , two - thirds of whom are elected by the bankers in the district . ”
As economic author Nomi Prins highlights , Obama ’s plan does nothing whatsoever to fix the excesses of financial institutions blamed for the financial collapse , it only ensures their continued operation and an expansion of the practices that contributed to the economic crisis in the first place .
“ The ‘ sweeping overhaul ’ of the financial system detailed by Geithner on behalf of the Obama administration does not overhaul the system at all , ” writes Prins , “ giving the Fed a bigger role , creating a ‘ council of regulators ’ to oversee the existing oversight bodies and allowing the biggest Wall Street players to maintain their status , leaves the system intact . ”
“ The Federal Reserve is not a fully public entity .
It has amassed a set of $ 7.87 trillion worth of facilities and other entities through which it has lavished cheap loans in return for questionable collateral from the banking system .
It has kept the true nature of these transactions a secret despite numerous FOIA requests .
And , it has actively promoted the creation of bigger institutions in a chaotic environment , rather than putting the brakes on the creation of these giants , ” concludes Prins .
Proof that the agenda of implementing overt financial dictatorship is being carefully coordinated can be seen in the fact that an almost identical scheme is also being set up in the United Kingdom , where “ The governor of the Bank of England has called for greater powers to allow it to fulfil its new role of promoting financial stability , ” according to a BBC report .
Just as in the U.S. , King is calling for traditional independent regulatory bodies to be all but abolished and replaced by the Bank of England itself , which just like the Federal Reserve is a private outfit with no accountability to the government whatsoever .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The mainstream media , for the most part , has reported the oversight plan as a much needed regulatory crackdown on those responsible for the financial crisis .
However , the details of the plan constitute almost exactly what lobbyists for leading bankers have been pushing for over the past few weeks .
“ All derivatives contracts will be subject to regulation and all derivatives dealers subject to supervision , ” Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said at a Time Warner Economic Summit in New York on Monday , also noting “ When you have too many people involved , there ’s an accountability problem . ”
As we reported earlier this month , heads of nine of the biggest banks in the derivatives market , including JP Morgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Citigroup and Bank of America , secretly lobbied to keep derivatives under Federal Reserve “ oversight ” and away from real scrutiny .
As reported by The New York Times , they all met secretly to discuss how to use the lax regulation and institutional secrecy of the NY Fed to shield their credit - default swaps business from prying eyes and attempts at regulation .
The banks formed a lobby – the CDS Dealers Consortium– only weeks after accepting TARP funds in October 2008 to protect its interests .
Heading this effort was Edward Rosen , who previously helped fend off derivatives regulation .
Rosen wrote and circulated a “ confidential memo ” to the Treasury Department and leaders on Capital Hill , making their agenda clear , the Times reported .
Rosen and his backers propose that derivatives be “ traded in privately managed clearinghouses , with less disclosure , ” according to the Times .
The clearinghouse of choice for the big banks in Rosen ’s CDS Consortium is ICE U.S.
Trust , which is in turned regulated only by the Federal Reserve system .
So the upshot of all this is that the bankers get what they want , are allowed to carry on as they were , while at the same time the fractional reserve banking system and the federal government are both greatly expanded and empowered , and the compliant corporate media ludicrously tells us that a strict crackdown is underway .
This kind of activity is exactly what some leading representatives have warned of in recent weeks .
A fortnight ago , the Democratic Chairman of the Agriculture Committee , Collin Peterson , announced to the press that “ The banks run the place , ” in reference to the US Congress .
While Peterson is also pushing for legislation to regulate derivatives trading , his proposed bill would limit derivatives trading to public exchanges , rather than private clearinghouses , which are managed by banks .
Peterson ’s warning mirrors that of Democratic Senator Dick Durbin , who just a few weeks before uttered the same rarely acknowledged truth .
“ And the banks — hard to believe in a time when we ’re facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created — are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill .
And they frankly own the place , ” Durbin said .
How simultaneously dangerous and ridiculous it is that the Federal Reserve is given more authority to oversee the economy .
This is the same privately run entity that refused to comply with congressional demands for transparency and disclose the destination of trillions dollars in bailout funds .
It is the same privately owned entity that has withheld internal memos , in spite of freedom of information act requests .
It is the same private entity , run for the most part by European banking elites , that has arrogantly refused to tell Senators and Congressmen which banks were in receipt of government loans .
The government is ready to hand over everything to a monolithic private corporation and a gaggle of bastard banker offspring , that have gobbled up an amount close to the entire GDP of the country in taxpayers ’ money and figuratively stuck the middle finger up regarding questions over where that money has gone .
It can be no more apparent than at this time that legislation to audit , repeal and eventually end the Federal Reserve , must be supported by Americans if they want to see their children and their grandchildren grow up without indentured debt and entrenched servitude to a fascistic marriage of private banks and hugely inflated government .

Comment on this article
President Obama marked the lowest point in General Motors ’ 100 - year history  its bankruptcy filing on Monday  by barely mentioning it , instead focusing his remarks on the second chance G.M. will have to become a viable company with more government aid .
“ I ’m confident that the steps I ’m announcing today will mark the end of an old G.M. , and the beginning of a new G.M. , ” Mr. Obama said .
While the moment had been anticipated for weeks , the bankruptcy filing nevertheless included more crushing news to G.M. ’s home state , Michigan , which is already reeling from waves of layoffs and plant closings .
Shortly after filing for Chapter 11 in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan , G.M. said it would close 14 more American factories  including seven in Michigan  and cut up to 21,000 more jobs .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Wall Street may be losing its luster for new U.S. college graduates who are increasingly looking to the government for jobs that enrich their social conscience , if not their wallet .

In the boom years , New York ’s financial center lured many of the brightest young stars with the promise of high salaries and bonuses .
But the financial crisis has tainted the image of big banks , and with fewer financial jobs available , Uncle Sam may be reaping the benefit .
“ Some grads might have seen two of their older siblings go through the dot - com crash and the emptiness of that , and now the Wall Street crash , just chasing after the big bucks , ” said John Challenger , chief executive of job placement company Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
Some of the appeal of Washington simply reflects the grim reality of graduating in the midst of the worst recession in decades .
The U.S. unemployment rate jumped to 9.4 percent in May , which means new graduates are competing with a large pool of older unemployed workers for a limited supply of jobs .
A report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers projected a 21.6 percent decrease in new hires among college graduates .
Almost every sector was hit , with banking taking the biggest blow , dropping 70.9 percent .
“ Students do n’t see the private sector as being as viable this year , ” said Edwin Koc , director of strategic and foundation research for the Pennsylvania - based NACE .
Of the roughly 1.6 million students who recently graduated from college , only 19.7 percent had secured jobs upon graduation in May , according to NACE ’s 2009 student survey .
But Labor Department data shows employment in the Washington area has increased since early 2008 , even as other regions have lost jobs .
“ D.C. is the only place where we can point to that is actually adding jobs right now , and we also know that the government is hiring thousands of people to oversee both the ( economic ) stimulus package and all the associated projects , ” said Marisa Di Natale , Senior Economist for Moody ’s Economy.com .
GIVE BACK
Challenger said the excitement surrounding the election of President Barack Obama , who enjoyed huge support on college campuses , was also attracting young graduates to government and government - service contractors .
Britini Wilcher is one of them .
Wilcher , a recent graduate from Spelman College in Atlanta , spent two summers as an intern for Merrill Lynch , which was hard hit by the financial crisis and taken over by Bank of America Corp last year .
When it came time to look for full - time employment , Wilcher wanted to do something with a bigger social impact .
The California native will be working in Washington for a government consulting firm where she will specialize in economic development .
“ It ’s becoming trendy to take your community into your hands and give back , which is a good thing , ” Wilcher said .
“ People are empowered by the current political climate . ”
The shift in attitudes is also apparent in graduate school enrollment .
At Morehouse College , more graduates are opting to study public policy , said Douglas Cooper , director of career services at the college ’s division of business and economics .
That is a big change for Morehouse , which has a long history of sending its students on to Wall Street , thanks in part to a relationship solidified by former college president and current Bank of America Chairman Walter Massey .
“ Clearly , students who have historically planned on making a beeline to Wall Street have rethought that or are rethinking that , ” Cooper said .
The share of Morehouse business students going into finance has decreased to 37.5 percent this year from 44 percent a year earlier , while the number of students going on to graduate school has almost doubled .
Most students who continue to graduate school this year are planning to go into government - related fields , Cooper said .
Some think the shift will have longer - term consequences in employment trends as the baby boomer generation approaches retirement , opening up career paths in government and service .
“ You may see a whole generation of some of the very best students that decide to do public service rather than business , ” Challenger said .
England 's captain , Andrew Strauss , has admitted that timekeeping has become an issue among certain members of the squad , after Andrew Flintoff had to be reprimanded by the ECB for a breach of discipline during the team bonding session in Belgium ahead of the Ashes .
Flintoff failed to make the journey to the trenches near Ypres on Saturday morning after missing the team bus , having attended a private team dinner the night before , and on the eve of England 's warm - up fixture against Warwickshire at Edgbaston , Strauss conceded that the squad had some issues that needed to be ironed out .
" We can confirm Andrew did miss the team bus and the matter has been dealt with internally with what is considered an appropriate response , " said an England spokesman .
The trip had been intended to honour the soldiers who died during World War I , part of the services to commemorate Armed Forces Day .
" He was very aware he 's stuffed up , " said England 's captain , Andrew Strauss .
" He 's taken it on the chin , and apologised sincerely .
In fact , punctuality has been a bit of an issue recently with a few players , so it 's something we 're trying to iron out , and we have taken steps to make sure it does n't happen again .
Fred accepts he made a mistake , the appropriate action has been taken , and we move forward . "
This is not the first time that Flintoff has been in the spotlight for his off - field activities .
He lost the vice - captaincy of the one - day team after his infamous encounter with a pedalo in St Lucia during the 2007 World Cup .
During the 2006 - 07
Ashes tour , Flintoff turned up for practice ahead of a one - day match the worse for wear from the previous evening .
" Of course there have been instances with Fred before , but it would be completely wrong for us to start looking back on that , " said Strauss .
" He 's massively excited about being back in the squad , and he feels bad about missing the bus , and bad about this becoming an issue , but we all know that if he 's playing well in the side he 's a massive asset . "
Flintoff , who is likely to return to the England side after sitting out five months due to a knee injury , did at least attend a team meeting later on Saturday after managing to catch up with his team - mates in his own time .
But the incident follows hot on the heels of Australia 's decision to send home their own allrounder , Andrew Symonds , from the World Twenty20 for repeated transgressions , particularly in relation to alcohol .
Strauss insisted that England would be strong enough to take similar action if required , even against a player of Flintoff 's standing , but he was adamant that such measures would not be required .
" It 's got to be an option with anyone who transgresses badly enough , but I 'm absolutely certain it's not going to come to that , and it 'll be a sad day for cricket if it comes to that .
Earlier this season , the Nottinghamshire allrounder , Samit Patel , was dropped from England 's one - day squads for failing to meet the necessary fitness requirements , but Strauss insisted that England did n't operate with one rule for one and one for another .
" We need to have consistency , " he added .
" We treat people like adults - that is fundamental to my captaincy - so it 's up to Fred what he does .
He 's been out of the side for a while , with a lot of injuries , and he 's desperate to come in and do well in the Ashes .
" It 's vitally important to a team functioning properly that everyone is treated the same .
Fred 's been working very hard … he generally recognises when the times are to drink and when not to drink .
" He missed the bus , but he took a full part in the rest of the day 's activities and he seemed absolutely fine , " said Strauss .
" We had a team dinner , alcohol was n't banned , but there 's no reason to suspect that anything massively untoward happened . "
WASHINGTON , June 24 ( UPI ) -- U.S. consumers have been forced to pay billions of dollars in medical bills health insurers should have covered , a Senate committee said Wednesday .
That 's because private insurers have systematically underpaid for out - of - network care , the Senate Commerce Committee said in its report .

Insurers normally pay a percentage of the " usual - and - customary " rates , but the process remains a mystery to most consumers and is difficult to challenge , The Washington Post reported .
The report says insurers typically relied on numbers from Ingenix Inc. , a wholly owned subsidiary of health insurer UnitedHealth Group , to determine " usual - and - customary " rates for out - of - network care , the Post said .
Ingenix determined benchmarks that kept usual - and - customary rates low , placing more of the cost burden on consumers , the report said .
The report also revealed the Ingenix data came from the insurers that bought the company 's information and that insurers often removed high charges from their data , the Post said .
In March testimony to the Commerce Committee , UnitedHealth Group 's chief executive , Stephen J. Hemsley , said he regretted the conflict of interest between his company and Ingenix , the report said .
But Hemsley said he stands by the integrity of the Ingenix data and the way the insurer used the data , the Post reported .

On Fox News yesterday , guest Lt. Col. Ralph Peters labeled Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl , “ an apparent deserter . ”
He later said that the Taliban should kill Bergdahl , “ If he walked away from his post and his buddies in wartime , I do n’t care how hard it sounds , as far as I ’m concerned , the Taliban can save us a lot of legal hassles and legal bills . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :

Peters said , “ I wanna stress first of all that we must wait until all of the facts are in to make a final judgment , but nobody in the military that I ’ve heard is defending this guy .
He is an apparent deserter .
Reports are indeed that he abandoned his buddies , abandoned his post and walked off … Now there ’s another problem Julie .
On that video he is collaborating with the enemy , under duress or not , that ’s really not relevant …
He ’s lying about how he was captured saying that he lagged behind a patrol … .
So we know this private is a liar we are n’t sure if he is a deserter , but the media needs to hit the pause button and not portray this guy as a hero . ”
Peters said that if he is a deserter , the Taliban should kill him , “ I want to be clear .
If , when the facts are in , we find out that through some convoluted chain of events , he really was captured by the Taliban , I ’m with him .
But , if he walked away from his post and his buddies in wartime , I do n’t care how hard it sounds , as far as I ’m concerned , the Taliban can save us a lot of legal hassles and legal bills . ”
Julie Banderas did her best to try to soften his remarks at the end of the segment .
How can Ralph Peters condemn the man as a deserter , if we do n’t know all of the facts ?
Anyone who remembers the Pat Tillman case understands that it is not beneath the military to lie about the circumstances surrounding a soldier ’s capture or death .
It would not be surprising if some in the Pentagon are trying to downplay the first U.S. solider to be captured by the Taliban by labeling him a deserter .
Peters claim that it does n’t matter whether , Pfc. Bergdahl was under duress in the released video is nonsense .
The definition of collaboration states that it has to be voluntary cooperation with the enemy .
Peters has already made up his mind that it ’s Bergdahl ’s fault that he got captured .
Regardless of the circumstances , the U.S. has an obligation to rescue this young man from the Taliban .

I love reading fantasy , I ’ve even written about some of my favourite fantasy series on this blog .
One of the things that I have always found interesting about fantasy literature ( besides unworkable economies and unsustainable population densities – I tend to over - analyse when I read :) ) was how they come up with the names for all the characters .
Large fantasy series often contain hundreds of characters – that ’s a lot of names .
This line of though naturally led me to think of what I would do if I ever needed to make up a bunch of names and being the software developer that I am the answer was naturally – get my computer to make up the names for me .
If you do a search around the web for name generators you get quite a few results , unfortunately most of those do n’t tell you how they do what they do and even that is besides the point since I was n’t really happy with the results that most of these name generators produce .
Either the results are way too random ( how about 6 consonants in a row ) or they are not random enough with clear traces of human intervention ( i.e. choosing from a list of pre-made names ) .
Then I found Chris Pounds excellent name generator page .
One of the things that he has on this page is his language confluxer ( lc ) script so for my first attempt at writing a name generator I decided to basically take his script and clean it up a little bit .
There were two reasons for this :
he uses a pretty clever algorithm for his name generator , it is completely data driven and is therefore able to avoid the 6 consonants / vowels in a row issue while producing output that sounds similar to the data it is based on
it was a yucky Perl script and nobody wants to work with that ( except Perl programmers ) , so I felt it was my duty to make it a little bit nicer and since I ’ve been playing around with Ruby lately , well you get the picture :)
The Name Generator Algorithm
As I said the script is completely data driven in that it takes a list of words ( names in our case ) as input and uses these to produce a bunch of randomised names that hopefully sound similar to the original input .
It does the following :
produces a list of starting letter pairs from the input data ( all our names will start with one of these pairs )
produces a map of which letters can follow which other letters based on the input data
generates words / names by randomly selecting a starting pair and then appending to the word by randomly choosing a letter from the map based on what the last letter in our new word currently is
this continues until the word length falls into a particular range ( this range is hard - coded in the script )
There are a few more little twists that make this whole thing function but that is the essence of the algorithm .
Faithful Perl - to - Ruby Conversion
So first thing I did was to take the Perl script and do a direct conversion into Ruby , here is what I got :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 require ' getoptlong ' data_file = ' data.txt ' words_to_generate = 10 min_length = 3 max_length = 9 opts = GetoptLong . new ( [ " -- datafile " , " - d " , GetoptLong :: OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT ] , [ " -- number-of - words " , " - n " , GetoptLong :: OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT ] ) opts .
each do | opt , arg | case opt when ' - - datafile ' data_file = arg when '-- number-of - words ' words_to_generate = arg end end start_pairs = [ ] follower_letters =
Hash . new ( '' )
File . open ( data_file , 'r ' ) do | file | chars = file .
read .
chomp .
downcase .
gsub ( /\s/ , ' ' ) . chars .
to_a chars .
push ( chars [ 0 ] , chars [ 1 ] ) ( chars .
length - 2 ) . times do | i | if chars [ i ] =~ /\s/ start_pairs .
push ( chars [ i + 1 , 2 ]. join ) end follower_letters [ chars [ i , 2 ] . join ] = follower_letters [ chars [ i , 2 ]. join ]+ chars [ i + 2 , 1 ]. join end end def generate_word ( word , follower_letters , min_length ) last_pair = word [- 2 , 2 ] letter = follower_letters [ last_pair ]. slice ( rand ( follower_letters [ last_pair ]. length ) , 1 ) if word =~ /\s$ / return word unless word .
length & lt ; = min_length return generate_word ( word [- 1 , 1 ]+ letter , follower_letters , min_length ) else word = word .
gsub ( / ^\s/ , '' ) return generate_word ( word + letter , follower_letters , min_length ) end end words_to_generate .
times do | i | puts generate_word ( start_pairs [ rand start_pairs .
length ] , follower_letters , min_length ) [ 0 , max_length ]. capitalize end
At this point I had a bit of a shock at how eerily similar the Ruby version of the script looks compared to the Perl version ( * shudders * ) .
Anyways , you can just take the above script put it into a file and run it , you ’ll need to give it a data file ( here is the one I used ) .
Cleaning Up The Basic Name Generator
The problems with the above script are :
it is not self - documenting
it is hard to test
it is hard to extend
Anyways , I decided to make it a little bit nicer and easier to play around with by breaking it up into a couple of classes ( in the interest of object orientation and stuff ) :
name_generator_main.rb – the script entry point
NameGenerator – concerned with name generation ( as you might expect )
DataHandler – concerned with reading the input data and producing the maps and arrays on which the NameGenerator relies
ArgumentParser – concerned with dealing with the command line arguments
You can download all of it here .
Now the main script looks much cleaner and you know exactly what ’s happening just by reading it :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 require ' argument_parser ' require ' data_handler ' require ' name_generator ' argument_parser = ArgumentParser .
new argument_parser .
parse_arguments data_handler = DataHandler .
new data_handler .
read_data_file ( argument_parser .
data_file ) name_generator = NameGenerator .
new ( data_handler .
follower_letters ) names = name_generator .
generate_names ( argument_parser .
words_to_generate , data_handler .
start_pairs ) names .
each { | name | puts name }
This produces output similar to the following :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jamin Luce Jevon Fredy Hamilinis Emmano Shamarcul Gagaedric Jary Raelis
That ’s pretty damn good for a random name generator .
The best part of it , since it is completely data driven , if you change the input data you completely alter the output .
So if you pass in a file with a bunch of French names , you will get French - sounding random names etc .
Try it yourself !
From Countdown :
A new internal government report reveals that President George W. Bush played a direct role in instructing Alberto Gonzales and Andrew Card to go to former Attorney General John Ashcroft 's hospital bed and urge him to personally approve warrantless wiretapping on Americans .
From James Risen and Eric Lichblau 's article at the New York Times :
While the Bush administration had defended its program of wiretapping without warrants as a vital tool that saved lives , a new government review released Friday said the program ’s effectiveness in fighting terrorism was unclear .
The report , mandated by Congress last year and produced by the inspectors general of five federal agencies , found that other intelligence tools used in assessing security threats posed by terrorists provided more timely and detailed information .
Most intelligence officials interviewed “ had difficulty citing specific instances ” when the National Security Agency ’s wiretapping program contributed to successes against terrorists , the report said .
While the program obtained information that “ had value in some counterterrorism investigations , it generally played a limited role in the F.B.I. ’s overall counterterrorism efforts , ” the report concluded .
The Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence branches also viewed the program , which allowed eavesdropping without warrants on the international communications of Americans , as a useful tool but could not link it directly to counterterrorism successes , presumably arrests or thwarted plots .
Après le remaniement annoncé hier soir et le premier conseil des ministres du gouvernement Fillon IV , ce mercredi sera consacré aux émouvantes passations de pouvoir .

Well , whether or not you can force licenses across an API is not well
settled , as far as I know ( IANAL ) Microsoft and Apple still have
licenses that try to claim ownership across API 's .
And to the extent
that the FSF still tries to claim that programs written to use the GNU
readline library must fall under the GPL , when two other BSD - licensed
implementations of the readline interface exist , they are claiming
exactly the same thing ( although the FSF has been known to call for
bycotts of companies that try to claim interfacde copyrights ; heh ) .
Which brings up an interesting point .
The moment someone implements
BSD - licensed code which implements a particular interface , it very
strongly weakens the case that anyone implementing code to that
interface is a derived work of the GPL 'ed interface .
This is one of
the reasons why claiming that the GPL can infect across an interface
( whether it is a module interface , a system call interface , or
dynamically linked shared library interface ) is bizarre at best .
For example , let me give the following example .
Debugfs of the
e 2fsprogs library uses libss , which I recently enhanced to attempt to
dynamically load one of the following libraries via dlopen : readline
( GPL'ed ) , editline ( BSD licensed ) , or libedit ( BSD licensed ) , which
all export the same interface .
Libss dates back to 1985 or so , and
has a BSD - style license .
It is also used in Kerberos V5 ( which is
also BSD licensed ) , and so Solaris has a propietary derived version of
Krb5 whose administration client uses libss .
So if you compile the
latest version of e2fsprogs on Solaris , and Solaris ' krb5 admin client
manages to use the new version of libss , then you could potentially
have in the single address space :
* Solaris 's propietary admin client
* The libss shared library ( BSD )
* The GPL'ed readline library
OK , riddle me this : is there a GPL violation , and if so , who committed
it ?
The user , for running the admin client in this configuration ?
But the GPL explicitly says that it 's only about distribution , and
does n't restrict usage in any way , and the end - user is only using the
code .
Solaris , the owner of the propietary admin client ?
But they were n't
involved in my enhancing the libss shared library to dynamically load
either a GPL'ed or a BSD - licensed library , and they created the admin
client before I added the libss enhancement .
And heck , the original
admin client was created by me while I was working at MIT , and is part
of the original MIT Kerberos V5 disitribution ( although Sun has
modified it extensively since then ) .
Me , for modifying a BSD - licensed library to try to dynamically load a
GPL 'ed library ?
But I was trying to make a perfectly legitimate stack
work :
* Debugfs ( which is GPL'ed )
* The libss shared library ( BSD )
* The GPL'ed readline library
and the reason why I used dynamic linking was because I wanted debugfs
to only optionally depend on readline library , since the readline
library is a monster ( over 600k ) and so it would n't fit on a rescue
floppy .
So trust me , you really do n't want to claim that just because a
program was written to use a particular interface , the license infects
across the API .
Apple and Microsoft are playing that game , and a very
unsavory game it is .
And it leads to all sorts of paradoxes , such as
the one I described above .

In this part I will introduce the python implementation of the ip to geolocation script .
It ’s more object oriented and hopefully better to read .
In the first part of this article I willdescribe the solution to read http resources and parse the content .
The second part is the same like the php version .
As conclusion I will compare the results of all five APIs with the data from the cache .
python : asynchonous http requests on google appengine
First I want to build the same multi-url - fetch - function ( like in php ) but I am using the google appengine .
There are no threads allowed and the urllib / httplib modules are masked with the urlfetch module from google .
I chose the normal and easy urllib.open call because the google backend works fast .
After this was done I found in the updated URLFetch - documentation ( since June 18 , 2009 or appengine version 1.2.3 ) the section that said : “ To do asynchronous calls you have to use the special modul from the urlfetch modul “ .
Have fun with the improved example .
from google.appengine.api import urlfetch class InfoItem ( dict ) : '' ' dict with start reading while __init__ the ipinfodb ''' def __init__ ( self , url ) : self.rpc = urlfetch.create_rpc( ) urlfetch.make_fetch_call(self.rpc , url ) def ready ( self ) : ''' Check if the async call is ready .
@return
True - if got data after parsing ''' try : result = self.rpc.get_result ( ) except urlfetch .
Error , ex : logging .
error ( " Error while fetch : %s " % ex ) return False if result.status_code != 200 : return False return self.parse( result.content ) #ready # InfoItem
For easy access the result class is based on a python dict .
To check if the api data is filled in the dict call the ready ( ) function .
You can build the instances of InfoItem , do something other and then ask the instances with the ready - function , if the data has arrived ( if not it will wait ) .
Accessing the values is easy because it ’s a dict .
Parsing XML data with python
xml should be parsed with the elementtree modul .
Its very fast and simple to use .
Using the InfoItem class there are two jobs : building the url to the api by simple adding the ip string and parsing the content .
import xml.etree.ElementTree as etree from xml.parsers.expat import ExpatError class IpInfoDbItem ( InfoItem ) : ''' Simple parsing the content of the IpInfoDP - API ''' def __init__ ( self , ip ) : '' ' Init with the IpInfoDb- url ' ' ' super ( IpInfoDbItem , self ) .
__init__ ( " http://ipinfodb.com/ip_query.php?ip= " +ip ) def parse ( self , content ) : ''' Parse the IpInfoDb - XML and save the keys in the inner dict .
@return
True - if parsing was successfull . ''' try : #etree needs a file - like - object instead a string !
t = etree.ElementTree( ).parse ( StringIO.StringIO( content ) ) self.update ( {' name ' : ' ipinfodb ' , ' country ' : t.find ( " CountryName " ) . text or '' , ' city ' : t.find ( " City " ) . text or '' , ' lat ' : float ( t.find ( " Latitude " ) . text ) , ' long ' : float ( t.find ( " Longitude " ) . text ) } ) return True except ( ExpatError , IOError ) , ex : logging .
warn ( " Nothing parsed : %s " % ex ) return False #parse # IpInfoDbItem # Test the code directly ( if google modules are in the path ) testing = IpInfoDbItem ( " 127.0.0.1 " ) if testing .ready ( ) : print testing # {'lat ' : 0.0 , ' country ' : ' Reserved ' , ' name ' : ' ipinfodb ' , ' long ' : 0.0 , ' city ' : None}
The example starts fetching the data from the IpInfoDb - API in the __init__ function , parses the xml und fills the values in the dict with self .
update .
Parsing non-structured data with python
The same hint like in php – use regular expressing for matching the data !
import re class HostIpItem ( InfoItem ) : '' ' dict with reading while __init__ the hostip ''' def __init__ ( self , ip ) : super ( HostIpItem , self ) .
__init__ ( " http://api.hostip.info/get_html.php?position=true&ip= " +ip ) def parse ( self , content ) : ''' Parse the HostIp - Text and save the keys in the inner dict .
@return
True if parsing was successfull . ''' match = re.search ( " Country :\s +(.*? ) \( \w + \ )
City :\s +(.*?)
Latitude : (-*\d+\.\d+)
Longitude : (-*\d+\.\d+ ) " , content , re .
S|re.I ) if match : self.update ( {' name ' : ' hostip ' , ' country ' : match.group ( 1 ) , ' city ' : match.group ( 2 ) , ' long ' : float ( match.group ( 4 ) ) , ' lat ' : float ( match.group ( 3 ) ) } ) return
True return False #parse # HostIpItem
Works like the xml example …
Build a complete webapplication
To put this together you have to define a RequestHandler , who fetches the data and produces a javascript .
In django style you need the following template , the values in {{ x }} will be replaced with a dict .
var com = com||{} ; com.unitedCoders = com.unitedCoders||{} ; com.unitedCoders.geo = com.unitedCoders.geo||{} ; com.unitedCoders.geo.ll
= {{ ll_json }} ; {{ maxmind }} {{ wipmania }} {{ google }} document .
write ( '< script type = " text / javascript " src= "
http://pyUnitedCoders.appspot.com/geo_func.js "></script>' ) ; com.unitedCoders.geo.staticMapUrl = function( x , y ) { var url = " http://maps.google.com/staticmap?key={{ google_key }}&size= " +x + " x " +y + " & markers= " ; var colors = [ " blue " , " green " , " red " , " yellow " , " white " , " black " ] ; for ( var i=0 ; i< com.unitedCoders.geo.ll.length;i++ ) { var s = com.unitedCoders.geo.ll[i ] ; url += s.lat+ " , " +s.long + " , mid " +colors [ i ] +( i+1 ) + " %7C " ; } ; url += this.getLat( ) + " , " +this.getLong ( ) + " , black " ; return url ; } ;
from google.appengine.ext import webapp from google.appengine.ext.webapp.util import run_wsgi_app from google.appengine.ext.webapp import template class GeoScript ( webapp.RequestHandler ) : def get ( self ) : ''' Get the location infos for the calling ip ( from api ) . ''' self.response.headers [' Content - Type ' ] = ' text/plain;charset=UTF
-8 ' #result - dict and local location list result = {} ll = [ ]
# Start fetching API data ipInfo = IpInfoDbItem ( ip ) host Ip = HostIpItem ( ip ) # Add some more Javascrip APIs scriptTemp = " document.write ( '< script type= \ " text / javascript\ " src=\ " %s\ " ></ script >' ) ; " result [ ' maxmind ' ] = scriptTemp % " http://j.maxmind.com/app/geoip.js " result [ ' wipmania ' ] = scriptTemp % " http://api.wipmania.com/wip.js " if self.request.get ( " key " ) : result [ ' google_key ' ] = self.request.get ( " key " ) result [ ' google ' ] = scriptTemp % \ ( " http://www.google.com/jsapi?key= " + self.request.get ( " key " ) )
# Get the fetched API Data if ipInfo.ready ( ) : ll.append(ipInfo ) if hostIp.ready ( ) : ll.append(hostIp ) result [ ' ll_json ' ] = encoder .
JSONEncoder ( ).encode ( result [ 'll ' ] )
# Put all together in the javascript template path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__ ) , ' geo.temp ' ) self.response.out.write(template.render( path , result ) ) # get # GeoScript application = webapp .
WSGIApplication ([ ('/geo_data.js ' , GeoScript ) ] , debug=True )
For more information on how to start a python google appengine Webapplication start reading the fine google documentation !
conclusion
Do n't mix too many languages - you will be confused !
The parallel implementation of the server side script in php and python and using one version for the advanced functions in javascript will mix three script language !
My first failures have been setting some semicolons in python or forgetting the block parentheses in javascript .
After deploying and watching a server side script with the dashboard of google 's appengine you get all data : Logs and API - calls in detail , you can manage many different versions ( default is one ) or give deploy access to other google accounts :
That 's great !
What is the best service provider ?
I have done some caching and checked all five API results .
Here is the hit rate for the location of visitors of this blog and the distance to the center from the given locations ( The center is the average of all long / lat values pairs with a given city value per ip ) .
Service Provider lat / long per ip city per ip distance to center maxmind 86 % 85 % 123 km WIPmania 89 % 0 % 1059 km google 48 % 0 % 197 km IPinfoDB 98 % 91 % 168 km hostip 35 % 53 % 404 km
HostIP and google do not offer location data for many visitors .
IPInfoDB and MaxMind do not have the same positions ( like suggested in the comments ) for all IPs .
At this time WIPMania mainly offers the center of the country .
So the positions are not very accurate ( in comparision to the calculated center ) .
How calculate the distance between lat / long values ?
I found some nice functions in javascript ( please do n't add functions to the prototype to String and Integer !!! ) , in python the distance function looks like the following lines :
def distance ( lat1 , long1 , lat2 , long2 ) : return 6378.7 * math.acos(math.sin(lat1/57.2958 ) * math.sin(lat2/57.2958 ) + math.cos(lat1/57.2958 ) * math.cos(lat2/57.2958 ) * math.cos(lon2/57.2958 - lon1/57.2958 ) ) #distance
Mexican lawmakers and experts on Monday began a first debate on the legalization of marijuana as part of a possible strategy to tackle the country ’s powerful drug cartels .
The five - day forum takes place with the death toll from the country ’s drug violence at around 7,000 people killed since the start of last year in mounting attacks amid a military crackdown on the cartels launched by President Felipe Calderon .
Discussions will focus on the possible impact of cannabis legalization on drug violence and public health and drug consumption , the opposition Social Democratic Party , which supports decriminalization , said in a statement .
The debate starts two months before legislative elections and three days ahead of a visit to Mexico by U.S. President Barack Obama , in which Mexico ’s drug cartels are likely to be top of the agenda .
Mexico ’s Congress three years ago passed a bill decriminalizing possession of small amounts of drugs intended for recreational use but , following pressure from the United States , then president Vicente Fox sent the legislation back .
Calderon ’s government has signaled that it wants to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of drugs .
– Article from The Province .
Early next year , the Southern California town of Carlsbad will break ground on a plant that each day will turn 50 million gallons of seawater into fresh drinking water .
The $ 320 million project , which would be the largest desalination plant in the Western Hemisphere , was held up in the planning stages for years .
But a protracted drought helped propel the project to its approval in May -- a sign of how worried local authorities are about water supplies .
" Water is going to be very short until you have a new source , " said Carlsbad Mayor Claude Lewis .
" And the only new source is desalination , I do n't care what anybody says . "
The desalination plant would use water that flows by gravity from the ocean across a manmade lagoon and into the facility through 10 large pumps .
The plant would then blast it through a filter , extracting fresh water and leaving behind highly pressurized salty water .
The process would provide enough water for 300,000 people each day .
Government agencies have opposed desalination because of the process 's energy consumption .
The desalination plant would use nearly twice as much energy as a wastewater - treatment plant available in Orange County .
Environmental groups also object because fish and other organisms are likely to be sucked into the facility .

When protesting a measure that is all about human lives and violent attacks upon the same ( no matter how much you overlook that meritorious point ) , it 's probably best to stay away from imagery that looks very close to a portrait of a human falling back into a pool of his or her own fluids :
Because while it might be easy for you all , per your fear - mongery wont , to see someone who 's slipping on the sneaky ice of liberalism , some of us can't help but see an LGBT person who 's been pushed for no other reason than the dangerous , hurtful , stigmatizing messages that tell society that his or her life and the protection thereof constitute some sort of " slippery slope . "
What can we say ?
Guess we 've just had one two many friends who 've mysteriously " slipped . "
Yours in firm but fair " culture war " challenges , Good As You
Well , at least they did n't put a target on him .
Nor did they show the actual fatal blow , or blood splattering .
We know that they " target " this kind of imagery at people who they also mislead into believing that hate crimes legislation has nothing to do with violence .
But you have to wonder if they also , subliminally maybe , expect that at least some of us who see it will take it as something of a threat .
Or worse , a bad joke .

This is really strange .
" Slippery Slope " is a logical fallacy - I have absolutely no clue as to what these retards are implying here .

Is there a secret gay mole graphic designer working for the far right groups in this country ?
First the " call 2 fall " blowjob stickfigure and now this ...
And is there any accountability by their followers , or by those of us that oppose this fraud ?
The Call2 Fall was supposed to involve 8 million " Christians " and bring about a U.S. " revival " and somehow encourage God to intervene in our politics .
Um , that was back on July 4 and as far as I know the only thing that intervened was Tony Perkins ' hand in lots of people 's wallets .
And this sloppy " slippery slope " argument , can we go back and do a little research on the other times it was used to try to deny us everything from the ability to have sex in private with our husband ( a slippery slope to " man-on - dog " ! ) to not having our children taken away from us because we 're gay ( a slippery slope to recruiting for NAMBLA ! ) ?
This lack of historical knowledge is my pet peeve , and I think a great idea for documentary .
History is blindingly clear about how wrong these statements have been and continue to be , in reference to LGBTs and other repressed groups .
One of us ought to lay it out .
Any takers , G - A - Y 'ers ?
There were fresh calls today for a formal inquest to be held into the death of Government scientist David Kelly .
A group of campaigning doctors have produced a report arguing that the Hutton Inquiry 's finding of suicide was flawed and have handed it to lawyers preparing a legal challenge .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Dr Kelly 's body was found six years ago on Friday in woods near his Oxfordshire home after he was exposed as the source of a BBC report on the grounds for going to war in Iraq .
Instead of a coroner 's inquest , Lord Hutton was asked by then Prime Minister Tony Blair to conduct an investigation .
His inquiry concluded the 59 - year - old died from blood loss as a result of cutting his wrist with a blunt gardening knife .
According to the team of 13 specialist medics , however , a cut to the ulnar artery was " highly unlikely " to have caused enough bleeding to kill Dr Kelly .
Autopsy reports should be provided to enable their questions to be answered , the doctors added .
One of the authors , retired consultant in orthopaedic and trauma surgery David Halpin , said previous examinations into Dr Kelly 's death were " flawed " .
Lord Hutton was charged with inquiring into the circumstances surrounding the death and not the cause itself and his inquiry did not have the same legal standards as a coroner 's inquest , he said .
" Due process has been subverted , " he said .
" The group that I am part of is not prepared to let that go .
There is evidence of a cover - up . "
Mr Halpin , 69 , who lives in Devon , described Dr Kelly as a " skilled " and " courageous " man who deserved a " proper inquest " .

He said : " He was a very prominent germ and chemical warfare expert .
That is relevant because of his knowledge of the biology of death .
He had spent 10 years at Porton Down ( a Government laboratory ) and he knew everything about killing things .
" So to take what was said to be a blunt knife and what was alleged to be his wife 's co-proxamol tablets to try to kill himself is extraordinary .
I think it 's highly likely he was assassinated . "
The doctors ' report setting out their rejection of the theory Dr Kelly died of a haemorrhage will also be sent to Sir John Chilcot 's forthcoming inquiry into the Iraq War .
Liberal Democrat MP
Norman Baker , who published a book about Dr Kelly 's death two years ago , backed the doctors ' campaign .
He said : " There are three aspects of 2003 which need to be put to bed .
" There needs to be a proper inquiry into the Iraq War , there needs to be a proper inquest into Dr Kelly 's death and there needs to be some recognition of his outstanding work .
" All we are asking for is proper legal process - we have not had it yet . "
The calls come ahead of the screening in London of a documentary featuring Dr Kelly 's work .
Investigative journalist Bob Coen 's film Anthrax War will be shown at the Frontline Club on Friday - the anniversary of Dr Kelly 's death .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A Berlin brothel has come up with a novel way to negate the impact of the global economic crisis and target a new group of customers at the same time -- offering a discount to patrons who arrive on bicycles .
“ The recession has hit our industry hard , ” said Thomas Goetz , owner of the “ Maison d’envie ” brothel .
“ Obviously we hope that the discount will attract more people , ” he added .
“ It ’s good for business , it ’s good for the environment -- and it ’s good for the girls . ”
Customers who arrive on bicycle or who can prove they took public transportation get a 5 - euro ( $ 7 ) discount from the usual 70 - euro ( $ 100 ) fee for 45 minute sessions , Goetz told Reuters .
He said the environmentally friendly offer was working .
“ We have around 3 - 5 new customers coming in daily to take advantage of the discount , ” he said , adding the green rebate has helped alleviate traffic and parking congestion in the neighborhood .

Barbie song appeal strikes an off note for high court
By Bill Mears
CNN Washington Bureau
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court rejected a chance Monday to delve into the world of pop music and pop culture , declining to hear a trademark case involving a song about the perky blonde Barbie doll .
The justices refused to hear a complaint from the maker of the doll , claiming lyrics in a pop song hurt Barbie 's image and the marketing of what the company calls " one of the most successful brands in history . "
The song , by a Danish group called Aqua , includes the lyrics , " I 'm a blonde bimbo in a fantasy world / Dress me up , make it tight , I 'm your doll . "
Aqua 's record company , MCA , says the song and album sold about 1.1 million copies , and it was a top 40 hit in the U.S. and Europe .
The group disbanded in August 2001 .
Lawyers for the label claim the song is a parody protected by Constitution 's guarantee of free speech and expression .
But toy company Mattel claimed in court the song lyrics " associate sexual and other unsavory themes with Mattel 's Barbie products . "
Mattel 's attorneys claimed children would be confused , believing the song was somehow linked to the actual Barbie doll , which the company says " encourages girls to be anything they want . "
Mattel also alleged MCA marketed the song at children .
In a trademark dilution lawsuit , Mattel sought monetary damages .
MCA later countersued .
A federal district judge had ruled for the recordmaker , saying , " Even if the song were considered vulgar as Mattel purports , it is a parody of the ' party girl ' image Barbie may already have among some members of the general public .
Absent stronger evidence that the song actually tarnishes Barbie 's image , plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on its trademark dilution claims . "
An appeals court agreed , with Judge Alex Kozinski saying , " With fame often comes unwanted attention . "
Noting the often bitter tone taken by companies in this five - year legal battle , Kozinski ordered both sides to behave .
" The parties are advised to chill , " he said in his ruling .
The case is Mattel v. MCA Records , No. 02-0633 .
For months we have been seeing various renderings and spy shots as well as hearing tidbits of leaked information concerning the Ferrari F430 replacement .
It has commonly been referred to as the Ferrari F450 .
However , we now have the official announcement on Maranello ’s latest wondercar and it goes by the name Ferrari 458 Italia .
Although we wo n’t get to see this car up close and personal until the Frankfurt Motor Show in September , we do have the official details as well as the first concrete pictures of this supercar .
The new direct - injection mid-rear mounted 4.5L V8 is seriously potent with 570 horsepower and 398 lb- ft of torque , of which , 80 % is available at 3,250 rpm .
This brilliant engine is mated with a 7 - speed dual clutch gearbox sending power to the rear axle .
Similar to the outgoing Ferrari F430 , the new 458 Italia has an aluminum frame which provides a very low dry weight of only 3,042 pounds .
So , what ’s the real story here ?
The Ferrari 458 Italia now has the distinction of being the first production model capable of breaking the 200 mph barrier with a top speed of 202 mph .
And the sprint from 0 to 62 mph takes only 3.4 seconds .
Even though this car is much more powerful that the aging F430 , the 458 Italia is more fuel efficient with a combined rating of 17.1 mpg as well as significantly reduced CO2 emissions .
Here is the full press release :
ITALIA – Ferrari ’s innovative new V8
The 458 Italia is the latest incarnation of the mid-rear engined berlinetta and will be unveiled at the next Frankfurt Motor Show
Maranello , July 28th 2009 –
While it ’s true that every Ferrari is innovative by definition , it ’s equally true that in the course of the Prancing Horse ’s history , certain cars have marked a genuine departure from the current range .
This is very much the case with the Ferrari 458 Italia , which is a massive leap forward from the company ’s previous mid-rear engined sports cars .
The new model is a synthesis of style , creative flair , passion and cutting - edge technology , characteristics for which Italy as a nation is well - known .
For this reason Ferrari chose to add the name of its homeland to the traditional figure representing the displacement and number of cylinders .
The Ferrari 458 Italia is a completely new car from every point of view : engine , design , aerodynamics , handling , instrumentation and ergonomics , just to name a few .
A two - seater berlinetta , the Ferrari 458 Italia , as is now traditional for all Ferrari ’s road - going cars , benefits hugely from the company ’s Formula 1 experience .
This is particularly evident in the speed and precision with which the car responds to driver inputs and in the attention focused on reducing internal friction in the engine for lower fuel consumption than the F430 , despite the fact that both overall displacement and power have increased .
However , Ferrari ’s track experience makes its presence felt in the 458 Italia not only in terms of pure technological transfer but also on a more emotional level , because of the strong emphasis on creating an almost symbiotic relationship between driver and car .
The 458 Italia features an innovative driving environment with a new kind of steering wheel and dashboard that is the direct result of racing practice .
Once again input from Michael Schumacher – who was involved from the very start of the 458 Italia project – played an invaluable part .
The Ferrari 458 Italia ’s Pininfarina design provides further evidence of the complete departure from the past that this new car hails .
The Ferrari 458 Italia has a compact , aerodynamic shape , underscoring the concepts of simplicity , efficiency and lightness that inspired the project .
As with every Ferrari , the car ’s styling has been very heavily influenced by the requirements for aerodynamic efficiency , as can be seen from the downforce of 140 kg at 200 km / h generated by the new model .
The front features a single opening for the front grille and side air intakes , with aerodynamic sections and profiles designed to direct air to the coolant radiators and the new flat underbody .
The nose also sports small aeroelastic winglets which generate downforce and , as speed rises , deform to reduce the section of the radiator inlets and cut drag .
The new 4499 cc V8 is the first Ferrari direct injection engine to be mid-rear mounted .
It has a very low piston compression height typical of racing engines which contributed to achieving its compression ratio of 12.5:1 .
Equipped with the traditional flat - plane crankshaft , the engine delivers 570 CV at 9000 rpm and , with an outstanding power output of 127 CV / litre , sets a new benchmark not only for the whole Ferrari range and the history of company , but also for the entire market segment .
Maximum torque is 540
Nm at 6000 rpm , over 80 per cent of which is available from 3250 rpm .
Specific torque is a record 120 Nm / litre .
However , what is truly extraordinary is the amount of torque available while still maintaining high levels of power at low revs .
The car ’s soundtrack is also typical Ferrari , with an exciting , powerful growl emerging from the engine before it channels through to the exhaust ’s three rear tailpipes .
The 458 Italia is equipped with the seven - speed dual - clutch transmission which increases performance whilst providing very smooth shifts even at full throttle .
The engineers have developed specific , sportier gear ratios to match the power and torque curves of the new V8 , guaranteeing high torque even at lower engine speeds and allowing the car to reach its maximum speed in top gear .
This new Ferrari is also a major leap forward when it comes to cutting emissions .
Despite the fact that the new engine is significantly more powerful than the V8s that preceded it , the Ferrari 458 Italia produces just 320 g/ km of CO2 and fuel consumption is 13.7 l/100 km ( combined cycle ) , the best in the entire segment .
The engineers also focused on weight reduction during the design phase for similar reasons .
Consequently , the Ferrari 458 Italia has a dry weight of 1380 kg with a power - to - weight ratio of 2.42 kg/ CV .
Weight distribution is also optimal with 58 per cent over the rear axle .
The result of the engineers ’ endeavours can be summed up in to two simple statistics which together perfectly encapsulate the Ferrari 458 Italia ’s exceptional performance : 0-100 km/h acceleration in under 3.4 seconds and a maximum speed in excess of 325 km/h .
For the new chassis , once more in aluminium , Maranello ’s engineers incorporated various types of advanced alloys along with aerospace industry - derived manufacturing and bonding techniques .
With regard to vehicle dynamics , the Ferrari 458 Italia ’s suspension features twin wishbones at the front and a multi- link set - up at the rear tuned for maximum roadholding and superlative handling .
Along with a more direct steering ratio , the 458 Italia thus offers extremely rapid turn - in and body control whilst maintaining superior ride comfort .
The integration of the E - Diff and F1 - Trac ( now controlled by the same ECU ) and their respective mappings is even greater , resulting in a 32 per cent increase in longitudinal acceleration out of corners compared to previous models .
The evolution of the control logic , with even faster and more accurate calculation of levels of grip , ensures even greater roadholding , better handling and ease of control on the limit .
The same ECU also governs the high - performance ABS , providing even more precise control over the logic threshold and greater efficiency .
The brakes also feature a prefill function whereby the pistons in the callipers move the pads into contact with the discs on lift off to minimise delay in the brakes being applied .
This combined with the ABS has cut the 100 - 0 km/h braking distance to a mere 32.5 metres .
The Ferrari 458 Italia ’s interior is another area of the car that exalts its sporty personality .
The driver is welcomed by a new layout and a revolutionary ergonomic interface where the main controls are all clustered on the steering wheel .
With the Ferrari 458 Italia , Maranello has brought a highly distinctive new car to its 8 - cylinder range .
The company now offers two models that share a common , race - derived DNA , both exceptionally sporty and fun to drive in true Ferrari tradition , but aimed at two very different kinds of client .
While the Ferrari California was created for owners requiring a more versatile sports car with a practical edge , the 458 Italia is designed for owners for whom the priority is uncompromising on - road performance with occasional track day capability , but who still demand a car that is useable in day - to - day driving like all Ferrari ’s recent models .

The United States believes that it must have a sizable military base in Central Asia to support the NATO mission in Afghanistan , especially now that supply routes through Pakistan are perilous .
The American installation on the outskirts of the Kyrgyz capital is crowded with C - 17 cargo planes and KC - 135 tanker planes that readily reach the Afghan skies for mid-air refueling of fighters .
As many as 30,000 military personnel cycle through the base monthly .
Those troops and planes have stirred deep unease in the Kremlin , which tried to persuade Mr. Bakiyev to oust the Americans , in the end unsuccessfully .
Central Asia is Moscow ’s former territory and current backyard , and the Kremlin evinces a sense of entitlement here , not to mention a desire to dominate natural resources .
At the same time , the Russians seem torn over the American venture in Afghanistan .
They understand that failure could threaten even Russia , which has grappled with Islamic extremism in its south , so they have allowed American military goods to flow across Russia .
The Kremlin also can sympathize with Washington ’s plight , given painful memories of the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan .
Still , the Kremlin fears that the United States is setting down lasting roots in Central Asia .
Russia ’s role in the former Soviet republics has been a constant source of friction between the two sides .
Just last week , Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited Ukraine and Georgia and rebuked Russia for its “ 19th - century notion of spheres of influence . ”
The other major player in Central Asia is China , which is also wary of the spread of Muslim fundamentalism .
The Chinese concerns were underscored in recent weeks by the uprising by Uighurs , a Muslim ethnic group , in the Chinese region that borders Central Asia .
Chinese companies are also investing billions of dollars in Central Asia .
American drone strikes are finding their targets in Pakistan through a series of infrared homing beacons , Al Qaeda alleges in a new online publication .
The American and Pakistani intelligence services credit U.S. unmanned aircraft with decimating the ranks of terrorist and insurgent operatives in Pakistan .
" Very frankly , it ’s the only game in town in terms of confronting and trying to disrupt the Al Qaeda leadership , " CIA director Leon Panetta said in May .
The unmanned aircraft have supposedly carried out 28 attacks on suspected militants , just since the start of the year .
Hundreds have been killed , including as many as 45 more people in a series of strikes today .
But how the killer drones find their targets has been a matter of some dispute .
Local Taliban commander Mullah Nazir , himself an occasional target , says they ’re guided by SIM cards , installed in militant cell phones .
Area tribesman talk of homing devices , planted by informants , that are capable of signaling American aircraft .
In * The Ruling Concerning Muslims Spies* , an internet - distributed book written by self - styled theologian and emerging Al Qaeda leader Abu Yahya al - Libi , warns readers of American infrared devices which he claims directs the attacks on Al Qaeda and its allies .
" These result in the firing of the murderous and destructive missiles whose wrath is inflicted on the Mujahedeen and the weak , " he writes .
Then he provides " photos of some of the devices the spies painstakingly transport to the targets they are assigned by their infidel patrons . "
The pictures of the " chips with 9 volt batteries " provided in the book ( see photo , above ) bear a sharp resemblance to the Phoenix and Pegasus models of infrared flashing beacons made by Cejay Engineering .
The devices are used by the U.S. military , among others , to identify friend from foe , mark drop zones , and outline perimeters .
The gadgets use LEDs , powered by a 9 volt battery , to emit beacons of infrared light that are visible only through night vision equipment .
A six - second memory can be programmed to flash in Morse - type codes and other sequences .
The lights can be seen at " distances of over five miles and can also be seen through clothing and underwater , " according to one distributor .
from a distance of up to five miles .
They can weigh as little as a half - ounce , are as small as an inch - and - a- quarter , and have a battery life of nearly 100 hours .
The Phoenix family of infrared beacons have been in use since 1984 , making them the “ the most widely used electronic Combat ID system in the world . "
American Predator and Reaper unmanned aircraft are both equipped with infrared cameras , making such beacons a natural drone signaling mechanism .
And because the devices are relatively simple and cheap – less sophisticated models can be purchased online for as little as $ 25 each – they can be handed out to informants , without fear of compromising clandestine , sophisticated American technology .
" Transmitters make a lot of sense to me , " former CIA case officer Robert Baer previously told about the general notion of beacons guiding in drone strikes .
" It is simply not possible to train a Pashtun from Waziristan to go to a targeted site , case it , and come back to Peshawar or Islamabad with anything like an accurate report .
The best you can hope for is they ’re putting the transmitter on the right house . "
In April , 19 year - old Habibur Rehman made a videotaped " confession " of planting such devices , just before he was executed by the Taliban as an American spy .
“ I was given $ 122 to drop chips wrapped in cigarette paper at Al Qaeda and Taliban houses , ” he said .
If I was successful , I was told , I would be given thousands of dollars . ”
But Rehman says he did n’t just tag jihadists with the devices .
" The money was good so I started throwing the chips all over .
I knew people were dying because of what I was doing , but I needed the money , " he added .
Which raises the possibility that the unmanned aircraft — America ’s key weapons in its covert war on Pakistan ’s jihadists and insurgents — may have been lead to the wrong targets .

This year , DeSena decided to experience the death race as a participant .
For the 2009 running , set for the last weekend in June , he turned over course design to disinterested officials .
He submitted his entry in an unofficial capacity , to avoid depriving less worthy contestants of the prize money .
Of the 57 registrants , 49 arrived , paying a $ 50 entry fee to compete for a $ 2,000 purse .
They ranged in age from 16 to past 50 .
The townspeople welcomed them , for the most part , though somebody did object to the proposed use of an air horn to signal the 4 a.m. start .
“ We enjoy having them here , ” said Ron Colton , whose family has lived in Pittsfield for generations .
“ We would n’t want them every day . ”
The course spanned 10 miles of mountain trails , ravines , lakes , underbrush and a burnt - out thicket known as the Labyrinth .
The physical challenges included digging holes , chopping wood and hauling encumbrances like bicycles , tree stumps and buckets of gravel .
The riddles included naming American presidents , assembling Lego structures from memory and cooking without modern tools .
Each of the 14 tasks was expected to take two hours .
A 24 - hour time limit was set .
Mathematically speaking , the designers considered their course all but impossible .

Four days before the race , Second Lt. Richard Lee of the Royal Marines ( who list among their official values determination , courage and cheerfulness ) arrived in town .
Discharged last November because of a broken leg , Lee had been hiking the mountainous former colonies as a means of rehabilitation .
At 27 , he cut the dashing figure of a gentleman explorer , with a girlfriend in tow .
He weighed in at 143 pounds .
“ We managed to beg , borrow or steal the equipment : an ax , a bicycle , ” Lee said before the race .
Summoning all the bluster his Englishness would allow , he vowed to do his level best against DeSena , saying , “ I ’m going to keep going until I can not physically move . ”
Requiem for Ben Bernanke and his Second " Great Depression "
“ I was not going to be the Federal Reserve chairman who presided over the second Great Depression , ” declared Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke this past Sunday .
Well , he sure had me fooled .
My gut reaction to Mr. Bernanke ’s statement was to recall the famous words of former President Nixon , who said of the Vietnam conflict , “ I ’m not going to be the first American president to lose a war . ”
And we know how that turned out .
Poor Mr. Bernanke .
Does he really not understand his fate ?
I ’ll grant that he was dealt a bad hand – a draw of pure , malevolent evil – by his incompetent predecessor at the Fed , Alan Greenspan .
But when you volunteer to run the nation ’s central bank , you ’re asking for a seat at the table of history .
When history deals , you play the cards that you ’re dealt .
And sometimes history holds all the trumps , if not a few aces up its sleeve .
This past weekend Mr. Bernanke “ appeared stoic at times , ” according to The Wall Street Journal , as he met with 190 people in a town hall - style forum at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City .
Over the course of an hour , at an event moderated by PBS correspondent Jim Lehrer , the Fed chairman answered 20 questions from attendees .
The unusual setting allowed the former Princeton professor to speak outside of his usual comfort zone .
The give - and - take in Missouri – aka “ flyover country ” to many Washingtonians – was far removed from Fed chief ’s normal , well - scripted congressional testimony , or his occasional academic presentations to roomfuls of big shot bankers and professional economists .
Continuing the Nixonian theme , the Kansas City forum was an opportunity to find out what Mr. Bernanke knew , and when did he know it .
Mr. Bernanke defended himself and the Fed against suggestions that he was too eager to aid large financial institutions last fall and winter , while sacrificing the interests of small businesses and everyday American citizens .
“ It was n’t to help the big firms that we intervened , ” argued Mr. Bernanke as he discussed intervening to help the big firms – y’know , the financial firms that are supposedly too big to fail .
Using a Discovery Channel analogy , Mr. Bernanke said , “ When the elephant falls down , all the grass gets crushed as well . ”
Thus did he justify unprecedented levels of federal aid to the very Wall Street banking houses that contributed so mightily to the bubble economy of recent years .
In essence , the Fed had to feed the beast and save the big guys to protect the little guys .
But have the little guys really benefited ?
Mr. Bernanke claimed that he was “ disgusted ” by circumstances under which the Fed rode to the rescue of several large financial firms .
“ Nothing made me more frustrated , ” he said , “ more angry , than having to intervene ” when big banks were “ taking wild bets that had forced these companies close to bankruptcy . ”
Then Mr. Bernanke argued – strangely – in favor of new laws to let financial firms other than banks fail WITHOUT going into bankruptcy .
Huh ?
What ’s wrong with bankruptcy ?
It ’s been around since the days of the Roman Empire .
I practiced bankruptcy law in my pre-Agora career as an attorney .
( I ’m a recovering attorney now . )
I do n’t understand Mr. Bernanke ’s viewpoint at all .
Why should n’t big financial firms go bankrupt when they deserve it ?
OK , there ’s the usual canard : because it would be difficult or impossible for a bankruptcy court to “ unwind ” all the open trades in the sweatshops and boiler rooms of big outfits like AIG .
I disagree .
Mr. Bernanke ’s comment makes me wonder how well he understands the intent ( let alone the history and legal process ) of bankruptcy .
Or does the Fed boss just always default to handing out special deals to the big - money guys ?
Still , I have to give Mr. Bernanke credit for showing up to speak with a couple hundred informed citizens .
The Fed certainly deserves the exposure .
According to a recent Gallup poll , a mere 30 % of Americans believe that the Fed is doing a “ good ” or “ excellent ” job ( down from 53 % as recently as 2003 ) .
About 57 % of Americans believe the Fed is doing a “ fair ” or “ poor ” job .
Indeed , according to Gallup , the Fed is the least - trusted of nine government agencies .
The Fed lags far behind on a list that includes agencies such as NASA and the FBI , as well as traditional bête noires such as the Central Intelligence Agency , the Internal Revenue Agency and the Food and Drug Administration .
Mr. Bernanke ’s tenure at the US central bank faces intense scrutiny , and not just from the serial bashing that he receives from the writers at Agora Financial .
He has only six months left in his term as Fed chairman .
Mr. Bernanke will soon learn whether President Obama will reappoint him to another four - year term or replace him with another Fed chairman wannabe .
Does Mr. Bernanke really want to continue at the Fed ?
Why ?
If Mr. Bernanke does n’t want to preside “ over the second Great Depression , ” as he claims , then he should get the hell out now and try to salvage some measure of his professional reputation – if not his old job and paycheck at Princeton .
Or does Mr. Bernanke want to continue on the pathway of becoming the central bank equivalent of Gen. William Westmoreland ?
The questioners in Kansas City were on the right track .
They certainly raised better issues than we see in the softball questions Mr. Bernanke routinely receives from members of Congress and senators .
Here ’s the key point .
Mr. Bernanke and the Fed had a clear policy choice last fall .
They could do a big bailout or not .
The Fed chose to open Door No. 1 and bail out Wall Street .
This was at the expense of Main Street , let alone the national balance sheet .
But the “ Second Great Depression ” was not going to be stopped so easily .
You do n’t just throw money at a Great Depression , especially money that you do n’t have .
Mr. Bernanke ought to know this , based on his studies of the first Great Depression .
Instead of the bailout last fall , Mr. Bernanke and the Fed should ’ve let the big guys fail .
The Fed should ’ve upset the whole stinking mess on the card table and reset the US monetary system .
The Fed had the chance to make a statement and choose a new path , and to cast the money - changers out of the temple , so to speak .
Mr. Bernanke and the Fed should ’ve allowed the failed banks to go down .
The Fed should ’ve sent the bubble perps down the street to the US Bankruptcy Court in lower Manhattan , along with all their fraudulent paper such as MBSs , CDOs , SIVs , etc .
Would large - scale bankruptcies have been a shock to the US and world financial system ?
Of course .
That ’s the idea .
It would have been very ugly .
But it would ’ve helped to clean up the US economy for a couple of generations .
Would Mr. Bernanke be despised by many people ?
Yep .
Burned in effigy , a la Paul Volker ?
Yes , and it comes with the job .
The Fed chairman should not try to be Mr. Popularity .
By now , almost a year later , we ’d have some semblance of financial finality .
That ’s because bankruptcy courts have the legal power to void bad contracts and discharge unpayable debt .
Instead , we still have the problem of bailed - out zombie banks with massive levels of unmarketable paper and unpayable debt on their books .
Right now , the “ dead banks walking ” are doing little but sucking capital out of the system while the Fed tries to reinflate more bubbles .
Would finance and commerce have proceeded during a banking bankruptcy ?
Yes , because there ’s an entire economy out there , with hundreds of millions of people expressing needs and wants in the marketplace .
If you believe in the basic idea of Capitalism , then you have to believe that we would have adapted , and learned new ways to meet the needs and wants absent the big , failed banks .
And it ’s worth pointing out that plenty of people and companies do business while they ’re in bankruptcy court .
There ’s nothing quite like the stroke of the pen of a federal judge to cut through the crap .
When Ben Bernanke says that he does n’t want to preside over the second Great Depression , he ’s missed a critical point .
He ’s already there .
Whether it was Pres.
Nixon and his policies , mired in the rice paddies in Southeast Asia many decades past , or the current fever - swamps of the Potomac River , there are some bullets that have your name on them .
You ca n’t duck and dodge .
Right now , many years of monetary malpractice are roiling the American economy .
To quote a famous Chicago preacher , “ The chickens have come home to roost . ”
The second Great Depression is happening , and it ’s happening on Mr. Bernanke ’s watch .
Did he really expect to skate through a couple of terms as post - Greenspan Fed chairman and not get blown up ?
Sad to say , Mr. Bernanke bailed out the big banks .
Now the damage is done .
We ’re still in for that “ Second Great Depression . ”
And Mr. Bernanke will forever be associated with it .
Ben Bernanke could have been a heroic figure .
He could have refused the bailout and repudiated several generations of bad monetary ideas .
He could have launched a new movement – something like monetary perestroika in the US – and moved the country ahead into a future of increased productivity and financial solvency .
Instead , Mr. Bernanke is just a bit actor in a historical tragedy .
There ’s no armor against the arrows of fate .
Mr. Bernanke has lost his chance .
Perhaps he can take solace in the words of Robert Louis Stevenson from his classic “ Requiem ” : “ Home is the sailor , home from the sea . ”
That ’s all for now .
Thanks for reading …

for The Daily Reckoning
Gordon Brown tonight said he would not " waver or walk away " from ­Downing Street at the end of a day of surprise ­resignations , a hastily redrafted cabinet reshuffle , and the Labour party facing obliteration in the local elections .
In an extraordinary 24 hours that left political corpses littered across ­Westminster , Brown restored a degree of his authority when no other cabinet ­minister followed James Purnell by quitting in protest , and two critical cabinet figures – David Miliband and John Hutton – decided to shore up Brown 's position rather than join a potential rebellion .
The prime minister , despite being unable to complete the kind of cabinet reshuffle he had wanted , was still defiant , saying : " I will get on with the job .
I have faith in doing my duty ... I believe in never walking away in difficult times . "
Labour rebels were regrouping tonight to mount a fresh assault on his leadership over the weekend in the wake of what are expected to be even worse ­European parliament election results , due to be announced on Sunday night .
They were still maintaining that they could ­collect 70 - 80 signatures on a letter asking the prime minister to step down .
Leading leftwing MPs were planning to hold talks over the weekend with supporters of Alan Johnson , the man most likely to succeed Brown , to see if they can agree a clearer policy agenda , insisting they would not be frogmarched into an empty coronation of a new leader based around personality .
" We are not a cheap date , " said one .
Brown 's fate may be sealed at a meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night , by which time backbenchers will have to show their hand or admit defeat .
But even as the prime minister was ­promoting his team as the best one to haul Britain out of recession , Caroline Flint , the Europe ­minister , ­reversed her decision to stay loyal and announced she was standing down .
In an extraordinary attack , she accused Brown of using her as " little more than female window dressing " .
In a dramatic day at Westminster , with Brown 's chances of survival wavering :
• He was forced to scale back his reshuffle and retain Alistair Darling as chancellor , leaving his protege , Ed Balls , to stay at the children 's department .
• Three cabinet ministers quit – the defence secretary , John Hutton , the transport secretary , Geoff Hoon , and the Welsh secretary , Paul Murphy .
• It emerged that Brown had repaid £ 181.88 to the Commons fees office following further claims about his Commons expenses .
The Daily Telegraph reported he had submitted an electricity bill for his home in Fife which partly covered a period when London was his designated second home .
• Lord Mandelson was in effect appointed deputy prime minister and given the lead role in fighting the recession , when his business department was given an enhanced role .
• Norwich North 's Labour MP , Ian ­Gibson , said he was resigning , prompting a byelection in protest at the way in which he was treated over his expenses .
The Blairite MP Stephen Byers led ­others questioning Brown 's leadership , warning : " I think on Monday Labour MPs will be considering a very important question – is Gordon Brown a winner , or is ­Gordon Brown a loser ? "
With most results in , Labour was heading for third place in the local elections .
Results from councils showed Labour has been wiped off the electoral map in England outside big cities .
The last four county councils held by Labour – Lancashire , Derbyshire , ­Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire – all fell to the Tories .
With 30 of 34 councils declared , Labour had lost 250 seats while the Tories had gained 217 .
The BNP gained its first two county council seats .
Labour came third in the BBC 's estimated projected national vote share in the local elections - the Conservatives are on 38 % , Labour on 23 % , a historic low , the Lib Dems on 28 % , and other parties on 11 % .
No 10 was throughout the day warning Labour backbenchers that if they forced Brown from office , a new prime minister would not withstand the demands to hold a near instant general election that would lead to a Labour wipeout .
No 10 argued Labour 's chances of emerging as a functioning party from this crisis depended on limping through the autumn under Brown 's leadership in the belief that the economy would recover .
It was also said that some of the ministers with the most controversial expenses claims , details of which are still to emerge , have now left the cabinet , so making it easier to restore Labour 's tarnished image .
Speaking at Downing Street , Brown said the political crisis , fuelled by the Westminster expenses scandal , was " a test of everyone 's nerve – mine , the government 's , the country 's " .

The North Korean dictator Kim Jong - il has a passion for cinema .
But he could never find a director to realise his vision .
So he kidnapped one from the South , jailed him and fed him grass , then forced him to shoot a socialist Godzilla .
Now , for the first time , Shin Sang - ok tells the full story of his bizarre dealings with - and eventual flight from - the world ’s most dangerous dictator .
By John Gorenfeld
" The task set before the cinema today is one of contributing to people 's development into true communists ...
This historic task requires , above all , a revolutionary transformation of the practice of directing . "
Kim Jong Il 's On the Art of the Cinema ( 1973 )
" What a wretched fate , " Shin Sang - ok , now 77 , remembers thinking after the meeting with the pudgy man in the grey Mao jacket .
" I hated communism , but I had to pretend to be devoted to it , to escape from this barren republic .
It was lunacy . "
Shin is a film director of legendary stature in his native country - the Orson Welles of South Korea .
He modernised movies at a time when people hungered for art , for escape , following the Korean war .
He and his wife , the well - known actress Choi Eun - hee , were among Seoul 's celebrity set .
But , in 1978 , he fell foul of the frequently repressive government of General Park Chung Hee , who closed his studio .
After making at least 60 movies in 20 years , Shin 's career appeared to be over .
What followed , according to Kingdom of Kim , Shin 's memoir , was an experience that revived his career in an unbelievable way .
Shin and his wife were kidnapped by North Korea 's despot - in - training , Kim Jong - il , who sought to create a film industry that would allow him to sway a world audience to the righteousness of the Korea Workers ' Party .
Shin would be his propagandist , Choi his star .
North Korean apparatchiks have tried to cast doubt on Shin 's story , claiming he willingly defected to North Korea and absconded with millions .
But Korea experts find Shin 's story believable .
Eric Heginbotham , a senior fellow at the US Council on Foreign Relations , is one of many
Kim - watchers who say it 's consistent with what is known about the regime .
Pyongyang now admits it captured 11 Japanese citizens in the late 1970s and 1980s to act as cultural advisers .
Several died in captivity , some in suicides .
Shin 's story is as fantastical as many of his movies .
He writes of being caught trying to escape , and spending four years in an all - male prison camp as a result , left to assume that his wife was dead .
Then , just as suddenly , he was brought into the inner sanctum of Kim Jong - il , the would - be successor to his father , Kim Il - sung , who ruled the country for nearly 50 years .
Shin 's talents then officially fell to the service of North Korea , and he made seven movies before he and his wife made a breathtaking escape in Vienna in 1986 .
Few have escaped to tell of the habits of the North Korean man who is now the most dangerous dictator in the world - armed with nuclear and chemical weapons , and seemingly touched by madness .
There is more than a passing resemblance between Kim and the insatiable Pulgasari , the communist Godzilla rip - off that Shin , at Kim 's request , created for North Korean audiences , which has become a camp curiosity for monster movie aficionados .
Shin says that shortly after arriving in Pyongyang , he made several attempts to escape , and was punished with four years at Prison
No 6 , where he lived on a diet of grass , salt , rice and party indoctrination - " tasting bile all the time , " he writes .
" I experienced the limits of human beings . "
Then , in 1983 , he and his wife were released and reunited at a reception thrown by Kim Jong - il .
Over soft drinks , the top party official finally , incredibly , explained why they were there .
" The North 's film - makers are just doing perfunctory work .
They do n't have any new ideas , " Kim told the couple .
" Their works have the same expressions , redundancies , the same old plots .
All our movies are filled with crying and sobbing .
I did n't order them to portray that kind of thing . "
The couple were stunned .
By 1978 , Kim had become disgusted with his Mount Paektu Creative Group studio .
Although the studio was run on the " monolithic guidance " of party groupthink , Kim told Shin he felt a " profound disappointment " with their work .
In the 1960s , Kim Il - sung 's propaganda machine had created Sea of Blood and The Flower Girl , films that , while regarded as tedious and crude by South Koreans , were products the North was quite proud of , and were based on revolutionary operas .
Sea of Blood is a war hagiography that gives Kim Il - sung exaggerated credit for victories over Japan in the 1930s .
Recently it was still being shown widely in North Korea .
Like Titanic and its schmaltzy My Heart Will Go On , Sea of Blood produced a hit song : My Heart Will Remain Faithful .
" Films should contain musical masterpieces like these , " Kim Jong - il writes in his book , " the fusion of noble ideas and burning passion . "
He spends most of the book entreating actors and directors , whom he compares to generals , to master their craft .
How ?
Sheer party loyalty .
" Actors must be ideologically prepared before acquiring high - level skills , " he writes , recommending a kind of communist method acting .
" No revolutionary actor has ever actually been a Japanese policeman or capitalist . . .
To effectively embody the hateful enemy , the actor requires an ardent love of his class and a burning hostility towards the enemy . "
Kim 's book also suggests that film - makers draw from real life , avoid creating unrealistic movies about " the colourful lives of flamboyant characters " .
And he reveals : " In the final analysis , a director who pins his hopes on finding a ' suitable actor ' is taking a gamble in his creative work .
And no director who relies on luck in creative work has ever achieved real success . "
During the same period , in South Korea , Shin Sang - ok 's studio , Shin Films , had produced a number of box - office hits , including My Mother and the Roomer .
He is best known for a 1968 historical drama called The Eunuch , about concubines and emasculated servants unable to consummate their secret love .
A popular theme in Shin 's films - not unlike the Hollywood weepies of the 1950s - concerns the plight of women chafing under the limits of society 's expectations , such as The Evergreen Tree ( 1961 ) , in which Choi played a reform - minded woman struggling against provincialism to teach rural children how to read and write .
" Though this film does not directly express class consciousness , " writes Korean film critic Kwak Hyun - Ja , " the dedication and faith in the people might be the reason this movie was praised and used as a textbook for acting in North Korea . "
Ten years after writing that book , the playboy author of On the Art of the Cinema sat across the glass table from Shin and Choi , two real film - makers .
He blamed misunderstandings by thoughtless officials for their unfriendly four - year North Korean welcome .
He also apologised for taking so long to get back to them personally , saying it had been busy at the office .
The idea came to Kim , he said , when he heard that Seoul 's repressive , militaristic Park regime had closed down Shin Films .
" I thought , ' I 've got to bring him here ' , " he said .
Infiltrating Shin Films with agents posing as business partners , Kim explained how he lured the two to Repulse Bay , Hong Kong .
First Choi disappeared on a trip to discuss an acting job .
Then , on the way to dinner one night , Shin had a sack filled with a chloroform - like substance pulled over his head .
With that , Kim had imported the best film talent the peninsula had to offer .
But Choi had come to the meeting with Kim prepared , according to her husband 's memoir .
She had purchased a cassette recorder at a nearby market for the party inner circle , and smuggled it past the guards of Kim 's lair .
It lay in her handbag , and before it came to a stop , it taped 45 minutes of the dictator laying out his plans for the two : to serve as role models for his industry , and claim they came to the North for the creative freedom .
To both Shin and Choi , the cassette of Kim's 45 - minute talk was the key to a safe return home - but posed severe dangers as well .
" It was a matter of life or death , " Shin said later , in an interview with a South Korean magazine .
They faced execution if the tape was found .
In North Korea , there are strict rules against recording or filming the top leaders of the party .
After the couple had been released , the tapes were eventually broadcast in South Korea .
But coming home was a long way away .
For now , Shin Films was back open for business - this time in Pyongyang .
" Shall we make Mr Shin one of our regular guests ? "
Kim asked the crowd at a birthday party for one of his generals , after Shin 's career , and life , was given its new lease .
A lot of cognac was being drunk .
The general in question was boasting that he could take Pusan in a week , tops .
Military men marched in a circular review , saluting Kim .
On stage , a bevy of young women jumped up and down screaming : " Long live the great leader ! "
Most jarring of all was when Kim shook his arm and pointed at the display of fawning , saying : " Mr Shin , all that is bogus .
It 's just pretence . "
This puzzling confession , Shin writes , lingered in his mind as he drove in a Mercedes to the new office of Shin Films .
Soon he'd be entrusted with an annual pay cheque of $ 3 m for personal or professional use , even as he formulated an escape plan .
By following the advice for directors in On the Art of the Cinema - " Be loyal to the party and prove yourselves worthy of the trust it places in yourself " - he would hope for some opportunity to escape , maybe during a trip to an Eastern bloc film festival .
Sometimes resigned to his stay , Shin took comfort in his increasing material well - being , and in making movies again .
When it came to choosing subject matter , he told the Seoul Times in 2001 that there were " fewer restrictions than is commonly believed " .
He said he even introduced the first kiss to the military - centric North Korean cinema .
All ideas , however , were approved by Kim Jong - il as arms of his ideology , and were developed in story conferences with him .
The dictator wanted to make crossover movies that would simultaneously project a fearsome image to the world while somehow improving how North Korea was perceived .
Shin was free to fly to east Berlin for location shots - though shadowed by ever - present escorts .
He recalls walking past the US embassy with his wife , who tugged at his sleeve and made a face suggesting they run for it .
" What 's the matter with you ? " he hissed .
" I will not make an attempt unless it 's 100 % certain .
If they caught us , we'd be dead . "
Besides , he was taking his new career seriously , and was eager to get work done .
He even claims that in 1984 he was able to produce the finest film of his career : Runaway , the tragic story of a wandering Korean family of 1920s Manchuria coping with Japanese oppression and the dishonesty of their neighbours .
After that , however , came a very different kind of movie .
Loosely based on a legend of the 14th - century Koryo monarchy , Pulgasari owes much to Godzilla .
Shin invited some monster - movie veterans from Japan to come to his studio , which had swelled to 700 employees , to help with the picture .
When Kim guaranteed their safety , they came to work on Pulgasari , including Kempachiro Satsuma , the second actor to wear the Godzilla suit , who soon dressed up as the lumbering , google - eyed Pulgasari .
Pulgasari is a monster of the people .
When the wicked king oppresses the people , a jailed blacksmith moulds a tiny character out of rice , declaring he will use the last spark of his creative power to bring the doll to life .
As the farmers are starving under the king 's rule , the doll , Pulgasari , eats iron and grows .
The cherubic toddler Pulgasari soon becomes a horned beast whose clawed foot is the size of a person .
And since this is a movie made under the guidelines of On the Art of the Cinema , there are seemingly endless shots of the people 's folk dances .
Finally , Pulgasari leads the farmers ' army in an assault on the king 's fortress - and against thousands of North Korean military troops who were mobilised and dressed up as extras .
Ultimately , the king uses his experimental anti-Pulgasari weapon , the lion gun .
But the enterprising Pulgasari swallows the missile and shoots it back at his oppressors .
Finally , the king is crushed beneath a huge falling column .
Then the movie becomes curiously ambiguous .
The beloved Pulgasari turns on his own people .
Still hungry for iron after his victory , Pulgasari begins eating the people 's tools .
The confusing conclusion seems to find salvation in the spirit of the people .
When the blacksmith 's daughter tearfully pleads with Pulgasari to " go on a diet " , he seems to find his conscience , and puzzlingly shatters into a million slow - motion rocks .
Then , inexplicably , a glowing blue Pulgasari child is born , waddling out of the ocean .
It 's a terrifically bad movie .
On one hand , Pulgasari is a cautionary tale about what happens when the people leave their fate in the hands of the monster , a capitalist by dint of his insatiable consumption of iron .
But it is also tempting to read the monster as a metaphor for Kim Il - sung , hijacking the " people 's revolution " to ultimately serve his purposes .
When the movie was delivered to Kim , he saw it as a great victory .
Trucks pulled up to Shin Films to unload pheasants , deer and wild geese for the movie crew to feast on .
Genghis Khan , or more specifically , John Wayne as Genghis Khan in the notoriously awful The Conqueror , was the inspiration for Shin 's last collaboration with Kim .
Shin had long wanted to make an authentically Mongolian or at least Asian version .
In Kim Jong - il he found a producer who shared his enthusiasm for the subject of invading hordes .
They agreed that this follow - up to Pulgasari would make a good export , even if it did n't meet with the approval of Kim 's father as a tool for thought control .
Plans were made for a joint venture with a company in Austria to distribute the film .
Soon , Kim trusted the director to travel to western Europe for a business meeting .
As a trip to Vienna approached , Shin writes , a plan began to form .
They had no doubts about wanting to leave their comfortable lifestyle .
" To be in Korea living a good life ourselves and enjoying movies while everyone else was not free was not happiness , but agony , " he writes .
Then they boarded a plane for Vienna , never to return to North Korea .
During the trip , Shin and Choi were able to escape with the help of a Japanese movie critic friend .
Meeting him for lunch , they fled by taxi to the American embassy , shaking off one of Kim 's agents in another taxi .
After the embarrassing escape of his star propagandists , Kim Jong - il shelved Pulgasari and every other Shin film .
The monster movie was not seen outside the country until 1998 when , amid a dawning feeling of openness in North Korean , relations with the rest of Asia , another Japanese critic campaigned for its release - as an important work deserving more attention , and a source of box - office dollars for the North 's disastrous economy .
It bombed .
In Seoul , a total of about 1,000 people saw it during its limited release .
Shin Sang - ok remains controversial .
At the Pusan International film festival in 2001 , a screening was planned for his favorite work , Runaway .
But the public prosecutor of Seoul halted the showing by invoking South Korea 's harsh national security law , which bans any action that could benefit the North .
Shin has worked hard to dispel any impression that he remains friends with his ex-executive producer .
In an open letter to the South Korean president following the September 11 attacks , he wrote that his first reaction to the World Trade Centre collapse was that it was in Kim Jong - il 's nature to do the same to Seoul .
Kim Jong - il continues to issue bold words of guidance to his film - makers .
His words are reprinted on a gigantic placard outside the Revolutionary Museum of the Ministry of Culture on the outskirts of Pyongyang : " Make more cartoons . "

Remember the polygon - shaped landforms at Mars north polar region that the Phoenix lander studied ?
The polygons are produced by seasonal expansion and contraction of ground ice , and these shapes have been found in other regions on Mars as well .
New studies of images from the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter indicates that the Martian surface near the equator experienced freeze - thaw cycles as recently as 2 million years ago .
This means Mars had significantly warmer weather in its recent past , and has not been locked in permafrost conditions for billions of years as had been previously thought .
The HiRISE images show polygon - patterned surfaces , branched channels , blocky debris and mound / cone structures .
Dr. Matthew Balme , from The Open University , made the new discovery by studying detailed images of equatorial landforms that formed by melting of ice - rich soils , such as the polygons , branched channels , blocky debris and mound / cone structures .
These are all found in an outflow channel , thought to have been active as recently as 2 million to 8 million years ago .
Since the landforms exist within , and cut across , the pre-existing features of the channel , this suggests that they , too , were created within this timeframe .
All of these features are similar to landforms on Earth typical of areas where permafrost terrain is melting .
“ The features of this terrain were previously interpreted to be the result of volcanic processes , ” said Balme .
“ The amazingly detailed images from HiRISE show that the features are instead caused by the expansion and contraction of ice , and by thawing of ice - rich ground .
This all suggests a very different climate to what we see today . ”
This also means as the shorter the time period since the last warm weather on the planet , the better the chance that any organisms that may have lived in warmer times are still alive under the planet ’s surface .
“ These observations demonstrate not only that there was ice near the Martian equator in the last few million years , but also that the ice melted to form liquid water and then refroze , ” said Balme .
“ And this probably happened for many cycles .
Given that liquid water seems to be essential for life , these kinds of environments could be a great place to look for evidence of past life on Mars . ”

One - Party State watch By Arnold Kling
Dan Balz summarizes the grim demographic statistics .
He quotes Robert Lang of Virginia Tech .
“ There ’s just not enough rural folks and small - city people left in America . ”
For Republicans , the most hopeful statistic is this :
Democrats lost white college graduates by 20 percentage points in 1988 but by four points last November .
Potentially , that is reversible .
You probably have to take it as given that among less educated voters , Democrats will sweep urban minorities and Republicans will sweep rural and small - town whites .
So for Republicans to win , they have to dominate among college - educated voters .
That tells me that Sarah Palin is not the right person to head the ticket .
Of course , I think that the one - party state will be based on more than mere demographics .
I think it will be a case of Democrats systematically rewarding their friends and punishing their enemies , using the increased control over the economy to do so .
I predict that while the Democrats hold power , the share of college - educated people who work for the government will rise dramatically , while the share working in the private sector will fall .
That is why so much of the stimulus is focused on giving money to state governments , even though unemployment already is low among government workers ,
The goal of the “ stimulus ” is to enlarge the constituency that is most likely to vote Democratic .
The dramatic increase in state control over the economy was initiated by George Bush and Henry Paulson .
Ultimately , we can thank them for the one - party state .
Creativity can save the world .
Creativity can save your life .
Yes it ’s that powerful .
It can make you a millionaire ; enchant the lover of your dreams ; take you around the world ; or fill your days with joy and wonder .
Creativity is one of the most in - demand skills required for the jobs of tomorrow .
And yet we get almost no creativity training in school .
It ’s expected that you either have it , or you do n’t .
Read on to find a simple method to begin unleashing your own creative brilliance .
The Incredible Power of Creativity
First , let ’s take a moment to look at the value of creativity .
I consider creativity one of the biggest keys to living an extraordinary life .
Creativity is essentially the ability to think about things in a new way – to take the available resources and find new ways to use them .
It can be used in a variety of artistic ways to create profound new experiences for you and your audience .
And it can also be used to solve difficult problems – like how to design an amazing new product , how to get out of debt , how to cure malaria or how to arrange the most memorable , romantic date ever .
Whenever you have a goal , creativity can help you figure out how to get from here to there faster , cheaper and easier .
If you think about it , there are really very few completely unbreakable laws in the universe .
Strictly speaking there are a handful of things like gravity , the speed of light and so on .
With so few real limitations , we really we have enormous freedom to use our skills , time and resources to accomplish amazing things .
We just have to figure out how .
And that ’s where creativity comes in .
In fact , I think if someone could figure out exactly the right things to do and say , they could even bring about world peace within 30 days .
Think about it …
Everyone has enormous creative potential ; they just have n’t learned how to unleash it .
There is a simple process you can use that overcomes the 3 most common creativity mistakes so you can generate powerful ideas toward whatever goals you ’re working on .
So first let ’s examine the 3 mistakes :
3 Common Creativity Mistakes
1. Lack of Focus :
Some people generate lots of great ideas but because they ’re not directed , they ca n’t be used to accomplish anything meaningful .
At other times , people set out to generate ideas without being really clear about what they ’re trying to achieve .
For example , if you sit down to brainstorm “ How can I make more money ? ” then “ pan handling ” would be a valid solution .
Much better results would come from a focused question like , “ How can I increase my income by 50 % within 12 months ? ”
2. Lack of Time : Like any activity , creativity takes concentrated effort .
Thinking takes time .
But most people just do n’t sit down and spend the time to actively brainstorm solutions to problems .
In fact , this is a big difference between experts and amateurs for many different activities .
The experts often spend more time on projects than amateurs .
Do n’t worry about not having the time to brainstorm .
Brainstorming solutions to life ’s problems pays for itself in more rapidly solved problems .
3. Lack of Subconscious Processing :
It ’s important to recognize that the mind continues to work on problems even when you think you ’re doing something else .
Many famous geniuses have written about this phenomenon and how they used it .
It ’s pretty common for amazing solutions to problems to just pop into someone ’s mind hours or days later when they ’re taking a walk , sleeping , showering or doing just about anything .
But you have to “ prime the pump ” and give it time to work .
Now let ’s get to the process that allows you to do that .
The 3 Step Process for Unleashing Your Brilliance
1. Ask a Question : Grab a fresh sheet of paper or digital document , and write the specific question you ’re trying to answer at the top .
This deliberate start to brainstorming helps focus your mind , and lets you begin to get curious about the answer .
Remember , be specific .
For example , instead of “ How can I build a better mouse trap ? ” ask “ How can I build a mouse trap that catches twice as many mice , is easier to use , and people will gladly pay twice as much for ? ”
2. Brainstorm Solutions :
Now just start writing down possible answers .
Brainstorm !
Do n’t censor yourself at all .
Write every idea down .
You ’ve got to work on impulse and do n’t allow your inner critic , or rational side , to process the answers .
At first you ’ll likely write a lot of obvious answers that also have obvious flaws to them .
They ’re probably too risky , too expensive , too slow or flawed in some other way .
But as you keep rapidly writing , you ’ll start putting down zany ideas that are too crazy to work , like finding a magic lantern , or robbing a bank .
When you keep at it , you ’ll eventually start getting ideas that seem zany at first , but then reveal themselves to be really clever , unique solutions to that specific problem .
You might solve your problem in the first brainstorm , but if not , go on to the next step .
3. Repeat Daily :
This is where you unleash the power of your subconscious mind .
Each day for the next few days , or week or month ( whatever it takes ) , sit down and brainstorm for another 5 minutes .
Again , just throw down as many crazy ideas as you can for answering the question you posed at the top of the page .
Each day you that do this , you ’ll benefit from the work your subconscious has done on the problem during the previous 24 hours .
Even your sleep time is productive for creative problem solving .
Very clever recent studies have shown how sleeping on a problem increases leaps of insight .
Also , each day that you do this , you ’re encouraging your subconscious to look into the problem further , and you increase the odds that a brilliant flash of insight will hit you sometime when you least expect it .
4. Bonus Strategy :
If you ’re really having trouble generating fresh ideas , it might be you ’re just too stuck in repetitive thinking about this topic .
One way to break out of your old patterns of thinking and generate new ideas is to take in very random stimulus and try to apply it to the solution .
You might randomly open a dictionary ( or any book ) , point your finger somewhere on the page and see if you can take that work or phrase and use it in the solution somehow .
So what if it ’s ridiculous !
Write it down .
It ’s stretching your thinking and helping you transition into that really creative way of thinking .
You can also do this by flipping channels , flipping pages of a magazine , finding ‘ objects ’ in clouds , or visiting a toy store or museum .
Take this process to the next level in conjunction with the concepts in my post “ Do Something Extraordinary Before Breakfast Every Day ” .
Now , what areas of your life do you need some creative breakthroughs in ?
Do you need more romance ?
A great product idea ?
New affordable social activities ?
New ways to trim your budget ?
A new look ?
The time to take action is now .

We 've seen Apple ban applications from the App Store for all sorts of ridiculous reasons .
This time , it 's different ; all Google Voice related apps were banned from the app store , and this time Apple - or , more likely , AT&T - has a very good reason to ban them : it 's scared of them .
Google Voice lets you do a lot of stuff for free that the AT&T charges for ; you can place free calls in the US , you can send and receive free SMS messages .
The application is still in beta , invite only stage , but several cool applications that use the service already exist for the iPhone .
Sean Kovacs , the developer of GV Mobile , has said on his site that Apple has rejected the application .
From his site :
" Richard Chipman from Apple just called - he told me they ’re removing GV Mobile from the App Store due to it duplicating features that the iPhone comes with ( Dialer , SMS , etc ) .
He did n’t actually specify which features , although I assume the whole app in general . "
Other similar applications , such as VoiceCentral and GVDialer , have also been banned .
And Google only has an official Google Voice app for the Android and BlackBerry ; now , they 've admitted that they do n't have an iPhone app because Apple said " no " .
The reason ?
The application (s ) is too similar to iPhone 's own functionality .
Like so many other Apple 's app rejection reasons , this one rings phony as well .
If nothing that 's similar to functions and features iPhone already has can get approval , then no VoIP apps should be allowed .
Also no camera - related apps , like Pro Camera .
Fring ?
It lets you place calls , and send free messages , which is similar to SMS , right ?
Why is that OK , then ?
Let 's call a spade a spade here .
There can only be one reason for thoroughly banning Google Voice from the iPhone : AT&T , like every mobile operator , is scared of apps that replicate their own services .
But by banning an app such as Google Voice from the iPhone , Apple and its partner are setting a dangerous precedent .
If the developers cannot be certain that Apple will provide them a fair , free marketplace , they will move elsewhere : to Android and Pre .
After all , why create for a locked - down platform where the owners take the cake and all you 're allowed to get is leftovers ?
Apple and AT&T need to make a decision : is the iPhone their playground , or everyone 's playground ?
If it 's the former , that 's OK , but they should n't get upset if no one wants to play with them .

Comment from reader : " I just read the front page of " The Orarch " and noticed Sidis 's statement about granting to others all rights which you would have them
grant to you .
I believe this idea is the thesis of " A Theory of Justice "
by John Rawls .
He seems to use it as a social contract .
It would seem
quite possible that this principle is one of those that Sidis discovered
but for which he received no credit .

Who : Sean Hannity : The Bully Sean Hannity is the typical bully .
He seems like the kind of person who is making up for being beaten up a lot as a child .
His debating skills are excellent .
His success comes from his natural ability to win an argument regardless of which side he takes .
Journalism Credentials : None available .
According to his bios posted on Foxs web site and his personal web site , Sean has not attended any journalism classes , has no formal training in journalism and has not been a reporter .
He was a talk show host on a college radio station and he made a very successful jump to AM radio .
Indicators : Out of Context Quotes :
This is one of Seans most common tools of deception .
By using partial quotes , or quoting words without explaining the intended message of the person quoted , Sean basically commits slander on an hour by hour basis .
For those of you who do not know what this is , I will try to site some examples in the future .
There is a never ending list of examples but all you have to do to witness this is watch or listen to him for 10 minutes .
It is amazing , once you realize he is doing this you will be stunned at how often he uses this method of deception .
 It is incumbent on broadcasters to add background and context 
BBC Director of News , Richard Sambrook Dismissing Facts :
Whenever someone points out a fact or statistic that works against his point of view he dismisses it .
He questions its validity regardless of the source .
In other words he disregards the truth .
Attack the Messenger :
This might be the most often used tactic of the right wing since Nixon used it so successfully .
Sean spends a great deal of energy searching for any controversial aspect of his interviewee , or the who ever the target of the moment is , so as to discredit the messenger .
In other words when he is scared of the message and he has no way of winning his argument he lashes out at the individual .
Sometimes he uses this preemptively , before any interview starts , he begins by making some accusation , distracting from the topic of discussion .
An example of how this is so wrong to do might be if a convicted murderer saved someone life , the fact that he had murdered in the past has no relevance to the fact that he just saved a life .
The argument , as most of Seans arguments are , is irrelevant .
To paint another picture of how wrong this to do when dealing with journalism you might think of it this way , regardless of Michael Jacksons odd personal life you can not in any way question his musical talent .
Sean would use Michaels personal life to discredit his talent .
It is wrong both technically and morally .
Cut Off and Redirect : Sean constantly stifles people for the purpose of brining up another issue or to make an accusation , usually making use of his skill at presenting out of context information .
Factual Errors Relentlessly Posed as Truth : Seans flagrant disregard for honesty is simply stunning .
He quotes facts that are simply wrong .
It would be a full time job for someone to keep track of his lies .
One example might be the fact that he continually repeats the statement that Sadam gassed 1.5 million of his own people .
Well Sean , wrong as usual .
1.5 million people may have died over the 10 years of war with Iran , but even the US did not sell him THAT much gas !
I can go on , but I have to work on the rest of the site ... check back for updates : -)
Why he is dangerous :
Using his loud mouth , partial truths , and tactics ( see above ) , he has become one of the most listened to radio hosts in America .
Sadly , our less than intelligent American public has been suckered into following this Pied Piper of Pontification .
much like the bad guys in professional wrestling gain a fan base .
A Message : Hey Sean , having an audience does not mean that you have anything meaningful to say .
Case in point , Jerry Springer .
Your claim to fame is a big mouth .
Lets have a little verbal one on one , without commercials , well see how right  you are .
The only reason for your success is due to the fact that the people you interview , no matter how right they are , just dont have your verbal skills .
You are all show , and no substance .

1 Stealthily secure a banana that is ready to eat .
You do n't want one which is too green , or has too many dark spots .
The idea is that your friend or family member will actually want to eat it .

3 Locate one of the seams of the banana , and insert the needle at the starting point .
When bananas are peeled , we usually pull them apart along seams .
This point can be at the top or bottom of the banana .
Chase will keep taking your money after your account is closed Sunday July 26 , 2009
This is an ancient blog post that was written many years ago .
It ’s archived here as a historical curiosity , and is likely to contain bad writing , bad ideas , and broken links .
Please do n’t assume that anything here is still accurate or represents my current opinions .
Earlier this month I paid off a car loan I had through Chase .
You may remember that I ’ve had a few problems with Chase before , so I was happy to finally be finished with them .
Unfortunately Chase was not finished with me .
According to Chase ’s website , my loan was paid off in full on July 6th and the account was closed on the 8th .
On July 9th , I received a letter from Chase notifying me that the account had been “ fully satisfied ” , along with a small overpayment refund check .
On July 21st , 13 days after my account was supposedly closed and 12 days after Chase had informed me in writing that the loan was fully satisfied , Chase withdrew a payment of $ 687.10 from my checking account ( which is at another bank ) .
I noticed the withdrawal late Thursday night and immediately filed a transfer inquiry via Chase ’s website telling them to refund the erroneous charge .
Friday morning I received a response saying that the payment was not erroneous and had been submitted according to my instructions .
I was told to call a 1 - 800 number to request a refund .
I called the number immediately , waded through the usual onerous phone menus , and eventually reached an operator only to discover that I had been given the number for Chase ’s mortgage division , not the auto finance division .
The operator gave me another number , which turned out to be the credit card division .
Finally , after realizing Chase could n’t be trusted even to get their own phone numbers right , I found the correct number on the website and reached a human being .
It was clear as soon as I explained the situation that this was not an uncommon occurrence .
The representative I spoke to told me that Chase had withdrawn the payment because I had not deactivated my automatic loan payments after paying off the loan .
I pointed out that the automatic payment authorization I had given authorized Chase to withdraw payments “ for the life of the loan ” , and that since I had paid off the loan and Chase had informed me the account was closed , I expected the “ life of the loan ” to be complete .
I ’ve paid off three other auto loans through various banks over the years , and this has always been the case .
She countered that Chase ’s interpretation of “ for the life of the loan ” is actually “ for the original terms of the loan ” .
Since it was a 72 - month loan and I had paid it off in 13 months , Chase would continue withdrawing payments for the full 72 months unless I manually canceled the automatic payments .
“ So , if you keep deducting money from a customer ’s account when there ’s nothing for that money to actually pay for , where does the money go ? ” I asked her .
“ It goes into a holding account until the customer calls and asks for a refund , ” she replied .
I pointed out that that ’s exactly what I was doing , and she said that I needed to fax an explanation and a copy of my bank statement showing the withdrawal to Chase ’s research department , which would “ investigate my claim ” .
“ I ’m not making a claim , ” I told her .
“ I ’m telling you to return the money that you stole from my bank account without authorization .
That ’s a fact , not a claim . ”
She launched into another scripted explanation of the meaning of “ for the life of the loan ” and how it ’s the customer ’s responsibility to cancel the automatic payments .
“ So you ’re saying that because Chase is too cheap to develop working software , it ’s Chase ’s policy to hold customers ’ money hostage until the customer proves , to Chase ’s satisfaction , that their money is rightfully theirs ? ”
“ No , you just need to call and ask for a refund . ”
“ I just did that and you told me I have to file a ‘ claim ’ with the research department so that they can ‘ investigate ’ . ”
“ Well…yes … ”
I gave up on the conversation , got the fax number for the research department , faxed them the required information , and have naturally heard nothing back .
My money remains in limbo and , according to the woman I spoke to , may remain in limbo for seven business days before the research department concludes their “ investigation ” , if in fact they even received my fax in the first place .
If I do n’t hear from Chase within the promised seven business days , I plan to contact my bank and dispute the withdrawal as fraudulent .
データベースの運用で避けられないのが、ロック競合によって起こるシステムトラブルへの対応です。「2時までに終わるはずのバッチ処理が朝になっても終わっていない」とか「負荷が高いわけでもないのにシステムが無応答になっている」といったトラブルが発生したとき、DBエンジニアはそれがロック競合によるものなのかどうかを切り分けて、適切に対処しなければなりません。
これま でInnoDBはロック競合に対してほとんど打つ手がなかったのですが、最近ようやく対処方法がでてきました。今日はその手順を確認していきたいと思います。
information_schemaの新しいテーブル InnoDBの最新バージョンでは、information_schemaデータベースに新しいテーブルが7つ追加されています。 mysql > show tables like ' INNO % ' ; +--------------------------------------+ | Tables_in_information_schema ( INNO % ) | +--------------------------------------+
| INNODB_CMP_RESET | | INNODB_TRX | | INNODB_CMPMEM_RESET
| | INNODB_LOCK_WAITS | | INNODB_CMPMEM | | INNODB_CMP | | INNODB_LOCKS | +--------------------------------------+
7 rows in set ( 0.01 sec ) もうお分かりかと思いますが、これらのテーブルからロック状態を取得することができるというわけです。今回はこのうち3つを使います。まずはINNODB_TRXから確認していきましょう。 mysql > desc INNODB_TRX ; +-----------------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------------------+-------+ |
Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-----------------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------------------+-------+ | trx_id | varchar ( 18 ) | NO | | | | | trx_state | varchar ( 13 ) | NO | | | | | trx_started | datetime | NO | | 0000-00-00 00:00:00 | | | trx_requested_lock_id | varchar ( 81 ) | YES | | NULL | | | trx_wait_started | datetime | YES | | NULL | | | trx_weight | bigint ( 21 ) unsigned | NO | | 0 | | | trx_mysql_thread_id | bigint ( 21 ) unsigned | NO | | 0 | | | trx_query | varchar ( 1024 ) | YES | | NULL | | +-----------------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------------------+-------+ 8 rows in set ( 0.00 sec ) mysql > select * from INNODB_TRX order by trx_id\G ***************************
1 . row ***************************
trx_id : F09 trx_state : RUNNING trx_started : 2009-06-17 23:03:18 trx_requested_lock_id : NULL trx_wait_started : NULL trx_weight : 3 trx_mysql_thread_id : 8 trx_query : NULL ***************************
2 . row ***************************
trx_id : F0A trx_state : LOCK WAIT trx_started : 2009-06-17 23:03:21 trx_requested_lock_id : F0A:3:3:9 trx_wait_started : 2009-06-17 23:03:21 trx_weight : 2 trx_mysql_thread_id : 9 trx_query : update emp set sal = sal + 200 where empno = 7788 2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec ) INNODB_TRXは現在実行中のトランザクションを表示するテーブルです。InnoDBが内部で持っているトランザクションID(trx_id)やトランザクションの開始時刻(trx_started)、実行中のSQLがあればそのSQL文( trx_query)が出力されます。InnoDBのトランザクションIDとshow processlistで表示されるスレッドID(trx_mysql_thread_id)との対応づけができるところもポイントです。
次はINNODB_LOCKS です。 mysql > desc INNODB_LOCKS ; +-------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ |
Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | lock_id | varchar ( 81 ) | NO | | | | | lock_trx_id | varchar ( 18 ) | NO | | | | | lock_mode | varchar ( 32 ) | NO | | | | | lock_type | varchar ( 32 ) | NO | | | | | lock_table | varchar ( 1024 ) | NO | | | | | lock_index | varchar ( 1024 ) | YES | | NULL | | | lock_space | bigint ( 21 ) unsigned | YES | | NULL | | | lock_page | bigint ( 21 ) unsigned | YES | | NULL | | | lock_rec | bigint ( 21 ) unsigned | YES | | NULL | | | lock_data | varchar ( 8192 ) | YES | | NULL | | +-------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ 10 rows in set ( 0.01 sec ) mysql > select * from INNODB_LOCKS order by lock_id \G ***************************
1 . row ***************************
lock_id : F09:3:3:9 lock_trx_id : F09 lock_mode : X lock_type : RECORD lock_table : `scott`.`emp` lock_index : `PRIMARY` lock_space : 3 lock_page : 3 lock_rec : 9 lock_data : 0x9E6 C
***************************
2 . row ***************************
lock_id : F0A:3:3:9 lock_trx_id : F0A lock_mode : X lock_type : RECORD lock_table : `scott`.`emp` lock_index : `PRIMARY` lock_space : 3 lock_page : 3 lock_rec : 9 lock_data : 0x9E6C 2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec ) INNODB_LOCKS はロック競合を起こしているトランザクションの情報を表示するテーブルです。待たせている方と待たされている方の両方が出力されます。一方、ロックを取得していても他のセッションと競合していないトランザクションは出力されません。ここでは、どのテーブル(lock_table)のどのインデックス(lock_index)をつかんでいるかが分かるようになっているところがポイントです。
3つ目は、INNODB_LOCK_WAITSです。 mysql > desc INNODB_LOCK_WAITS ; +-------------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ |
Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | requesting_trx_id | varchar ( 18 ) | NO | | | | | requested_lock_id | varchar ( 81 ) | NO | | | | | blocking_trx_id | varchar ( 18 ) | NO | | | | | blocking_lock_id | varchar ( 81 ) | NO | | | | +-------------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
4 rows in set ( 0.00 sec ) mysql > select * from INNODB_LOCK_WAITS\G
***************************
1 . row ***************************
requesting_trx_id : F0A requested_lock_id : F0A:3:3:9 blocking_trx_id : F09 blocking_lock_id : F09:3:3:9 1 row in set ( 0.01 sec ) INNODB_LOCK_WAITSはどのトランザクションがどのトランザクションを待たせているのかを出力するテーブルです。blockingが待たせている方、requestingが待たされている方になります。
ロック競合を表示す るSQL このように 、InnoDBの最新バージョンではロック競合を出力するための部品が十分に揃っています。あとは解析に必要な情報をつなげて出してあげればよいというわけです。例えば以下のようなSQLになるでしょう。 select t_b.trx_mysql_thread_id blocking_id , t_w.trx_mysql_thread_id requesting_id , p_b.HOST blocking_host , p_w.HOST requesting_host , l.lock_table lock_table , l.lock_index lock_index , l.lock_mode lock_mode , p_w.TIME seconds , p_b.INFO blocking_info , p_w.INFO requesting_info from information_schema.INNODB_LOCK_WAITS
w , information_schema.INNODB_LOCKS
l , information_schema.INNODB_TRX t_b , information_schema.INNODB_TRX
t_w , information_schema.PROCESSLIST
p_b , information_schema.PROCESSLIST
p_w where w.blocking_lock_id = l.lock_id and w.blocking_trx_id = t_b.trx_id and w.requesting_trx_id = t_w.trx_id and t_b.trx_mysql_thread_id = p_b.ID and t_w.trx_mysql_thread_id = p_w .ID order by requesting_id , blocking_id \ G 実行結果 (横 ) です。
+-------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+------------+-----------+---------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| blocking_id | requesting_id | blocking_host | requesting_host | lock_table | lock_index | lock_mode | seconds | blocking_info | requesting_info |
+-------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+------------+-----------+---------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | 8 | 9 | localhost :37001 | localhost :37002 | `scott`.`emp` | `PRIMARY` | X | 72 | NULL | update emp set sal = sal + 200 where empno = 7788 | +-------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+------------+-----------+---------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0.01 sec ) 実行結果 (縦 ) です。
***************************
1 . row ***************************
blocking_id : 8 requesting_id : 9 blocking_host : localhost:37001 requesting_host : localhost :37002 lock_table : `scott`.`emp` lock_index : `PRIMARY` lock_mode : X seconds : 86 blocking_info : NULL requesting_info : update emp set sal = sal + 200 where empno = 7788 1 row in set ( 0.00 sec ) ここから 、
8番のスレッドが9番のスレッドを86秒間待たせている
8番のスレッドはempテーブルの主キーを排他ロック( X)している
8番のスレッドは現在アイドル状態である
9番のスレッドはempno = 7788のレコードを更新しようとしている といった情報を読み取ることができます。これはOracle Databaseと遜色のない内容になっており(参考：ロックをつぶせ！
最初に疑うべき原因（1/3） − ＠ IT ) 、ほぼ完璧といってよいレベルです。
それから、今回の例のようにデータベースにTCP/IP経由で接続している場合は、TCPのポート番号からクライアントプロセスを特定することができます。
# netstat - np | grep 37001 tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:37001 127.0.0.1:3306 ESTABLISHED
6105 / mysql tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:3306 127.0.0.1:37001 ESTABLISHED
6000 / mysqld この例では8番のクライアントはmysqlコマンドラインツールであり、プロセスIDは6105番であることが分かります。ここまで分かればあとは該当のプロセスをkillするといった暫定対処や、プログラムを修正するといった本格対処をとることができます。

Ahh ..Linux ..
The superior OS for the superior beings ( no kidding here .. ) , it scares the newbie with the hard to decrypt interface and the hoaxes of less user friendliness by the guys at Microsoft .
But everybody knows that our beloved Tux is far more secure and capable then its Windows sibling .
I am moving on to Linux and the version I have chosen is Puppy Linux .
Hard core Linux geeks will say that I had better choices like Ubuntu and Fedora but its compactness , features and interface is something that got me .
And right now I m posting this post through it .
Puppy Linux is a Live CD Linux distribution that is ultra compact and focuses on ease of use .
Its small ( approx 100 MB ) comes loaded with some cool applications such as SeaMonkey , AbiWord , Gnumeric , and Gxine / xine and can literally boot from any possible media .
However , do n't underestimate Puppy Linux for its sheer size ( something I did .. and I m glad I was proven wrong ) cuz its a full fledged operating system bundled with application suites covering a wide variety of tasks which can be used productively by general users .
Creative users can use it as a rescue system , a demo system or for reviving old ( dinosaur : P ) computers .
Also it features built - in tools which can be used to create bootable USB disks , create new Puppy CDs , or remaster a new live CD with different packages
Overall I found Puppy Linux to be VERY user friendly and a good Linux flavor to migrate from Windows to Linux , and trust me , its worth it .
At the end of the day , its free .. Long live open source .
Download Your flavor of Puppy Linux
Cheers and Keep Learning
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A U.S. - based language monitoring group crowned Web 2.0 as the one millionth word or phrase in the English language on Wednesday , although other linguists slammed it as nonsense and a stunt .
The Global Language Monitor , which uses a math formula to track the frequency of words and phrases in print and electronic media , said Web 2.0 appeared over 25,000 times in searches and was widely accepted , making it the legitimate , one millionth word .
It said Web 2.0 started out as a technical term meaning the next generation of World Wide Web products and services but had crossed into far wider circulation in the last six months .
Other linguists , however , denounced the list as pure publicity and unscientific , saying it was impossible to count English words in use or to agree on how many times a word must be used before it is officially accepted .
There are no set rules for such a count as there is no certified arbiter of what constitutes a legitimate English word and classifying the language is complicated by the number of compound words , verbs and obsolete terms .
“ I think it ’s pure fraud ...
It ’s not bad science .
It ’s nonsense , ” Geoffrey Nunberg , a linguistics professor at the University of California at Berkeley , told reporters .
Paul JJ Payack , president of the Global Language Monitor , brushed off the criticism , saying his method was technically sound .
“ If you want to count the stars in the sky , you have to define what a star is first and then count .
Our criteria is quite plain and if you follow those criteria you can count words .
Most academics say what we are doing is very valuable , ” said Payack .
He has calculated that about 14.7 new English words or phrases are generated daily and said the five words leading up to the millionth highlighted how English was changing along with current social trends .
This list included “ Jai Ho ! ” an Indian exclamation signifying victory or accomplishment , and “ slumdog , ” a derisive term for children living in the slums of India that became popular with the Oscar - winning movie “ Slumdog Millionaire . ”
The list also included “ cloud computing , ” meaning services delivered via the cloud or Internet , “ carbon neutral , ” a widely used term in the climate change debate , and “ N00b , ” a derogatory term from the gaming community for a newcomer .
“ Some 400 years after the death of the Bard , the words and phrases were coined far from Stratford - Upon - Avon , emerging instead from Silicon Valley , India , China , and Poland , as well as Australia , Canada , the U.S. and the UK , ” said Texas - based Payack .

Jerry Seinfeld once joked that if a Martian landed in New York and saw a bunch of humans following behind their dogs , scooping up poop and placing it in little plastic bags , he would conclude that dogs are in charge on this planet .
He would think the same if he observed kids and their dads in any city in America .
And unlike in the Seinfeld example , the Martian would be right .

To commemorate the 40th anniversary of man 's landing on the moon , you can buy yourself a little piece of space history .
On July 16 , the auction house Bonhams is conducting an auction of lunar memorabilia .
The sale includes a number of items that the Apollo 11 mission crew carried onto the moon 's surface on the history - making trip .
Lunar dust still covers some of the lots .
The existence of Holyrood 's secret " banning chamber " is only ever hinted at .
When you bring the subject up , politicians tend to scuttle away , murmuring manically to themselves .
And , like Auld Nick himself , just when you cast doubt on its existence , it appears behind you .
Last week , the sentinels who keep guard over the necromancy of the banning room handed down another of their strange and unusual edicts .
From now on , there shall be no more killing of seals - ever .
These cute and furry marine dwellers are very uncommon across vast swaths of Scotland , probably on account of there being no sea water .
Either that or they have been beaten into oblivion by the nature - hating Visigoths of Calton and the Garngad .
Hence the banning order .
Some of you may have felt that the impending global Armageddon of swine flu may be taxing the brains of all our MSPs , but you 'd be wrong .
It seems the injuring or killing of our seals has been deemed a matter of major concern for the nation just as Scotland is gaining enviable world headlines for saying wise and steadfast things about pig fever .
The welfare of seals is very high on the Green party agenda , and as the Green party has become the conscience of all of Scotland 's politicians , on account of being cute and furry and of no consequence to anyone , their little idiosyncrasies tend to make it on to the Holyrood statute book .
There is a very noble tradition of banning things in the 10 years of the new parliament 's tenure .
Smart , successful Scotland has no peers in the practice of forbidding , forfeiting and classifying .
Our MSPs wasted very little time in using their limited powers to insinuate themselves into the lives of their citizens .
It started when Mike Watson , while representing the people of Castlemilk , brought forward a bill to ban hunting with hounds .
It was Holyrood 's first - ever private member 's bill and it left the good people of this benighted and sprawling arrondissement to Glasgow 's south in a state of bemused fascination .
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in Castlemilk are poverty , drugs , knives and alcohol ; not once have the locals ever heard a huntsman 's bugle .
Yet the only equine menaces that Mr Watson could see were wearing silly hats , red coats and looking for foxes .
After that , it became a feeding frenzy as MSPs and councillors realised how easy it was to ban things .
Soon there was a bill to ban fur farming .
And only after the legislation was passed was it discovered that , er ... there were no fur farms in Scotland .
Nevertheless , they harrumphed , it would serve as a warning to les autres ... just in case anyone was considering the establishment of these obscene rural charnel houses .
And when our politicians discovered what a fat little country we had become they became obsessed about obesity .
Soon , every MSP and councillor in the land was trying to rid us of this national embarrassment .
Fizzy drinks would be banned from schools and hamburgers would be replaced by couscous and guacamole suppers .
Indeed , the selling of lemonade to impressionable youngsters almost became a capital offence .
There was a proposal to rewrite Enid Blyton 's Famous Five books to delete all references to the vile substance .
And not only were we the Fattest Small Nation in the World , we were also , according to Jack McConnell and his acolytes , the Most Sectarian Small Country in the World .
And so an entire range of hate laws was arranged , sorted , packaged and sent to the four corners of the kingdom .
Now the offence of chibbing a fellow citizen would not be deemed to be as serious an offence as chibbing him while calling him a Protestant , Catholic or Anabaptist bastard .
Uttering any of those unspeakably sordid prefixes could see you do two extra years in the pokey .
The forbidders and their fundamentalist acolytes had the fire of righteousness in their gimlet eyes as they sought to place their fiery crosses all over Scotland .
Emboldened by their astonishing banning successes they now sought out the big one : smoking cigarettes .
Even when a nationwide public consultation rejected overwhelmingly an outright ban on smoking in all public places , they still went ahead and did it anyway , fortified by the conviction that , spiritually , they were right and that poor people would thank them in years to come for granting them another 10 years in the urban squalor that a generation of Labour government had bequeathed to them and their children .
Now no one is saying that the roots of the recession in Scotland started when hundreds of small pubs were forced to close as smokers began drinking at home .
But do you think the Scottish government would have forced an outright ban in the first months of 2009 ?
Meanwhile , the denizens of Holyrood 's secret chamber of the banned wring their hands and seek out other practices to forbid .
Did n't someone hear of an Asbo being dished out to an English couple last week for fornicating too vigorously ?
A shagging curfew ?
Now would n't that be wonderful .
With steep state budget cuts under debate in Sacramento , Los Angeles County supervisors voted Tuesday to push for changes to CalWorks and other government aid programs they said would save nearly $ 270 million .
Included in their suggestions is a novel proposal :
Put unemployed parents to work caring for their own children .
“ What we ’re saying is do not cut Welfare to Work outright : Target the cuts to the people who are the most expensive , ” said Miguel Santana , a deputy to the county ’s chief executive .
Parents now receiving assistance must attend job training and search for work .
While they fulfill those requirements , they are eligible for subsidized child care , which typically costs the state about $ 500 a month per child in L.A. County .
The parents of children under age 1 may stay home and still receive benefits .
Now , county officials propose expanding that to parents who have one child under age 2 or two children under age 6 .
Monthly job training and child - care costs for such parents often exceed their welfare check , Santana said .
In Los Angeles County , 8,000 households with more than one child under age 6 receive CalWorks - subsidized child care , according to the county ’s department of social services .
If adopted , county officials estimate the proposal -- intended to counter Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s threat to eliminate CalWorks -- could save the state $ 140 million this fiscal year .
Some parents who would be affected by the change had mixed feelings .
After Antoinette Levenson ’s husband was laid off by a boat dealership two years ago , the mother of two applied for cash assistance and joined the state ’s Welfare to Work program .
Now Levenson , 27 , is about six months from earning her associate degree in culinary arts and has a job lined up at Ralphs .
She receives about $ 750 a month in assistance .
The state also pays about $ 1,000 a month for her sons , Jaden , 4 , and Gavyn , 2 , to attend Canyon Vista Children ’s Learning Center in Chatsworth while she finishes school .
“ If I had it my way , I ’d stay home all day with my kids , ” Levenson said as she dropped the boys off Tuesday .
“ Then again , I love day care .
My kids have learned so much . ”
Although Levenson said she is not sure she could replace her eldest son ’s preschool teachers , she is willing to try .
“ There ’s times I just drive by and watch the kids , ” she said .
“ You ’ll never be able to get the kids ’ little years back . ”
But Priscilla Murillo of Canoga Park , a single mother with three children under age 5 , said she wants to finish school and find a job as soon as possible .
With her youngest child just a month old , Murillo , 27 , could stay home now and still receive benefits .
But she said the Welfare to Work program motivated her to continue pursuing her associate degree .
Murillo worries that if the state pays fellow single mothers to stay home , they will become dependent on welfare .
“ I think it ’s good to push people , ” she said .
“ It helps them and it helps the economy . ”
Child - care providers also said they are concerned about looming cuts .
Michael Olenick , who heads the nonprofit Child Care Resource Center in Chatsworth , said 12,000 child - care staff members and parents in northern L.A. County alone rely on CalWorks .
“ For many of them , it ’s the only source of revenue that they have , ” Olenick said of the CalWorks subsidies .
“ If they lose the revenue , then they end up on cash aid as well . ”
On Tuesday , a legislative budget committee in Sacramento rejected the governor ’s plan to eliminate CalWorks , proposing instead to cut it by $ 270 million .
Those cuts include $ 175 million in reductions to child - care and employment services .
That would allow the county to move forward with its proposal , said Philip K. Browning , director of the county Department of Public Social Services .
“ But it ’s still not a done deal -- the governor has n’t signed off on it yet , ” Browning said .
A spokeswoman for the governor said he will continue to push for the elimination of CalWorks but remains open to other options as he tries to close the $ 24.3 - billion budget shortfall .
County supervisors -- who plan to pursue a waiver to get federal welfare funds even if CalWorks is eliminated -- also proposed Tuesday that the state cap and overhaul general relief for single people , as well as reduce payments to adoptive parents , disabled foster children and some child - care providers .
The proposal to allow more parents to stay home troubled some of the county supervisors , including Supervisor Mike Antonovich , who voted against exempting parents of children under age 2 from Welfare to Work .
“ They should be seeking employment .
In the long term it benefits everyone in the county , ” Antonovich said .
Supervisor Gloria Molina grudgingly voted yes .
“ It does n’t fit with the spirit of Welfare to Work , but we ’re in a different situation , ” Molina said .
“ What we ’re doing is trying to say to them do n’t eliminate Welfare to Work -- here are some savings . ”

It has only been a few days but I am already sick of the “ XHTML is bullshit , man ! ” crowd using the cessation of XHTML 2.0 activity to condescend to — or even childishly glory in the “ folly ” of — web developers who build with XHTML 1.0 , a stable W3C recommendation for nearly ten years , and one that will continue to work indefinitely .
A coterie of well - informed codemeisters , from ppk to Ian Hickson , has always had legit beefs with XHTML , the most persuasive of which was Hickson’s :
It is suggested that HTML delivered as text / html is broken and XHTML delivered as text / xml is risky , so authors intending their work for public consumption should stick to HTML 4.01 , and authors who wish to use XHTML should deliver their markup as application / xhtml+xml .
This problem always struck me as more theoretical than real , but I pointed it out in every edition of Designing With Web Standards and left it to the reader to decide .
When I wrote the first edition of the book , some versions of Mozilla and IE would go into Quirksmode in the presence of HTML 4 , breaking CSS layouts .
To me , that was a worse problem than whatever was supposed to be scary or bad about using well - formed XHTML syntax while delivering it as HTML all browsers could support .
The opportunity to rethink markup
The social benefit of rethinking markup sealed the deal .
XHTML ’s introduction in 2000 , and its emphasis on rules of construction , gave web standards evangelists like me a platform on which to hook a program of semantic markup replacing the bloated and unsustainable tag soup of the day .
The web is better for this and always will be , and there is much still to do , as many people who create websites still have not heard the call .
A few who became disenchanted with XHTML early retreated to HTML 4 , and as browsers stopped going into Quirksmode in its presence , valid , structural HTML 4 became a reasonable option again .
But both HTML 4 and XHTML 1 were document languages , not transactional languages .
They were all noun , and almost no verb .
So Ian Hickson , XHTML ’s biggest critic , fathered HTML 5 , an action - oriented toddler specification that wo n’t reach adulthood until 2022 , although some of it can be used today .
And guess what ?
HTML 5 is as controversial today as XHTML was in 2000 , and there are just as many people who worry that a specification of which they do n’t entirely approve is being shoved down their throats by an “ uncaring elite . ”
Only this time , instead of the W3C , the “ uncaring elite ” is Mr Hickson , with W3C rubber stamp , and input from browser makers , including his employer .
XHTML not dead
All of this is to say that XHTML is not dead ( XHTML 2 is dead , thank goodness ) , and HTML 5 is not here yet .
Between now and 2022 , we have plenty of time to learn about HTML 5 and contribute to the discussion — and browser makers have 13 years to get it right .
Which is also to say all of us — not just those who long ago retreated to HTML 4 , or who became fans of HTML 5 before it could even say “ Mama ” — are entitled to be pleased that standard markup activity will now have a single focus , rather than a dual one ( with XHTML 2 the dog spec that no one was willing to mercy - kill until now ) .
Entitled to be pleased is not the same as entitled to gloat and name call .
As DN put it in comment - 44126 :
What is really rather aggravating is how many people are using this news as a stick with which to beat any developer or freelancer who ’s had the audacity to study up on and use XHTML in good faith–or even , much to the horror of the Smug Knowbetters , admire XHTML ’s intelligible markup structure –for the brand - new - minted sin of doing the most with XHTML that ’s possible .
The ‘ unofficial Q&A ’ is ripe with that kind of condescension .

The trip , stemming from a visit scheduled to commemorate trans -Atlantic ties 
Mr. Obama plans to walk the beaches of Normandy with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and visit the site of the concentration camp that his great - uncle helped liberate at Buchenwald in Germany  will also now offer Mr. Obama an opportunity to define how he plans to navigate America ’s relationship with the Muslim world .
Image President Obama is to visit the Middle East and Europe , and plans a major speech in Cairo .
Credit ... Doug Mills / The New York Times
He will begin the Middle East leg of the trip in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , where he will take King Abdullah a wish list from not just himself , but from Israeli and Palestinian officials as well .
Officials said Mr. Obama was hoping that King Abdullah would agree to make an overture to Israel that could , in turn , get Israel to move more quickly on a peace process .
Israeli officials would love to see Saudi Arabia open an interests section in Tel Aviv ( Saudi Arabia would never put one in Jerusalem because Palestinians see the city as the site of their future capital ) , or issue a few symbolic tourist visas for Israelis , or agree to hold open meetings with Israeli counterparts .
These would be a tall order for the Arab kingdom , which has , thus far , eschewed taking much of a role that could be seen as acknowledging Israel .
Meanwhile , Palestinian officials want Mr. Obama to prod King Abdullah to provide more aid for the Palestinian Authority , which the Saudis have largely set aside in recent months as the Palestinian political system has become increasingly fractured .
White House officials said they wanted greater Arab acceptance of Mr. Obama ’s peace plans .
But past American presidents  particularly George W. Bush  had sought the same without much luck .
“ Now that Obama has raised the pressure on the Israelis when it comes to settlement freeze , it ’s time to start raising pressure on the Arab states for something in return , ” said Ghaith al - Omari , a former negotiator for Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian Authority president .
“ Saudi is the key to unlocking the rest of the Arab world . ”
Saudi Arabia may also be part of the key to addressing the morass in Pakistan .
Obama administration officials are hoping to get Saudi Arabia to use its influence with the Pakistani opposition leader , Nawaz Sharif , to figure out a way to bring some stability to Pakistan ’s tumultuous politics as President Asif Ali Zardari becomes increasingly unpopular .

I do n’t have a personal beef against Apple or the iPhone – I ’ve never wanted to tether my computer to my phone , I ca n’t get a Google Voice account ( Google maintain an air of smug US - centricity sometimes that Apple ca n’t match ) , and I ’ve never tried to ship an app with an open webkit in it .
But the reflected rage about the whole thing has me all annoyed / uncomfortable / fearful in advance .
So I ’m casting around for replacements .
And basically , this means Android , as it seems to suck less than everything else .
Indeed , if the iPhone did n’t exist , Android phones would be easily the best phones out there for me .
Maybe the Pre / WebOS would be better .
But it ’s not available in the UK yet , so it ’s pretty much moot .
I ’m trying to like Android .
I have to write down why Android annoys me .
I ’d really like a go at using a Hero ( I ’m using a G1 dev phone running cupcake here ) before committing , so this is a random set of half - formed thoughts .
It ’s slow .
Again , probably the hardware .
But the G1 is slow compared to the iPhone ( original and 3G , let alone the 3GS ) .
I ca n’t listen to music on it .
It wo n’t sync with iTunes ( solvable ) , it does n’t have a headphone socket ( solvable ) , the music app is lousy ( probably solvable ) , and I only have a 2 gig micro-SD card , so it does n’t all fit ( solvable ) .
All solvable , all annoying .
Many fewer apps .
The store is smaller , and the apps that are on it tend to be worse than the ones on the Apple store .
It ’s hard to find reviews of them .
They do n’t come with screen shots .
There are already some apps that require cupcake , some that do n’t work on cupcake , some that just crash on startup , etc .
The browser just is n’t up to the standard of the iPhone ’s .
The Mail app is awful .
The web browser seems to sometimes open new windows , and sometimes reuse existing windows when following links .
The on - screen keyboard is sluggish .
This is the same speed problem as above , but whereas elsewhere it ’s mostly just cosmetic annoyance , here it ’s causing me serious difficulty – lots of typing errors unless I slow right down .
I ’m trying to port Flame to it – Flame is my normal ‘ just real enough that you have to learn the platform ’ app that I port to new things I ’m playing with .
But the emulator behaves differently from the real device , I ’m not confident that any other real device running Android would behave the same , so I ’d have to test everywhere .
And anyway , the device seems to have a major bug around multicast that makes Flame impossible .
Any one of these I could deal with no problem .
Probably more .
It ’s just the combination of all of them that wears you down .
And then there ’s all the standard little things that come with being a citizen of a second - class platform .
A tiny example – diveintomark.org has an iphone - optimized mobile view – I believe it ’s a wordpress standard , I might have seen it in a few places .
But he serves the normal page to the android web browser .
It ’s not a big deal , but a thousand things like that is like using linux in a world of windows people again .
No -one bothers with the little stuff .
Stuff works on the iPhone because everyone tests on the iPhone .
It would work on Android if anyone bothered .
Linux vs Windows / MacOS , all over again .
You gain Freedom by using an open platform , making life worse for yourself in a thousand tiny ways , any one of which can easily be dismissed , so they are .
But it ’s still worse .
Commercial showing the damage a bullet can do .
By Renfrey Clarke
June 16 , 2009 --
For governments and vehicle corporations , the charm of biofuels used to be the promise they held out of a ready - made solution to transport - related greenhouse gas emissions -- a solution that might simply be dropped in , while changing almost nothing else .
Freeways , suburban sprawl , four - wheel - drive family cars -- everything could remain .
Only the fuel on sale at service stations would be different .
Biofuels , the promise to the public ran , would be ``clean and green ’’ , an environmental zero-sum .
Although carbon was released to the atmosphere when biofuels were burnt , this was carbon that had been there earlier , before being taken up by the plants from which the fuels were derived .
Underlying the biofuels push was an unlikely premise .
Within a relatively few decades , human beings were predicted to finish burning the Earth ’s accessible resources of petroleum , resources which had been built up over hundreds of millions of years .
After that , biofuels were supposed to meet these consumption levels year - by - year out of the Earth ’s current biological production -- which would also need to sustain the living environment and feed human beings .
The scale of the contradiction was pointed out by British writer George Monbiot in a 2005 article :
In 2003 , the biologist Jeffrey Dukes calculated that the fossil fuels we burn in one year were made from organic matter ‘ containing 44x10 to the 18th grams of carbon , which is more than 400 times the net primary productivity of the earth ’s current biota . ’
In plain English , this means that every year we use four centuries ’ worth of plants and animals .
The idea that we can simply replace this fossil legacy -- and the extraordinary power densities it gives us -- with ambient energy is the stuff of science fiction .
By early in 2008 , reflections such as these -- along with a good deal of bitter experience -- were prompting a rethink .
In economics as in nature , critics of biofuels were pointing out , everything is connected to everything else .
When corn in the US was diverted from food markets and used to produce corn-ethanol fuel , world corn prices rose accordingly .
That meant the Mexican poor went hungry .
The high corn prices encouraged farmers in the US Midwest to plant corn instead of soybeans .
As soybean supplies tightened , soy interests in Brazil were prompted to plough up what had earlier been cattle pasture .
And with pasture scarce , cattle ranchers in the Amazon cut and burned fresh tracts of tropical forest .
When such cascades of land use changes were taken into account , a 2008 study led by Timothy Searchinger of Princeton University and published in the journal Science concluded , the cost of using corn ethanol in greenhouse emissions per kilometre driven was almost double that of gasoline over a 30 - year period .
True , the carbon released when the ethanol was burnt had been in the atmosphere a few months earlier , not locked away in the Earth as with gasoline .
But no fewer than 167 years would have to elapse before the savings made in this fashion would pay off the “ carbon debt ” incurred .
When peat - land rainforest in Indonesia was cleared for oil - palm biodiesel plantations , New Scientist reported in February 2008 , the repayment time would be more than 400 years .
Citing Princeton research , the Mongabay site in May 2008 reported that more than 55 per cent of oil palm expansion in Malaysia and Indonesia occurred at the expense of forests .
At least in Europe , attempts are now made to ban imports of palm oil from recently deforested areas .
Adding to the misgivings surrounding biofuels has been a 2008 study by a team led by Nobel prize - winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen .
This found that nitrogen fertiliser used in growing biofuel crops was converted by soil microbes to nitrous oxide at around twice the rate previously thought .
Nitrous oxide ( N2O ) is a greenhouse gas hundreds of times more potent than carbon dioxide .
Crutzen and his co-authors estimated that for rapeseed ( canola ) biodiesel , the relative warming due to nitrous oxide emissions was 1 to 1.7 times the cooling effect due to saved carbon dioxide emissions .
For corn ethanol , the figure was 0.9 to 1.5 times .
Only cane sugar ethanol ( 0.5 to 0.9 times ) was likely to have a net cooling effect .
Nevertheless , biofuels remain entrenched in agricultural and industrial practice in the European Union and the US .
“ A fourth of this year ’s US grain harvest -- enough to feed 125 million Americans or half a million Indians at current consumption levels -- will go to feed cars , ” Scientific American reported in May 2009 .
An environmental atrocity , existing biofuels production is also economically disadvantageous for almost everyone except grain farmers and various sectors of the agribusiness , vehicle and energy industries .
In essence , today ’s biofuel industry survives only because governments , drawn by promises of a cheap fix for climate change and by the political lure of green credibility , have set mandatory targets for biofuel use and backed these targets with incentives .
In the US , the Energy Dependence and Security Act of December 2007 requires that annual production of ethanol , which was about 5 billion gallons in 2006 , should reach 7.5 billion gallons in 2012 and 36 billion gallons in 2022 .
This latter figure corresponds to about 25 per cent of US fuel production at today ’s consumption levels .
The World Bank ’s 2008 World Development Report calculates that more than 200 support measures in the US have a cost of US $ 5.5 - 7.3 billion per year , and provide ethanol with subsidies of 38 - 49 US cents per litre of petroleum equivalent .
The European Union , meanwhile , has set goals for biofuel use in vehicles of 5.75 per cent by 2010 and 10 per cent by 2020 .
Politicians and agroindustry in Australia have bought into biofuels too .
The NSW government requires that petrol sold in that state include 10 per cent ethanol by 2011 .
In the setting of modern capitalist society , biofuels are proving a destructive , costly fiasco .
But if society were more rationally organised , could biofuels be produced and used responsibly ?
The answer is a cautious “ yes ” .
But not all biofuels -- only those with a verified “ cooling ” effect .
And because of the potential damage , a truly green biofuels industry would need to be regulated closely in line with the best science available .
There would be no room for the profit - at - all - costs mayhem of “ free markets ” .
Biofuels can only be a rational choice if they do not cause a loss of soil fertility , and do not compromise vital biosphere elements such as forests and rivers .
Nor must they be allowed to displace important sources of food production .
Also crucial is an understanding that on a world scale , biofuels can only play a minor part in ending net emissions from the transport sector .
There is no way biofuels will ever power national transport fleets of today ’s size and type .
Even if the entire US grain crop were fermented into ethanol , Scientific American noted in May 2009 , this would supply at most 18 per cent of current US automotive fuel consumption .
The transport systems of a sustainable future will rest heavily on public transport .
Recent developments suggest that back - up will be provided by plug - in hybrid vehicles , yielding way progressively to purely electric cars and light trucks .
For a time , production of biofuels will go largely to powering the hybrids on longer trips .
Later , as electric - car batteries improve , the use of biofuels will increasingly be confined to specialised applications which require an energy source more concentrated than even the most advanced batteries can provide .
These applications will include heavy trucks ; agricultural machinery ; locomotives , on rail lines with too little traffic to justify electrification ; aviation , and shipping .
In large part , the biofuels used in a sustainable society will be produced from sources and using technologies quite different from those of today .
At present , the main biofuel used is ethanol fermented from grain sugars and starches -- that is , from potential foodstuffs .
As indicated earlier , a less flagrantly wasteful feedstock for ethanol than the corn mostly used in the US is the sugarcane that supplies the Brazilian ethanol industry .
About half of Brazil ’s sugarcane goes to biofuel production , providing about 15 per cent of the country ’s liquid fuel supply .
Depending on the degree and type of land use change , the carbon “ debt ” incurred by sugarcane plantings can be modest ; Searchinger in his earlier - quoted paper speaks of it being repaid in four years if the plantings are on former tropical grazing land .
Sugarcane , however , is a voracious consumer of water and of agricultural chemicals , with the latter washing freely into streams .
When sugarcane is planted anywhere except on level ground , it contributes heavily to soil erosion .
Cellulosic biofuels
Better than extracting sugars and starch from plants in order to make biofuels , many scientists have surmised , is to find ways to process all or most of the plants -- including the cellulose that is among their main building - blocks .
This is the thinking behind “ cellulosic ” or “ advanced ” biofuels , projected as the next stage in the development of the biofuels industry .
The US National Renewable Fuels Standard , which sets out the requirements made of fuel companies under federal legislation , effectively mandates that of the 36 billion gallons of biofuels to be produced in the US by 2022 , around 20 billion gallons must be of this “ advanced ” or “ second - generation ” variety .
Woody plants are composed mainly of lignocellulose , made up of the polymer lignin and of cellulose , which consists of long chains of sugar molecules .
Numerous microorganisms feed on plant matter by secreting enzymes which break down the cellulose chains into simple sugars , which can then be digested .
In the conventional production of cellulosic biofuels , plant matter is treated with enzymes to break down the cellulose in the fibrous cell walls .
Yeast is then used to ferment the resultant sugars into ethanol .
Cellulosic biofuel production has a range of important advantages over “ first - generation ” processes .
Since most of the plant is used , much more fuel can be produced for a given input of water and fertilisers .
Often , cellulosic waste from food crops can be used as the feedstock .
If the feedstock is purpose - grown biomass , plant species can be used which do not require prime farmland and need not displace food crops .
As of April 2009 , four cellulosic biofuels facilities were recorded as operating in the US , with a further nine planned .
Economically , however , “ conventional ” cellulosic biofuels remain a marginal proposition even with government incentives ; the enzymes , in particular , are expensive .
Research is now under way on new processes .
One line of investigation seeks to circumvent the high cost of the enzymes by using a thermal process to break down the biomass .
Pyrolysis -- that is , heating in the absence of oxygen -- can be used to gasify the plant matter , turning it into carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide and hydrogen ; these gases are then fed into a fermenter where bacteria convert them into ethanol and water .
A variant of this approach makes use of the Fischer - Tropsch process , devised in the 1920s to make liquid fuels from coal .
In this process , the gases are heated to high temperatures and passed over a catalyst , producing hydrocarbons that can be refined into petrol , aviation kerosene and diesel fuel .
A sophisticated version of the Fischer - Tropsch process has been developed for use with plant biomass by the firm Choren in Germany , with commercial operation planned for 2012 .
Thermochemical biofuels production has potential for being combined with the production of biochar -- that is , finely divided charcoal -- for soil improvement and carbon sequestration .
In any event , some additional use has to be found for the large amounts of heat produced if the carbon emissions savings are to be substantial , and the process acceptably cheap .
For this reason and others , current research on advanced biofuels concentrates mostly on biological processes .
A particular goal is to find -- or engineer -- micoorganisms that both break down cellulose and secrete biofuels .
While there have been no dramatic breakthroughs , a number of intriguing leads have emerged .
Technology Review in December 2008 reported that the US firm Qteros was working with a microbe able to “ dissolve cellulose into sugars and convert the sugar into ethanol , all in one step . ”
The company claimed to be “ 60 to 70 percent of the way to reaching its technology targets for commercialisation . ”
Much of the eventual demand for biofuels is not expected to be for ethanol -- which has a relatively low energy density , is difficult to transport and store , and generally needs to be mixed with fossil fuels -- but for fuels made up of longer - chain hydrocarbons that can substitute for petrol , diesel and aviation kerosene .
In November 2008 the British Guardian reported the finding in a Patagonian rainforest of a tree fungus that consumes cellulose and “ produces a range of hydrocarbon molecules that are virtually identical to the fuel - grade compounds in existing fossil fuels . ”
Biodiesel
In the near term , most of the biodiesel that reaches the market seems certain to be produced using more established methods .
Since the late 1930s , chemists have known how to turn vegetable oil into biodiesel through the process of transesterification , in which the oil is processed using alcohol and an acid catalyst .
Modern diesel motors will run on biodiesel without modification , creating fewer harmful emissions than with petroleum diesel .
World output of biodiesel -- almost all of it obtained from vegetable oils -- is growing rapidly , but remains much less than production of bioethanol .
According to World Bank figures , about 6.5 billion litres of biodiesel were produced in 2006 , compared with ethanol output that year of about 40 billion litres .
About three - quarters of biodiesel production took place in the European Union ; most of this came from rapeseed ( canola ) , at grievous cost in nitrous oxide emissions .
Of other biodiesel production , a great deal is derived from palm oil , with the lamentable environmental costs noted earlier .
Biofuel processors are looking intently for sources of biodiesel that are cheaper than the present ones , and that if possible , draw less criticism from environmentalists .
A good deal of attention has been turned to the developing world , and to previously little - known plant species that have potential for improvement as oil sources .
In 2007 , the Indian corporation Nandan Biomatrix was reported to have selected eleven species for study as biodiesel feedstocks .
Among the outstanding discoveries has been the bush , or small tree , Jatropha curcas .
Native to Central America , jatropha is able to survive prolonged droughts ; fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere , it grows vigorously in poor soils .
Though toxic to livestock , jatropha has long been valued in Africa and South Asia for the superior lamp - oil that can be pressed from its large seeds .
More recently , village mechanics have found that the oil also performs well as fuel for diesel engines .
The Indian government , the Yale Environment 360 site reports , has now “ announced plans to subsidise an intensive program to plant jatropha for biofuels on 27 million acres of ‘ wastelands ’ -- an area roughly the size of Switzerland . ”
A new industry association , the Jatropha Sustainable Biofuels Alliance ( JSBA ) , has identified more than 240 plantation projects , mostly in developing countries of Asia but also in East Africa and Latin America .
In West Timor , foreign interests are to fund Indonesia ’s first large - scale jatropha project on one million hectares of land .
“ We are observing a trend of major oil companies and international energy conglomerates entering the field with plans for large - scale investments , ” the JSBA ’s website notes .
Large corporate investors to date include BP and the German vehicle firm Daimler .
Feeding enthusiasm for jatropha in the most recent period has been the discovery that its oil can be processed into a jet fuel that is compatible with aviation kerosene while also having a lower freezing point , lower specific gravity and greater energy density .
The International Air Traffic Association has set a goal for its members to be using 10 per cent alternative fuels by 2017 .
In the initial vision of the Indian government , the jatropha industry was not to distort the production of foodstuffs .
Jatropha oil is inedible , and the plant was to be grown in place of rough pasture , or on otherwise unused land such as the strips bordering rail lines .
The hunger of airlines for fuel , however , suggests that jatropha cultivation will now evolve quite differently .
Demand for land capable of growing jatropha will rise .
Small landowners will come under pressure to sell out to plantation interests , and land rents will increase .
Growing the new cash crop will become an economic necessity for tenant farmers who traditionally have produced food crops .
Inexorably , the pressures of the market will shift jatropha cultivation from marginal and degraded land to prime farming areas where high yields are possible ; studies in India have shown that while jatropha will survive in arid conditions , yields are typically five times greater when the plant is grown with irrigation .
The growing of jatropha for jet fuel , this suggests , could set off a cascade of food shortages and environmental destruction similar to that created by corn ethanol .
The impact will be exacerbated if , as seems likely , jatropha plantations are granted credits under emissions offset schemes .
Agronomists might well protest that the real problem here is not jatropha .
Growing the plant -- a deep - rooted perennial that requires virtually no fertiliser -- creates very few emissions to detract from the savings its use provides .
In principle , jatropha should fit well into traditional smallholder farming regimes , since it improves soil nitrogen levels and is well suited to intercropping with food plants .
The inedible harvest residues could be used in local pyrolysis plants to produce electricity and biochar , further raising soil fertility and food output while sequestering carbon .
The biodiesel would supply local needs and allow national oil imports to be cut .
The real problem , it emerges , is capitalism -- and specifically , the power of global capital to short - circuit rational development in poor countries .
Meanwhile , plants such as jatropha and technologies such as cellulosic ethanol have no prospects for supplying anything like the offsets needed for “ business as usual ” to continue in the transport area .
At current jatropha yields , New Scientist calculated in August 2008 , replacing world consumption of fossil - based jet fuel would require the plant to be grown on 1.4 million square kilometres , well over twice the area of France .
Nothing , it is clear , will save the airline industry from having eventually to cut its operations to a fraction of their present scale .
The calculations for transport fuels in total are no more comforting .
Assuming an average yield for biomass of 10 tonnes per hectare , New Scientist works out that “ replacing all current transport fuel with ( biomass - to - liquids ) would require more than 10 million square kilometres -- an area bigger than China . ”
True , existing crop production and forestry create quantities of biomass that are often categorised as waste , and that might render the above figure less daunting .
Biofuels researcher K. John Morrow in a 2008 paper cites “ an authoritative and carefully researched study ” of US resources which “ documents that a billion tons of biomass is available for conversion to biofuel without serious economic , environmental or agricultural disruption . ”
This figure for the US , however , is still less than one - tenth of the global requirement calculated by New Scientist .
Even cellulosic biofuels , this makes plain , cannot be more than a modest extender for fossil - based liquid fuels .
The world ’s current internal combustion vehicle fleet is nowhere near sustainable .
The success of biofuel interests in having their products mandated by the US Congress defies logic on other counts as well .
There is no reason to think that biofuels , even from cellulosic sources , will be able to compete in terms of economic costs or carbon emissions with electric vehicle technologies .
The Australian newspaper in May 2009 cited “ running cost differentials between an electric vehicle ( 2c / km ) and petrol cars ( 10 - 14c / km ) . ”
A far more efficient and desirable way to turn biomass into transportation , it is now emerging , is to burn the biomass to create electricity that can be used in battery - powered vehicles .
According to Technology Review in May 2009 , a comprehensive US study has concluded that “ on average , using biomass to produce electricity is 80 percent more efficient than transforming the biomass into biofuel .
In addition , the electricity option would be twice as effective at reducing greenhouse - gas emissions . ”
The present US biofuels legislation , this serves to illustrate , is not just a triumph for farm - state lobbyists , but also for vehicle corporations wanting to pay off their investment in current models .
Microalgae
On every count , it seems , biofuels are doomed not to measure up , except as fuel for transitional hybrid cars and for the heavy - vehicle applications noted earlier .
Unless , that is , something exotic comes to the rescue .
In the speculations of some scientists and engineers , microalgae have been cast in such a role .
In the first years of the century physicist Michael Briggs of the University of New Hampshire excited imaginations by calculating that biodiesel produced from microalgae grown in ponds covering 38,500 square kilometres could replace all the transportation fuels used in the US .
Briggs ’s main data were derived from theoretical figures calculated by the Aquatic Species Program of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory from tests in New Mexico between 1978 and 1996 .
Computations by the US Department of Energy have since suggested a larger pond area of 152,000 square kilometres , roughly equal to England and Wales .
In ideal circumstances , microalgae -- familiar to most of us as pond scum -- can double their mass in as little as six hours , and produce many times more biomass in the course of a year than any terrestrial plant .
Numerous algal species are at home in brackish or even hypersaline water ; grown in deserts using groundwater too salty for irrigation , they can be raised without displacing conventional agriculture .
Selected species contain as much as 50 per cent of oils by weight .
Even species that are not optimal as oil producers create a range of other saleable products , protein - rich animal feed among them .
Algae flourish in nutrient streams from sources such as sewage plants , animal feedlots or agricultural run-off ; if algal culture can be used to offset or reduce the cost of wastewater remediation , their fertiliser needs may be obtained free of charge .
The signs in the algal equations , however , are not all pluses .
Briggs acknowledges , then ignores , the fact that the Aquatic Species Program was seeking uses for the carbon dioxide in flue gases from fossil - fuelled power plants .
The impressive figures for algal biomass production published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory were for ponds with carbon dioxide bubbled through them .
When consuming atmospheric carbon dioxide alone , algae are well able to befoul swimming pools , but their biomass output is much too low to make harvesting worthwhile .
The visions of algae ponds stretching to the horizons of the world ’s deserts and allowing the car industry to produce unfettered are chimerical .
Most of the development work on algal biofuels carried out to date has , in fact , focused on recycling the emissions from fossil - fuelled power stations .
Some of the most sophisticated algal bioreactor equipment produced so far , by a team at Ohio University , has been devised with the help of funding from the Ohio Coal Research Center .
There is a danger that algal sequestration of power station emissions will be used by energy companies as green - sounding propaganda for keeping fossil - fuelled plants operating , even though the net saving in emissions is rather modest .
Algae are good at scrubbing nitrogen oxides from exhaust streams at any hour , but they photosynthesise carbon dioxide only in daylight ; as a result , their effectiveness in reducing fossil carbon emissions round - the - clock is no more than about 40 per cent .
It should also be remembered that while fossil carbon that is turned into algal biofuels and used in vehicles gets to be burnt twice , it still finishes up in the atmosphere .
The scale of the investment required if fossil - fuelled power plants are to have their flue gases scrubbed by algae suggests that the technology will not be widely installed , just hinted at in coal - company handouts .
A typical 1000 - megawatt coal - fired power plant , it has been calculated , would require no less than 5200 hectares of algae ponds to consume 40 per cent of its carbon emissions .
None of this is to say that algal biofuels should not be developed and used .
There are numerous industrial plants -- steelworks , cement works and breweries among them -- that release carbon dioxide and that might be connected to algal bioreactors , with useful emissions savings .
Perhaps the most promising concept involves integrating algal biofuel production with stockraising and the production of electricity and biochar from biomass .
Such complexes would use flue - gas carbon dioxide from biomass pyrolysis to enrich algae ponds , producing animal feed as well as algal oil .
The fodder would be used to raise livestock , whose manure would be bio-digested to produce methane for additional process heat , electricity and carbon dioxide .
The nutrient - rich sludge from the bio-digesters would then fertilise the algae ponds .
In Arizona , the firm XL Renewables is developing a related concept that would feed 7500 dairy cows , deriving its carbon dioxide initially from the fermentation of corn for ethanol , and later from fermenting part of the algae output .
“ Closed loop ” algae complexes of this type have considerable promise for carbon abatement .
Not only is their efficiency in offsetting fossil fuel use high ( XL Renewables projects an eventual figure of 10 to 1 for its algal oil and ethanol ) , but their output of meat is achieved at a fraction of the emissions cost of conventional stockraising .
In principle , they can allow grain to be used as human rather than animal food , and grazing land to be turned over to timber plantations or natural forest .
Perhaps the most impressive feature of these schemes is their potential to be expanded without incurring major environmental costs .
Their basic requirements are for low - cost level land , sunlight , brackish groundwater ( or seawater ) , mild - to - warm temperatures , and a source of carbon dioxide that does not give rise to additional fossil fuel use .
The latter source need not be in plant form ; with due care , selected urban garbage might be used in combination with a pyrolysis process .
So too , conceivably , might sewage sludge .
This picture fits well with stretches of coastline relatively close to various Australian cities .
Areas such as the South Australian gulfs and the Western Australian coast north of Perth recommend themselves .
But is there anything in the prospects for microalgal culture to suggest that on a world scale , it might replace all or most of current petroleum fuel use ?
With algae - cum - stockraising complexes the size of whole countries ?
Merely to pose the question is to answer it .
Biofuels in Australia
On a global scale , biofuels are unlikely ever to have more than “ niche ” significance .
Is the situation fundamentally different in Australia ?
As scientist Mark Diesendorf observes in his book Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy , Australian landscapes with their warm temperatures and evergreen trees can be highly productive of biomass .
Meanwhile , land area per head of population is unusually great .
The effect is to make biofuels production , at least in principle , a more enticing proposition here than in most countries .
So far , investors have not been aggressive in developing this potential .
According to a study by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics ( ABARE ) , biofuels early in 2009 were providing only about 0.5 per cent of Australia ’s petrol and diesel supply , compared to a world figure the previous year of 2.8 per cent .
This indifference has not been for lack of government backing .
Ethanol manufacturers in Australia enjoy an exemption from the federal government ’s excise levy on petrol of 38.1 cents per litre , in addition to a similar customs duty on imported fuel ethanol .
The 2008 federal budget included $ 15 million for research into second - generation biofuels over three years .
Since 2007 the New South Wales government has mandated an ethanol content of 2 per cent in petrol sold within that state .
In NSW , and possibly in Queensland as well , government support for biofuel production is set to increase sharply .
NSW legislation passed in April 2009 provides for the state ’s ethanol mandate to increase to 6 per cent in 2010 and to 10 per cent in 2011 .
The NSW government also reportedly plans to implement a biodiesel mandate of 2 per cent , rising to 5 per cent when sufficient supplies become available .
According to the Australian in January 2009 , the Queensland government plans a 5 per cent ethanol mandate , to be introduced by 2010 and to be supplied mainly through the fermentation of molasses , a low value by - product of sugar refining .
Until now , most of the ethanol required for the 2 per cent mandate in NSW has come from a plant at Bomaderry , south of Sydney .
Owned by the Manildra Group , the plant processes wheat starch , a by - product of milling operations .
According to the crikey.com website in January 2009 , the “ E10 ” -- that is , 10 per cent ethanol -- mandate in NSW will require the direct use of an estimated 2.5 million tonnes of grain each year .
Projections have been made for at least four new ethanol production facilities in NSW , and for the Bomaderry plant to be expanded .
A further plant , processing grain sorghum , has begun operating at Dalby in Queensland .
In drought years , the Australian on January 5 quoted biofuels analyst Geoff Ward as saying , the NSW and Queensland ethanol mandates could consume as much as 40 per cent of the national grain crop .
Over the full cycle of ethanol production and use -- that is , including the fossil fuels used in feedstock growing , transport and processing -- the E10 mandate is predicted by ABARE to result in no more than minor savings of carbon emissions .
With the ethanol content of fuel at 10 per cent , the savings per kilometre are calculated at between 0.7 per cent ( for ethanol from wheat ) and 4.2 per cent ( for ethanol produced from molasses , while using sugar refinery wastes to generate electricity ) .
There is no indication that when ABARE worked out these figures it factored in the most recent evidence concerning nitrous oxide emissions and crop fertilisers .
Nor does it seem to have taken into account the effects of sharply cutting Australian supplies to world grain markets .
As with US corn , the reduction in Australian grain exports will raise world prices and spur the destruction of forests for additional grain - growing in countries where controls on land clearing are weak or non-existent .
In mandating ethanol use , legislators in NSW have argued that they are looking toward the advent in years to come of “ second generation ” ethanol - from - cellulose processes , expected to sharply reduce the diversion of food grains to biofuels production .
But for most of the next decade , if not longer , the net effect of the ethanol mandates will be to put large amounts of extra greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
The world environment would be better off if motorists in NSW and Queensland were to continue filling up with conventional petrol .
For biodiesel in Australia , the prospects are considerably more encouraging .
Modern diesel engines are about 40 per cent more fuel - efficient than petrol engines of equivalent power ; replacing petrol - engined with biodiesel - driven vehicles can thus bring important emissions savings .
At present , most biodiesel sold in Australia comes from tallow -- that is , animal fats , now usually considered abattoir wastes -- and from recycled cooking oil .
For these reclaimed feedstocks , the emissions savings are impressive .
In a 2007 report produced for the oil firm Caltex , the CSIRO concluded that the savings with used cooking oil were 87 per cent , and with tallow 76 per cent .
“ Palm oil from existing plantations ” was rated at 80 per cent , but guaranteeing that consignments of Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil are not tainted by rainforest destruction has proven difficult .
Canola ( rapeseed ) oil rated a lowly 49 per cent even , it appears , without increased nitrous oxide emissions being taken into account .
According to ABARE , biodiesel production throughout Australia in 2007 amounted to 59 million litres , about 0.3 per cent of total diesel use .
The NSW government ’s biodiesel mandate , the Australian reported in January 2009 , is to come into force later in the year and will initially require about 80 million litres annually .
Most of this is expected to come from a facility near Maitland in the Hunter Valley , run by the firm Biodiesel Industries .
Sources are to include cottonseed and canola oil .
The best options for expanding Australian biodiesel production sustainably involve tree crops in the north of the country .
In Central Queensland in particular , large areas which once supported dense scrub have been cleared for cattle - raising .
In the “ top end ” of the Northern Territory gamba grass , introduced as a superior cattle feed , has fed bushfires so hot as to kill the native savannah woodland across wide areas .
As in Australia as a whole , the cattle industry in both regions needs to be scaled back , since the enteric methane emitted by cattle is a dangerous contributor to global warming .
New land management systems are needed , and tree plantations for biodiesel could be part of them .
An obvious species for such plantations is Jatropha curcas .
The plant has long been established in northern Australia , where its toxicity -- it is known locally as “ bellyache bush ” -- has caused it to be declared a noxious weed .
High - yielding male sterile clones are available , and might be grown with government consent .
The crop residues , which like the leaves are poisonous to cattle , could be pyrolysed to make electricity and biochar .
A better candidate than jatropha in many settings might be the honge tree ( Pongamia pinnata ) , which is native to regions from India to northern Australia .
Nitrogen - fixing , undemanding as to soils , and highly tolerant of salinity , honge sends its taproot as deep as ten metres , allowing the tree to flourish in monsoonal regions with a brief rainy season .
In plantation conditions , yields of its inedible oil can outstrip those of jatropha and oil palm several times over .
The residues from the oil - bearing seeds provide a protein - rich animal feed .
With appropriate support and training , graziers might well agree to switch from cattle - raising to running biodiesel plantations .
In Central Queensland , such an industry could also provide alternative work for coal miners idled as moves to reduce carbon emissions see mines shut down .
In theory , plants such as jatropha and honge could be cultivated widely across northern Australia .
They have potential for providing indigenous communities with an economic base .
According to Pacific Renewable Energy , which has researched honge in collaboration with the University of Queensland , a “ good ” yield of honge oil is 5 tonnes per hectare per year , with an “ optimal ” figure of 9.66 tonnes .
At “ good ” levels , enough honge oil to substitute for Australia ’s annual diesel use of about 13.5 million tonnes could be produced on an area of plantations measuring about 270 by 100 kilometres .
Amid the vastness of northern Australia , this area is not particularly large .
It represents , for example , less than half the area of brigalow woodland that was cleared -- mainly for cattle grazing -- in Central Queensland between 1960 and 1990 .
There would be no need for further native vegetation to be destroyed for biodiesel to be produced on the necessary scale .
Honge trees take up to 15 years to yield at their full potential .
If biodiesel is to contribute to a swift reduction in Australia ’s transport - related emissions , feedstock sources that can be developed more rapidly will be required .
Here , the most promising field of research is microalgae .
At least ten universities and government - funded research bodies around Australia have microalgae programs .
One of the most advanced is that of SARDI , the South Australian Research and Development Institute .
In alliance with Flinders University , SARDI in December 2008 was planning a proof - of - concept facility to combine biofuel production with that of high - value co-products such as nutraceuticals .
The project , SARDI reported , would include a facility on Torrens Island , near Adelaide , to incorporate “ four 50 - square - metre raceway ponds that will utilise nutrient rich saline water from the Port River estuary , carbon dioxide from adjacent power plants and solar energy . ”
As explained by Associate Professor Wei Zhang of Flinders University , producing biofuels would only cover the basic costs of the process ; profits would have to come from value - added products : “ Biodiesel is worth around one dollar a litre ; pharmaceutical grade Omega - 3 fatty acids can fetch up to $ 100 a litre . ”
It is not hard to imagine how production of algal oil might take place in integrated fashion on an industrial scale .
Low - value land would be used , quite probably coastal samphire flats close to infrastructure .
Production of biochar from crop wastes or trees such as mallee would provide energy and a portion of the carbon dioxide .
Water would come from brackish aquifers or sewage too saline to be reclaimed for irrigated agriculture .
Quite likely , the algae would be grown not in broad ponds but using the trough - form equipment developed in the US by XL Renewables , and available commercially .
After the oil was extracted , pigs , poultry , rabbits and perhaps fish such as barramundi would be raised on the protein - rich residue .
Manure from the livestock would be bio-digested , and the resulting methane burnt to produce additional energy and carbon dioxide .
The process would be remarkably self - sufficient ; the major inputs , apart from the crop wastes or other biomass , would be phosphorus fertilisers , trace nutrients , and possibly stockfeed supplements .
None of the technology employed would be really novel , and much of it could be bought “ off the shelf ” .
Given the political will , large complexes of this type could be operating in Australia in less than a decade .
Australia ’s consumption of fossil - based diesel fuel , it emerges , might well be replaced with biodiesel within a relatively short time - frame .
What about consumption of petrol , currently about 19 billion litres per year ?
Could the advent of suitably cheap cellulosic processes allow petrol substitutes to be “ dropped in ” , and existing Australian transport patterns to continue with minimal disruption ?
Significant research into cellulosic processes is now being mounted in Australia , centred in Queensland and concentrating on ways of making biofuels from bagasse , the fibrous residue left after sugarcane is crushed .
At present , bagasse is largely burnt to produce energy for sugar mills and for feeding into the electrical grid .
October 2007 saw the setting up at Queensland University of Technology of the Syngenta Centre for Sugarcane Biofuel Development .
As described by the Australian , the centre involved “ a collaboration between the Queensland government , Swiss agribusiness giant Syngenta and Brisbane - based biotechnology company Farmacule . ”
Funding was reportedly in the region of $ 5 million .
The quantities of sugarcane wastes available in Australia are nowhere near enough to replace the country ’s petrol consumption , but what about cellulose from fast - rotation tree crops ?
Does Australia have enough suitable , already - cleared land to grow the quantities required , and to do it without affecting food production ?
Many of the calculations here have been performed by Mark Diesendorf , who on p. 152 of his book concludes :
… it is possible that more than half of Australia ’s liquid fuels could be supplied from about 10 million hectares of dedicated land .
If we allow three million hectares for biodiesel production , this suggests that about 17 million hectares of biomass tree plantations would be needed to keep the country ’s petrol - driven vehicles on the road .
According to the Australian National Resource Atlas , about 13 per cent of Australia ’s land area , some 100 million hectares , has been cleared of its natural vegetation .
In 2005 , the Australian Bureau of Statistics records , the country ’s cropped area amounted to 26.7 million hectares .
From the other 70 - odd million hectares of cleared land , might 17 million suitably productive hectares be found ?
Almost certainly it could , especially since global warming , by drying out marginal grainlands , will force wheat farmers off large areas which will then be available for drought - resistant tree crops such as mallee .
Producing enough petrol substitutes to allow “ business as usual ” on Australia ’s roads , this suggests , is literally possible .
Whether this represents a rational use for biomass is a separate question .
If the goals motivating policy are not to keep petrol - engined vehicles on the road , but to reduce carbon emissions by as much as possible while providing Australians with transport , different strategies will be followed .
The cellulosic feedstock will be pyrolysed to biochar , while heat released in the process will be used to produce electricity which , by the time the biochar is sequestered in soils , will be emissions - negative .
Even if the electricity is then used to charge battery - driven private cars rather than to drive trams and trains , the emissions savings compared to taking the cellulosic - fuels route will still be substantial .
The research effort now going into producing cellulosic biofuels from bagasse poses particular dangers : if the process is shown to be profitable , pressures will mount for sugarcane to be grown specifically to feed the biofuel facilities .
Sugarcane is a heavy consumer of water , which might otherwise be used to irrigate food crops .
Cane growing also requires abundant use of nitrogen fertilisers , the nitrous oxide from which can cancel out most of the gains in terms of greenhouse emissions .
How might the appropriate choices surrounding biofuels in Australia now be summarised ?
Biofuels must , of course , be considered within a general framework that involves the accelerated replacing of petrol - driven cars with a mix of public transport and electric cars , with biodiesel - powered hybrids as an interim stage .
Within this context , vigorous work should go into researching and developing algal biodiesel complexes .
The same should occur in the case of oil - producing trees such as honge and jatropha .
Mandates for biodiesel use should be introduced , and depending on research results , steadily expanded as feedstock becomes available .
The use as feedstock of edible vegetable oil from crops such as canola or oil palm , however , should cease .
The fermenting of ethanol from molasses -- which otherwise would be used mainly as cattle feed -- might well continue .
No further facilities , however , should be built to produce ethanol from grains , and the ethanol mandates should be repealed .
Biochar pyrolysis , on the other hand , has genuine promise , and depending on further research , should be developed both as an adjunct to algal biodiesel production and because its own by - products include a useful bio-oil .
If the prognoses for biochar remain favourable , plantations of tree crops on historically cleared grazing land should be fast - tracked .
But the resulting biomass should not be used to produce cellulosic petrol substitutes in any major way .
If produced at all , these fuels should be a heavily taxed self - indulgence of classic car buffs and miscellaneous petrol - heads .
That would be a rational way to proceed .
But in current political circumstances , events promise to unfold quite differently .
As the present economic crisis ends , demand for biofuels to meet mandated levels , in Australia and abroad , will increase rapidly .
High prices can be expected to spur an assault on savannah regions around the world , and this will be reflected in Australia too .
So far , the savannah belt of northern Australia has been one of the few such regions in the world to have its biota remain substantially intact .
But as the biofuels industry becomes wealthy and politically influential , it can be expected to exert pressure for the more fertile and well - watered parts of Australia ’s savannah regions to be cleared for huge new oil - tree and biomass plantings .
Those prospects might seem cause for environmentalists to reject the whole concept of biofuels .
But technologies should not be ruled out merely because capitalism in its search for profit uses them in perverse and destructive fashion .
The task before environmentalists is to assess new practices critically , on the basis of their genuine merits .
Combined with this must be a readiness to campaign for rational choices in the interests of humanity and nature , whatever the pursuit of profits might dictate .

An off - duty Ministry of Defence police dog handler has taken a video of what he claims is a panther - sized big cat .
Pc Chris Swallow was helping a friend with their garden in Helensburgh , Argyll , when he spotted the black creature on a nearby railway line .
The officer , who is stationed at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde , said the cat was as big as a Labrador dog .
Big cats have been reported in the area in the past , with several sightings of the so - called Coulport Cougar .
I 've heard stories about creatures like this moving about the countryside , but never really believed them before
Pc Chris Swallow Pc Swallow said he saw the animal on 30 June while working in the garden at Kildonan Drive , Helensburgh .
He could tell it was not a Labrador , as he first thought , because of the way it was walking , and because its tail was about twice the length that a dog's would have been .
He said : " My friend 's house is next to the West Highland Line and at one point I looked down and saw what I first thought was a black Labrador on the tracks .
" There were trains coming and going throughout the day and I was a bit concerned , but when I looked again I saw that the animal was n't moving the way I expected a dog to .
" It was then I realised that what I was seeing was a big cat and I shouted on my friend to come and have a look .
We were stunned . "
After running to his car to grab his camera phone , Pc Swallow stood on the rail bridge at Winston Road and got a still photo and a couple of minutes of footage of the animal moving up the railway line .
Pc Swallow is a dog handler with the Ministry of Defence He added : " It was remarkable .
I 've heard stories about creatures like this moving about the countryside , but never really believed them before .
Looking back at the video I do n't think there 's any doubt that it 's a big cat . "
The Coulport Cougar was first reported in June 2004 .
The creature was described as being tan and prowling the woods and hills around Loch Long , Portincaple , Whistlefield and next to the Coulport access road .
However , another creature , described as being black in colour , was also spotted at the nearby Garelochhead Training Camp , leading some people to believe that there may also have been a panther in the area .
John Belshaw , pest control officer at the Faslane naval base , said he had spoken to people in the past who had been " quite shaken " by seeing a big cat cross the road in front of them during the night .
Mr Belshaw said : " I have had a look at Chris 's footage and have to say that I do not believe it is a domestic cat or a dog .
" At one point in the video it seems to walk on the railway line and a dog simply would n't have had the balance to do this .
" Also , you can tell from the size of the track that it is much larger than a house cat . "
There have been regular reports of big cat sightings across the UK , leading to speculation that they may have escaped from a private zoo or collection .
' Very exciting ' Shaun Stevens , a researcher with the Big Cats in Britain group , said : " We have regular sightings reported every year of large black cats in the Helensburgh area and it appears to be a favourite haunt of these animals .
" In Argyll , I probably get to hear of maybe 20 or 30 sightings in a year .
In the UK we get a sighting practically every day . "
Mr Stevens said he believed the cats could be a hybrid species , or possible an entirely new species .
" I myself have photographed a black hybrid cat of over 3.5 ft in length , " he said .
" Knowing the width of the rail tracks in Chris 's video is 4ft 8.5 in , the animal photographed by him is clearly in excess of 4ft and as such is certainly not a domestic cat .
" Initial first impressions are very exciting , as I think this could be one of the best pieces of footage of a big cat in the UK ever . "

This is a happy and sad moment at the same time - I have finally reached the last two lectures of MIT 's undergraduate algorithms course .
These last two lectures are on a fairly new area of algorithm research called " cache oblivious algorithms . "
Cache - oblivious algorithms take into account something that has been ignored in all the lectures so far , particularly , the multilevel memory hierarchy of modern computers .
Retrieving items from various levels of memory and cache make up a dominant factor of running time , so for speed it is crucial to minimize these costs .
The main idea of cache - oblivious algorithms is to achieve optimal use of caches on all levels of a memory hierarchy without knowledge of their size .
Cache - oblivious algorithms should not be confused with cache - aware algorithms .
Cache - aware algorithms and data structures explicitly depend on various hardware configuration parameters , such as the cache size .
Cache - oblivious algorithms do not depend on any hardware parameters .
An example of cache - aware ( not cache - oblivious ) data structure is a B - Tree that has the explicit parameter B , the size of a node .
The main disadvantage of cache - aware algorithms is that they are based on the knowledge of the memory structure and size , which makes it difficult to move implementations from one architecture to another .
Another problem is that it is very difficult , if not impossible , to adapt some of these algorithms to work with multiple levels in the memory hierarchy .
Cache - oblivious algorithms solve both problems .
Lecture twenty - two introduces the terminology and notation used in cache - oblivious algorithms , explains the difference between cache - oblivious and cache - aware algorithms , does a simple memory analysis of several simple algorithms and culminates with a cache - oblivious algorithm for matrix multiplication .
The final lecture twenty - three is the most difficult in the whole course and shows cache - oblivious binary search trees and cache - oblivious sorting called funnel sort .
Use this supplementary reading material by professor Demaine to understand the material better : Cache - oblivious algorithms and data structures ( .pdf ) .
Lecture 22 : Cache Oblivious Algorithms I
Lecture twenty - two starts with an introduction to the modern memory hierarchy ( CPU cache L1 , L2 , L3 , main memory , disk cache , etc. ) and with the notation and core concepts used in cache - oblivious algorithms .
A powerful result in cache - oblivious algorithm design is that if an algorithm is efficient on two levels of cache , then it 's efficient on any number of levels .
Thus the study of cache - obliviousness can be simplified to two - level memory hierarchy , say the CPU cache and main memory , where the accesses to cache are instant but are orders of magnitude slower to main memory .
Therefore the main question cache - oblivious algorithm analysis tries to address is how many memory transfers ( MTs ) does a problem of size N take .
The notation used for this is MT ( N ) .
For an algorithm to be efficient , the number of memory transfers should be as small as possible .
Next the lecture analysis the number of memory transfers for basic array scanning and array reverse algorithms .
Since array scanning is consequential , N elements can be processed with O ( N / B ) accesses , where B is the block size - number of elements that are automatically fetched as N - th element is accessed .
That is MT ( N ) = O ( N/B ) for array scanning .
The same bound holds for reversing an array , since it can be viewed two scans - one from the beginning and one from the end .
Next it 's shown that the classical binary search ( covered in lecture 3 ) is not cache efficient , but order statistics problem ( covered in lecture 6 ) is cache efficient .
Finally the lecture describes a cache efficient way to multiply matrices by storing them block - wise in memory .

The Great Leonardo Da Vinci is known the world over for his infamous paintings such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper .
But he was no one trick pony .
He was also the inventor of some of the greatest war machines ever conceived .
Here ’s a look at some of his finest examples .
1. Leonardo Da Vinci’s Terminator
Leonardo Da Vinci ’s mechanical knight was not discovered until 1957 , when Carlo Pedretti discovered it , hidden amongst Da Vinci ’s countless designs .
The mechanical knight , first sketched by DaVinci in 1495 , was not reconstructed until 1996 when Mark Rosheim published an independent study of the robot , followed by a joint enterprise with the Florence Institute and Museum of the History of Science .

2. Machine Gun
The multi- barrelled machine gun was a weapon with remarkable firepower .
Da Vinci sketched this rolling artillery battery around 1480 while in Florence .
A hand crank adjusts elevation , and reloading is a major challenge – especially when under fire .
Image source : Leonardo3
3. Cluster Bomb
To make the bombard , or cannon , a weapon already known at the time , even more deadly , Da Vinci also designed large projectiles , composed of round shells fitted around iron spacers and stitched inside a pliable casing .
Once fired , this invention exploded into many fragments that had greater range and impact than a single cannon - ball .
Image source : Leonardo3
4. Scythed chariots
This is one of Leonardo ’s most beautiful manuscripts .
His sketches reveal horse drawn carriages covered with sharp , swirling blades that moved in the thick of battle slashing through everything in their wake .
The rotating blades were specifically designed to sever the limbs from its victims .
In one of his drawings , Da Vinci illustrated the carnage in such gruesome detail that his notation indicated that his contraption probably would wreak as much havoc on friends as on foes .
Image source : Leonardo3
5. Barrage Cannon
This drawing is on the first page of the Codex Atlanticus .
The drawing itself is very complete and quite fascinating , illustrating the plan of a bombard with sixteen radial cannons .
The most interesting aspect of the project is the centre of the bombard itself , housing a pair of mechanical paddles and gear wheels , providing only a partial glimpse of the possibilities of massive weapon .
Image source : Codex - Atlanticus
6 . Tank
This is perhaps one of the most famous of Da Vinci ’s projects .
His idea of reaping panic and destruction among enemy troops was envisioned in this tortoise - shaped vehicle , reinforced with metal plates , and ringed with cannons .
In a job application to the Duke of Milan , Da Vinci boasted “ I can make armoured cars , safe and unassailable , which will enter the close ranks of the enemy with their artillery , and no company of soldiers is so great that they will not break through them .
And behind these the infantry will be able to follow quite unharmed and without any opposition . ”

7. Wall Defense
Leonardo designed complex and ingenious methods of defence .
Here , when the walls are under attack , the soldiers hidden behind the battlements could quickly and easily ward - off enemies and their single movement by using a system of levers .
As the enemy used ladders in an attempt to breach the walls , the levers were engaged to move the rails built into the walls that the ladders were leaning on , causing them to become unstable and eventually fall .

8. Catapult
The basic design of the catapult had been in use for hundreds of years before Da Vinci embarked upon improving it .
He actually came up with several different models .
This particular design uses a double leaf spring to produce an enormous amount of energy in order to propel stone projectiles or incendiary materials over great distances .
Loading of the two large leaf springs was accomplished using a hand crank on the side of the catapult .

9. Fortress
Leonardo designed this fortress with the idea of rendering it safe from the attack .
The elaborate shape is innovative and presumably could have been an effective defence against the impact of deadly artillery projectiles .
The Da Vinci fortress could be considered by many as very modern in its design with its circular towers and the slightly inclined exterior walls designed to absorb attacks from firearms .

10 . Dismountable cannon
Cannons were very heavy and the carriages used to transport them were often unwieldy .
Leonardo designed a structure that could be easily dismantled and transported , thus permitting the cannon to be easily moved about .

11 . Springald
The Springald , a device that throws large bolts or stones , resembles a contemporary crossbow with inward swinging arms .
Examples of springalds were drawn by Leonardo da Vinci during a period when he was also drawing powder - propelled weapons .
Though several reconstructed examples can be found , there are no known archaeological finds of these machines .
Image source : Leonardo ’s Catapults
12 . Da Vinci’s Helicopter
Leonardo Da Vinci is credited with having first conceived the idea of a machine for vertical flight .
His sketch of the airscrew dated 1493 , was not discovered until the 19th century .
It consisted of a platform mounted by a helical screw driven by a rudimentary system , not unlike that of rubber band - powered model aircraft .
Da Vinci ’s notes state “ if this instrument in the form of a screw were well made of linen , the pores of which had been stopped with starch , it should , upon being turned sharply , rise into the air in a spiral ” .
Image source : Wikipedia
13 . Armoured vessel
This 3D rendering is based on the drawing depicting Da Vinci ’s armoured vessel shows a light vessel fitted with a prow protected by metal and used to ram enemy ships .
Also featured is a rotating covering shield , which opens during the boarding phase of the attack .
The covering shield provided protection against enemy ships and allowed the vessel to approach the enemy without the cannon being observed .
Image source : Universal Leonardo
14 . Giant crossbow
The crossbow is so big that the six wheels are set at a slight angle in order to increase its stability .
This gigantic Da Vinci crossbow launches heavy balls , rather than arrows .
The bow is made with flexible wooden pieces bound together by cords and held in place by pivoting pins .
It has a span of approximately thirteen meters and it is stretched by a complex screw mechanism .
Image source : Universal Leonardo
15 . Da Vinci Siege Weapon
The model proposed by Leonardo represents a machine designed for attacking defensive walls , consisting of a mobile structure with an armoured bridge that rests on the walls of an enemy fortress , while the troops penetrate the city or castle .
In addition to new machines , Da Vinci proposes classical systems for use in assaulting enemy city walls .

Some of these ideas may seem dated now , but when Da Vinci first conceived them they were revolutionary .
With these sketches he progressed the way we look at warfare both on the attack and defence .
A true pioneer in both renaissance painting and war machines .
An outspoken anti-immigration activist who was at the center of a series of violent crimes in Everett earlier this year now stands accused of the home - invasion killings of an Arizona man and his 9 - year - old daughter .
Shawna Forde , 41 , and two associates in her Minuteman American Defense group are charged with two counts of first - degree murder , one count of first - degree burglary and one count of aggravated assault , according to the Pima County Sheriff ’s Department in Arizona .
The May 30 killings were believed to be premeditated and part of a plan to steal money and drugs to finance the Minuteman group she leads .
Forde ’s own family said that the woman weeks ago had discussed using robberies to raise money for her cause .
Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik told the Green Valley News and Sun that Forde was trying right up until her arrest Friday “ to get together a large amount of money to further sophisticate the type of operation she ’s interested in . ”
Forde denied the charges .
“ No , I did not do it , ” the newspaper quoted her saying as she was led out of the sheriff ’s office in front of reporters Friday afternoon .
Raul Flores , 29 , and his daughter , Brisenia , 9 , were killed when a group of armed people , including a woman , forced their way into the home .
The child ’s mother traded gunfire with the attackers .
She survived but remains hospitalized with gunshot wounds .
Pima County officials said the intruders had been looking for the couple ’s other daughter to shoot her , too , but she was n’t home .
Forde was arrested without incident in Sierra Vista , a few miles from the Mexican border .
Also charged in the case are Jason Eugene Bush , 34 , who was being treated for a gunshot wound he is believed to have received during the attack .
He has a history of auto theft from Chelan County , in Eastern Washington .
The third defendant is Albert Robert Gaxiola , 42 .
Pima County Sheriff ’s Department spokeswoman deputy Dawn Barkman told The Herald that Forde “ was the ringleader of this group and of this attack .
She made the order for Bush to go in and shoot these individuals .
“ She ’s just truly an evil person to do something like this , ” Barkman said .
Detectives believe there are additional suspects and are aggressively continuing their investigation , Barkman said .
The shootings occurred in the tiny hamlet of Arivaca , about 60 miles south of Tucson and 10 miles north of the Mexican border , an area of heavy illegal traffic in drugs and people .
It is in an area where Forde and her group , Minuteman American Defense , regularly operate .
The group claims to conduct desert surveillance and undercover investigations aimed at curbing illegal immigration and drug smuggling .
Forde has been active in the Minuteman movement for years , although even before Friday ’s arrest , many groups and leaders kept their distance .
Before she headed to Arizona earlier this year to start another season of prowling the desert with her group , she made it clear that she was preparing for violence .
“ I will stay the course and lead in this fight with every once ( sic ) of strength and conviction I have , ” she wrote in an e-mail message to supporters .
“ I will not waist ( sic ) it on matters that do not pertain to this very mission .
It is time for Americans to lock and load . ”
Forde has a long and troubled history in Snohomish County , including juvenile convictions for felonies , prostitution and other street crime .
Some of her past was recounted by The Herald in a profile that appeared Feb. 22 .
Forde was at the center of a flurry of violence that began Dec. 22 when her ex-husband was shot in his Everett home .
A week later , she reported being beaten and raped by strangers at the same house .
On Jan. 15 , Forde was found in a north Everett alley with apparent gunshot wounds .
She claimed the violence was all retaliation for her activities targeting criminal groups operating on both sides of the border between Mexico and the U.S .
The cases here remain under investigation by Everett police .
Forde ’s ex-husband was seriously wounded during the Dec. 22 shooting .
Reached Friday , he was distraught hearing that a child died .
He declined to comment on his former wife .
Forde ’s mother , who lives in California , said she was not surprised to hear of her daughter ’s arrest .
Rena Caudle said Forde visited her before heading to the border this year .
She talked of staging home invasions , Caudle said .
“ She sat here and said that she was going to start a group where they went down and start taking things away from the Mexican mafia , ” Caudle said .
“ She was going to kick in their doors and take away the money and the drugs . ”
Caudle said she was n’t sure what to make of that at the time , in part because Forde has a history of exaggeration and lying .
Then , early on May 30 — a few hours after the shootings —
Caudle said , Forde called her and reported she was taking refuge in a “ safe house ” in Arivaca .
Forde “ was very frightened , ” Caudle said .
“ She says , ‘ I ’m in hiding . ’
I said , ‘ What is going on ? ’
She said .
‘ You wo n’t believe what is going down here …
The mafia , they are kicking down doors and they are shooting people and they are looking for me . ’”
Pima County sheriff ’s Lt. Michael O’Connor told reporters in Arizona that Raul Flores had connections to Mexican drug cartels and his involvement was known to the Drug Enforcement Agency .
People in the Minuteman movement reacted to news of the arrests with sadness — and some contempt for Forde .
Jim Gilchrist , president of the California - based Minuteman Project and a longtime Forde ally , said his group is separate and “ we disassociate any affiliation between her , her organization and ours . ”
On Friday he posted a message of condolence to the victims ’ families .
Jeff Schwilk , founder of the San Diego Minutemen and an outspoken critic of Gilchrist , said he and others long ago recognized that Forde was unstable and dangerous .
He said Gilchrist should have done the same .
“ The warning had been out in Arizona to stay away from this woman , ” he said .
“ Unfortunately , this conclusion was very tragic . ”

A movement is taking place in an old methodology .
Prefab or modular homes seem to be taking a very popular spot light in the green arena .
This is not the old modular homes that most people think of , where the home is a square box split in half and resemble a double wide trailer home .
These new breed of modular homes are quite stylish and green friendly .
There are a few things that make these green modular homes appealing .
The basic principle of modular homes is to build in a controlled environment and utilization of material .
Several companies are creating boxes of particular components like kitchen , bedrooms and bathrooms .
These boxes are like building blocks that are assembled in many different configurations to create the home .
This process can speed up the construction of the home .
What make a modular home to be considered green ?
Well if we look at what green building is all about we may understand even more .
The primary goal is to reduce environmental impact and create a healthy living environment .
Modular homes reduce the impact on the land , reduce waste of material and make many green products more economical buy using bulk purchase .
Transportation is one huge factor , with fewer deliveries to the jobsite .
A great article on this process and the reasons for using modular homes can be found at Low Impact Living , in an article called Green Prefab Homes - Prefabulous ! , Written by Jason Pelletier .
They have covered this process very well and explain modular living in further detail .
Is there a future for prefab homes ?
Well if anyone that follows the financial news or the stock market will now how successful Warren Buffet has been .
So what does Warren Buffet have to do with Prefab Homes ?
In an article posted May 8 , 2009 in Environmental News Network , Warren Buffet is investing in Green Prefab Homes .
Now everyone knows that anything Mr. Buffet touches seems to turn to gold .
A Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary called Clayton Homes has just launched a green prefab home called I - Home .
To read more about this go to Warren Buffet Company Debuts Line of Green Prefab Homes , By Jason Pelletier .
Not every home buyer is going to have an interest in prefab or modular homes but this may be the next big Green movement in the building industry .
There are several companies that are giving the modular or pods a big push .
The smaller size also makes it fit in the square foot per bedroom scale in all green certifications .
The cost is ranging from $ 100 - $ 170 a square foot without land or site prep .
In the old space movies it showed people living in pods in space , well we are not quite there but we are living in pods on earth , just another step into the future of housing .

KILL BILL star David Carradine was found hanged in his Thai hotel room yesterday after an apparent sex game went wrong .
The 72 - year - old was naked in a closet and had a curtain cord around his neck .
It was also attached to his private parts .
Police in Thailand , where Carradine was making a movie called Stretch , said a maid at his Bangkok hotel found him hanging from the door of a wardrobe yesterday morning .
Chuck Binder , the actor 's manager , described his death as " accidental " .
He added : " It 's just shocking .
He was full of life , always wanting to work - a great person . "
It was believed Carradine - who rose to fame as Grasshopper in cult 70s TV series Kung Fu - had committed suicide .
But there was no note and pals insisted he had not been depressed .
One of Carradine 's friends , David Winters , said it was " impossible " he would have killed himself .
He added : " I 'd have to see a suicide note to believe that David would ever contemplate such a thing . "
Police later refused to confirm or deny Carradine 's death was the result of an " auto - erotic " sex act similar to the one that killed INXS rocker Michael Hutchence in 1997 .
But a spokesman added : " We do not believe anybody else was involved in his death . "
They said Carradine had been dead for at least 12 hours before he was found .
His body was taken to hospital for an autopsy .
The actor arrived in Thailand on Tuesday and checked in to room 352 of the five - star Nai Lert Park Hotel .
He was due to have dinner with the crew from his film on Wednesday night but failed to turn up for the meal .
Carradine appeared in almost 200 films , including Death Race 2000 and The Long Riders .
For most of his career , he played villains and elderly martial arts experts in low - budget thrillers .
But he returned to the limelight in 2003 when Quentin Tarantino cast him as Bill in revenge movie Kill Bill .
He also appeared in Kill Bill - Vol II , in 2004 , earning a Golden Globe nomination as best supporting actor .
Carradine said at the time : " All that was ever required was somebody with Quentin 's courage to take and put me in the spotlight . "
Carradine admitted he had been hooked on drugs and booze in the past but had been sober for years .
He is survived by his fifth wife , Annie , and two daughters .
His dad John , brother Bruce and half - brothers Keith and Robert were also actors .
Hutchence hanged himself with his belt from the door spring of a hotel room in Sydney .
He was naked when he was found and he left no note .
His brother insisted his death was not suicide but as the result of a sex game .
Cutting off oxygen to the brain during sex acts is believed by some to enhance pleasure .
Want to know who visits your Twitter profile ?
Sounds potentially interesting , and it ’s the premise of TwitViewer.net , a site that is being shared by thousands of Twitter users this afternoon with the message “ Want to know whos stalking you on Twitter ? ”
Unfortunately , it appears that TwitViewer may be a phishing scam , or at the least , is probably not doing what it promises .
Upon entering your credentials , it does show you a list of users that supposedly visited your profile – but it seems likely this is simply fake , as a dummy account we created just to test the app showed 200 recent visitors seconds after registering .
The app also automatically tweets out the “ want to know whos stalking you ? ” message ( and yes , the message itself is spelled wrong ) .
It ’s unclear that this is phishing , as the site does let you know that it will send out the auto - tweet .
It ’s almost certainly not doing what it promises though , as there would be no conceivable way for it to know who has been visiting your Twitter profile .
In short : be wary of this app , and if you logged in , you may want to consider changing your password ( Twitter suggests you do the same ) .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
His was one of the first photos of a missing child to appear on a milk carton .
Almost 30 years later , Etan Patz is still missing .
Etan Patz , who disappeared in 1979 , was the first missing child featured in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s .
Etan was 6 when he disappeared on May 25 , 1979 , the Friday before Memorial Day .
He was on his way to school in what is now the upscale Soho neighborhood of New York .
It was the first time he'd walked to the bus stop by himself .
It was just a few blocks away .
Etan , like any 6 - year - old , argued that all of his friends walked to the bus stop alone , and his parents relented .
His mother , Julie Patz , learned that Etan had n't been in classes when he failed to return home .
She called the school at 3:30 p.m. , then called the homes of all his friends .
When no one had seen Etan , she called police and filed a missing person 's report .
By evening more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds .
The search continued for weeks , but no clues to Etan 's whereabouts were found .
Watch an update on the case »
The boy 's disappearance was one of the key events that inspired the missing children 's movement , which raised awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children .
Etan 's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s .

Grace heats up the cold cases .
8 & 10 p.m. , HLN see full schedule »
" In our minds there were only two possibilities , " said Stan Patz , the boy 's father .
" Either Etan was taken by a stranger and killed or he was taken by a very sad woman desperate for a child of her own , and we hoped that such a woman would at least take care of him and keep him safe . "
Patz lived with this hope until 1982 , when he learned of Jose Antonio Ramos ' arrest and the surprising connection between him and a former babysitter of Etan's .
Ramos was a drifter who in 1979 lived in Alphabet City , a neighborhood not far from Soho .
In 1982 he was arrested after boys in a neighborhood in the Bronx complained that he had stolen their book bags while trying to coax them into a drainpipe under a bridge , where he lived , said the Patzes and federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois , who spent years investigating the case .
When police found Ramos in his drainpipe home , they found he had many photographs of small blond boys .
They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz , according to author Lisa R Cohen 's book about the case , " After Etan : The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive . "
Bronx police questioned Ramos , and he denied having anything to do with Etan 's disappearance .
But he did tell police that his girlfriend used to baby - sit for the boy , GraBois said .
Prosecutors in the Bronx and Manhattan pursued this lead , but concluded they did not have enough evidence to connect Ramos to Etan 's disappearance , GraBois and a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney 's Office said .
Ramos was released when the parents of the Bronx boys chose not to press charges against him , according to published reports .
He left town and disappeared for six years -- until GraBois reviewed Etan 's case .
GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect .
GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison .
GraBois said he brought Ramos to New York for questioning and surprised him with the question : " How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz ? "
Ramos told GraBois that he'd taken a little boy to an apartment he had on the lower East Side on the same day that Etan went missing .
" He was 90 percent sure it was the same he'd seen in the news that was missing , " GraBois said .
According to GraBois , Ramos claimed he released the boy and brought him to a subway station so the boy could go visit his aunt in Washington Heights .
" Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights , " GraBois said .
When questioned further , Ramos refused to say anything more and asked for a lawyer , according to GraBois .
Ramos is serving a 10 - to 20 - year prison sentence in Pennsylvania .
He is scheduled to be released in November 2012 , GraBois said .
GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison , and planted informants as his cell mates .
He would n't go into detail about what Ramos might have told them , but said he 's convinced he 's eyeing the right suspect .
GraBois turned over his evidence to the Manhattan District Attorney 's Office , but prosecutors have not brought charges .
They say that without a body , they do n't have enough evidence .
Etan 's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case .
Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Etan Patz or that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for his disappearance is asked to call the FBI / NYPD Etan Patz hotline : 212-384-2200 .
All About Missing Children
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have laid the groundwork for an unprecedented simulation of a large - scale botnet after booting up 1 million Linux kernels as virtual machines .
Sandia computer scientists Ron Minnich ( foreground ) and Don Rudish ( background ) have successfully run more than a million Linux kernels as virtual machines .
( click image to enlarge )
They now are waiting for completion of a new , faster and more capable supercomputer at the Livermore , Calif. , lab , on which they hope to run 10 million kernels in a simulation of the open Internet — complete with Web and mail servers , as well as simulated users clicking on simulated emails , getting simulated infections , and joining a simulated botnet .
A kernel is the core component of the operating system that passes instructions between hardware and software .
To make the unprecedented achievement of running 1 million kernels as virtual machines , researchers stripped out support for extraneous devices like Bluetooth and wireless connectivity .
Managing a Challenge
They still had difficulty keeping up with all of the virtual machines , said Sandia computer science researcher Don Rudish , who worked on the experiment .
For instance , the Ethernet switch on the lab ’s supercomputer , called “ Thunderbird , ” was n’t designed to recognize one million MAC addresses online .
“ After 100,000 , the whole network came to a crawl , ” Rudish told LinuxInsider .
“ Just looking through 1 million lines on a text log takes some time . ”
While the experiment was a success , Rudish said researchers did n’t entirely solve the issue of monitoring the vast network , even after working out ways to visualize some of the data and reduce the amount of information flowing to them .
Virtual Botnet
They hope to solve that in the future by using botnet behavior to help control the network , Rudish said .
Unfortunately , researchers still do n’t know much about how botnets actually work .
So , they ’re planning to use the lab ’s new Red Sky supercomputer , currently under construction , to create a 10 million kernel system and introduce botnet software into the system to see what happens , Rudish said .
Other researchers have simulated the behavior of botnets in computer models , but little is known about how they really operate .
Sandia ’s experiment will be different because it ’s much closer to an actual real - world application with what will look to the network like 10 million computers online at once , he said .
“ It ’s implemented in software , so you can say it ’s a simulation , but it ’s a much better one in that you ’re running real code , real TCP stacks , ” Rudish said .
Some of the computers will be programmed to act as Web and mail servers , others as simulated users with a percentage chance to click on incoming “ emails ” — some of which will download botnet software to infect the virtual machine .
That machine will then take on one of several roles in the botnet : storage server , Web server , or aggressor seeking to further propagate the botnet ’s control .
The experiment should give researchers more insight into how botnets work and how to combat them , Rudish said .
Project Cost
It ’s difficult to calculate the cost of the 1 million kernel experiment because so much of the technology that went into it was developed for other purposes , explained Rudish .
However , direct costs ran about US $ 100,000 , he said .
The Department of Energy ’s Office of Science , the National Nuclear Security Administration , and Sandia funded the project .
PHILADELPHIA -- Jim Johnson , whose attacking defenses helped the Eagles to one Super Bowl appearance and five NFC title games , has died .
He was 68 .
Johnson had taken a leave of absence from the team in May as he continued to battle a cancerous tumor on his spine .
The Eagles announced his death on Tuesday afternoon .
Giants coach Tom Coughlin said the football season is starting off on a sad note .
" It is a sad , very sad , day .
I talked recently to ( Eagles video director ) Mike Dougherty and asked him to let Jim know that I was thinking about him , and I had dropped Jim a note to let him know as well , '' Coughlin said Tuesday .
" Forget about what kind of coach he was ... he was an excellent , excellent defensive coach , and he trained others to be the same .
We know what Steve Spagnuolo meant to us .
We had great respect for Jim , and he had great respect for us .
" I did n't know Jim personally , but we would always talk to each other , mostly about the NFC East and what a great , competitive division it is .
It was a respectful critique about what great players , coaches and organizations there are within the division .
In talking with people who worked with Jim , you sense what a class act Jim was .
He was great to work with and for , and he had his priorities in order .
His players loved to play for him and his coaches loved to coach with him .
" It is a sad day for the National Football League to lose somebody the quality of Jim Johnson .
It is a sad note on which to start the season .
He coached right up to the very end . "
A veteran of 22 years as an NFL assistant , Johnson was considered one of the top defensive minds in the league , known for complex schemes that confused opponents and pressured the quarterback from every angle .
His defenses consistently ranked among the best in the league , including last season , when the Eagles finished third in total defense and fell one victory short of the Super Bowl .
From 2000 - 08 , Johnson 's Philadelphia defenses ranked second in the NFL in sacks ( 390 ) .
During his 10 - year tenure , the Eagles made the playoffs seven times and he produced 26 Pro Bowl selections .
" This whole Eagles - Andy Reid regime here that 's taken place would n't have been possible without Jim , " said Andy Reid , who hired Johnson to be his defensive coordinator shortly after he got his first head coaching job with the Eagles in 1999 .
" I 'm not sure there 's a person that I 've met that is n't a Jim Johnson fan .
He really represented everything this city is all about with his toughness and grit .
That 's the way he fought this cancer . "
Eagles chairman Jeffrey Lurie praised Johnson for his leadership skills and the person he was .
" For 10 years , Jim Johnson was an exceptional coach for the Philadelphia Eagles , but more importantly , he was an outstanding human being , " Lurie said .
" As an integral part of the Eagles family , Jim epitomized the traits of what a great coach should be -- a teacher , a leader , and a winner ...
It was easy to feel close to him . "
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell echoed Lurie 's sentiments .
" He was a teacher to many players both on and off the field and devoted his life to the game of football , " Goodell said in a statement .
" He had a positive influence on scores of young men , and leaves behind a wonderful legacy . "
On Sunday , the Eagles announced that Sean McDermott would replace Johnson .
In his first news conference as coordinator , McDermott gave full credit to Johnson .
" What have n't I learned from Jim ? " McDermott said .
" I do n't think it would be fair to Jim , in this setting , to try and limit in one statement , one press conference , the effect that Jim has had on my life . "
McDermott paid Johnson the ultimate compliment in describing the style of defense he wanted the Eagles to play : Johnson 's style .
" There is one thing I know , and that is that this system , it works , " McDermott said .
" Jim has spent a considerable amount of time in his coaching career researching and finding things that work and finding things that did n't work , quite frankly , and I 'm going to respect that and we 're going to build on that .
From there , we 'll add wrinkles . "
Coaches across the league paid homage to Johnson 's impact on their careers and the league .
" I loved Jim Johnson , " said Ravens coach John Harbaugh , an Eagles assistant for nine seasons with Johnson .
" He had a special ability to bring out the best in people while getting you to see the best in yourself .
He saw potential and developed it .
He made me believe I could coach at this level .
In football , he was a pioneering and brilliant strategist , changing the way defense is played in the NFL .
For me , he was a father - type mentor , and above all , a cherished friend .
He belongs in the Hall of Fame .
I will miss him so much . "
" He was a dear friend and a special person , " said St. Louis Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo , a member of the Eagles defensive staff under Johnson for eight seasons .
" Our prayers and thoughts go out to his wife Vicki and their family .
Jim meant the world to me , both personally and professionally .
I am very blessed to have had the privilege to work for him and with him .
The NFL has lost a good man . "
Johnson had been treated for melanoma in 2001 .
In January , he complained of back pain and coached from the press box in the Eagles ' playoff win over the Giants and in the loss to the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC championship .
An MRI after the divisional playoff win against the Giants on Jan. 11 alerted doctors that something might be wrong .
Following the Arizona loss , the team announced the cancer had returned and Johnson would undergo more treatments .
Johnson had recovered sufficiently to coach during the team 's first post - draft minicamp in May .
But he coached from a motorized scooter during practices and said he was n't certain he'd be able to return for the season .
" Jim was tailor - made to coach in Philadelphia , " said Broncos safety Brian Dawkins , who played 10 seasons for Johnson in Philadelphia .
" He was a tough coach who was n't afraid to let you know how he was feeling , but at the same time , he cared about us deeply . "
Johnson is survived by his wife , two children and four grandchildren .
Full reactions from around the NFL , courtesy of the Eagles :
Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie : " For ten years , Jim Johnson was an exceptional coach for the Philadelphia Eagles , but more importantly , he was an outstanding human being .
As an integral part of the Eagles family , Jim epitomized the traits of what a great coach should be - a teacher , a leader , and a winner .

It was easy to feel close to him .
Our hearts go out to his wife , Vicky and his wonderful family .
We will miss him greatly . "
Eagles president Joe Banner : " This is a sad day for the entire Philadelphia Eagles family .
Jim Johnson was first and foremost a friend and our hearts are with his family at this difficult time .
Jim was an exceptional coach who had an incredible passion for his work .
He had a knack for developing young players into mature , focused and responsible men .
Jim was a strong , wise man ; absolutely dedicated to his family and friends .
While his presence will be missed , his legacy of excellence will be felt for years to come . "
Commissioner Roger Goodell : " Jim Johnson was a beloved coach who spent 22 years in the NFL as one of the best defensive coaches in league history .
He was a teacher to many players both on and off the field and devoted his life to the game of football .
He had a positive influence on scores of young men and leaves behind a wonderful legacy .
On behalf of the NFL family , we extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Vicky and his children and grandchildren . "
Ravens coach John Harbaugh : " I loved Jim Johnson .
This is a sad day for so many people who were touched by this great man .
Ingrid and I , the Harbaugh family , and the Ravens have Jim 's wife , Vicky , and the Johnson family in our thoughts and prayers .
Jim was a tremendous teacher of football and life .
He had a special ability to bring out the best in people while getting you to see the best in yourself .
He saw potential and developed it .
He made me believe I could coach at this level .
In football , he was a pioneering and brilliant strategist , changing the way defense is played in the NFL .

Broncos safety Brian Dawkins : " This is a sad , sad day for myself and my Philadelphia family .
Jim was tailor - made to coach in Philadelphia .
He was a tough coach who was n't afraid to let you know how he was feeling , but at the same time , he cared about us deeply .
He was an absolute blessing to me with the way he used me on the football field and allowed me to show my God - given ability .
His confidence in me meant so much -- he looked to create new defenses each week to utilize my talents .
I have been praying for him every day , and those prayers wo n't stop now .
I 'll be praying for his family and their comfort during this difficult time . "
Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo : " My wife Maria and I are deeply saddened to hear of Jim 's passing .
He was a dear friend and a special person .
Our prayers and thoughts go out to his wife Vicki and their family .
Jim meant the world to me , both personally and professionally .
I am very blessed to have had the privilege to work for him and with him .
The NFL has lost a good man . "
Chargers defensive coordinator Ron Rivera : " Jim was most certainly a very good man ; a very decent man .
He was definitely a mentor , not just for me but for several guys in the league right now that are coordinators and head coaches .
He was just a real caring person .
He gave me my start and my opportunity .
He took the time to teach me .
I 'm extremely grateful for everything he did for me .
" Going into my fourth year in the league , he showed me how to script ( plays ) .
He showed me how to put together a game plan .
Then he'd have me write his game plan up for him and he'd ask me , ' Why would you do this ? '
He 'd tell my why .
' That 's not good enough , ' or ' That 's a good idea . '
He was most certainly a teacher .
" You talk about people giving you a start and helping you along the way .
I got my first job coaching with Dave Wannstedt , but I got my first opportunity to be a position coach with Jim .
He took the time to teach me and show me .
I would n't be where I am today without him mentoring , showing me and giving me the opportunity .
" Leslie ( Frazier ) , Steve ( Spagnolo ) and I ... we laugh about our time with Jim all the time .
We were the three young guys on the staff and Jim was hard on us .
I remember just after I was hired in Philadelphia , I had just finished signing my contract and he walked into my office and closed the door .
He said , ' Listen .
I 'm an old linebacker coach .
Do n't take anything personal when I come in and take over your meetings , when I take over your drills .
I can't help myself .
Do n't take it personal when I 'm hard on you because I 'm just trying to teach you . '
That 's exactly what he did .
You take a step back and look at the success we 've all had .
The direct correlation was Jim Johnson . "
49ers coach Mike Singletary : " I would like to express , from the 49ers organization , my condolences to the Johnson family and the Eagles family , from the 49ers family .
Everything that I know about Coach Johnson , is he is from the old school .
He had a way of doing things and some of the people , players , coaches that know of him , speak very highly of him . "

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Most of us , when we take our first science classes , learn that when things cool down , they shrink .
( When they heat up , we learn , they usually expand . )
However , water seems to be the exception to the rule .
Instead of shrinking as it cools , this common liquid actually expands .
In order to explain this phenomenon , some scientists have adopted the “ mixture ” model , which purports that low - density , ice - like components dominate due to cooling .
Masakazu Matsumoto , at the Nagoya University Research Center for Materials Science in Japan , has a different idea .
He describes his findings in Physical Review Letters : " Why Does Water Expand When It Cools ? "
“ Theoreticians often describe that ice - like local structure emerges in the super - cooled liquid water by cooling , and increase of such heterogeneous low - density domain causes the density anomalies , ” Matsumoto tells PhysOrg.com .
“ Such an explanation is easy to imagine and looks plausible .
Experimentalists tend to believe the theoretician ’s beautiful and simple model , and interpret their data based on this . ”
However , such heterogeneity as must occur in this mixed model has not been truly proven experimentally .
Matsumoto set out to model super - cooled water , and see if he could discover the mechanism behind the expansion of water under conditions that should make it shrink .
In a previous work ( M. Matsumoto , A. Baba , and I . Ohmine , J. Chem .
Phys. 127 , 134504 ( 2007 ) ) , Matsumoto offered a new method of analyzing the hydrogen bond network structure found in super - cooled liquid water .
“ I found that the structure of supercooled water can be tessellated into a variety of polyhedron - like structure , vitrites , ” he says .
“ I thought the issue would be a good chance to test my method . ”
“ Water is a network - forming matter .
You can imagine the structure of the network as a kitchen sponge , ” Matsumoto continues .
“ The sponge structure is originally a kind of foam but membranes are lost , and only the beams - bonds - remain .
In both network of water and kitchen sponge , four bonds meet at a point , or node , to form a three dimensionally connected random network .
As Plateau pointed out in 19th century , four beams of a foam crosses at a node with regular tetrahedral angle - Maraldi 's angle - similar to the water ’s hydrogen bond network . ”
Matsumoto used computer simulation to look at three ways to change the volume of the foam cells : extension of the bonds , a change in the containing angle between the bonds , and a change in network topology .
“ By discriminating the three contributions , the mechanism became very clear .
One contributes to thermal expansion , another one contributes to thermal contraction , and the last one does not .
Density maximum is a result of these competing contributions , ” he explains .
“ I found that the thermal volume contraction is due to the deviation of bond angles from the regular tetrahedral angle , ” Matsumoto says .
He also applied his former idea of vitrites to classify local structures .
“ Any kind of local structure shrinks when bond angle is distorted from the regular tetrahedral angle .
In other words , local structural variety is not the principal factor contributing to the thermal contraction .
Water shrinks homogeneously by thermal angular distortion , regardless of local structural variety . ”
Right now , though , reproducing the results of Matsumoto ’s simulation experimentally is a rather difficult task .
“ It is still very difficult to observe microscopic heterogeneity by experiments . ”
He hopes , though , that his simulation will at least get theoreticians and experimentalists thinking about alternatives to idea of an ice - like , low - density domain growing in liquid water through cooling .
“ My finding will affect to the interpretation of experimental data on super - cooled water as well as water in the vicinity of walls , solutes , biomolecules . ”
Moving forward , Matsumoto hopes to use computer simulation to tackle water polyamorphism .
“ There are several materials which invoke liquid - liquid coexistence .
Most apparent case is observed in phosphor , and tetrahedral network materials such as water , silicon , silica and germanium , are supposed to be the case , too , ” he insists .
“ By computer simulations , many people also have reproduced the liquid - liquid coexistence .
However , nobody ever explained how and why two liquid phases of a single component can share the interface . ”
It appears that water is much more interesting than many of us ever could have imagined .

Heard enough of the Creation Museum ?
If not , go read the article I wrote last week about a visit by paleontologists there ( it ’s a good article , I promise ) as well as a follow - up blog posting ( that ’s good , too ) .
And then Answers in Genesis responded to my posting .
My post today is not about the Creation Museum .
Rather , it ’s about the opposite : why are the vast , vast majority of biologists so convinced of validity of the theory of evolution ?
Actually , a large chunk of this post comes from Kenneth Miller , a biology professor at Brown University who has been at the forefront of the evolution wars , explaining why biologists are convinced of evolution .
He gave this talk at the North American Paleontological Convention in Cincinnati last month , and I think it ’s worth reading his words unfiltered , in context .
( There ’s some scattered but noncrucial jargon .
“ Homologous ” just means of similar structure and function .
“ Beta - globin ” is an important protein because two beta - globins plus two copies of another protein known as alpha - globin make hemoglobin , without which your blood could not carry oxygen and your cells would suffocate . )
Dr. Miller told an anecdote of how he caught two students plagiarizing .
Two of my students cheated on a written assignment by submitting the same paper .
And I called them in and said , “ Guys , I caught you . ”
They said , “ Well , our papers are n’t that similar .
We have different titles .
We begin in a different way . ”
What they had done was rearrange all of the paragraphs and put in new words and stuff like that .
At superficial glance , they looked entirely different .
And they said , “ Our thinking is the same , because we ’re roommates , of course .
And we had discussed this , we talked about it , so it ’s not surprising we come to the same conclusion .
But look , none of the paragraphs in our two papers match . ”
And they were right about that .
So they said , “ How would you think we copied ? ” I said , “ I ran your papers through a program that looks for unusual matching strings .
You guys misspelled the same six words in the same six ways .
And when you have matching mistakes , there is no other explanation other than a common ancestor for the paper . ”
And they broke down , and they threw themselves on the mercy of the court .
In the same way that the spelling errors pointed to the students ’ copying from an earlier paper ( or one another ) , Dr. Miller said , genetic errors point to the lineage of different species .
The human genome includes five copies of the gene that produces beta -globin .
In the middle of these genes is a stretch of genetic code that clearly was once a sixth beta - globin gene .
But this so - called pseudogene now contains mistakes that prevent it from producing RNA that can be transcribed into beta - globin protein .
Dr. Miller continued :
It turns out that there is an organism that has matching mistakes in its beta - globin pseudogene .
That organism actually turns out to be the chimpanzee , and also the gorilla – beta - globin pseudogenes with exact matching errors .
And there is only one explanation for that at the molecular level , which is common ancestor .
In 2005 , a couple of weeks before the start of the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District trial in Pennsylvania over the teaching of “ intelligent design ” in public schools , the journal Nature published the full chimpanzee genome .
Humans and chimps share about 98 percent of the DNA and most of the genes .
That general fact had been known for some time and by itself is not immensely convincing .
But there are stronger arguments in the details , and Dr. Miller discussed one argument presented at the trial .
Again , the evidence centers around a glitch .
We had to put this into terms – no offense intended here – that were so simple that even an attorney could understand them .
And I want to show you how we did this .
We humans have 46 chromosomes – 23 pairs .
All of the other great apes have 24 pairs of chromosomes .
So how is it that we are missing a pair of chromosomes that all these recent relatives actually have ?
Is it possible that a pair of chromosomes just got lost in our lineage ?
Well , no .
There are so many important genes on every chromosome that the loss of both members of a homologous pair would be fatal , would n’t even get past embryonic development .
So the only possibility is two chromosomes that are still separate in other primates must have gotten accidentally stuck together to form a single fused chromosome in us .
And that ’s the explanation that exists in evolution .
Here is why evolution is science and not conjecture .
If that ’s true , we want to be able to find that fused chromosome .
So if we can , that is a powerful confirmation of an evolutionary prediction .
Well , can we find it ?
It turns out it is much easier to recognize a fused chromosome than you might think .
The tips of all chromosomes are covered with a very special DNA sequence , in a region called the telomere .
It is really easy to recognize .
Near the center of every chromosome is an equally recognizable region called the centromere .
If one of our chromosomes was formed by the fusion of two primate chromosomes , you know what it would have ?
It would have telomere DNA at the center , and it would have two centromeres .
Should be very easy to recognize .
We scanned the human genome .
Do we have a chromosome like that ?
The answer is , you bet we do .
It is called human chromosome number two .
Our second chromosome has telomere DNA at the center .
It has two centomeres .
We have placed it as being from primate chromosomes 12 and 13 and so exact is the correspondence that people who work on the chimpanzee genome now call the chromosomes they used to call 12 and 13 2A and 2B , because they correspond to those two halves of the human second chromosome .
Is there any question , to explain these facts – and these are facts , this is not hypothesis or conjecture – any way to explain these facts in light of the view that our species was uniquely designed or intelligently created ?
The answer is no .
You can only explain this by evolutionary common ancestry .
About the only thing you could say is maybe the designer wanted to fool us into thinking we evolved and he rigged chromosome number two to make it look that way .
And the only thing I can tell you is if that was his intent , he did a heck of a job .
Because the marks of evolution are literally all over our chromosome .
Not surprisingly , the Creation Museum people come to a different interpretation .
There are several stages of drunkness 1 .
Happy -
The only reason you feel anything at all is because you 're glad that you 're beginning your alcohol binge .
2 .
Tipsy -
Your first shot has taken effect .
You feel as though you may " tip " over .
3 . Buzzed - A slight pressure inside your head .
You feel as though you can walk up to anyone in the bar and take them home tonight .
4. Drunk ( aka sloshed ) -
Your limbs have stopped working the way you want them to .
Speech slurred .
You may also feel a sloshing feeling from the alcohol contents in your stomach .
5. Hammered -
You 're sitting on the floor of the club wondering how you got there .
By now , the pressure in your head has elevated to a hammering feeling .
6 .
All fucked up -
You have reached the trifecta of alcohol consumption !
To reach this state , you probably have mixed your beers , wines , and liquors .
Congratulations !
7 .
So drunk you act sober again - Rinse and repeat
It was the first time the International Olympic Committee eliminated any sports in 69 years .
Both baseball and softball suffered from low international support because they are not widely played , despite their Olympic inclusion , and remained dominated by North American teams .
Cuba won three of the four baseball gold medals and the United States won the other .
The United States won all three softball gold medals .
Moreover , Major League Baseball never allowed its players to participate and the International Olympic Committee has expressed concern over any sport that is not played in the Olympics with its best players .
" Those who bear most of the blame are the owners of the professional leagues , who refuse to free up their ballplayers to compete , " Carlos Rodriguez , president of the Cuban baseball federation , told The Associated Press .
" It 's a shame because this decision will disappoint millions of young people who practice and love this sport . "
Major League Baseball is about to unveil a world baseball tournament that will include the top players and that will be played before the regular season , a plan that did not help the sport 's standing with the International Olympic Committee .
" I feel like somebody who has been thrown out - it 's certainly not a good feeling , " said Aldo Notari of Italy , the president of the International Baseball Federation .
" I do n't think the I.O.C. members know our sport deeply enough . "
