Mr Kroenke also owns a number of US sports clubs Arsenal director Stan Kroenke has moved nearer to the stage when he would have to make an offer for the entire stockholding of the club .
The US billionaire has bought another 427 shares in Arsenal 's holding company , at a cost of £ 3.6 m ( $ 5.86 m ) , taking his shareholding to 29.6 % .
He bought the shares at £ 8,500 each , which values the club at about £ 529 m .
He is nearing the 29.99 % threshold , beyond which he would be forced to make an offer for the remaining shares .
' Flirts '
Mr Kroenke acquired more stock from the estate of the late British industrialist Ernest Harrison .
" I do not know what Kroenke will do , " said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger .
" All I know is the rules , that if he gets to 30 % , he has to make a bid for the club .
At the moment , he flirts with the 30 , but is not there .
" I do not know what his intentions are , I have not spoken to him about it .
TAKEOVER GUIDELINES
Once someone reaches a 30 % shareholding in a company they are deemed by the Takeover Panel to have " effective control " of the firm and must then make an offer for the remaining shares
The price offered cannot be lower than the highest price the offerer has paid for shares in the firm in the previous 12 months
If , after the offer has been made , the offerer has more than 50 % of the shares they are deemed to have been successful in their takeover and legally in control
If an offer is unsuccessful and the 50 % shareholding level is not breached then the offerer cannot come back with another takeover attempt for 12 months , unless invited to do so by the company " Inside the club , on a daily basis , it does not change anything , " said the Gunners ' boss ahead of Wednesday 's Champions League game with AZ Alkmaar at the Emirates Stadium .
At Arsenal 's annual general meeting at the Emirates Stadium on 22 October , Mr Kroenke was asked what his intentions were for the north London club .
But he chose not to speak to the gathered shareholders , with chairman Peter Hill - Wood intervening .
Mr Hill - Wood pointed out that under takeover rules any public statements regarding future bid intentions must be unambiguous , otherwise the individual concerned would be prevented from making a formal takeover move for six months .
Mr Kroenke , who owns the NBA 's Denver Nuggets and Colorado Rapids MLS football team , has been gradually increasing his stake in Arsenal this year through a number of different share purchases .
As well as Mr Kroenke , the other major shareholders are Uzbeki tycoon Alisher Usmanov , who holds a stake of about 25 % , Danny Fiszman , and Lady Bracewell - Smith .
' Plurality ' According to the Arsenal Supporters '
Trust , roughly 13 % of the club 's shares are held by small shareholders .
After Mr Kroenke 's latest share purchase was announced , the fans ' group said : " While the AST welcome Stan Kroenke 's involvement , we agree with the sentiment of Peter Hill - Wood 's statement at the most recent AGM that there is no need for any shareholder to launch a takeover of the club . "
It added : " The AST believes in plurality of ownership . "
The statement continued : " The AST has a good relationship with both Stan Kroenke and members of his team at Kroenke Sports Enterprises ( KSE ) .
" We have stressed to them the importance of custodianship and that the club will be stronger if it has supporters directly involved in its ownership model .
" While we can not vouch for their future actions , we are encouraged that they have said they see the AST having an important role to play at Arsenal . "

When most people retire they take up golfing , but 101 - year - old Virgil Coffman is living life in the fast lane .
The active centenarian recently became the oldest - known living owner of a new 2010 Chevrolet Camaro .
Despite initial concern from the sales associate , Coffman knew exactly what he wanted when he purchased the 400 - plus horsepower , bright yellow , Transformers edition Camaro .
Impressed by the overall design , Virgil was ultimately sold on the cars ' easy handling and striking looks .
After owning nearly 40 cars in his lifetime , he follows the philosophy that if you want something , get it .
These days Virgil says he can't go anywhere without strangers asking him about his car and he 's already planning road trips for next summer .

Jamie Dimon , JPMorgan ’s chairman and chief executive , said the earnings reflected growth across several business lines , but he gave only a cautious outlook .
“ While we are seeing some initial signs of consumer credit stability , we are not yet certain that this trend will continue , ” he said in a statement .
Image James Dimon , chief executive of JPMorgan Chase , said that the bank was performing well but still gave a cautious outlook .

Consumer loss rates remain high , but there were upbeat signs in the bank ’s numbers .
Bank officials said they saw “ a little bit of stabilization ” in home values , especially for lower price properties and in states like California .
And while delinquencies remain high , fewer borrowers were falling behind on mortgages .
Michael J. Cavanagh , the bank ’s chief financial officer , called that a “ hopeful sign ” but stopped short of declaring that heavy losses were over .
“ We have to watch the economy and see where it heads , ” he said in a conference call with reporters .
JPMorgan was the first of the nation ’s biggest banks to report third - quarter earnings .
Bank of America , Citigroup and Goldman Sachs also release results this week .
As one of the first major banks to warn of troubles with subprime mortgages , home equity loans and credit cards , JPMorgan is seen as a bellwether for the financial industry .
Although the housing market and economy remain weak , analysts expect to see a slowdown in consumer loan losses at the biggest banks and for them to start setting aside less money in their reserves .
Meanwhile , the troubles are quickly moving to commercial real estate loans , which will place a heavier burden on smaller lenders .
Mr. Dimon still must contend with several problems .
His decision last month to replace the two co-heads of the investment banking division with a single leader , James E. Staley , raised concern within the ranks .
JPMorgan ’s credit card division is unlikely to turn a profit until 2011 , and , like most of the industry , its consumer franchise has seen a fall - off in new mortgage lending .
Mr. Dimon also faces obstacles in Washington .
He must balance paying bonuses to JPMorgan investment bankers based on blow - out earnings with public furor over Wall Street pay .
New regulations on credit cards threaten to lower the profitability of that business , and lenders face other legislative efforts to curb bank fees and derivatives trading .
The Kent - based firm which markets the test has been accused of commercial exploitation of a sensitive issue .
Newspaper advertisements for the test have been targeted at men who have " nagging doubts " about whether a child is really theirs .
The £ 298 kit can be conducted at home and does not require a blood sample .
Instead a swab is taken from the child 's mouth .
There is then a five - week wait for the result of the DNA test while it is matched against a sample taken from the possible father .
For the ' suspicious and disbelieving '
In its advertisements , the company asks : " Whose child is it ?
Are you really the father ?
" The curious , suspicious or disbelieving who just want peace of mind can now conduct paternity checks in the comfort of their own home .
Do-it - yourself DNA tests are now available in Britain . "
The Human Genetics Advisory Committee has raised doubts about the tests .
Children could suffer
David Hinchliffe wants ban
" I think it 's the children who could suffer most , " Mr Hinchliffe said .
" I think they ( the firm ) are blundering into a very dangerous area .
" They are enticing fathers , obviously on the back of the Child Support Agency issue , to carry out tests without any reference whatsoever to the child 's feelings or discussion with the mother .
Her consent or views are not taken account of in the propaganda they have issued .
Contemplate suicide
" I hope the company might think through the implications of this because I am sure they must realise that the likely consequences are damaged and destroyed relationships , and I suspect that some people could , as a consequence of this , sadly be even driven to contemplating suicide . "
Mr Hinchliffe added : " I hope the Government will find some way to block the activities of this agency and other agencies undertaking similar testing .
" I intend to pursue the matter with the Department of Health .
I want to see it stopped .
Clearly there is a huge gap in law here where there is no provision in respect of non-medical use of DNA .
" I think there is a need for urgent guidelines and the advisory committee on genetic testing must look at this as soon as possible . "
Ethical issues
Paternity issues have sparked passionate demonstrations
" Why should somebody carry out the test ?
Whom should they consult ?
Should they ask or tell the biological mother ?
" Should they seek the consent of the child ?
If they get the information , is it reliable ?
" Are they under an obligation to tell anyone , including the child ?
This seems to be a topic without any of the moral context in which it should be approached , " he said .
Deception a possibility
Professor Martin Richards , director of the Centre for Family Research at Cambridge University , said people should not be denied access to the truth .
But he added : " I really do n't see how any commercial testing organisation can really determine where a sample they are testing comes from .
" If people wish to deceive them and , for example , get a child tested when the parents of that child - or the people who appear to be the parents of that child - do n't wish that to be done , I do n't really see how that can be stopped once this becomes generally available . "
There would be nothing to stop grandparents carrying out the test without the supposed parents ' knowledge , he said .
No complaints
A spokesman for the DNA Testing Agency , based in Keston , Kent , which sells the kit , said the adverts had been running in a national newspaper for some months .
He said : " There has not been a big rush , it has just been trickling along .
Dozens of people have taken it up .
" As many mothers as alleged fathers have been buying the test . "
Commenting on criticism of the test , the spokesman added : " They are defending the position where they are controlling the tests in this country .
" We are giving people the opportunity to do private testing .
There is nothing deceitful or underhand about it . "
The spokesman added that some people had already received test results and the company had received no complaints " whatsoever " .

Should criminal justice reform groups actively urge SCOTUS to overrule The Slaughterhouse Cases ?
As detailed in this effective SCOTUSblog post , the petitioners in the McDonald case concerning whether the Second Amendment applies to the states have filed " a wide - ranging survey of the meaning and origins of the privileges clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [ with ] only seven pages of the 73 - page brief are devoted to another provision of that Amendment : the Due Process Clause ....
In a bold thrust , the attorneys for the challengers to Chicago ’s strict handgun ban asked the Court to strike down ... the Slaughterhouse Cases in 1873 — the ruling that made the privileges clause a nullity . "
At yesterday 's OSU symposium , lots of the legal luminaries were buzzing about this brief and about whether the Supreme Court would really consider overuling The Slaughterhouse Cases .
Orin Kerr has now shared some of his thoughts on this topic in posts over at Volokh , and other Conspirators are also buzzing about the McDonald brief .
Here are links to some of these posts :
There is some much fodder for constitutional commentary in the McDonald brief , I am not sure where a con law guru would start to unpack all the great issues the brief raises .
But I am sure what at least one sentencing guru would like to discuss : whether persons or groups seriously interested in criminal justice reform ought to actively support the effort in McDonald to overrule The Slaughterhouse Cases .
I ask this question for two reasons : ( 1 ) I tend to view any constitutional development that stirs the pot as good for those interested in criminal justice reform , so my first instinct is that reform groups ought to actively support overruling The Slaughterhouse Cases , and ( 2 ) I think it is safe to assume that the dissenters in Heller ( aka the supposed liberals ) might well be drawn toward overruling The Slaughterhouse Cases if and only if some traditionally liberal advocacy groups seriously support the effort to do so .
Put another way , the McDonald brief urging the Supreme Court to overrule The Slaughterhouse Cases provides more evidence for my view that the awakening of the Second Amendment through the Heller ruling has started to take us through the modern constitutional looking glass .
I have generally been disappointed that many traditional criminal justice reform groups have failed to actively embrace the potential of Heller , and now I am wondering — really hoping — that the new McDonald brief will spotlight Heller 's profound potential .

Comments
I 'm not quite sure why anyone would argue against overturning those cases .
I thought the brief 's opening comment that there is near universal agreement that they are and always have been unconstitutional to be correct .
In fact , as far as I am aware most of the commentary against Slaughterhouse has been by " liberals " although Doug might more clearly explain what he means by that term .
I do n't really comprehend why this is considered to be a " revolution " either .
That revolution happened many years ago .

It is academically interesting whether most of the Bill of Rights is incorporated through the Privileges and Immunities Clause or the Due Process Clause , but I do n't see that it has much practical significance .
I do n't see the Supreme Court overruling any of the decisions incorporating various criminal law protections or the Hurtado decision declaring the Indictment Clause not incorporated .
What 's left ?
Excessive fines ?
They 'll get around to expressly declaring that incorporated sooner or later , whether it 's P&I or DP .
I also disagree that stirring the constitutional pot is good for reform , but then we probably have different ideas of what constitutes " reform . "

This case also has potential implications for the felon - in - possession law , given that the court held that all gun laws must be independently justified notwithstanding the Heller Court 's dicta .
I actually think the domestic violence misdemeanant ban , which is limited to persons with a proven record of violence , is considerably more defensible under intermediate scrutiny than a blanket ban on possession by felons .

" It is academically interesting whether most of the Bill of Rights is incorporated through the Privileges and Immunities Clause or the Due Process Clause , but I do n't see that it has much practical significance . "
It 's significant because there 's this urban legend that 's been floating around various factions of the Originalist crowd for years that incorporating the Bill of Rights through the Privileges or Immunities Clause instead of the Due Process Clause will provide a basis for overruling most of the substantive due process precedent ( abortion , etc ) .

If you read David Kopel 's blog post , I think you 'll see that his quote about " a superb brief ... worthy of study by law students and anyone else who wants a great example of legal writing that is passionate and forceful , yet also sober and serious " is in reference to Petitioner 's brief , not in reference to the NRA brief .

JC is partially correct : Adopting the bill of rights through the PI Clause rather than the DP Clause runs the risk of abrogating many of the right the Supreme Court has recognized under the DP Clause .
BUT this concern is not just " urban legend " ( on that point , JC is incorrect ) .
Justice THOMAS ( who is probably the biggest proponent of overturning The SlaughterHouse cases and breathing new life into the 14th Amend 's PI Clause ) has virtually admitted this to be true .
Thomas has intimated that the PI Clause should " displace , rather than augment " any rights that have been recognized under the DP Clause which are also not specifically listed in the first 8 Amendments :
" Because I believe that the demise of the Privileges or Immunities Clause has contributed in no small part to the current disarray of our Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence , I would be open to reevaluating its meaning in an appropriate case .
. .
[ Before doing so ] , [ w ] e should also consider whether the Clause should DISPLACE , rather than augment , portions of our equal protection and substantive due process jurisprudence . ”
Thomas then describes the DP Clause as a " convenient tool for inventing new rights , limited solely by the ' predilections of those who happen at the time to be Members of this Court . ' "
Saenz v. Roe , 526 U.S. 489 , 527 ( 1999 ) ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) .
In other words , Thomas wants to overturn The SlaughterHouse cases because , in doing so , it should overturn much of the Court 's 14th Amend .
procedural and substantive due process jurisprudence .
So , to answer the post 's question : Assuming : a ) Thomas has his way , and b ) it is not in the criminal justice reform groups ' interest to overturn / " displace " much of the 14th Amend . ’s DP Clause ; Then c )
No , such groups should not actively urge SCOTUS to overturn The SlaughterHouse cases .
All that being said , if the assumption in a ) is not met ( i.e . The Court overturns The SlaughterHouse cases , yet the PI Clause is interpreted to " augment " or be " in addition to " the rights previously recognized under the DP Clause ) , then it might be a good development for such groups .
Posted by : DEJ | Nov 19 , 2009 3:26:09 PM
Kent ,
I am confused by your post 's assertion that if the Court overturns The SlaughterHouse Cases , then the 5th Amend 's Grand Jury requirement would not be enforceable against the states .
Of course , overturning The SlaughterHouse Cases , would not require overruling Hurtado v. CA , 110 U.S. 516 ( 1884 ) .
That case only held that the DP Clause does not require Grand Jury proceedings in state court .
Yet , if the Court overrules The SlaughterHouse Cases , then ALL ( i.e. each and every one of ) the rights found in the first 8 Amendments would be enforceable against the states , including the Grand Jury requirement .
At least , that was my understanding of what the PI Clause would mean .
If that 's true , I 'm surprised the Petitioner 's brief did not address how such a change impacts the court 's stare decisis decision .
Then again , maybe it's more of an argument for the Respondents to make .
Posted by : DEJ | Nov 19 , 2009 3:43:36 PM
DEJ , so there would be a constitutional right to a jury trial in a state civil case for $ 21 ?
I do n't doubt that in theory the Court * could * reconsider the P&I clause and resurrect Justice Black 's total incorporation view .
I just do n't think there is a snowball 's chance in hell they will really do it .
Posted by : Kent Scheidegger | Nov 19 , 2009 7:16:37 PM
Kent ,
The impression I got , after reading the Petitioner 's brief , was that if the Court adopted the intent of the framers , as outlined in that brief , then total incorporation would be the implication .
The framers continually referenced the first 8 and said they would be applied against the states via the PI Clause .
Now , selective incorporation under the DP Clause was the route that eventually became historically necessary , given the holding of The SlaughterHouse Cases .
It 's not about " reconsider[ing ] "
Black 's view , because that debate was only necessary under a DP Clause analysis , as opposed to " intent of the framers " PI Clause analysis .
Put another way , if the PI Clause is resurrected , in favor of the framer 's intent , then total incorporation seems to be the logical result .
Posted by : DEJ | Nov 19 , 2009 8:39:39 PM
You can read it that way , and it may indeed be the " logical result . "
However , I think the Justices have enough wiggle room to avoid total incorporation if they want to , and I think they very much want to .
For example , at page 2765 col. 3 of the Congressional Globe , Sen .
Howard refers to the privileges and immunities as including the first eight amendments but then he proceeds to list them , and grand jury indictment and civil - case juries are not on his list .

Scala 's Stackable Trait Pattern
by Bill Venners
September 30 , 2009

Summary
This article describes a Scala design pattern in which traits provide stackable modifications to underlying core classes or traits .
This article describes a Scala design pattern in which traits provide stackable modifications to underlying core classes or traits .
One way to use Scala 's traits is as stackable modifications .
In this pattern , a trait ( or class ) can play one of three roles : the base , a core , or a stackable .
The base trait ( or abstract class ) defines an abstract interface that all the cores and stackables extend , as shown in Figure 1 .
The core traits ( or classes ) implement the abstract methods defined in the base trait , and provide basic , core functionality .
Each stackable overrides one or more of the abstract methods defined in the base trait , using Scala 's abstract override modifiers , and provides some behavior and at some point invokes the super implementation of the same method .
In this manner , the stackables modify the behavior of whatever core they are mixed into .
Figure 1 . Roles in the stackable trait pattern .
This pattern is similar in structure to the decorator pattern , except it involves decoration for the purpose of class composition instead of object composition .
Stackable traits decorate the core traits at compile time , similar to the way decorator objects modify core objects at run time in the decorator pattern .
As an example , consider stacking modifications to a queue of integers .
( This example is adapted from chapter 12 or Programming in Scala , by Martin Odersky , Lex Spoon , and Bill Venners . )
The queue will have two operations : put , which places integers in the queue , and get , which takes them back out .
Queues are first - in , first - out , so get should return the integers in the same order they were put in the queue .
Given a class that implements such a queue , you could define traits to perform modifications such as these :
Doubling : double all integers that are put in the queue
: double all integers that are put in the queue Incrementing : increment all integers that are put in the queue
: increment all integers that are put in the queue Filtering : filter out negative integers from a queue
These three traits represent modifications , because they modify the behavior of an underlying " core " queue class rather than defining a full queue class themselves .
The three are also stackable .
You can select any of the three you like , mix them into a class , and obtain a new class that has all of the modifications you chose .
An abstract IntQueue class ( the " base " ) is shown in Listing 1 .
IntQueue has a put method that adds new integers to the queue and a get method that removes and returns them .
A basic implementation of IntQueue ( a " core " class ) , which uses an ArrayBuffer , is shown in Listing 2 .
abstract class IntQueue { def get ( ) : Int def put( x : Int ) }
IntQueue
import scala.collection.mutable .ArrayBuffer class BasicIntQueue extends IntQueue { private val buf = new ArrayBuffer [ Int ] def get ( ) = buf.remove (0 ) def put( x : Int ) { buf += x } }
BasicIntQueue
ArrayBuffer
Class BasicIntQueue has a private field holding an array buffer .
The get method removes an entry from one end of the buffer , while the put method adds elements to the other end .
Here 's how this implementation looks when you use it :
scala > val queue = new BasicIntQueue queue : BasicIntQueue = BasicIntQueue@24655f scala > queue.put ( 10 ) scala > queue.put ( 20 ) scala > queue.get ( ) res9 : Int = 10 scala > queue.get ( ) res10 : Int = 20
So far so good .
Now take a look at using traits to modify this behavior .
Listing 3 shows a trait that doubles integers as they are put in the queue .
The Doubling trait has two funny things going on .
The first is that it declares a superclass , IntQueue .
This declaration means that the trait can only be mixed into a class that also extends IntQueue .
trait Doubling extends IntQueue { abstract override def put(x : Int ) { super.
put ( 2 * x ) } }
Doubling
The second funny thing is that the trait has a super call on a method declared abstract .
Such calls are illegal for normal classes , because they will certainly fail at run time .
For a trait , however , such a call can actually succeed .
Since super calls in a trait are dynamically bound , the super call in trait Doubling will work so long as the trait is mixed in after another trait or class that gives a concrete definition to the method .
This arrangement is frequently needed with traits that implement stackable modifications .
To tell the compiler you are doing this on purpose , you must mark such methods as abstract override .
This combination of modifiers is only allowed for members of traits , not classes , and it means that the trait must be mixed into some class that has a concrete definition of the method in question .
Here 's how it looks to use the trait :
scala > class MyQueue extends BasicIntQueue with Doubling defined class MyQueue scala > val queue = new MyQueue queue : MyQueue = MyQueue@91f017 scala > queue.put ( 10 ) scala > queue.get ( ) res12 : Int = 20
In the first line in this interpreter session , we define class MyQueue , which extends BasicIntQueue and mixes in Doubling .
We then put a 10 in the queue , but because Doubling has been mixed in , the 10 is doubled .
When we get an integer from the queue , it is a 20 .
Note that MyQueue defines no new code .
It simply identifies a class and mixes in a trait .
In this situation , you could supply " BasicIntQueue with Doubling " directly to new instead of defining a named class .
It would look as shown in Listing 4 :
scala > val queue = new BasicIntQueue with Doubling queue : BasicIntQueue with Doubling = \$anon \$ 1@5fa12d scala > queue.put ( 10 ) scala > queue.get ( ) res14 : Int = 20
new
To see how to stack modifications , we need to define the other two modification traits , Incrementing and Filtering .
Implementations of these traits are shown in Listing 5 :
trait Incrementing extends IntQueue { abstract override def put(x : Int ) { super.
put(x + 1 ) } } trait Filtering extends IntQueue { abstract override def put( x : Int ) { if ( x >= 0 ) super. put(x ) } }
Incrementing
Filtering
Given these modifications , you can now pick and choose which ones you want for a particular queue .
For example , here is a queue that both filters negative numbers and adds one to all numbers that it keeps :
scala > val queue = ( new BasicIntQueue | with Incrementing with Filtering ) queue : BasicIntQueue with Incrementing with Filtering ... scala > queue.put( - 1 ) ; queue.put(0 ) ; queue.put ( 1 ) scala > queue.get ( ) res15 : Int = 1 scala > queue.get ( ) res16 : Int = 2
The order of mixins is significant .
( Once a trait is mixed into a class , you can alternatively call it a mixin . )
Roughly speaking , traits further to the right take effect first .
When you call a method on a class with mixins , the method in the trait furthest to the right is called first .
If that method calls super , it invokes the method in the next trait to its left , and so on .
In the previous example , Filtering 's put is invoked first , so it removes integers that were negative to begin with .
Incrementing 's put is invoked second , so it adds one to those integers that remain .
If you reverse the order , first integers will be incremented , and then the integers that are still negative will be discarded :
scala > val queue = ( new BasicIntQueue | with Filtering with Incrementing ) queue : BasicIntQueue with Filtering with Incrementing ... scala > queue.put( - 1 ) ; queue.put(0 ) ; queue.put ( 1 ) scala > queue.get ( ) res17 : Int = 0 scala > queue.get ( ) res18 : Int = 1 scala > queue.get ( ) res19 : Int = 2
Overall , code written in this style gives you a great deal of flexibility .
You can define sixteen different classes by mixing in these three traits in different combinations and orders .
That 's a lot of flexibility for a small amount of code , so you should keep your eyes open for opportunities to arrange code as stackable modifications .

Piercings run the risk of infection Deadly brain abscesses should be added to the list of risks of having a tongue piercing , say doctors .
Archives of Neurology reports how a 22 - year - old man who died in hospital following multiple brain abscesses weeks after getting his tongue pierced .
The man 's Israeli doctors warn infection can spread in the bloodstream from the piercing up to the brain .
Piercing can more commonly lead to chipped teeth and oral infections , and sometimes heart problems , say experts .
Despite the risks , tongue piercings remain popular .
The clear message is that oral piercing is ill advised and should be avoided
Professor Damien Walmsley
Scientific adviser to the British Dental Association Celebrities like Spice Girl Mel B and Princess Anne 's daughter Zara Phillips have had their tongues pierced .
But experts say people should think twice and put their health before fashion .
Professor Damien Walmsley , scientific adviser to the British Dental Association , said : " Dentists are all too aware of the health problems that can be caused by oral piercings .
" There are many potential complications , ranging from pain and swelling to chipped or cracked teeth .
Patients who have oral piercings can also suffer with recession of the gums and prolonged bleeding .
" Piercing of oral sites also carries with it a risk of infection .
The clear message is that oral piercing is ill advised and should be avoided . "
Problems associated with body piercing can be down to poor hygiene during the procedure or people failing to heed advice about follow - up care at home .
Professional piercers maintain that hygienic , precision piercing rarely causes complications .

PORTLAND , Maine ( Reuters ) - Voters in Maine on Tuesday overturned a law allowing same - sex couples to wed , dealing a fresh setback to the U.S. gay marriage movement in a race that attracted national attention .
The law was approved by Maine ’s Legislature in May but was not implemented after opponents gathered enough signatures to put the issue to a “ people ’s veto . ”
With 87 percent of precincts reporting , votes to reject the law were running at 52.75 percent to 47.25 percent , according to unofficial tallies from the Bangor Daily News .
Frank Schubert , chief organizer of the “ Yes on 1 ” campaign to reject same - sex marriage in the state , claimed victory early on Wednesday , although his opponents refused to concede .
Connecticut , Iowa , Massachusetts , New Hampshire and Vermont are the only U.S. states where a same - sex marriage law is on the books .
In each instance , the laws were approved by legislatures and judges , not by popular vote .
Citizens in some 30 states before Maine voted against same - sex marriages .
The referendum in sparsely populated Maine was thrust onto the national stage , attracting large levels of funding and battle - hardened strategists .
The outcome is “ further evidence that although voters have shown tolerance toward same sex couples , they draw the line at marriage , ” said Jeff Flint , a partner with Schubert Flint Public Affairs in Sacramento , who worked on California ’s “ Yes on 8 ” campaign in 2008 .
“ They feel marriage is different . ”
Groups in favor of traditional marriage prevailed in Maine even though they were outspent two - to - one by the “ No on 1 ” groups , Flint said .

The push to repeal got powerful help from Portland ’s Catholic Bishop Richard Malone , who spoke out repeatedly against the legalization of same - sex marriage .
About 37 percent of Maine ’s population is Roman Catholic .

STATE OF THE UNIONS
Several U.S. states have statutes sanctioning various kinds of civil unions for same - sex couples .
But those do not carry many of the same legal protections as actual marriages , such as the ability to share healthcare benefits with a partner , or inheritance rights .
“ There were real inequalities in terms of Maine ’s statutes .
Civil unions did not equal civil marriages , ” Maine Governor John Baldacci , a Democrat , said on local television of his decision to support the gay marriage law .
Maine ’s initiative was closely followed after California ’s bitter same - sex marriage fight in 2008 .
Proposition 8 upended a state Supreme Court ruling that same - sex couples have a constitutional right to marry .
Some of the best known national gay and lesbian rights groups would like to wait and watch before attempting to turn back Proposition 8 .
But John Henning , executive director of the group Love Honor Cherish in Los Angeles said Maine ’s vote was likely to catalyze grass - roots action in several states .
“ It will light a fire under activists and be a reminder that we all had our right to marry taken away in California , ” he said .
Tens of thousands of disaffected Anglicans could become Roman Catholics following a decree made today by Pope Benedict to poach whole Protestant communities for the church for the first time since the Reformation .
The move surprised many as it was unveiled simultaneously in the Vatican and in London , where the Archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , was forced to admit that he had not known about it until a fortnight ago .
Pope Benedict 's initiative – set out in an apostolic constitution , the highest form of pontifical decree , and unveiled by a senior Catholic cardinal – allows Anglicans worldwide , both clergy and worshippers , to convert en masse while still maintaining part of their spiritual heritage .
Both Williams and the Catholic archbishop of Westminster , Vincent Nichols , who was sitting next to him in a show of unity , refused to concede that the Vatican was passing judgment on the troubles within the Anglican communion .
" It is not an act of aggression , it is not a statement of no confidence .
It is business as usual , " said Williams , who nevertheless apologised to Anglicans that there had not been a chance for prior debate .
The Vatican sought no input from Lambeth Palace .
The papal decree comes after many years of approaches to the Vatican from Anglicans unhappy with the ordination of women and gay people .
There was scarce detail about how the new structure would work – there could be separate services in Roman Catholic churches for breakaway Anglicans who could organise their own bishops and create their own prayer books , though ultimate control would lead back to Rome .
It creates not so much a church within a church as an enclave operating under the auspices of the Vatican or a safe haven for endangered Anglicans .
The most significant part of the decree is that it will allow married Anglican clergy to be ordained as Roman Catholic priests , waiving the requirement of celibacy .
The pope 's chief theological adviser , the US cardinal William Levada , said that he would put the number of Anglican bishops in the world who were poised to become Catholics " in the 20s or 30s " .
Later , Joseph Di Noia , the deputy head of the Vatican 's liturgical department , said he believed the figure was closer to 50 .
Williams today appeared alongside Archbishop Nichols in Eccleston Square , the administrative headquarters of the Catholic church in England and Wales , and there were awkward moments .
When Williams was asked if the Vatican move was a " massive vote of no confidence " in his leadership , it was Nichols who jumped in with an answer .
Several times they both said the apostolic constitution was not a commentary on the internal disputes ravaging the world 's third biggest Christian denomination – despite years of Roman consternation over the ordination of women and gay people .
At an Anglican conference last year several cardinals swooped into Canterbury to air their concerns about the impact such innovations would have on relations between the two churches and how undesirable an Anglican schism would be .
But today in a basement room , faced with the press , Williams was optimistic and resolute , though his complexion reddened .
" I do not think this constitution will be seen as in any sense a commentary on Anglican problems offered by the Vatican .
It is a response to this range of requests and inquiries from a very broad variety of people .
In that sense it has no negative impact on the relations of the communion as a whole to the Roman Catholic church as a whole . "
There were no " regular or routine channels of communication " with the Vatican department that made the decision – the congregation for the doctrine of the faith - Williams explained , because his relationship was with the Pontifical Council Promoting of Christian Unity .
It is unknown whether this body was aware of the constitution prior to its unveiling but chose not to tell him .
Williams was also forced to reveal his ignorance about the move to Anglican bishops and archbishops , a number of whom are dissatisfied with his leadership .
News that he was kept in the dark will only reinforce their antipathy towards him .
In a letter he wrote : " I am sorry that there has been no opportunity to alert you earlier to this ; I was informed of the planned announcement at a very late stage , and we await the text of the apostolic constitution itself and its code of practice in the coming weeks . "
Two bishops from a prominent Anglo - Catholic movement in the UK , Forward in Faith , welcomed the apostolic constitution , but said it was not a time for " sudden decisions or general public discussion " .
The bishops of Ebbsfleet and Richborough , who provide pastoral and spiritual care for people opposed to women bishops , also confirmed their 2008 meeting with Vatican officials , an event previously denied by Lambeth Palace .
They said some would want to stay in the Anglican communion , while others would make arrangements according to their conscience .
They said they had chosen 22 February " to be an appropriate day for priests and people to make an initial decision as to whether they wish to respond positively " to the apostolic constitution .
" We were becoming increasingly concerned that the various agendas of the Anglican communion were driving Anglicans and Roman Catholics further apart .
It was our task , we thought , to take the opportunity of quietly discussing these matters in Rome .
We were neither the first nor the last Anglicans to do this in recent years .
Following the decision of the General Synod of the Church of England in July 2008 to proceed with the ordination of women … we appealed to the Holy Father and have patiently awaited a reply . "
The initiative is not without problems for the Vatican .
The Catholic church will accept married Anglican vicars who agree to be reordained , just as it includes married priests of the so - called Uniate churches that belong to the Orthodox rite .
But , like the Orthodox , it draws the line at married bishops .
However , under the arrangements Anglicans can be taken into so - called " personal ordinariates " in each country , similar to military chaplaincies .
Each would be headed by a former Anglican prelate , who does not have to become a bishop in the Catholic church , and so could be married .
By accepting numbers of married clergy , some with the responsibilities and status of bishops , the Vatican risks reigniting the debate among Catholics over its insistence on celibacy for the vast majority of its priests who belong to the western , or Latin , rite .
The latest move will also revive unease in the Orthodox world where the Vatican is under constant attack for allegedly trying to poach adherents .
The reverberations of the yesterday 's announcement will be felt for some time to come .
It will seriously test the diplomacy skills of the Queen , the supreme governor of the church of England , and Williams , when they receive the pope in 2010 for his first official visit to the UK .
It will also affect general synod as it grapples with legislation on women bishops and the election of a new membership .
Rewriting the rule book
Will breakaway Anglicans get their own churches ?
The details are still to be decided , but there may be separate services held in Roman Catholic churches .
There may also be special prayer books and training centres for them .
The chain of command will still lead to the pope ( pictured right ) .
Will these Anglicans be 100 % Roman Catholic ?
They have to accept all Roman Catholic doctrine and teaching .
But they could use elements of Anglican tradition .
The big news is that married clergy can be ordained as Roman Catholic priests , with a view to eventually providing pastoral care for other former Anglicans .
Celibacy is normally a requirement to join the Catholic priesthood , but this new global structure has torn up the rule book .
Why do people want to leave the Anglican Communion ?
Two reasons : women and gay people .
For the last few decades traditionalists have been unhappy with the liberal progression of the church .

Finance ministers from developing and rich countries meeting in Scotland have pledged to keep stimulus measures in place until global recovery is assured .
A statement issued after the G20 meeting says the recovery is " uneven " and remains dependent on support , while unemployment is a " major " concern .
Earlier , British PM Gordon Brown called for a fund for bank bailouts , possibly paid for by a tax on transactions .
But the proposal received a lukewarm response from other G20 countries .
After the meeting in St Andrews , US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said there was a " very broad consensus that growth remains the dominant policy imperative across our economies " .
We agreed to maintain support for the recovery until it is assured
Alistair Darling British Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling said that although the threat of a downturn had receded , it was too early to withdraw emergency support .
" There is no one who believes the job is yet done , " he said .
The G20 statement said : " The recovery is uneven and remains dependent on policy support , and high unemployment is a major concern .
" To restore the global economy and financial system to health , we agreed to maintain support for the recovery until it is assured . "
' Impeding markets '
The BBC's Andrew Walker at the meeting says it was overshadowed by a call by the British prime minister for a new " social contract " with banks to make them more responsible to society .
[ A transaction tax ] is not particularly attractive to me as finance minister in Canada , because we 're not a government that has raised taxes
Jim Flaherty
Mixed response to transaction tax Mr Brown said the financial sector was so key that governments had no choice but to step in when it failed .
He added : " And it can not be acceptable that the benefits of success in this sector are reaped by the few but the costs of its failure are borne by all of us . "
Mr Brown said a global levy on financial transactions was one of the ways to make banks pay .
But he added that Britain would not act alone , and any new tax on banking would have to be a global agreement .
The idea is popular with campaigners who see it as a way of raising funds for developing countries .
HAVE YOUR SAY Brown wants us to pay for bank failures in advance by taxing transactions
John Clifford
But critics argue the proposed tax would impede the global financial markets that help lubricate an increasingly interdependent world economy .
Our correspondent says the idea has been received politely by the finance ministers - but several made remarks which suggest that other ways of tacking the problem are rather more likely to be adopted .
Canadian Finance Minster Jim Flaherty said the UK plan was " not particularly attractive to me as finance minister in Canada , because we 're not a government that has raised taxes " .
The British Bankers ' Association has also cast doubt on the effectiveness of such levies , which Chief executive Angela Knight " do n't work as they require perfect or near - perfect global implementation " .
The G20 countries also promised to step up efforts to tackle climate change and " work towards an ambitious outcome " at next month 's climate conference in Copenhagen .

Henry Blodget passes along this startling statistic :
The average federal worker makes $ 75,419 a year , while the average in the private sector is $ 39,751 .
Why is that , exactly ?
Is it because Federal workers are 80 % better than private - sector workers ?
And remind us again why , in the interest of cutting the deficit , the government should n't just slash 20 % of its budget across the board ?
Why indeed .
Option ARMs are the gift that keeps on giving this holiday season .
As it turns out , these pesky toxic mortgages are still sitting waiting to hit recast periods .
Like a street vendor taco these things went down nicely and appeared cheap but came with a hefty aftermath .
The last option ARMs were made in 2007 yet they are still causing much pain in the housing market .
Attorney General Jerry Brown has requested data from the top 10 issuers of option ARMs with a deadline date of November 23 .
It ’ll be interesting to see what is released from the AG ’s office .
However , Standard & Poors issued a report on option ARMs last week and found that much of the problems with these loans are still to come .
One of the stunning points found was that 93 percent of option ARM borrowers decided to go with the negative amortization option otherwise known as the “ minimum payment ” option .
This is something we have established from many fronts and data sets .
The bottom line is the vast majority went with negative amortization and this grew the actual balance owed .
Yet one of the new findings in the report was that 78 percent of all outstanding option ARMs have yet to hit major recast points .
Given that 58 percent of option ARMs are here in California , this is a one state wrecking ball :
In total , some 350,000 option ARMs are still active nationwide .
Over 200,000 of these loans are here in California .
The most risky option as we have established with option ARMs is the negative amortization payment :
Now why was this payment such a poor choice ?
Well as the California housing market fell by 50 percent from its peak , the actual balance on many option ARMs was going up .
So not only is the home underwater from the initial starting point , the loan taken out on the home has increased on 90 + percent of these borrowers .
This is like negative equity squared .
So deep are these loans in negative equity territory that not even HAMP can save them .
Oh , and speaking of HAMP , it is turning out to be a colossal failure as expected :
“ ( NY Times ) Capitol Hill aides in regular contact with senior Treasury officials say a consensus has emerged inside the department that the program has proved inadequate , necessitating a new approach .
But discussions have yet to reach the point of mapping out new options , the aides say .
“ People who work on this on a day - to - day basis are vested enough in it that they think there ’s a need to do a course correction rather than a wholesale rethink , ” said a Senate Democratic aide , who spoke on the condition he not be named for fear of angering the administration .
“ But at senior levels , where people are looking at this and thinking ‘ Good God , ’ there ’s a sense that we need to think about doing something more . ”
I know many delusional folks in California were thinking that somehow the quiet on the option ARM front had to do with the masterful success of HAMP .
Of course , these loans never qualified for HAMP but that is beside the point .
HAMP is failing because of a simple reason .
Negative equity .
Here in California , we have millions underwater .
Those with option ARMs are not only underwater , they are going to have massive spikes in their monthly payments at a time when the California unemployment rate is the highest in record keeping history .
The problem is Wall Street has sucked up all the taxpayer bailouts and for what ?
To keep the crony welfare investment banks ticking ?
Trillions of dollars out the door and the real economy is still troubled .
HAMP had the naïve premise that the only problem was high interest rates and the problem with the housing market was toxic mortgages .
Well , the actual problem is thousands of homes are still valued at bubble prices and with stagnant wages for a decade , people ca n’t afford homes without going massively into debt .
Prime , near prime , and subprime means little when you have no income and that is why even prime defaults are spiking .
The option ARM had such an allure for the gold rush California home speculator because it sidestepped that tiny little caveat of income .
It allowed maximum leverage without the valid income support .
80 percent of option ARMs went stated income .
In other words , people made crap up like saying they made $ 200,000 when they were pulling $ 75,000 to qualify for that $ 600,000 home :
“ ( CNN )
There is another little problem that many option - ARM borrowers seeking refinancing would face : “ Upwards of 80 % of were stated - income loans , ” said Westerback .
These are the so - called “ liar loans ” in which lenders did not verify that borrowers earned as much money as they said they did .
Lenders may not be able to modify mortgages because many of the borrowers ’ income could not stand up to the scrutiny .
Borrowers may also not want to go through underwriting again because they could be held legally liable for deliberate inaccuracies on their original applications .
Add to those conditions the still fragile economy and high unemployment rates , and you have a recipe for disaster . ”
As people chime in about stabilization , California is still hovering near the bottom in terms of prices .
The only reason we have seen prices move slightly up is because the massive jump into foreclosed homes , the home buyer tax credit , Fed buying securities to lower mortgage rates , and all these phony moratoriums that we are now seeing are basically delaying reality for many .
Inventory is artificially low because of the shadow inventory .
People ask for a solution .
Here it is :
We should have ( and still should ) break up the banks into pieces that are small enough to fail .
Bring back Glass - Steagall with some teeth .
Commercial and investment banking should be put into silos that do n’t even come close to one another .
Banks that need to fail should .
After all , the government now backs 90 + percent of all mortgages so why do we even need them ?
A quick assessment should have been made from day one on housing .
Those that could n’t afford their homes should have gotten assistance into rentals .
Here ’s a thought .
Why did n’t we create a program where those who had no way of paying on an overpriced home were given a tax break to rent a place in an empty commercial real estate development ?
Right there you kill two birds with one stone .
Of course , those on Wall Street and those in our government are two sides of the same coin .
For the past three decades they have systematically neutered our government to the point of it being a bread and circus spectacle .
You think the 200,000 option ARM borrowers in California are sitting in a good spot ?
Let us look at negative equity rates for a few metro areas since this is the largest predictor of future foreclosures :
If you look at the Inland Empire and the Phoenix metro area , they virtually reflect one another .
In fact , both areas have negative equity rates of 54 % of all mortgage holders .
This is incredible .
Half of all borrowers are underwater in these big regions .
But look at the largest block of mortgages in California clustered in the Los Angeles - Long Beach area .
1.5 million mortgages and 400,000 + are underwater .
You think this is going to bode well for home prices as option ARMs hit their recast dates in stride from 2010 to 2012 ?
I put in a more normal area of Dallas above and you can see what a normal market looks like .
Even there , you can see that negative equity is still an issue .
But compare that to California and it is another story completely .
What does this mean ?
The middle market is certainly going to take major hits once these loans hit their recast dates .
If they do n’t qualify for HAMP , then what ?
S&P in their report gives an example of a hypothetical $ 400,000 mortgage :
The payment flat out doubles at the recast date .
Do you think people are going to be able to come up with an extra $ 1,200 per month with no problems ?
You know what the typical mortgage payment for a home bought last month in California totaled ?
$ 1,097 .
That is the price of the hypothetical increase in the priciest state in the U.S.
So yes sales are happening but at a much lower end .
How is this going to help those in negative equity on more expensive homes ?
Take a look at the raw numbers for the state :
34 percent of all California mortgages are underwater .
You can rest assured that 80 + percent of those option ARMs are underwater .
As the above highlights , those mortgages are still here and they are still toxic .
Option ARMs fall under a bigger umbrella of Alt - A loans .
California has over 700,000 active Alt - A loans .
The bulk of the 200,000 + California option ARMs fall under this category .
But the bulk of these loans are also toxic mortgage waste .
These will go off as well .
These are actually part of the shadow inventory including those who simply stop paying but banks sit back and do absolutely nothing .
Is that really a solution ?
Take a look at where the Alt - A loans are in California :
Los Angeles and Orange counties hold the biggest number of Alt - A and option ARM loans .
Do you really think this is a bottom ?
It might be for a home in the Inland Empire selling for $ 100,000 or $ 150,000 depending on local area dynamics .
But many cities in Los Angeles and Orange County are vastly overpriced .
The above dynamics look similar to how subprime was building up in 2006 and 2007 before the market imploded .
Yet somehow things are now different .

( CNN ) --
Investigators will continue their grisly dig Wednesday after finding that the Cleveland , Ohio home of a convicted sex offender had been turned into a tomb holding at least 10 bodies .
Fire officials were scheduled to help in the search inside the house of Anthony Sowell , with plans to tear into walls and floors of the three - story home for more remains .
" I like to believe there is nothing else more there , but we will not know until we finish the search , " said Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath .
" It appears that this man had an insatiable appetite that he had to fill . "
Authorities charged Sowell , 50 , with five counts of aggravated murder Tuesday afternoon , police said .
He was also charged with rape , felonious assault and kidnapping , police said .
His arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday morning .
He had been arrested Saturday , two days after police discovered the decomposing bodies of five females inside his home and another woman 's body outside the house .
Four more bodies were discovered Tuesday buried in the yard behind the home , police said .
A skull wrapped in a bag was also found in a bucket in the basement .
Authorities had not yet identified any of the victims .
Because of the conditions of the bodies , authorities would have to conduct the lengthy process of DNA tests , McGrath said .
The first six bodies found last week were all African - American women and five of them had been strangled , McGrath said .
" I can imagine how families feel who have reported a missing person , and the anxiety that they are going through , " Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said .
" And we want to assure them as soon as we know something they will be the first to know . "
And as investigators poured through missing person 's reports , some in the area wondered how long the home in their neighborhood had been turned into a graveyard .
" We never known about him , " neighbor Mike Edwards , told CNN - affiliate WKYC .
" Right there in the house .
Right there and I lived here all of my life . "
Sowell pleaded guilty to attempted rape in a 1989 case and was imprisoned from 1990 to 2005 , police said .
Since his release from prison he was listed as living at the Cleveland home where the bodies were found , McGrath said .
Authorities from the Cuyahoga County Sheriff 's Office checked on Sowell regularly and last checked on him September 22 to confirm his address and found no problems , McGrath said .
Police began to get suspicious of Sowell about a month ago , after a woman accused him of rape and assault , said Cleveland Lt. Thomas Stacho .
Investigators obtained the warrants that set off the search after getting the " cooperation of the victim , " he said .
Stacho said Sowell makes his living as a " scrapper . "
" He walks around and picks up scrap metal and takes it to junk yards to make a few pennies , " he said .
CRP says California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa is the richest lawmaker on Capitol Hill , with a net worth estimated at about $ 251 million .
Report : 237 millionaires in Congress
Talk about bad timing .
As Washington reels from the news of 10.2 percent unemployment , the Center for Responsive Politics is out with a new report describing the wealth of members of Congress .
Advertisement
Among the highlights : Two - hundred - and - thirty - seven members of Congress are millionaires .
That ’s 44 percent of the body – compared to about 1 percent of Americans overall .
CRP says California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa is the richest lawmaker on Capitol Hill , with a net worth estimated at about $ 251 million .
Next in line : Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Calif. ) , worth about $ 244.7 million ; Sen. Herb Kohl ( D - Wis. ) , worth about $ 214.5 million ; Sen. Mark Warner ( D - Va. ) , worth about $ 209.7 million ; and Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , worth about $ 208.8 million .
All told , at least seven lawmakers have net worths greater than $ 100 million , according to the Center ’s 2008 figures .
“ Many Americans probably have a sense that members of Congress are n’t hurting , even if their government salary alone is in the six figures , much more than most Americans make , ” said CRP spokesman Dave Levinthal .
“ What we see through these figures is that many of them have riches well beyond that salary , supplemented with securities , stock holdings , property and other investments . ”
The CRP numbers are somewhat rough estimates – lawmakers are required to report their financial information in broad ranges of figures , so it ’s impossible to pin down their dollars with precision .
The CRP uses the mid-point in the ranges to build its estimates .
Senators ’ estimated median reportable worth sunk to about $ 1.79 million from $ 2.27 million in 2007 .
The House ’s median income was significantly lower and also sank , bottoming out at $ 622,254 from $ 724,258 in 2007 .
But CRP ’s analysis suggests that some lawmakers did well for themselves between 2007 and 2008 , even as many Americans lost jobs and saw their savings and their home values plummet .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) gained about $ 9.2 million .
Sen. James Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) gained about $ 3 million , Sen. Daniel Inouye ( D - Hawaii ) had an estimated $ 2.6 million gain , and Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) gained about $ 2.8 million .
Some lawmakers have profited from investments in companies that have received federal bailouts ; dozens of lawmakers are invested in Wells Fargo , Citigroup , Goldman Sachs and Bank of America .
Among executive branch officials , CRP says the richest is Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary L. Schapiro , with a net worth estimated at $ 26 million .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is next , worth an estimated $ 21 million .
President Barack Obama is the sixth - wealthiest , worth about an estimated $ 4 million .
Vice President Joe Biden has often tagged himself as an original blue collar man .
The CRP backs him up , putting his net worth at just $ 27,000 .
He ’s hardly the worst off .
Rep. Alcee Hastings ( D - Fla. ) , freshman Rep. Harry Teague ( D - N.M. ) , Rep. Jeff Fortenberry ( R - Neb . ) , Rep. John Salazar ( D - Colo . ) and Rep. Sander Levin ( D - Mich . ) each a net worth of less than zero , CRP says .
One caveat on those numbers : Federal financial disclosure laws do n’t require members to list the value of their personal residences .
That information could alter the net worth picture for many lawmakers .
Even so , Levinthal said , “ It is clear that some members are struggling financially .
“ Over a calendar year , one ’s wealth can change drastically .
Many peoples ’ investments took a nose dive over night in the last year , ” he said .
A number of lawmakers are estimated to have suffered double - digit percentage lossed in their net worth from 2007 to 2008 .
The biggest losers include Kerry , who lost a whopping $ 127.4 million ; Warner lost about $ 28.1 million ; Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) lost about $ 11.8 million ; and Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) lost about $ 10.1 million .
Graciela Rocha with one of her Brazilian mint plants A cup of Brazilian mint tea has pain relieving qualities to match those of commercially available analgesics , a study suggests .
Hyptis crenata has been prescribed by Brazilian healers for millennia to treat ailments from headaches and stomach pain to fever and flu .
Working on mice , a Newcastle University team has proved scientifically that the ancient medicine men were right .
The study is published in the journal Acta Horticulturae .
In order to mimic the traditional treatment as closely as possible , the Newcastle team carried out a survey in Brazil to find out how the medicine is typically prepared and how much should be consumed .
The most common method was to produce a decoction .
This involves boiling the dried leaves in water for 30 minutes and allowing the liquid to cool before drinking it as a tea .
The taste is n't what most people here in the UK would recognize as a mint
Graciela Rocha
Newcastle University
The team found that when the mint was given at a dose similar to that prescribed by traditional healers , the medicine was as effective at relieving pain as a synthetic aspirin - style drug called Indometacin .
They plan to launch clinical trials to find out how effective the mint is as a pain relief for people .
Lead researcher Graciela Rocha said : " Since humans first walked the Earth we have looked to plants to provide a cure for our ailments - in fact it is estimated more than 50,000 plants are used worldwide for medicinal purposes .
" Besides traditional use , more than half of all prescription drugs are based on a molecule that occurs naturally in a plant .
" What we have done is to take a plant that is widely used to safely treat pain and scientifically proven that it works as well as some synthetic drugs .
" Now the next step is to find out how and why the plant works . "
Graciela is Brazilian and remembers being given the tea as a cure for every childhood illness .
' Interesting research '
She said : " The taste is n't what most people here in the UK would recognize as a mint .
" In fact it tastes more like sage which is another member of the mint family .
" Not that nice , really , but then medicine is n't supposed to be nice , is it ? "
Dr Beverly Collett , chair of the Chronic Pain Policy Coalition , said : " Obviously further work needs to be done to identify the molecule involved , but this is interesting research into what may be a new analgesic for the future .
" The effects of aspirin - like substances have been known since the ancient Greeks recorded the use of the willow bark as a fever fighter .
" The leaves and bark of the willow tree contain a substance called salicin , a naturally occurring compound similar to acetylsalicylic acid , the chemical name for aspirin . "
The research is being presented at the International Symposium on Medicinal and Nutraceutical Plants in New Delhi , India .

What other position can someone hit 39 HR in just 471 AB ( Carlos Pena ) and not be ranked in the Top 15 ?
If he ’s not in , let ’s take a look at who made the cut ( again , ( keep in mind that these are going to be fluid throughout the offseason based on news , transactions and further research ) :

When Adam Dunn is not good enough to be a starter in a shallow , 12 - team league , you know you are dealing with one of the deepest positions in baseball .
Since when is a nearly given 40 HR , 100 RBI season something to sneeze at ?
We all know that it ’s his average that hurts him , since his .267 could easily fall to .220 in 2010 .
That sounds very similar to the concern for Carlos Pena , though he actually did hit .227 before getting injured .
The # 2 spot is an interesting debate , between Teixeira and Cabrera .
In the end , Teixeira is surrounded by a better line - up and calls a hitter friendly park home .
Could you imagine the type of numbers he could post if he were to get off to a great start instead of hitting .200 with 3 HR in April ?
Mark Reynolds played 24 games at 1B in 2009 , meaning he should be eligible there in the majority of formats in 2010 .
We ’ll be talking about him in detail during the offseason , but it is hard to imagine him putting up another 40 / 20 campaign .
His previous career high in stolen bases , including the minor leagues , was the 11 he stole in ’08 .
Keep that in mind .
Ryan Howard vs. Prince Fielder ?
That ’s a match - up that could bounce back and forth all winter long .
They tied for the league lead in RBI , showing you how close they are .
Derrek Lee ’s resurgence really came as a surprise .
It had been three years since he had more than 22 HR ( he hit 35 in ’09 ) and he set his career high in RBI with 111 .
The truth is , it is hard to imagine him being able to repeat this amazing success .
Joey Votto had an amazing season , but what would have happened if he had stayed healthy all year long ?
The power may not be the same as some of the other top first base options , but he could conceivably hit 30 HR with a .300 + average .
How can you go wrong ?
The interesting comparison is between Votto and Kendry Morales , one of the breakout players in the league in 2009 .
Which of the two would you rather have ?
While Victor Martinez is among the best catchers in the game , his bat just does n’t portray as well as a first baseman .
The flexibility is nice and something that pushes him a few other deeper options , but I would be disappointed if I was saddled with him as my starting first baseman .
What are your thoughts on the early rankings ?
Who is too high ?
Who is too low ?
Who was omitted that should n’t have been ?

Joining me now here is the former British prime minister , Tony Blair .
He is also the Middle East peace envoy for the quartet , the U.S. , Russia , the U.N. , and the European Union .
Welcome .
Welcome , indeed , Mr. Blair .
TONY BLAIR , FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN : Thank you .
AMANPOUR : Did you hear any of the discussion between Saeb Erakat and Dan Meridor ?
BLAIR : I heard just the bit at the end there .
AMANPOUR : It 's a bit of a he said / she said .
And the issue is to start negotiations .
We just saw that nine years ago this whole issue ended in stalemate , and now President Obama at the U.N. today is calling for a resumption , but they 've dropped their demand or their preference that a full Israeli settlement freeze should be the best condition to do that .
Do you think there 's any chance of getting these two sides together now ?
BLAIR : Yes , I think there is , and I think that 's what will happen , actually , over the next few weeks .
AMANPOUR : What leads you to believe that ?
BLAIR : Because I think that -- that , in the end , the issue really is this :
What is the context within which this negotiation is being launched ?
The worry for the Palestinians is that , if you do n't lay down some -- some conditions , right , let 's have a settlement freeze or this or that ...
AMANPOUR : Which has been an international condition since time immemorial .
BLAIR : Absolutely .
That 's -- that 's absolutely correct .
So what they say is , if you do n't lay down these conditions , the negotiation wo n't be credible .
What the Israelis say is , look , we 'll negotiate without precondition .
We 're not prepared until we start negotiating to yield this or yield that .
Now , personally , I think what -- what will happen and should happen is that we try and put together the best possible context of the launch of the negotiation .
It may not be everything that everyone wants , but get the thing underway , because the issues , as you rightly say , I mean , they 've been canvassed many times .
Actually , the Annapolis process went into them in a fair amount of detail .
And -- and the two sides reached not agreement exactly , but they - - they narrowed the differences .
AMANPOUR : Can I just play a little bit of what Prime Minister Netanyahu said to Wolf Blitzer on CNN yesterday about his version and his vision of peace ?
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU , ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER : I think that prosperity is good for peace .
I do n't think it 's a substitute for a political peace , but I think it really enables it , because young Palestinians see there -- there is a future there .
I mean , they -- they -- they have jobs .
There are investments .
There are buildings sprouting out in Palestinian cities like Ramallah and Jenin and not missiles , as in Gaza , but , you know , high rises , apartment blocks , office buildings .
This is what I 'd like to see .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
AMANPOUR : So he 's thrilled about the economy .
I mean , the economy is kind of a no - brainer .
Obviously , everybody wants to see people having a better life .
But it does look as though that that is what they 're more interested in right now , the economy rather than the hard political decisions .
BLAIR : No , you 've got to be interested in both .
I mean , look , my theory of this is absolutely clear and simple , which is that you 've got to negotiate from the top down , build from the bottom up .
The economy matters .
I mean , prosperity matters .
And it 's true : The Palestinian economy on the West Bank , now that we 've eased some of the restrictions , got some of the -- and this is obviously what I 'm working on -- got some of the -- the projects going and so on , Israeli Arabs coming in to the West Bank ...
AMANPOUR : I mean , the figures are amazing .
It does look like a renewal there economically .
BLAIR : There 's a lot happening .
But nobody 's under any illusion at all : Without a political settlement , it wo n't last .
So we need both .
AMANPOUR : You know , the Israelis are always saying that they do n't have a partner for peace , and yet Terje Roed - Larsen 's -- Middle East envoy and president of the IPI -- has got an exclusive new poll , basically a new poll which says that attitudes are changing , Palestinian attitudes are shifting , much more ready to be flexible , much more ready to compromise .
Fatah is -- is -- is going up , his popularity .
Is that -- is that not something that the Israelis should seize upon right now ?
BLAIR : Yes .
I mean , I think that 's why I actually do believe that we will launch the negotiations in the next few weeks .
And then people have got a choice to make .
I mean , there 's no doubt , if you want to resolve these issues -- territory , the land swaps that 'll take place , refugees , the security issues , even Jerusalem , which is very , very sensitive and very , very difficult -- if you want to settle these issues , you can .
But essential to doing that -- and this , I think , is the critical point -- Israel will not negotiate a Palestinian state unless they 're sure that state will be securely and properly governed .
That 's the importance of the work that is happening with Prime Minister Fayyad now .
And the Palestinians wo n't make the compromises necessary to agree a state unless they think they 'll actually be able to run it , that the Israelis will get out , leave them to run their own territory .
AMANPOUR : I want to show you some more of this poll regarding the United States , attitudes by the Palestinians to the United States .
Basically , the poll is saying that the U.S. has 80 percent unfavorable rating from the Palestinians , only 16 percent favorable .
Barack Obama himself personally , 69 percent unfavorable , 27 percent favorable .
And more importantly , can President Obama make progress on peace between Palestine and Israel ?
Fifty - six percent say unlikely , forty - one percent say likely .
Now , since the United States is the main interlocutor , so - called honest broker , power broker , where does that leave everybody , if them and also the Israelis do n't have that much faith in President Obama , either ?
BLAIR : Look , I think it 's not very surprising to get those type of poll results because of the history of all this .
The basic point is this :
If you ask people whether they want the two - state solution , Israelis and Palestinians , they 'll say yes .
If you ask them whether they think they 're going to get it , then based on their recent history , they say no .
But it 's our job , in a sense , to bridge that credibility gap .
And I think it is bridgeable .
AMANPOUR : So how do we bridge it ?
Because you 've laid that -- laid out the positions .
We 've had the two gentlemen from the Israeli side , the Palestinian side .
There was a -- no matter the spin that 's going on right now -- and there is a lot of spin -- President Obama really did want to see a settlement freeze .
He sent his envoy , George Mitchell , who worked with you on Northern Ireland , over and over again , and they did n't get it .
They shook a hand .
It did n't seem to be more than a photo - op , and he 's dropped the demand for a settlement freeze .
So how is he credible either for the Israelis or for the Palestinians ?
BLAIR : Because I think , if you look at what this now needs -- and in any of these situations , you never achieve exactly what you want -- I think what we need to do is basically to launch the negotiation with as -- as good a context that launches it with some credibility , that deals with issues like settlements , but also the obligations , obviously , of the Palestinians , some of the other issues around access and movement and -- and so on .
So you launch the negotiation with a time limit , with the credibility that that context of agreement should give it , and then you carry on the work of building from the bottom up .
And that means both trying to encourage the West Bank economy , but also -- and critically -- relieve the situation in Gaza and start to get Palestinian politics to come around to a more unified position .
But , you know , in the end , it 's not impossible to do this if people want to do it .
AMANPOUR : Is n't that always the case ?
BLAIR : It is , but you -- sorry .
AMANPOUR : We have to continue this conversation online , but I 've got 15 seconds to get out of this .
I wanted to ask you :
Do you think in a week , a month these negotiations will restart between both sides ?
BLAIR : I think in the coming weeks they will , yes .
AMANPOUR : All right .
Well , that 's optimistic .
KHOBAR , Saudi Arabia —
Within a week , two events on the manicured corniche of this seaside town set tongues wagging and heads shaking while Saudis sought explanations .
The riot came first .
Al Khobar ’s double - lane , palm - fringed corniche was packed with families celebrating National Day on Sept. 23 .
The crowd was especially large this year because the holiday fell amid Eid vacation at the end of Ramadan .
Music blared from cars , fireworks lit the sky .
The humid air was full of energy .
Suddenly , scores of young men began smashing windows and breaking into the stylish shops nearby .
They trashed inventories of sunglasses , crystal glass , clothes and ice cream .
They stole cash from the tills , overturned furniture , ran off with copying machines .
In all , about 30 shops and restaurants were badly vandalized before police arrived and managed to arrest about 80 of the looters .
The rare outbreak of hooliganism stunned Saudis .
“ I can not call actions such as looting , breaking glass and terrifying innocent shop keepers any less than juvenile and barbaric , ” said Ali Batarfi , a youth counselor who witnessed the mayhem .
Khobar is a major city in the Eastern Province , where much of the kingdom ’s oil riches are located .
The province is also home to most of the country ’s Shiite minority , although Shiite community leaders said no Shiites were among the arrested rioters .
The second event on the corniche took place five days later when about 20 of the not - yet - convicted perpetrators were each given 30 lashes in public .
About a dozen were flogged in Khobar and the rest in Dammam , a 20 - minute ride away , according to Saudi newspapers .
The lashings were ordered by the Eastern Province ’s vice - governor Prince Jalawi bin Abdul Aziz bin Mossaed , the papers stated .
Police officials told reporters that all the flogged youths , including four under age 18 , had confessed to participating in the rampage .
No one has come up with definitive explanation for why the apparently spontaneous violence erupted .
Some Khobar residents say the men got “ carried away ” by the celebrations .
Although some vandals were heard to cite U.S. support for Israel as a reason for attacking Pizza Hut and Starbucks , anti-Americanism does not appear to have been a motive .
Mutlaq Al - Anazi , managing editor of Al - Yaum newspaper , told the Arab News : “ This has never happened here before .
The Eastern Province is a quiet place .
Our youngsters have always been known for their good behavior .
Therefore , this is alarming .
We have had street brawls before — especially after soccer matches , but ... this was pretty violent and calls for a thorough investigation . ”
Student Abdullah Thafir Al Amri , 20 , was caught up in the police sweep as he bought take - out food in a restaurant .
Released days later , he told his family that most of “ the actual perpetrators ” were from Riyadh and had come to Khobar for vacation because of its “ more free atmosphere , ” according to Al Amri ’s sister , Hajar .
Hajar , who declined to give her full name , said that the violence was unplanned .
" As you know , " she added , " the youth here have little space to express themselves , so they take every chance they have , which usually comes during public celebrations , and some abuse it . "
Indeed , many Saudis agree .
And they saw the Khobar violence as a harbinger of the demographic challenges facing Saudi Arabia .
In a country where 38 percent of its 20 million citizens are under 24 years , the government will have to find jobs for this huge youth bulge , as well as provide recreational and entertainment activities .
Not easy in a country dominated by an austere strain of Islam .
Saudi Arabia has no movie theaters and limited sports facilities for young men , who can only go to beaches reserved for single men and eat in “ singles only ” sections of restaurants .
As dating is prohibited , most young single men have no opportunity to interact with the opposite sex .
Even innocent partying on the streets to celebrate National Day is taboo for some religious conservatives .
Saudi blogger Eman Al Nafjan described Riyadh on the recent holiday .
“ The streets were full of guys hanging out of their car windows with flags wrapped around their heads or waving them …
Some even stopped their cars at the side of the road , got out and danced ! ”
But later at a shopping mall , Al Najran noted that the religious police were “ all out to squelch celebrations .
They caught a bunch of teenage girls and took the flags that the girls had thrown over their abayas . ”
Writer Abdullah Al Alami believes that such constrictions on public fun contributed to the Khobar incident .
" This terrible event reflects the need to allow more space for the youth in terms of sport clubs , movie theatres and recreation facilities , " he told Arab News .
There is , he added later in an interview , a “ lack of other outlets for these youth . ”
Laila M. Bahammam , a writer at Al Yaom newspaper , disputed that notion .
“ There are plenty of beaches ... there are so many things for youngsters , ” she said .
“ Also , Bahrain is a one - hour drive away , where they can see movies . ”
The public flogging drew mixed reviews .
Bahammam said most people in Khobar wanted a quick punishment and that “ all the parents [ of the detained youths ] agreed to ” the lashings .
Maher Al Bawardi , Al Yaum ’s circulation manager , said he would have preferred some type of community service for the looters , all of whom have been released from jail .
About 20 of them will face civil claims for damages from shop owners , he said .
Al Bawardi added that floggings hurt more psychologically than physically .
Under Islamic law , he explained , the lasher must keep his elbow next to his body to mitigate the force of each blow .
“ No blood comes , ” Al Bawardi said .
“ It wo n’t hurt that much , you wo n’t die from it .
But it ’s an insulting punishment .
...
It hurts psychologically , so he knows he ’s done something wrong . ”
The National Society for Human Rights , a Saudi group , issued a statement condemning the looting but objecting to the lack of due process .
" The execution of lashing … [ before ] a lower level court issues a sentence " and all appeals are exhausted is " not coherent " with the country ’s basic law , it stated .
Marwan Al Zamil , a junior high student at Dhahran Ahliyaa , a private school , was hanging around outside Pizza Hut one night recently with his friends .
He said they all approved of the floggings so that " the bullies " responsible for the rampage " ca n’t do it again . "
His friend , Ahmed Bubshait , agreed : " They should learn a lesson , " he said , adding that the flogging would make the perpetrators think twice about doing " anything like that on National Day again . "
One of the looted shops , OPTICA , sustained more than $ 130,000 in damage , according to manager Ata Kanani .
The eyeglass store ’s entire inventory , including hundreds of designer sunglasses , as well as fax and credit card machines , were stolen .
Kanani turned and showed a visitor a piece of paper in a brown frame , which he said was presented to him by members of a Khobar youth club a few days after the rampage .
Across the top under " Apology , " it said " on behalf of all Saudis , we deeply condemn the terrible ' or sorrowful ' events that you had to witness . "
The shop manager was pleased , but he ’s taking precautions nonetheless .
" Actually , we have to make some shutters , " he said .
" And have them installed next year , close to National Day . "

The Cassini spacecraft has weathered the Monday , Nov. 2 , flyby of Saturn 's moon Enceladus in good health and has been sending images and data of the encounter back to Earth .
Cassini had approached Enceladus more closely before , but this passage took the spacecraft on its deepest plunge yet through the heart of the plume shooting out from the south polar region .
Scientists are eagerly sifting through the results .
In the unprocessed image above ( top left ) , sunlight brightens a crescent curve along the edge of Enceladus and highlights the moon 's misty plume .
The image was captured by Cassini 's narrow - angle camera as the spacecraft passed about 190,000 kilometers ( 120,000 miles ) over the moon .
Another raw image ( top right ) appears to show separate jets spewing from the moon .
This image was taken from approximately 330,000 kilometers ( 200,000 miles ) away .
At its closest point on Nov. 2 , Cassini flew about 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) above the surface of Enceladus .
Since the discovery of the plume in 2005 , scientists have been captivated by the enigmatic jets .
Previous flybys detected water vapor , sodium and organic molecules , but scientists need to know more about the plume 's composition and density to characterize the source , possibly a liquid ocean under the moon 's icy surface .
It would also help them determine whether Enceladus has the conditions necessary for life .
Mission managers did extensive studies to make sure the spacecraft could fly safely through the plumes and not use an excessive amount of propellant .

Atheists have accused the Brumby Government of discriminating against them by refusing to fund the movement 's global conference in Melbourne , but giving $ 2 million to a religious conference .
The Parliament of the World 's Religions begins on December 3 at the new Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre and has also received $ 2 million from the Federal Government and $ 500,000 from the Melbourne City Council .
Premier John Brumby launched the event this morning .
The Atheist Foundation of Australia says it approached all three levels of government for a total of $ 270,000 for its conference , to be held at the same venue early next year , but has received no funding .
" This is a world - class event with world - class academic and intellectual speakers , " foundation president David Nicholls said .
Sherwangei , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
A passport bearing the name of Said Bahaji , a suspect linked to the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington , has been found in a town captured by the Pakistani military .
The passport was found in South Waziristan , where the Pakistani military has been battling to wrest territory from the Taliban in Pakistan .
It contained a Pakistani visa issued in August 2001 showing that the bearer entered Pakistan on September 4 , 2001 , and appeared unusually new for a document eight years old .
CNN has not independently confirmed its authenticity .
Bahaji is suspected of having fled Germany for Pakistan on September 3 , 2001 , after receiving a tip that the attacks were imminent .
The photo in the passport resembles images of Bahaji posted on Interpol 's Web site .
It shows a clean - cut man wearing a red sweater .
Bahaji , 34 , is alleged to have been a member of the Hamburg , Germany - based cell that provided money to the hijackers who carried out the September 11 attacks , which killed about 3,000 people .
He is wanted in Germany and Spain on terrorism charges , according to Interpol .
A U.S. counterterrorism official said only that Bahaji is a senior propagandist for al Qaeda who had ties to some of the September 11 hijackers and is very much of interest to the United States .
He lived with one of the leaders of the hijackers , Mohammed Atta , in Germany before the attacks , according to the September 11 report .
He is a German citizen of Moroccan descent .
CNN 's Reza Sayah saw the passport and another one from Spain along with other documents during a trip to South Waziristan for journalists run by the Pakistani military .
It was the first time the army had taken journalists to the region since the offensive against the Taliban began on October 17th , he said .
The army showed journalists a pile of documents that they said they had seized .
Among the papers was the German passport in Bahaji 's name , which included his signature and a photo of him in a red shirt .
Pakistani military spokesman Gen. Athar Abbas was not aware of the passport until reporters asked him about it .
CNN 's Samson Desta in Islamabad , Pakistan , contributed to this report .

Extraordinary camera footage taken by a BBC crew proves that golden eagles do hunt and kill reindeer .
In this clip , an eagle is filmed swooping down and grabbing a calf attempting to escape over the snow .
The footage , shot from long distance , was gathered along a reindeer migration route in northern Finland .
The film crew filmed the behaviour while capturing footage of the reindeer migration for the BBC natural history series Life .
The arbitrary termination of Internet access for repeated accusations of copyright infringement -- " three strikes " -- is as profoundly unpopular in the UK as it is elsewhere .
National experts have generally come out against the idea , from government civil servants who previously omitted it from a public consultation document as too drastic , to the counter - intelligence MI5 unit , who apparently fear it will encourage an encrypted and unpoliceable darknet , to many of the artists it is supposed to protect .
Net users , of course , are aghast at such a disproportionate and ineffective scheme , and 70 % of Britons came out against it in a recent poll .
Nonetheless , UK Business secretary Peter Mandelson today stated explicitly that he intends to include three strikes in the upcoming digital economy bill .
In a subsequent press conference , a government spokesman emphasized that the arbitrariness of this Internet enforcement mechanism will be proportional only to how ineffective it is as a deterrent :
If it [ illegal filesharing ] is a massive problem we could turn on a fast , powerful response ...
If there is a little problem we can be more proportionate .
How draconian we are will be a matter for the secretary of state to decide at the time . "
Is the UK really set to join France in a legally mandated three strikes regime ?
Even with Britain 's generally government - friendly lawmaking process , that seems up for question .
A UK general election is due to occur within the next few months ( the exact date is up to current Prime Minister Gordon Brown , but he is required to name the date before June 2010 ) .
The Conservative chairman for the committee considering the proposed digital economy bill has already expressed scepticism that there is time in this parliament if such a " hot potato " as three strikes is included .
The more British voters write to their MPs to complain , the hotter that potato will get .
Unpopular and arbitrary proposals as three strikes will not sit well with any politicians facing an election in their near future .
The Frozen Throne
With the 3.3 patch , a variety of new content is coming to the game in the Icecrown Citadel Instances .
There will be four new instances total with the new Raid instance being The Frozen Throne and additional content appearing in the three new 5 man instances .
As of the writing of this guide , testing is underway on the 5 man bosses and the raid bosses , so we do n’t yet have complete strategies to go over , but soon enough we ’ll be able to take a much closer look at these instances and what they mean for players .
Here are some details about each instance :
The Frozen Throne will be the newest 10 / 25 man raiding instance .
It consists of three separate wings , then the final battle with the Lich King , completing the storyline that was started with the release of Wrath of the Lich King .
You will join forces with HIghlord Tirion Fordring , High Overlord Saurfang , Muradin Bronzebeard , Highlord Darion Mograine , and King Varian Wrynn to fight the Scourge and the Lich King in this instance .
There are 12 total encounters in this instance ( see below ) and each encounter can be fought on 10 man or 25 man and on normal or heroic difficulty .
You can also now toggle between difficulties with ease on the new UI option added in the 3.3 patch .
The items in the instance dropping will be ilvl 251 for normal 10 man , ilvl 264 for heroic 10 man and normal 25 man , and ilvl 277 for heroic 25 player mode .
The instance starts with the breach of the fortress , followed by facing down a legion of undead guards in a gauntlet .
This first boss is Lord Marrowgar , a fused together construct of other dead bodies .
You will then face Supreme Overseer of the Cult of the Damned , lady Deathwhisper .
In addition , there will be a fight between Alliance and Horde characters , led by Saurfang and Bronzebeard aboard the Icecrown airships .
After this fight , you will enter the three wings of the instance to face off against the Lich King ’s minions before you face him .
Lord Marrowgar – Bone Guard leader of the Citadel Defenses

5 Man Instance ‐ Forge of Souls
The first of the three new 5 man instances is the Forge of Souls .
This instance exists to provide an epic quest line in which players must weaken the forces of Icecrown Citadel so they can breach the doorway and get in to attack the Lich King thee .
Technically , all three instances are part of the same full instance , but they have their own lockout timers and names .
However , you will need to defeat them in order to get into the Frozen Throne .
The goal of this instance in particular is to follow Jaina for Alliance forces and Sylvanas for Horde forces as you work your way deep into the citadel to destroy the Soul Grinders located within its walls .
You will need to defeat the following bosses :
Bronjahm , the Godfather of Souls– This boss is the watcher of the engines and Soul Grinders in the Forge of Souls .
He must be killed before the grinders can be destroyed .
The Devourer of Souls – This is the operator of the engines in this wing and the guardian of the souls that have been stolen by the Lich King .
5 Man Instance – The Pit of Saron
I have to start with ABC since there were a couple things that caught my eye .
Unsurprisingly , Hank ( 2.1 ) and The Middle ( 2.6 ) did n't do so great .
Modern Family ( 3.8 ) and Cougar Town ( 3.8 ) managed to keep a large part of their audience which is a good sign .
The thing that bothered me the most was the low ratings for Eastwick ( 2.3 ) .
I think the show is actually pretty good and with a big lead - in , I would have expected it to do better .
If it continues down this road , Eastwick will be canceled .
From 3.0 last week to 2.4 is pretty bad and indicates the viewers do n't like it .
CBS did well with Criminal Minds ( 3.8 ) and CSI : New York ( 3.3 ) .
As usual the comedies New Adventures of Old Christine ( 1.9 ) and Gary Unmarried ( 2.2 ) did n't do too well , so CBS tied with Fox for the night .
Fox rode So You Think You Can Dance ( 2.7 ) and Glee ( 3.3 ) to a tie which is pretty good for them .
NBC continued their pattern of suckage with Mercy ( 2.1 ) , Law & Order : SVU ( 2.5 ) , and The Jay Leno Show ( 1.9 ) .
This page is very much a work in progress , and not yet meant to be consumed by the general public .
But now that there ’s a thread going , feel free to make all kinds of comments about stuff I have or have n’t covered yet ( syntactic or otherwise ) and I ’ll decide whether it belongs here .
( Often as not , it does . )
Haskell : The Confusing Parts
If you ’re used to the C family of languages , or the closely related family of “ scripting languages , ” Haskell ’s syntax ( mainly ) is a bit baffling at first .
For some people , it can even seem like it ’s sneaking out from under you every time you think you understand it .
This is sort of a FAQ for people who are new to Haskell , or scared away by its syntax .
Use this as a cheat sheet , not a textbook .
Misc. Stuff You Should Know Already Quick review , because if you ’ve heard of Haskell , you should also have heard of most of this .
foo :: Bar baz ->
Bar quux is a type signature for the function foo , where Bar baz is the type of argument it takes , and Bar quux is the type of the return value .
Function application looks like sin x , not sin(x ) , because the latter would just look goofy with curried functions ( map foo bar vs. map ( foo ) ( bar ) ) .
List syntax ( [ 1,2,3,4 ] ) is sugar for “ cons ” syntax ( 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : [ ] ) .
An enumerated list looks like [ 1..10 ] , and a list comprehension looks like [ x | x <- [ 1..10 ] ] .
There ’s no null and no void .
Every variable has to have a value , even if it ’s a placeholder .
The standard placeholder value is the empty tuple , ( ) , a.k.a. “ unit . ”
The type of ( ) is also ( ) .
Haskell ’s syntax is indirectly based on ML , so if you stop reading here and go learn OCaml instead , some of this information will still be kinda useful .
I rhyme “ Haskell ” with “ ask Elle , ” but everyone else rhymes it with “ rascal ” because otherwise people keep mishearing it as “ Pascal , ” and nobody wants that ( except trolls ) .
Type Names and Constructors
There are two completely separate namespaces in any Haskell source file :
The value namespace , and the type namespace .
The former is where functions , literals , patterns , etc. reside , and the latter is where you ’ll find type constructors , typeclasses , and type variables .
Haskell has no need for reflection 90 % of the time , so rather than make the type and value namespaces visually distinct with syntax conventions , the designers actually reused many of the same conventions in both namespaces .
Thus , in order to know what Foo bar baz means , you have to know whether it ’s in the type namespace or the value namespace .
Fortunately , you only have to look for the type namespace in the following places :
The “ has type ” ( : :) operator can appear as an expression in parentheses , or a separate declaration .
The stuff on the left of the operator is in the value namespace , and the stuff on the right is in the type namespace , as in 5 :: Int .
The type keyword declares a type alias ( like typedef in C ) .
Everything in that declaration is in the type namespace .
In a class ... where declaration , everything between class and where is in the type namespace .
Same deal for instance ... where .
In a data ( or newtype ) declaration , any new constructor names to the right of the = sign are in the value namespace .
Stuff between curly braces ( when using the record syntax ) follows the rules for ( : :) .
Everything else is in the type namespace .
The data and newtype declarations ( the latter is a subset of the former ) are probably the worst offenders .
Just to be clear , the highlighted parts are in the value namespace : data Pizza a b = Pepperoni a | TheWorks { sauce :: a , toppings :: [ b ] } deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show ) ( Still writing this section .

Avoiding Too Many Parentheses
Lisp is known for hating infix notation , but Haskell embraces it .
All functions are operators and all operators are functions .
There are ten levels of operator precedence ( 0 through 9 ) , not counting function application ( foo bar ) , which binds tighter than any operator .
That means you can always write x + sin y instead of x + ( sin y ) .
Function infix notation ( backticks ) will turn any function into an operator at precedence level 4 ( although the precedence can be changed for individual functions ) .
Operators always take two arguments .
This means that whenever you have foo ( bar 1 ) ( baz 5 ) , you can change it to bar 1 `foo` baz 5 .
You can only use backticks around a function name , not an arbitrary expression , so if you want to write something like x `f g` y , you have to bind f g to some intermediate name ( with let or where ) .
Any operator ( including `foo` ) can be written in prefix notation by surrounding it with parentheses : (+ ) , ( == ) , ( `div` ) .
These are called sections , and they ’re regular functions like map and sin .
For example , instead of 2 + 2 , you can write (+) 2 2 .
You can even leave off either the left or right operand to curry an operator .
For example , ( `div` 0 ) is a function that takes one argument and divides it by zero .
There are two operators in Haskell that do n’t show up in many other languages : Apply ( $ ) and compose (. ) .
These have very simple definitions ( below ) and are used frequently either for currying or just for the sake of leaving out some parentheses .
f $ x = f x ( f . g ) x = f ( g x ) putStrLn ( take 12 ( map foo ( bar ++ " ack " ) ) ) putStrLn $ take 12 $ map foo $ bar ++ " ack " ( putStrLn . take 12 . map foo ) ( bar ++ " ack " ) putStrLn .
take 12 . map foo $ bar ++ " ack "
In terms of good Haskell style , the last example above is preferable to the others .
By the way , note that ( $ ) has the lowest precedence ( zero ) of any operator , so you can almost always use arbitrary syntax on either side of it .
Writing Functions
It ’s called functional programming for a reason .
Haskell actually permits more ways of turning functions into other functions than any other language I ’ve ever seen ( even J ) .
The scariest - looking of these is easily the lambda notation : f x = ( x , foo ) f = \x -> ( x , foo ) A lambda expression , which defines an anonymous function , starts with a backslash ( which is special syntax , not an operator ) and extends till the next semicolon / newline / closing ( brace|bracket|paren ) .
The arrow ( always -> , never => ) separates the argument list from the body of the function .
You can use pattern matching in the argument list ( eg. \ 3 -> 4 ) , but it ’s generally a bad idea , because you can only write one branch , and if that fails it ’ll throw a runtime exception .
If you need to do pattern matching , you should do it in a separate function , and pass that function in place of the lambda .
It ’s pretty rare to see explicit lambda expressions in Haskell , either way , because there are much nicer ways of writing anonymous functions .
For example , anywhere you might write \x -> foo x [ 1..10 ] , you should instead write flip foo [ 1..10 ] , where flip is a standard Prelude function that flips the first two arguments of whatever function you give it .
The curry and uncurry functions stand in for \f x y -> f ( x , y ) and \f ( x , y ) -> f x y , respectively .
There ’s a whole bunch of other stuff I ca n’t even think of right now .
To see some of it , go into the IRC channel and play around with lambdabot ’s @pl command .
Statements vs. Expressions
There ’s no difference between statements and expressions in Haskell .
If something is not an expression , then it ’s a declaration , even if the language definition calls it a statement .
This is more important than you think .
A lot of newbies wander into the IRC channel wondering why the following code does n’t work : main = do foo <- getLine putStrLn " Pull my finger " if length foo < 9000 then return ( ) else sunglasses <- getLine putStrLn " YEEEEAAHHH "
The problem is that the special do syntax fools people into thinking that they ’ve somehow escaped into an imperative language , when in reality , it ’s syntactic sugar for the >>= and >> operators and the \foo -> ... lambda notation .
Yes , this has to do with monads , and no , I ’m not going to explain them .
Go read the appropriate chapter of Real World Haskell , or check out “ You could have invented monads . ”
I will point out that return is , in fact , not a return statement .
It ’s a function , and an inappropriately named function , at that .
Writing return ( ) in your do block will not cause the function to return .

The American Medical Assn. on Tuesday urged the federal government to reconsider its classification of marijuana as a dangerous drug with no accepted medical use , a significant shift that puts the prestigious group behind calls for more research .
The nation 's largest physicians organization , with about 250,000 member doctors , the AMA has maintained since 1997 that marijuana should remain a Schedule I controlled substance , the most restrictive category , which also includes heroin and LSD .
In changing its policy , the group said its goal was to clear the way to conduct clinical research , develop cannabis - based medicines and devise alternative ways to deliver the drug .

I spent most of this past spring and summer rolling my eyes every time I heard a news story about the swine flu .
Almost every day local reporters got hysterical about 5 or 10 or 20 confirmed cases .
Entire schools closed in response to a handful of kids with fevers , and as if there were no war in Afghanistan , no economic crisis , and no other epidemics claiming ten times as many lives , newscasters talked about H1N1 ( the proper name for swine flu ) for hours .
I have a degree in public health and my work focuses on preventing rape and other acts of violence and supporting survivors in healing from abuse .
When I see all the attention swine flu is getting , I ’m jealous .
Other than intermittent news stories about sex offenders on the loose or why women who accuse professional athletes of rape are lying , sexual violence rarely gets any widespread coverage .
Certainly no state of emergency declared by the President of the United States .
Now , I do n’t want to diminish the grief of those who have lost loved ones to H1N1 .
I do n’t even want to question the scientific validity of the Center for Disease Control ’s decision to declare it a pandemic .
But the fact remains that the impact H1N1 has had on our country to date is far less than that of other public health crises that receive a fraction of the attention and resources .
The CDC reported just over 43,000 cases of H1N1 between April and July of this year and estimates that it affected a million people in that time .
Compare this to the 2.5 % of women and 0.9 % of men who reported being raped or sexually assaulted in the past year .
That ’s more than 2.5 million sexual assaults in a three - month time period .
The most recent statistics about rape available from the CDC are from last year .
Swine flu ?
Last week .
( Editor ’s note : A few sentences from the above paragraph have been updated to reflect statistical changes since this post was originally published . )
What would our media , our public discourse , and our institutional responses look like if people cared as much about rape as they do about H1N1 ?
I imagine the federal government urging colleges to stop the epidemic of rape by developing protocols for quarantining students who have tried to use drugs or alcohol to incapacitate women who would otherwise not consent to sex .
Or university officials directing students to stay off campus or out of public areas until they are free of the belief that they are entitled to sex any time they want for a full 24 hours .
Sounds pretty good , does n’t it ?
I dream of public health departments so inundated with the demand for educational programs that teach kids about healthy relationships that they can’t keep up .
Of public outrage that there are not enough doses of self - defense training to inoculate everyone against rape , and of medical experts having to go on television to reassure people that more of these self - defense vaccines are on the way .
Then I wake up to a phone conversation with a principal who tells me there is no dating violence in his school and another with a teacher who desperately wants to offer rape prevention resources to her high school classes but ca n’t because the entire budget for health education in her district was cut .
So much for the dream .
But if I stop resenting H1N1 for getting so much attention for a moment , I realize that what I ’m complaining about is actually public health at is best .
It is probably true that the coordination of government urgency , media attention , medical system mobilization , and common sense precautions will succeed in thwarting a pandemic .
We will probably not look back at 2009 and say it was the beginning of a swine flu crisis that devastated a generation .
What feels like hysteria or over - emphasis is actually the way prevention is supposed to look .
It is supposed to be widespread and coordinated .
Messages about the importance and seriousness of the public health threat are supposed to be so pervasive that they are almost impossible to ignore .
I ’m so used to caring about public health crises that do n’t get the attention and resources they deserve that I almost ca n’t recognize what the public health system looks like when it does work .
This kind of focused attention is my wildest dream for our society ’s response to HIV , rape , domestic violence , drug addiction , racial health disparities , cancer - causing corporate pollution , food system injustice and every other area of public health that is marginalized .
So why is the public health infrastructure working so well ?
Because it ’s not being undermined by shame , stigma , and denial ( you know , the way rape and sexual assault are ) .
Even in the highest drama evening news stories there is almost a complete absence of victim blaming .
Personal choices and individual behaviors spread the flu , but our government , our health workers , and our media understand that this crisis is too serious to waste time arguing over whether people who do n’t wash their hands or share cubicles with co-workers who fail to stay home from work the recommended 4 to 7 days deserve what they get .
It would be unthinkable for a person to avoid seeking treatment for swine flu because s/he ’s afraid that if s/he tells her / his doctor s/ he ’ll be blamed for touching her / his eyes and nose or lose her / his housing because no parents want to raise their children in a neighborhood where people do n’t sneeze into their elbows
As if invoking the finale of High School Musical , when it comes to H1N1 , we ’re all in this together .
Swine flu is not concentrated in any population that people already hate or devalue , so raging debates about whose immoral lifestyle caused it do n’t get in the way of an effective public health response .
( Even Fox News is posting stories that are sympathetic to people whose jobs do n’t have paid sick leave and the hardship they face in missing work as the authorities direct . )
Would n’t it be nice if other health crises were treated the same way ?
In watching the rapid mobilization against this virus I know that the public health infrastructure works when our government , our media , and our medical leaders are motivated to mobilize it .
H1N1 is not getting any attention it should n’t – it ’s getting the attention all public health crises should .
As much as anything else , a user ’s impression of a web site has to do with how fast the site loads .
But modern Web 2.0 websites are n’t your father ’s Oldsmobile .
Chocked full of rich Flash content and massive JavaScript libraries , they present a new set of challenges to engineers trying to maximized the performance of their sites .
You need to design your sites to be Fast by Default .
That ’s the theme of the upcoming Velocity Online Conference , co-chaired by Google performance guru Steve Souders .
Souders is the author of High Performance Web Sites and Even Faster Web Sites , and spent some time discussing the new world of web site performance with me .
James Turner :
There ’s been an evolution of the whole area of web performance , from the old days when it was all about having a bunch of servers and then doing round robin or just spreading the load out .
How is web performance today different than it was , say , ten years ago ?
Steve Souders :
Well , what ’s happened in the last five years or so is that Web 2.0 and DHTML and AJAX has really taken off .
And that ’s really been in the last two years .
Five years ago , we started seeing a lot of flash and bigger images .
So basically what ’s happened is our web pages have gotten much richer , and that also means heavier .
There ’s more content being downloaded , more bytes .
And then in the last two years , with the explosion of Web 2.0 , we ’re seeing not only a lot more bytes being downloaded into web pages , but we ’re seeing that that involves a lot of complex interaction with JavaScript and CSS .
And so whereas maybe five or ten years ago , the main focus was to build back - end architectures that would support these websites , we ’re seeing today that we need a lot more focus on the front - end architecture of our websites and web applications .
So that ’s where Velocity comes in , and my work comes in .
Whereas ten or twenty years ago , you had people looking at collecting and evangelizing best practices for back - end architectures like databases and web servers , Velocity and my work is about identifying and evangelizing best practices for building really fast high - performance front - end architectures .
James Turner : I know , as someone who ’s been doing AJAX development , AJAX is a very different kind of paradigm for how you ’re interacting with the server .
It ’s a lot more chatty .
Are the current generations of web servers really designed for that kind of interaction ?
Steve Souders : I think that the chattiness of AJAX applications is n’t really the issue with regard to performance .
I mean , anything can become an issue , but looking across the top 1,000 websites in the world , that ’s not the issue .
The issue is that these web applications that do AJAX require a lot of JavaScript to set up that framework on the client , inside the browser .
And to set that up , to download all of that JavaScript and parse it and execute it just takes a lot of time .
A user is downloading complex photos or mail or calendaring application , and before they ’ve even done any chatty AJAX request , they ’re just waiting for the application to actually load and start up .
That ’s the frustrating period , you just want to get in and start working on your slides or reading your mail , and you ’re waiting for this start up to happen .
Typically , once these AJAX frameworks have loaded , the AJAX work that we ’re doing in the background is not that big of a problem either from a back - end perspective or from the client side perspective .
James Turner :
One of the things we see a lot these days is people using libraries like YUI or Google ’s libraries or JQuery .
They have compressed versions , but they ’re still pretty large .
To what extent do you think there ’s a need to really go in and pick and choose out of those libraries ?
Steve Souders :
Well , myself personally , I do that frequently because I only need usually one small feature , like I need a carousel or I need a drop - down menu or something like that .
And I ’ll go to the work of pulling out just the code that I need .
But I ’m working small website projects .
If you ’re building a whole web application , you ’re probably using many parts of these JavaScript frameworks .
There still might be some benefit in pulling out just the pieces that you need .
But that ’s extra work .
And when you need to upgrade , that ’s the likelihood of introducing bugs or other problems .
So certainly , I would n’t avoid doing that .
It should be evaluated , pulling out just the JavaScript that you need from the frameworks so long as the licensing even supports that .
But something else that helps address that problem is the Google AJAX Libraries API .
This is where Google is actually hosting versions of JQuery and Dojo and YUI and Google ’s Closure JavaScript framework and Scriptactulous and EXT and others .
What happens is you can have multiple websites that do n’t have any interaction with each other , Sears.com and WholeFoods.com , but they both might be using JQuery 1.3.2 .
And if they ’re both downloading that library from the Google AJAX Libraries API , then the URL is exactly the same .
So a user that visits multiple of these websites only has to download that JavaScript once during their entire cache session .
That further mitigates the need or motivation or benefit of pulling out just the parts that you need .
At first , I did n’t think there would be that much of a critical mass around these people that would adopt the Google AJAX Library CDN and the actual version numbers of these JavaScript frameworks , but it ’s actually taken off really well , a lot of websites are using them .
Users are actually getting this critical mass benefit where when they go to some website , Sears.com , that ’s using JQuery , they already have that in their cache from a visit they made a previous day to a different website .
So I think in general , I would recommend to developers that they not change the JavaScript frameworks they ’re using .
And if they ’re using a framework that ’s hosted on Google , download it from there .
It ’s hosted on Google ’s infrastructure , so it ’s going to be fast , reliable , and users will actually get the benefit of having a greater probability of the framework being in their cache , because multiple websites are taking advantage of loading it from there .
James Turner : I have to put my security hat on for a second and ask , when you get into a situation like that , the flag that comes up for me is if someone managed , by some kind of an injection fake , delivery a version of a library that had vulnerabilities so that it appeared to be coming from Google , you could get into a situation where someone would be using a poison library .
Do you think that ’s at all a realistic concern ?
Steve Souders :
Well , I think it depends on who ’s doing that .
I work at Google so I do n’t want to come off as sounding like a fan boy who ’s only going to say great things about what Google is doing .
I ’m as cautious as the next person with what passwords I use and what information I give to any web company .
But when it comes to something like this , I ’ve built stuff that ’s running on Google App Engine or Amazon AWS .
It ’s always possible that these big companies , these big web hosting providers are going to go down .
But there ’s probably a greater chance that my website is going to go down than Google or Amazon .
And the same thing with security .
There ’s probably a greater chance that my website is going to be hacked than Google or Amazon .
So I think it is a possibility .
But I think the odds are pretty small of that happening .
And that would not be a concern that would stop me from taking advantage of these services because of the performance benefits I get from them .
James Turner : Staying a little bit on security , there ’s certainly been more of an emphasis over the last , pick your unit of years , about making sure that data stays secure .
You see things like Open ID now and everything pretty much is SSH’d .
How much of a balance do you have to keep between performance and security or can they work in concert ?
Steve Souders : I do n’t think there is that much tension between performance and security .
The things that are making websites slow are not being done in a slow way because people are striving to have greater security .
In most of the places where improvement could be made , the improved way , the higher performance way of doing things , does n’t change your security exposure to any degree .
There are some situations where protecting the users ’ data could make a website slower .
For example , suppose I ’m a mail application and I want to not cache the user ’s address book .
You want to protect the user ’s data .
That ’s a higher priority than performance .
And so you make that address book response non-cacheable .
Now that will make the website slower , the web mail application slower the next time the user goes there , but that one request for the user ’s inbox and the user ’s address book , those small number of requests are insignificant compared to all of the other JavaScript and CSS and images that are being downloaded .
So whether you cache that or not , whether you load it over SSL or not , that is not what ’s making websites slower .
The things that are making websites slower are large amounts of JavaScript , much of which is not used in the initial loading of the page , images that are not being optimized and these other performance best practices that are being evangelized by tools like YSlow and Page Speed .
James Turner :
You ’ve been focusing a lot on the front - end .
I have to say as someone who works largely on the back - end , one of the trends I ’ve seen is more and more tiers being layered on , of more and more complexity .
Maybe not now , but certainly a few years ago , everything was going to be SOAP over web services with Enterprise Service Buses and all of this very complex multi-tier architecture .
Was n’t that just latency waiting to happen there ?
Steve Souders :
Well , if you look at most websites , you ’ll see that for almost all websites , less than 10 to 20 percent of the page load time is spent getting the HTML document .
And that ’s largely where this back - end potential for latency lies that you ’re talking about .
It lies behind generating that HTML document .
That HTML document might generate a page that has a few more hits on the back - end for some AJAX responses or some dynamically generated JavaScript , but by and large , that ’s where you ’re going to have the biggest latency impact from the back - end , from these tiers that you ’ve described , it ’s generating the HTML document .
And yet we see across almost all websites that the HTML document , not just the generation of it , but the request going up to the web server and the response coming back , all of that is less than 10 to 20 percent of the page load time .
So it ’s certainly not the long pole in the tent .
And , in fact , if you could drop the HTML document time to zero , most users would n’t notice .
It ’s that front - end part that is the long pole in the tent .
That ’s not true of all websites .
It ’s probably true of 95 percent of the websites out there .
There are certainly a number of websites where the back - end is taking a long time .
It ’s taking 30 to 50 percent of the overall page load time .
The first thing I recommend website owners do is get a handle , get an idea of the overall page load time .
And then the second thing I say is break that into two parts : the back - end and the front - end .
And if you find that like most websites , your back - end time is less than 10 or 20 percent , then you ’re correct in focusing on these front - end best practices .
If your back - end time is 30 to 50 percent or more , then you should really start on looking at your back - end architecture .
Perhaps there are some latency delays injected there because of multiple tiers or other web services that you ’re using .
But there are even some best practices in that situation .
For example , flushing the document early is a situation where if you do have a lot of web service requests that are required to generate your HTML document , you can still send back some of your HTML page to the browser early before you start those slow web service calls and give the user some content and some feedback and start the browser doing some work while you continue on with your other back - end requests in processing .
James Turner :
One place that I see a lot of slowdown in pages has nothing to do with the site I ’m actually visiting , but a lot of times , it appears the ads being served on the page .
What ’s the state of that right now ?
It seems like the people who are doing the least to optimize their performance are the ad servers .
Steve Souders : Yeah .
Ads being served , third party ads being served inside of web pages , is becoming more of a problem .
It ’s not that it ’s getting worse ; it ’s that everything else is getting better .
When I started this work about five years ago , the percentage of problems that could be associated with ads was pretty small .
Maybe 20 percent of the improvements you could make to a page had to do with ads .
That ’s because most websites were n’t focusing on these other best practices of spriting and ETags and caching .
Well , in the last five years , we ’ve seen a lot of the major websites adopting these front - end performance best practices .
So it ’s not that ads have gotten worse ; it ’s that the actual website content has gotten so much better .
Now , of the bad performance practices that you see inside of popular web pages , a much higher percentage , maybe 40 or 50 percent of the problems are introduced because of third party ads .
And it ’s not too surprising that that ’s happening for two reasons .
One is that it ’s amazing that this system of serving third party ads works .
Here you have two companies that have never spoken to each other .
You have two sets of web developers who have never met and never exchanged any plans for how to integrate content .
And yet , this third party ad service can serve up content that almost 100 percent of the time loads correctly in some publisher ’s page .
That ’s just an amazing infrastructure that has worked for as long as it has and it continues to work , especially when you consider all of the cross browser compatibility issues that can arise .
So how is it that we were able to achieve that ?
Well , it ’s because we adopted a framework of inserting ads , of creating ads , that ’s pretty simple .
And because it ’s pretty simple , it ’s not highly tuned .
That ’s one reason why we should n’t be too surprised that we see performance issues in third party ads .
The other reason is that ad services are not focused on technology .
Certainly companies like Yahoo and Google and Microsoft , we ’re technology companies .
We focus on technology .
So it ’s not surprising that our web developers are on the leading edge of adopting these performance best practices .
And it ’s also not surprising that ad services might lag two , three or four years behind where these web technology companies are .
I think that ’s where we are .
We ’ve seen a lot of adoption of these performance best practices in these web companies over the last three years and now it ’s time for the ad services to catch up .
I do n’t know what the answer is there .
It ’s going to require changing this huge infrastructure for serving third party ads , and that ’s not something that ’s easy to do .
Certainly we know things that we can do to make ads serve better , to make them faster , to reduce the impact they have .
But getting that to propagate across this huge ecosystem of ads is going to take a long time , a lot of evangelism , a lot of monitoring and a lot of organizational changes .
It ’s not something that ’s going to happen overnight .
But hopefully in the next few years , we ’ll see progress there .
I know in the last two years , the IAB has established a performance working group and has published some guidelines for how to make ads higher performance .
I think we ’ll continue to see progress there .
And just as we ’re seeing with web companies , where companies that have faster web pages are more successful , have greater revenue , reduced operating expenses , the ad services are going to realize that too , that when it comes to ads , faster ads are going to have a competitive advantage .
I think , in part , the ecosystem will take care of itself .
These ad services will realize that to remain competitive , they need to be fast .
James Turner : Okay .
I ’m going to wrap up with one last , kind of geeky , question .
What is the state - of - the - art in small good - looking images these days ?
Steve Souders :
Well , when it comes to images , the two experts in the industry are Stoyan Stefanov and Nicole Sullivan .
I worked with both of them over in the Yahoo Exceptional Performance Group .
And they , in fact , contributed a chapter to my most recent book on optimizing images .
So they ’re really the experts , but I think I can summarize what they would say .
If you have small images with a very few number of colors , GIF is probably going to be the optimal format to use .
All of these formats are supported across all browsers .
In most cases though , PNG is going to be the format to choose , you can choose PNG 8 for images that are less than 255 colors or PNG 24 for images that are over 255 colors .
And if you have a very high resolution image , like a photograph , JPEG is still the optimal format .
So your question was about small high - quality images .
PNG is going to be the format of choice , most likely , for those types of images .

( Adds second Republican backing health reform , details )
WASHINGTON , Nov 7 ( Reuters ) - After a narrow win in the U.S. House of Representatives , President Barack Obama ’s fight for a sweeping healthcare overhaul moves to the U.S. Senate where it faces a difficult path to approval .
The Senate ’s version of healthcare reform has been stalled as Democratic leader Harry Reid awaits cost estimates from congressional budget analysts and searches for an approach that can win the 60 votes needed to overcome Republican procedural hurdles .
Eventually , the House and Senate will have to reconcile their separate bills into a single proposal that can be signed by Obama , who has set a now - threatened goal of finishing work by the end of the year .
Here is a look at how the issue might play out as it moves through Congress over the next few weeks :
SENATE BILL
Reid has made his toughest decision in merging the separate bills passed by the Finance and Health panels :
He included a national government - run public insurance option , which was part of the Health bill but was not in the Finance measure .
Reid also included a compromise that would allow states to decline to participate , or “ opt out , ” of the government - run program -- an effort to appease moderates , most from conservative Republican - leaning states , who oppose a national public option .
Reid has little margin for error -- Democrats control exactly 60 votes , the number needed to overcome procedural hurdles and pass a bill .
Most of the dozen or so Democratic moderates in the Senate remain uncommitted or oppose the public option .
Senator Joe Lieberman , an independent who caucuses with Democrats , opposes the public option and has said he will side with Republicans to block a final vote on any bill that includes one .
Senators Mary Landrieu , Ben Nelson , Evan Bayh and Blanche Lincoln are the other Democrats who appear to be most resistant to Reid ’s approach on a public option .
Obama has been meeting lawmakers privately at the White House in an effort to persuade the uncommitted moderates , and Senate leaders have explored possible alternatives that could keep them on board .
One of those could be Republican Olympia Snowe ’s favored approach of a “ trigger ” that would activate a government plan in states where there is not enough competition in the insurance market .
Snowe is the only Republican in the Senate to back one of the healthcare reform bills in a committee vote , but she has said she will oppose a bill with the “ opt - out ” public option .
A first - term House Republican , Anh Cao of Louisiana , became the second Republican to endorse the healthcare overhaul on Saturday when he backed the House bill .
Reid is waiting for the Congressional Budget Office to provide him cost estimates , and Democrats say a response is not expected until at least late next week .
Reid could be ready to publish the measure and move to floor debate fairly quickly once he gets the estimates , but the Senate will be in recess for a week around the Thanksgiving holiday in late November .
Democratic aides said the bill is likely to drop a mandate that all employers offer insurance to workers or pay a penalty .
Differences over the amount of subsidies offered to help lower - and middle - income people buy insurance and on the taxes imposed to pay for the plan must also be overcome .
A floor debate that could last several weeks is now expected to begin in the next few weeks .

Once the Senate and House have passed separate measures , they will appoint negotiators to a conference committee that will negotiate the differences .
Their final bill must be passed again by the House and Senate .
It is at this stage where Obama and White House staffers can become most active in closed - door negotiations , cementing what they want in a final bill and what they think is most likely to pass in each chamber .
A final bill would be sent to Obama for his signature , with a goal of finishing work by the end of the year .
Deadlines on the bill have slipped repeatedly , however , and Reid has raised the possibility that final action on the measure could drift into January .

Twenty - seven year old UK entrepreneur , Matt Horan , has started a company based off an ingenious idea .
“ After getting tired of giving my girlfriend a piggyback home every Saturday night , I had a ‘ eureka ’ moment , ” says Rollasole founder Matt Horan of his clever invention .
( Pics )
Rollasole is an emergency ballet flat sold in vending machine at UK clubs .
For about 5 pounds ( around 8 bucks ) , you can relieve your dancing or partying feet with these comfy and cute ballet flats that roll open and come complete with a little carry pouch ( for you to tote around and use later ! ) .
Within 6 months of starting his business , Horan has sold thousands of Rollasoles and has expanded to the wedding / special occasions market .
The next expansion ?
Over the pond , of course .
Rollasole is coming soon to the U.S. to bring relief to our stiletto - wearing partying feet .
Via Coquette
For the first time , 25 - year - old researcher Robert Thomas reveals to Gawker how earlier this year he and Richard Heene drew up a master plan to generate a massive media controversy using a weather balloon .
To get famous , of course .
Thomas spent several months earlier this year working on developing a reality science TV show to pitch to networks — the " show , " Thomas says , that Falcon was referring to when he told CNN " We did it for the show . "
Among the ideas that Heene , Thomas and two others came up with for their reality TV proposal — and one that he says most intrigued Heene — involved a weather balloon modified to look like a UFO which they would launch in an attempt to drum up media interest in both the Heene family and the series he was desperate to get on the air .
Still , Thomas never imagined that Heene would involve his six - year - old son in what he is certain was a " global media hoax " to further Richard Heene 's own celebrity .
Thomas ' story of his time with Heene , based on an interview with Ryan Tate , follows below .
It 's a fascinating account and after he publicly offered to sell his story , we paid him for it .
I came to Fort Collins for school — Colorado State University .
I was a Web entrepreneur , starting a few small companies that evolved into a larger scale project called Extropedia.org , an open source online encyclopedia for advancing humanity through technology and science .
Doing research for the project on Google and YouTube , I stumbled upon Richard Heene and his video series Psyience Detectives .
I was surprised to find this potential collaborator in the small city of Fort Collins .
Since a very young age , I 've been fascinated with electromagnetics , applied physics and how technologies developed out of those concepts could that change the world .
Richard was studying basically the same thing .
He asserted , for example , that tornadoes and hurricanes are not a result of changes in pressure but of magnetic polarity changes within the Earth .
I sent him an email in March , talking about Extropedia , a web site I founed and hope to re-launch soon .
( Click here to read some of Thomas ' email exchanges with the Heene family ) .
Things progressed .
Soon I was dropping in unannounced , having dinner .
I 'd bring various patents from the 50s and 60s that showcased technologies far more advanced than what we use today , and we discussed why they were n't being used .
That was when Richard first started telling me about his conspiracy theories — which would eventually reveal themselves to be both extreme and paranoid .
Hunger for Stardom
There was something else at work , though .
Oddly enough , Richard 's sampling of stardom from being on Wife Swap — twice — gave him a sense of seniority in our scientific conversations .
They became less and less about what I had to contribute and more and more about what Richard wanted .
And he wanted nothing more than to get another reality TV series .
Richard had an ongoing dialog with someone at ABC who helped produce Wife Swap .
Richard was pitching something along the lines of " MythBusters - meets - mad scientist . "
There would be these esoteric abstract experiments attempting to prove or disprove various theories .
My job was to help him prepare a formal proposal .
For each of 52 weekly episodes , to explain specifically what the subject would be , and why .
( See the full proposal here . )
As the days progressed I became basically a stenographer .
Richard was very hyperactive , and I would type out his ideas as quickly as I could .
It was five hours of us brainstorming , or really Richard pouring his ideas out , then an additional ten hours of me taking his thoughts , cleaning them up , and making them linear and easier to understand .
I would hyperlink the various scientific theories he mentioned for the people at ABC .
I was to be paid $ 15 per hour , per a verbal agreement .
More crucially , if and when and the reality series and was picked up by ABC , I would be one of his lead research assistants on the show .
I was very receptive to the idea of filtering esoteric science for the general population .
A show would allow us to take the TV network 's money and use it to fund real experimentation , to buy equipment unavailable to me as a student and an entrepreneur .
We could experiment with electromagetics , crystal formation and new types of materials .
Richard , on the other hand , was often driven by ego and fame .
He was all about controversy , hoping to whip up something significant enough to eliminate our reality TV competitors .
He wanted episodes that would shock people and maximize his exposure .
And he'd been trying for months .
On several occasions , he sat down and told me he'd do whatever it took to make it happen — to win .
He eventually resorted to extreme measures .
The UFO Idea ( And the End of the World As We Know It in 2012 )
One night , when Richard and I were sitting and talking , he brought up Wife Swap , and specifically a confrontation he had with a woman on the show who claimed to be a psychic .
They very much disliked one other .
Richard said , " Well , think about it .
We were the 100th episode of Wife Swap .
And why are we the most recognized Wife Swap family and episode ?
It 's because of the controversy .
I do n't care what people say about me as a person , but the fact of the matter is that they know who I am . "
And then we delved into the area of UFOs .
I was reading a book on witness reports of Roswell at the time , just out of curiousity —
I 've never concluded whether it really took place or was an elaborate hoax .
And Richard said , " how much do you want to bet we could facilitate some sort of a media stunt that would be equally profound as Roswell , and we could do so with nothing more than a weather balloon and some controversy ? "
( See item 16 here . )
Can we attract UFO 's with a homemade flying saucer ?
We will modify a weather balloon , so that it resembles a UFO and will electrically charge the skin of the craft ( Biefield - Brown Effect ) .
We will capture the footage on film , and will utilize the media as a means with which to make our presence known to the masses .
This will not only provide us with incredible footage , but will also generate a tremendous amount of controversy among the public , as well as publicity within the mainstream media .
This will be the most significant UFO - related news event to take place since the Roswell Crash of 1947 , and the result will be a dramatic increase in local and national awareness about The Heene Family , our Reality Series , as well as the UFO Phenomenon in general .
I clearly remember Richard telling me that , if we accomplish this , it would be the most controversial and widespread UFO news story since Roswell in 1947 .
( See audio at top of post . )
But he was motivated by theories I thought were far - fetched .
Like Reptilians — the idea there are alien beings that walk among us and are shape shifters , able to resemble human beings and running the upper echelon of our government .
Somehow a secret government has covered all this up since the U.S. was established , and the only way to get the truth out there was to use the mainstream media to raise Richard to a status of celebrity , so he could communicate with the masses .
As the weeks progressed , his theories got more and more extreme and paranoid .
A lot of it surrounded 2012 , and the possibility of there being an apocalyptic moment .
Richard likes to talk a lot about the possibility of the Sun erupting in a large - scale solar flare that wipes out the Earth .
It got to the point where he was really pressing me , saying we 're running out of time , we 're running out of time , the end of the world is coming .
And we have to take necessary precautions to make sure that we 're not among the majority that 's going to be killed .
It got to the point where I was just nodding my head and going along with what he said , because it was easier than trying to debate with him .
( See audio at bottom of post . )
Falcon 's Fishy Flight Incident
When my friends called me about the whole balloon episode I was working .
I had just moved to a new place and did n't have my television set up .
I probably would never even have heard about this , except that a good friend of mine remembered me telling him about Richard several months ago .
He told me , " Rob , you need to turn on the tv immediately !
That Richard guy you worked with just pulled a massive publicity stunt ! "
Richard 's story does n't add up .
He is saying he thought Falcon was in the balloon , and that Falcon ran and hid as a result of Richard yelling at him .
I 've spent a lot of time with them , and Falcon is , first of all , not afraid of his father .
I 've never once seen Richard 's children afraid of him — and I 've definitely never seen Falcon go hide .
He was one of the most social of the three children .
Secondly , Falcon supposedly hid in that attic in the garage .
I 've spent a lot of time in his garage , which has a drill press and various welding tools .
It 's unorganized and chaotic .
There 's really not so much an attic as some support beams connected with plywood .
Being an adult of average height , I could n't get up into the attic if I 'd wanted to , so I do n't know how a six - year - old child could have gotten up there .
There 's not an easy way to access that overhang .
Maybe if I 'd lifted that child up into the attic , he might have been able to rest up there , but not comfortably .
My doubts and concerns about that story were verified when Falcon 's parents asked him on CNN , " why did n't you come out ? "
And Falcon said , " you guys said we did this for the show . "
Lights went off in my head .
Bells were ringing ; whistles were whistling .
I said , " Wow , Richard is using his children as pawns to facilitate a global media hoax that 's going to give him enough publicity to temporarily attract A - list celebrity status and hopefully attract a network . "
The Price of Desperation
Desperate times call for desperate measures , and I think in this case the desperation was too much for Richard to bear .
Richard 's construction business was n't doing too well .
It 's hard to find people interested in spending money on the aesthetics of their home when they 're worried about their mortgage .
A lot of the work I did with the Heene family related to passing out fliers , putting them on people 's front doors .
The fliers advertised a roofing business and a general handyman business .
As the months progressed , Richard 's paranoia increased exponentially and my paycheck decreased exponentially .
The work I put in for the ABC proposal was never compensated .
Richard implied he did n't have the money to pay me .
But he would always reassure me , " It 's all going to pay off in the end . "
But , in " the end , " Richard did n't think about the implications of his behavior .
He certainly did n't consider the people that were praying for his child , and the hundreds , maybe thousands of people that were inconvenienced in pursuit of this balloon .
The thousands of dollars of taxpayer money spent on things that were n't necessary .
Bluntly , I think Richard 's ego blinds him to his brilliance .
The only thing inhibiting him from progressing is a steadfast determination to become famous and live a Hollywood lifestyle .
Someone needs to slap him in the face and say , " Wake up !
This is not what 's important . "
He has an amazing family that has already been subject to a tremendous amount of criticism .
I especially feel bad for Falcon .
He 's going to be known as Balloon Boy the rest of his life .
That 's not something you want to tell a girl on the first date .
For me , it 's been quite the experience .
I do n't regret any of it .
I learned a lot from Richard .
Not necessarily what I should do but rather what I should not do , in my career path and in my goals .
It allowed me to question , " What do I find of value in the world ? "
And I was led to the conclusion that the only thing that matters to me is my friends and family and loved ones .
Everything else is details .
If the world were going to end tomorrow , like a lot of Richard 's theories on 2012 , who would you go to ?
Would you go to a bunch of investors for some company or a reality show ?
Or would you go to your family and friends ?

added Oscar Wilde Quotes on Journalism [ edit ]
It was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is mightier than the paving - stone , and can be made as offensive as the brickbat .
They at once sought for the journalist , found him , developed him , and made him their industrious and well - paid servant .
It is greatly to be regretted , for both their sakes .
Behind the barricade there may be much that is noble and heroic .
But what is there behind the leading - article but prejudice , stupidity , cant , and twaddle ?
And when these four are joined together they make a terrible force , and constitute the new authority .

In the old days men had the rack .
Now they have the Press .
That is an Improvement certainly .
but still it is very bad , and wrong , and demoralising .
Somebody - was it Burke ?
- called journalism the fourth estate .
That was true at the time , no doubt .
But at the present moment it really is the only estate .
It has eaten up the other three .
The Lords Temporal say nothing , The Lords Spiritual have nothing to say and the House of Commons has nothing to say and says it .

In America , the President reigns for four years , and journalism governs for ever and ever .
Fortunately , in America journalism has carried its authority to the grossest and most brutal extreme .
As a natural consequence it has begun to create a spirit of revolt , people are amused by it , or disgusted by it , according to their temperaments .
but it is no longer the real force it was .
It is not seriously treated .
In England , journalism , except in a few well - known instances , not having been carried to such excesses of brutality , is still a great factor , a remarkable power .
The tyranny that it proposes to exercise over people 's private lives seems to me to be quite extraordinary .

Heavy.com reports :
Heavy.com has confirmed with sources close to the UFC that a welterweight matchup between Renzo Gracie and Matt Hughes is in the works for UFC 109 in February .
Gracie , 42 , last appeared in a February 2007 disqualification victory over Frank Shamrock .
Rumors have circulated over the last month that the legendary Gracie family member has been in negotiations with the UFC .
Both fighters have been approached about the fight , but bout agreements have not been signed .
Now this is matchmaking !
Despite his ranking at # 6 on the USAT / SBN Consensus MMA Rankings , Hughes is done as a serious title contender after two losses to champ Georges St. Pierre and a loss to Thiago Alves .
But he 's still a very marketable attraction and a formidable competitor .
His most famous and lucrative bout was his UFC 60 fight with Royce Gracie .
Renzo Gracie on the other hand , is probably the most respected of the original generation of Gracies that popularized jiu jitsu and MMA in the U.S and Japan in the 1990s .
Unlike his cousins Royce and Rickson , he never developed a reputation for hand - picking his opponents and he faced some of the top fighters of his era : Oleg Taktarov , Maurice Smith , Kazushi Sakuraba , Dan Henderson , Carlos Newton , B.J. Penn , Pat Miletich , and Frank Shamrock .
But his most famous fight would have to be his bout with Luta Livre ace Eugenio Tadeu in 1997 .
That fight ended in a riot that killed the commercial prospects for MMA in Brazil for a decade .
Despite having had a great career in MMA , Renzo has never fought for the UFC .
It 's easy to see why Matt Hughes declined to fight Mike Swick , Josh Koscheck or Jon Fitch when he can make a great deal more money fighting the 42 year old Renzo .

Alex Freyre y José María Di Bello se besan en un bar de Buenos Aires .
REUTERS
El próximo martes día 1 de diciembre Alex Freyre , de 39 años , y José María Di Bello , de 41 , tienen hora en el Registro Civil de Buenos Aires para contraer matrimonio .
Un juez de lo Contencioso Administrativo admitió su recurso , la alcaldía de la ciudad no presentó ninguna reclamación , las asociaciones católicas , que ponen el grito en el cielo , no están en plazo para presentar un nuevo pleito y Alex y José María están a punto de convertirse en el primer matrimonio homosexual de Argentina y de todo América Latina .
Sentados en la terraza del único hotel gay de la capital , en el barrio mas histórico de la ciudad , San Telmo , no ocultan su sorpresa ni su alegría .
Los dos son militantes de la Federación Argentina de Lesbianas , Gays , Bisexuales y Transexuales ( FALGBT ) y todavía temen que , en el último minuto , alguien encuentre la triquiñuela legal para retrasar la ceremonia .
Freyre y Di Bello consideran que la Constitución argentina no habla en ningún lugar del matrimonio como un acto que solo pueden realizar un hombre y una mujer y acudieron al Registro a presentar su solicitud , como ya habían hecho otras cuatro parejas de lesbianas y gays en los últimos meses .
La diferencia es que en esta ocasión , tras la habitual negativa , los dos novios no recurrieron ante la justicia civil , donde las cosas van muy lentas , sino ante un Tribunal de lo Contencioso Administrativo de la ciudad .
Y ahí , una jueza , Gabriela Seijas , dictó el pasado 13 de noviembre una sentencia inesperada : el Registro Civil estaba obligado a celebrar la unión de los dos hombres .
La segunda sorpresa llegó cuando el intendente de la ciudad , Mauricio Macri , dirigente de un partido , PRO , considerado de derechas y liberal , decidió agotar el plazo sin presentar recurso contra esa sentencia .
Para cuando la poderosa Iglesia Católica se dio cuenta , los plazos ya habían pasado .
El Cardenal Beroglio hizo público un comunicado afirmando que la sentencia de Seijas era " absolutamente ilegal " y que el gobierno porteño " faltó gravemente a su deber " y una asociación de abogados católicos se lanzó a estudiar posibles vericuetos legales .
Pero los días van pasando y la cita sigue en pie .
Freyre y Di Bello admiten que el camino habitual habría sido que se aprobara primero una ley que dejara clara la interpretación de la Constitución .
" Un grupo de diputados presentó una proposición de ley , pero las discusiones en el Congreso están completamente estancadas " .
Muchos diputados del partido mayoritario apoyan la iniciativa pero el Gobierno de Cristina Fernández de Kirchner mantiene una actitud ambigua .
" La sentencia de la jueza del Contencioso ayudará a precipitar las cosas " , confía Alex .
" No es la primera vez que en Argentina el poder judicial marca la agenda al Legislativo " .
" Además , la Corte Suprema esta estudiando el caso que presentaron en su día dos lesbianas y estamos muy confiados en que su sentencia sea favorable " , asegura .
¿ Por qué creen que Macri no recurrió la sentencia ?
" Porque ha visto las encuestas que se han hecho en Buenos Aires y sabe que la mayoría cree que tenemos derecho a casarnos y que no basta con el Registro de Parejas que se puso en marcha en 2003 .
Así de simple " , explica José María .
Si el matrimonio de Alex y José María consigue llevarse a cabo , nadie duda de que caerán sobre los tribunales de lo Contencioso de todo el país centenares de nuevos recursos .
" Yo calculo que hay preparados ya unos 500 " , se alegra José María .
" Queremos casarnos porque nos queremos y llevamos juntos desde 2005 , pero también sabemos que esto ya no es solo una cuestión nuestra y de nuestras familias , que nos apoyan , sino que es un golpe contra la homofobia que existe en toda América Latina " , mantiene Alex .
Si los abogados católicos no encuentran la forma de pararlo , el matrimonio de Alex y Jose María será una auténtica fiesta en Buenos Aires , con decenas y decenas de personajes de la política y las artes queriendo firmar como testigos de primer enlace homosexual del continente .
" Queremos dejar constancia de nuestro agradecimiento a España , que abrió el camino .
Esperamos a Pedro Zerolo para que sea también nuestro testigo " .
Alex y José María , que llevan el lazo rojo de la lucha contra el sida y que son portadores de VIH , bromean sobre la filípica sobre valores que les ha dedicado la Iglesia Católica argentina : " Deberían hacer como mi padre , que es conservador y quiere que me case " .
AT&T has announced an official change in a policy which has frustrated iPhone users ever since the handset got a 3G data connection .
Previously , if you wanted to use Skype or another Voice over IP application to make free calls , you had to do it over Wi-Fi.
AT&T would n’t let you use the 3G data connection at all .
Now , in a filing to the FCC , AT&T has relented , and iPhone owners will be able to make calls without ever using the phone part of the iPhone again :
[ …]
We also stated that we were taking a fresh look at the issue and would promptly notify the Commission of any such change in our policies .
AT&T has completed its review of the matter and today we informed Apple that , effective immediately , AT&T consents to Apple enabling third - party VoIP applications for the iPhone that use our wireless network , including our 2G and 3G capabilities .
Aside from being great news for Skype and Vonage users , this is an interesting development .
The general thought has been that AT&T did n’t want always - available VoIP because it would eat into its core business as a telephone company .
The well known 3G congestion on AT&T ’s network has also been suspected .
This has all been upturned , for voice communications at least .
The new policy is limited to VoIP .
Speaking to Ars Technica , AT&T said that it would still not be allowing video streaming or other high - bandwidth applications over 3G , including the currently gelded SlingPlayer .
One day we may see it , but the Death Star moves slowly .
For full coverage of the business implications of this reversal , see AT&T Relents , Opens iPhone to Skype , VoIP on our sister blog , Epicenter .

Hillary Clinton gives Obama ’s Middle East game away
5 November 2009
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has spent the past days trying to limit the damage from her praise of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu for making “ unprecedented ” concessions to the Palestinians by offering to “ limit ” settlement construction on the West Bank .
Clinton made her remarks after meeting Palestinian Authority ( PA ) President Mahmoud Abbas in Abu Dhabi , where he reiterated his refusal to restart talks unless Israel freezes all settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
After travelling to Jerusalem to meet Netanyahu , Clinton demanded that the Palestinians resume negotiations and denied that an end to settlement construction had ever been a precondition for talks .
“ There has never been a precondition .
It 's always been an issue within the negotiations , ” she said .
Netanyahu was delighted , responding that demands for a full Israeli settlement freeze were “ being used as a pretext … as an obstacle that prevents the re-establishment of negotiations . ”
The Palestinians should “ get a grip , ” he added .
Clinton ’s endorsement of Netanyahu ’s supposed concessions flies in the face of numerous public declarations by President Barack Obama .
In doing so , she has provided an unvarnished insight into Washington ’s real intentions and priorities .
An end to settlement construction was included in the “ Road Map ” drawn up by the US , the European Union , Russia and the United Nations in 2002 and has remained the formal US position ever since .
The Road Map also states that the issue of East Jerusalem , which the Palestinians want as their capital , will be determined in the final phase of negotiations .
Netanyahu ’s offer of a “ restraint ” on settlement activity excludes East Jerusalem .
Obama came to the White House promising to bring about a negotiated settlement creating a Palestinian state , pledging in this way to rebuild the reputation of the US in the aftermath of the Iraq war .
In a major policy speech in Cairo in June , he promised to “ personally pursue ” the realization of a Palestinian state and stressed that “ it is time for these settlements to stop . ”
Netanyahu has treated such public pronouncements with contempt , confident that the US relies on Israel as a regional enforcer and that its professions of even - handedness are for public consumption only .
On September 4 , he announced a massive program of housing construction involving a total of 3,500 units on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem .
Obama made ritual statements of opposition , but by the time he met with Netanyahu and Abbas in New York on September 22 , this stance was abandoned .
He instead praised Netanyahu for having “ discussed important steps to restrain settlement activity ” [ emphasis added ] and insisted that both leaders show a “ sense of compromise . ”
US envoy George Mitchell followed Obama ’s statement by telling the Jerusalem Post , “ We are not identifying any issue as being a precondition or an impediment to negotiation . ”
A settlement freeze was merely one of several US “ requests . ”
Clinton ’s speech only echoed the positions previously expressed by Mitchell and indicated by Obama .
But she has nevertheless been forced to make a humiliating public retraction .
At a regional forum in Morocco Monday , where she met with various Arab leaders , she said that Netanyahu ’s offer to limit settlements “ falls far short ” of a settlement freeze and that “ successive American administrations of both parties have opposed Israel 's settlement policy . ”
Speaking to Al Jazeera , she added that Obama had been “ absolutely clear ” on wanting a “ halt to all settlement activity , ” and “ perhaps those of us who work with him and for him could have been clearer in communicating that that is his policy . ”
In Cairo Wednesday , Clinton stated that Washington does not accept the legitimacy of the West Bank settlements and wants to see construction halted “ forever . ”
Her extraordinary volte face has been necessitated by the anger generated in the Occupied Territories and throughout the Middle East by her fawning before Netanyahu .
Tensions in the Palestinian Authority are already explosive , with Israel ’s beginning of various settlement projects accompanied by the demolition of numerous Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem .
There has been a series of protests , riots and violent confrontations between Palestinian youth and Israeli police in the compound surrounding the al - Aqsa Mosque .
Under these conditions , Abbas could have been delivered a fatal political blow by Clinton .
He is already despised as a Western stooge , particularly after last month , when he initially agreed to a request from Obama not to support a UN report accusing Israel of war crimes in its 22 - day assault on Gaza last December and January .
Commenting on Clinton ’s remarks , PA Foreign Minister Riad Malki warned , “ We should not put the credibility and the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority again under jeopardy . …
They started accusing my president and the Palestinian leadership of treason [ and ] of selling the suffering of the Palestinian people in exchange of one item and another . ”
Similar concerns were reflected throughout the Middle East .
Amre Moussa , secretary - general of the Arab League , said , “ I am telling you that all of us , including Saudi Arabia , including Egypt , are deeply disappointed .
…
Failure is in the atmosphere . ”
Clinton ’s back - pedaling is a desperate effort to restore the illusion that the US under Obama will act as an honest broker between Israel and the Palestinians .
But this pretense , which is critical to the stability , if not survival , of the venal Arab bourgeois regimes in the region , has been shattered and cannot be restored .
The claim that Obama ’s presidency marks a new era for the Middle East has been utilized from the start for the basest purposes .
By posing as a friend of the Palestinians , Obama has attempted to make it easier for the despots in Cairo , Riyadh , Tripoli , et al. , to line up behind the US in its ongoing threats against Iran , which are aimed at consolidating US hegemony over the region .
Clinton was in Morocco primarily to engage in discussions with the Arab leaders over supporting US threats against Tehran — hence the need for her public recantation .
The Wall Street Journal noted that Arab leaders have warned many times that their governments “ could be attacked by their publics for conspiring with Israel against another Muslim nation without getting anything in return . ”
Even as these sordid discussions are taking place , the US is engaged in joint military maneuvers with Israel , Operation Juniper - Cobra , involving 2,000 personnel and testing sophisticated long - range radar and Patriot anti-missile devices .
Commander Carl Meuser of the US Navy destroyer Higgins told the press , “ We ’re here for some very specific reasons , some specific threats that the Israelis are interested in , that we ’re interested in . ”
The clear intention is to prepare a possible Israeli strike on Iran ’s nuclear facilities , while guarding against any possible reprisal .
This is the essential content of US policy in the Middle East .
Its exposure will hasten the day when the Arab regimes will indeed be attacked by “ their publics . ”

The Leonid Meteor Shower can be viewed from November 13 - 20 , 2009 but the peak will be early tomorrow morning , November 17 , 2009 .
The most activity will occur and best hours to view the Leonid Meteor Shower will be after 1:30 am EST and before sunrise .
This year , the view may be even better because the moon will not be visible from Earth ( it will be darker ) and will be in a new moon phase during the peak , and the meteors should be easier to see .
According to NASA , every hour 20 - 30 meteors should be visible during the peak time ( 1:30 am EST until dawn ) .
Asia should be able to see the most activity at 200-300 meteors per hour NASA has stated , but other astronomers have predicted that it could be as high as 500 an hour during the peak .

The professionals do n't think it 's going to be a storm , which would have to be over 1,000 ( meteors ) per hour , but still a 100 an hour is certainly possible , " Kirkwood said .
That is the case generally speaking , but in North America , this MSNBC story suggests we 'll see more like a dozen an hour .

( CNN ) --
In what may prove one of the biggest breakthroughs against Islamist terrorism since 9/11 , the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group ( LIFG ) , a militant Libyan Jihadist group , once allied with Osama bin Laden and with close personal ties to al Qaeda 's senior leadership , is publicly repudiating al Qaeda 's ideology .
Many expect the breakthrough talks to have an impact far beyond Libya .
The LIFG 's disavowal of the use of violence to achieve political ends , its criticism of attacks in the West and its clear - cut ruling that the killing of civilians is never legitimate from an Islamic point of view , amount to a stunning rebuke of Bin Laden 's brand of Jihad , from former allies with significant credibility amongst Jihadists worldwide .
The respect with which the LIFG is held in Jihadist circles will likely hurt al Qaeda 's recruiting efforts in Libya and further afield .
" If someone from the government starts talking [ about ] how bad is that terrorist activities it will not be received in the same way as when it comes from the leaders of the terrorist group because [ they ] have more credibility , " Saif al Islam Gadhafi told CNN .
Gadhafi was in no doubt about the significance of the breakthrough : " It 's big news .
It 's a big thing ... especially in the Middle East and North Africa for sure . "
Noman Benotman , a key intermediary in the talks , told CNN that the LIFG 's revisions will be " a very big shock " to al Qaeda .
Libyan officials hope that the revisions document will have an impact in Algeria in particular .
In the last two years Libyan security services have grown increasingly concerned about the rising number of attacks launched across the region by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) , al Qaeda 's North African affiliate .
They have also grown concerned about the number of Libyans traveling across to Algeria to join the group .
Over the last months LIFG revisions have been serialized in leading newspapers in Algeria and disseminated by the government to militants across the country .
Libyan sources told CNN that , while it is still early days , the document may already have made an impact in Algeria because since the revisions were published attacks are down .
" We have to prevent those people from killing Muslims and Arabs and innocent people in Libya and Algeria and the best thing is that to let those people who led the terrorist activities in the past to show up and speak and talk about their experience and this is the best weapon against terrorism in our world , " Gadhafi told CNN .
The impact these revisions will have will likely depend on how they are viewed among the radical - leaning Muslims al Qaeda is targeting for recruitment .
Several hard - line Jihadist critics have stated that the LIFG only wrote the revisions because it was coerced to do so by the Libyan security services inside prison .
But the LIFG 's leaders insist the document is genuine .
So too does Gadhafi : " We do n't dictate anything on them and we are not telling them you have to write this or say this no , no , no .
Not at all otherwise it would be a fake game , like everything was authentic it should be real and sincere otherwise it will be just a game .
Nobody can impose anything on them , " he told CNN .
When we spent time inside Abu Salim prison in early September we were told by several mid-ranking members of the LIFG that the revisions were genuine .
They told us that that being in prison meant that they could not speak completely freely , but that the revisions were the result of a genuine rethink by the group .
" Iraq had a big influence on us , " one of them told us , referring to al Qaeda in Iraq 's increasingly barbaric campaign of violence there .
The LIFG 's rethink has been strengthened by the fact that their document has been endorsed by a half dozen leading Islamic clerics from around the Middle East , including Yusuf al Qaradawi , a highly influential Egyptian cleric based in Qatar who threw his weight behind the Libyan reconciliation process in a live - televised Friday sermon last month .
The revisions may resonate all the more because they are just the latest critique of al Qaeda from within the Jihadist movement .
In recent years Jihadist leaders and groups in Iraq , Egypt , Saudi Arabia have also turned against bin Laden 's terrorist network , disturbed by the growing number of Muslim victims of al Qaeda terrorism .
In September 2007 , for example , Salman al Oudah , a cleric once greatly admired by Bin Laden , personally criticized al Qaeda 's leader in a televised address .
In the late summer Al Oudah endorsed the LIFG 's revisions in a statement on his Web site .
Tarek Durman , a mid-level LIFG commander arrested in Jordan in 2000 , told us inside Abu Salim prison , that the revisions " may have an impact on al Qaeda 's new recruits by virtue of the support of the Sheikhs [ and the fact that it is ] the product of a well known group with wide experience ... these people will influence many groups and individuals .
I even expect they may have an impact on al Qaeda . "
Other LIFG prisoners were more sanguine .
" It will have more of an effect on mature Jihadists than young ones , " Lotfi Kreir told CNN .
Benotman , a key broker in the talks , accepts that some young extremists will totally close their ears to the LIFG 's Revisions .
" Sure , some say that this message is coming from old - timers who are not fighting any more .
Sure they use emotional blackmail and say we are dying for you and you say this ?
But what I 'm trying to do is to start to make the young think . "
Al Qaeda has thus far not officially commented on the LIFG revisions .
According to Benotman , Zawahiri , is maintaining a strategic silence , not wanting to draw more attention to the document .
As late as this August Zawahiri heaped praise on LIFG leaders in an online video statement in an apparent attempt to make them think twice about publicly criticizing al Qaeda .
That earlier praise may make it all the more difficult for al Qaeda 's number two to now attack the revisions .
For al Qaeda the revisions have a sting in the tail because several of its top leaders operating out of the Afghan - Pakistan border region are former members of the LIFG .
For Abu Yayha al Libi , currently al Qaeda 's chief propagandist , the rebuke from the LIFG was personal .
One of the LIFG Shura Council members who authored the revisions in Abu Salim prison is none other than Abu Yayha 's [ elder ] brother Abd al Wahab al Qaid .
Tarek Durman , the mid-level LIFG commander told CNN that he expected Abu Yayha to " not react to this event , " something which may weaken al Qaeda 's ability to counter the LIFG 's arguments .
Gadhafi believes that the process he initiated in 2007 should be a model for other countries in the struggle against Islamist violent extremism .
" Even for Americans it is important to engage with al Qaeda , the Taliban .
" Dialogue is more important and more efficient than smart bombs and UEV and bullets .
Dialogue is very important because you can kill a 100 or 1000 terrorists but next month next year they will be replaced by others .
The most important thing is ... how to kill the source of the terror the ideology , the wrong perception , the wrong ideas , the wrong principles . "
Gadhafi added : " We have to prevent those people from killing Muslims and Arabs and innocent people ... and the best thing is to let those people who led the terrorist activities in the past to talk about their experience .
This is the best weapon against terrorism in our world . "
DAKAR
Mamadou Ndiaye wades across his flooded house as his children bail out dirty water bucket by bucket .
He and his family are among many thousands of Senegalese whose homes have been under water for days .
Thirty years ago when Ndiaye moved to Guédiawaye , 26 km outside the city centre of the capital Dakar , the land was dry and cheap .
Now residents of this densely populated suburb endure floods every rainy season .
Recurrent flooding in towns and cities across West Africa is more about people than rains , according to Professor Cheikh Mbow at the Institute of Environmental Sciences at the University of Dakar , who studies the impact of climate variability on urban flood risk .
The region ’s annual flooding reflects explosive population growth in the cities , poverty and poor urban management , he said .
“ The rural poor come and settle on unsuitable land and are then exposed to flooding and other hazards like landslides and industrial risks . ”
West Africa ’s population is expected to grow at an average rate of 2.4 percent from between 2005 and 2010 , and the population is likely to more than double from 293 million in 2008 to 617 million in 2050 , according to the UN Population Fund , most of this growth in urban areas .
Amid this year ’s flooding in West Africa , which the UN says has killed at least 160 people to date , observers repeatedly point to the problem of urban congestion .
In Sierra Leone ’s capital Freetown the main cause of recent flooding was “ indiscriminate building ” in green belt zones [ undeveloped land ] according to national disaster management head , Mary Kamara .
In northern Nigerian cities overpopulation has people building homes on waterways , with natural drainage systems becoming blocked by rubbish , according to Hassan Musa , an environmentalist at Bayero University in the northern city of Kano .
“ In some cases when people build houses on waterways and the government hardly restrains them , this leads to a cycle of flooding , destruction and sometimes death , ” Musa told IRIN .
We live in atrocious conditions .
The flooding is a problem the government could solve .
But they have forgotten us .
It is that simple
Dakar : No urban plan
Fifty years ago Dakar consisted of a triangular peninsula surrounded by wetlands , known as “ cap vert . ”
The once - green surroundings are now mostly grey , as a 1970s and 1980s Sahel - wide drought pushed rural dwellers to settle in the flood - prone depressions on the city ’s outskirts in spite of regulations outlawing construction .
“ The State has not really carried out a strong policy to ban occupancy of this unsuitable land , " said Mbow .
Now 95 percent of the Dakar region , which includes the districts of Pikine , Rufisque and Guédiawaye , is covered with buildings and roads that block natural waterways and basins .
Malick Faye , an urban planner at Dakar ’s Regional Council , said the severely flooded neighbourhood of Wakhinane in Guédiawaye – where people have built at the level of the water table – is a good example of the wider problem .
“ The water table used to be very low , but now that the rains have come back the water has returned to its natural level .
So now all you need is 5 mm of rain for it to flood , ” he told IRIN .
While emergency response teams pump water from Dakar ’s flooded neighbourhoods , experts agree that relocating people is the only solution .
“ You can never fight the path of the water , ” said the Mbow .
“ As you pump , the aquifer restores the water level .
You have to take the people out and make sure others will not replace them . ”
New cities
In response to devastating floods in Dakar in 2005 the government launched a housing scheme , ‘ Plan Jaxaay ’ , aiming to relocate flood victims to an area 25 km east of the capital .
The government has built 1,793 two - bedroom houses of a planned 3,000 , as well as three primary schools , a technical college , a nursery school and a police station .
Cité Jaxaay resident Aliou Ba , a retired schoolteacher , is pleased with his new house .
“ I prefer living out in the sticks to living under water in the city , ” he said .
" The only problem is there is no electricity or running water yet . ”
Chimère Diallo , field coordinator of Plan Jaxaay , said relocating 3,000 families is a good start , but it is not enough given the enormous scale of Senegal ’s housing problem .
Some 1.6 million people live in Dakar ’s suburbs , with 10,000 per square kilometre in some areas , according to Mbow .
The relocation task is enormous , said the regional council ’s Faye .
“ If you want to move 2,000 families you must create a new city … with all the services and infrastructure required – electricity , water , drainage systems .
This is an enormous task … .
Plan Jaxaay is a good thing .
But we can not build houses for everyone in a year . ”
Frustration over the lack of services and dire conditions in Dakar ’s suburbs recently boiled over into sreet protests .
Guédiawaye resident Ndiaye said : “ We live in atrocious conditions .
The flooding is a problem the government could solve .
But they have forgotten us .
It is that simple .
We can not count on our politicians .
We can count only on ourselves . ”

REUTERS / Wolfgang Rattay
CHENNAI , India ( Reuters ) - A leading French chess player turned up drunk and dozed off after just 11 moves in an international tournament in Kolkata , losing the round on technical grounds , domestic media reported Friday .
Grandmaster Vladislav Tkachiev arrived for Thursday ’s match against India ’s Praveen Kumar in such an inebriated state that he could hardly sit in his chair and soon fell asleep , resting his head on the table , Hindustan Times newspaper reported .
Indian papers carried pictures of the world number 58 sleeping and the organizers ’ futile attempts to wake his up .
The game was awarded to the Indian on the technical ground of Tkachiev being unable to complete his moves within the stipulated time of an hour and 30 minutes , the paper said .
The player was warned and reprimanded by the organizers afterwards but has been allowed to take part in the remainder of the competition , the paper said .
( CNN ) -- Police say guilt was written all over their faces .
Police received a call Friday night that two men with hooded sweatshirts and painted faces had tried to break into a man 's home in Carroll , Iowa .
When police stopped a vehicle matching the caller 's description blocks away , they were stunned by the men 's disguises .
There were no ski masks or stockings pulled over their heads ; instead , Matthew Allan McNelly , 23 , and Joey Lee Miller , 20 , streaked their faces with permanent black marker .
Carroll Police Chief Cayler told CNN the strange disguises made it easier for his officers .
" We 're very skilled investigators and the black faces gave them right away , " Cayler said jokingly .
" I have to assume the officers were kind of laughing at the time .
I 've never heard of coloring your face with a permanent marker . "
Cayler said police believe one of the alleged burglars targeted the home because he suspected his girlfriend had a relationship with the man who lived there .
" They probably were just not thinking straight and figured we 'll go out and scare the guy or whatever , " Cayler said .
" [ They were ] being dumb and combine that with alcohol and it was the perfect storm . "
Both men were charged with attempted burglary , and McNelly was charged additionally with operating a vehicle while intoxicated .
Lawyers for the two men could not be reached for comment .
Cayler said he 's been fielding calls about the case from news media outlets from all over the country -- mostly because of their funny - looking mug shots .
" I 've been chief here almost 25 years , been with the department 28 ½ years and I 've seen a lot of things that make me laugh and weird things but this was probably the best combination of the two -- strangely weird and hilariously funny all at the same time . "
Kennett , Missouri ( CNN ) --
This much is n't in dispute : Heather Ellis joined a line at a Wal - Mart nearly three years ago .
Whether she cut in line or merely switched checkout lanes to join her cousin is in dispute , and the accounts of what happened next vary greatly .
The debate has divided this economically struggling town of 11,000 along racial lines .
Ellis , then a college student with no criminal history , said some white patrons shoved and hurled racial slurs at her when she switched checkout lines at Wal - Mart in January 2007 .
Store employees refused to give her back her change and called police , she said .
And when she was taken outside to the parking lot , an officer allegedly told her to " Go back to the ghetto . "
Another roughed her up , she said .
Witnesses and police offer a different take : Ellis was belligerent , cutting in line , shoving merchandise belonging to another customer to make way for hers on the conveyor belt , kicking one officer in the shin and splitting another 's lip .
A Dunklin County Circuit Court jury heard from the prosecution and defense as Ellis ' felony trial got under way Wednesday .
Surveillance tapes from the store were shown in court Thursday and released publicly , but the tapes do n't show much of the alleged confrontation .
A camera above the cash register appears to show Ellis ' arm shoving merchandise to the side on the register 's conveyor belt several times .
Employees testified Wednesday that the shoving led to a heated verbal exchange with employees , during which Ellis was loud and profane .
Another camera showed her being led out of the store by police , with her arm in the air .
A third shot from the parking lot shows her being handcuffed and put into a police car .
Ellis appears to kick backward at police but her defense maintains she did so after police assaulted her .
Ellis , who is charged with assaulting police officers , resisting arrest and disturbing the peace , could face 15 years in prison if convicted .
Officials with the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference said the case is indicative of racial bias in the town , where 13 percent of the population is African - American .
Kennett , the hometown of singer Sheryl Crow , is in the southeastern corner of Missouri and has struggled economically .
Black and Hispanic residents have long complained about the predominantly white Police Department profiling them during traffic stops .
When Ellis ' supporters held a peaceful rally in June , officers found business cards scattered along the route that read : " You have been paid a social visit by the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan .
The next visit will not be social . "
During another rally Monday , a handful of opponents stood on the sidelines waving Confederate flags .
" I know it 's racism .
It 's blatant , overt racism , " said Ellis ' father , the Rev. Nathaniel Ellis .
Her attorney , however , has not brought up race as a contributing factor in the case .
" I 'm not going to go there , " Scott Rosenblum said .
" It 's up to the prosecutor to decide to prosecute the case that the police investigate and present to them . "
At the time of the incident , Ellis was a pre-med student at Xavier University in New Orleans , Louisiana .
She was home visiting relatives when she made a trip to Wal - Mart on January 6 , 2007 , to pick up some items for her mother .
Ellis ' 15 - year - old cousin was with her .
After selecting their items , the two stood in different checkout lines .
Noticing that her cousin's line was moving faster , Ellis cut in next to him , angering other customers .
In the arguments that followed , Ellis yelled so loudly that employees in the back of the store could hear her , prosecutor Morley Swingle said during his opening statements Wednesday .
Ellis " went ballistic in a profane tirade , " he said .
When police arrived to remove her from the store , Ellis confronted them with the " worst kind of cussing imaginable , " Swingle said .
Al Fischer , the lead officer at the scene , testified on Thursday that Ellis spewed invective at the officers as he repeatedly asked her to calm down .
" If you try to arrest me , I 'll kick your ( expletive ) ass , " he quoted her as saying .
That 's when he told her that she was under arrest for threatening an officer .
He said Ellis began to fight as he grabbed her from behind to handcuff her , kicking and swinging .
Two other officers assisted him , Fischer said , as they took Ellis into custody as she struggled .
She repeatedly kicked one officer in the shin and another in the face , police said .
" I ain't going nowhere until I get my ( expletive ) change back , " Ellis told officers , according to a police incident report .
" She resisted arrest , kicked her feet and stiffened her body " when officers tried to put her in the police cruiser , the report said .
Under cross-examination , Fischer admitted he did not document his own injuries from the scuffle and acknowledged that he went against police protocol .
Customer Teresa Kinder testified that Ellis shoved her items back on the checkout conveyor belt to make room for her own .
When Kinder protested , Ellis allegedly threatened her with violence .
Defense attorney Rosenblum described the incident as an unjustified assault on his client .
When Ellis tried to seek help from the cashier and a store manager during the arguments , " her voice was not heard , " he said .
Store employees treated Ellis with indifference , Rosenblum said , and officers taunted her by telling her to " go back to the ghetto . "
Ellis told the ACLU that officers addressed her " with a series of racial remarks that included the N - word and everything you can imagine . "
She said the Wal - Mart cashier asked for her ID card , even though she was paying in cash , and refused to give back her change .
" When you read the probable cause affidavit here , quite frankly , it does sound like she 's out of control , " legal analyst Lisa Bloom said .
" There are five police officers .
They 're all saying the same thing .
There are at least four other witnesses within the Wal - Mart store .
They 're all saying the same thing .
" She has a completely different version of the facts , " Bloom added .
" She feels that she was treated differently ; it was on account of her race .
It 's in a racially charged community .
And these charges are being blown out of proportion , so she 's facing 15 years behind bars for an incident that began with cutting in line .
... I think there 's good reason to think there are some racial allegations here . "
Now a 24 - year - old schoolteacher , Ellis is engaged to a state trooper .
She has not spoken publicly about her case , saying she has been instructed not to do so .
" I wish I could , but I can't , " she said leaving the courtroom Wednesday .
Two years ago , prosecutors offered a plea deal under which she would have received probation if she dropped her complaint against the police .
" She decided not to sign it , because she was taught to never admit guilt when you 're innocent , " her father said .
" We plan to fight it as we have .
We 're marching on . "
This report incorporates comments and information that aired on CNN's " Anderson Cooper 360° " and HLN's " Issues With Jane Velez - Mitchell . "
CNN 's Chuck Hadad contributed to this report .
Detailed accounts from participants in the recent Copenhagen climate summit are still coming in , but a few things are already quite clear , even as countries step up the blame game in response to the summit ’s disappointing conclusion .
First , the 2 1/2 pages of diplomatic blather that the participating countries ultimately consented to " take note " of are completely self - contradictory , and commit no one to any specific actions to address the global climate crisis .
There is n’t even a plan for moving UN - level negotiations forward .
Friends of the Earth correctly described it as a " sham agreement , " British columnist George Monbiot called it an exercise in " saving face , " and former neoliberal shock doctor - turned - environmentalist Jeffrey Sachs termed it a farce .
Long - time UN observer Martin Khor has pointed out that for a UN body to " take note " of a document means that not only was it not formally adopted , but it was not even " welcomed , " a common UN practice .
Second , the global divide between rich and poor has never been clearer , and those countries where people are already experiencing the droughts , floods , and the melting of glaciers that provide a vital source of freshwater expect to find themselves in increasingly desperate straits as the full effects of climate disruptions begin to emerge .
Not to mention the small island nations that face near - certain annihilation as melting ice sheets bring rising seas , along with infiltrations of seawater into their scarce fresh water supplies .
Especially despicable was the changing role of the governments of the rapidly developing " BASIC " countries ( Brazil , South Africa , India and China ) , who claim to speak for the poor – in their own countries and around the world – when it is convenient , but mainly seek to protect the expanding riches of their own well - entrenched elites .
Third , even the meager and contradictory progress of the past 17 years of global climate talks is now at risk , as is the flawed but relatively open and inclusive UN process .
After the 2007 climate summit in Bali , Indonesia , the Bush administration tried to initiate an alternate track of negotiations on climate policy that involved only a select handful of the more compliant countries .
That strategy failed , partly because its figurehead was George Bush .
Now that the Obama administration has adopted essentially the same approach , with the full collaboration of the " BASICs , " the utterly substanceless " Copenhagen Accord " can be seen as this coercive strategy ’s first diplomatic success .
As I wrote just as the Copenhagen meeting was getting underway ( see my " Repackaging Copenhagen , " posted in early December ) , the US had planned for some months to attempt to replace the quaint notion of a comprehensive global climate agreement with a patchwork of informal , individual country commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and undertake other appropriate measures .
If the Copenhagen document means anything at all , it establishes that process as a new global norm for implementing climate policy .
Nothing is binding , and everything is voluntary , only to be " assessed " informally after another five years have passed .
( Pages 4 and 5 of the " accord " actually consist of a pair of high school - caliber charts where countries are free to simply write in their voluntary emissions targets and other mitigation actions , nominally by the end of January . )
The document was hammered out in a back room , WTO - style .
It hedges all the important issues , and appends loopholes and contradictions to every substantive point that it pretends to make .
While discussions will nominally continue under the two UN negotiating tracks established 2 years ago in Bali , the " accord " provides a justification for leading countries in the process - which Bill McKibben has termed the " league of superpolluters , " plus a few wannabes - to continue subverting and undermining those discussions in the name of a more efficient and streamlined process to continue business as usual for the benefit of the world ’s elites .
As some have pointed out , it could have been worse .
A useless non-agreement may be better than a coercive agreement that entrenches insufficient targets and destructive policy measures , such as expanding carbon markets .
But the potential loss of an accountable UN process could prove to be an even worse outcome than that .
The US , of course , has always tried to undermine the United Nations when it could n’t overtly control it , but replacing the processes established under the 1992 UN climate convention with a cash - for - compliance , anything - goes circus that more closely mirrors the World Trade Organization ’s discredited mechanisms does n’t bode at all well for the future .
Did anything positive happen in Copenhagen ?
For climate justice activists around the world , Copenhagen may have been a long - sought Seattle moment .
It was a unique opportunity for activists and NGO representatives from around the world to gather , forge personal ties , and begin raising the global profile of an essential climate justice agenda .
Independent journalists , most notably Amy Goodman ’s Democracy Now team , helped amplify the voices best able to explain how climate disruptions are no longer an abstract scientific issue , but one that is already impacting the lives of those least able to cope .
Even the mainstream US press featured some notable stories of people around the world who are struggling to live with the effects of climate chaos .
More than ever before , people are coming to understand that the only meaningful solution to the climate crisis is to " leave the oil in the soil , the coal in the hole , and the tar sands in the land , " following the slogan raised by campaigners against oil drilling in Ecuador ’s endangered Yasuni National Park .
It was also a pivotal moment for the ALBA countries of Latin America - most notably Bolivia , Nicaragua , and Venezuela - which continued to the very end to stand up to intimidation from the US and other powerful countries , and refused to buckle under last - minute pressure to approve the vapid and destructive " Copenhagen Accord " as an agreement of the assembled nations .
This is in stark contrast to the role of the European Union , which once stood for a strong worldwide agreement on greenhouse gas emissions , but has now fallen in line with the disruptive strategies of the US .
Another positive income is that there was no new bone thrown to the world ’s financial elites , who were banking on a Copenhagen agreement to help inflate their artificial market in tradable carbon allowances .
Carbon prices in Europe have begun to decline , which may help prevent the enshrinement of carbon markets ( so - called " cap and trade " ) as the primary instrument of climate policy in the United States .
So now the struggle returns to the national and local levels , where people may be best able to create examples of just and effective ways to address the climate crisis .
There is no shortage of positive , forward - looking approaches to reducing excess consumption and furthering the development of alternative energy sources , especially ones that can be democratically controlled by communities and not corporations .
But the power of positive examples is far from sufficient to address the crucial problem of time .
A few years ago , climate experts shocked the world by saying we had less than ten years to reverse course and do something to prevent irreversible tipping points in the global climate system .
The disastrous outcome of the Copenhagen conference makes it harder than ever to feel confident that it is n’t too late .

Chansa Kabwela believes the case is political
The news editor of Zambia 's largest independent newspaper has gone on trial accused of distributing obscene images .
Chansa Kabwela sent two photographs of a woman giving birth without medical help to the country 's vice - president , health minister and rights groups .
She says she was highlighting issues in the healthcare system and calling for an end to a nurses ' strike .
But President Rupiah Banda called the pictures pornographic and demanded a police investigation .
The Post 's news editor Ms Kabwela did not publish the controversial photographs , but sent copies to a number of prominent people and women 's rights groups , along with a letter calling for the strike to be brought to an end .
The defence is arguing that the case rests on the definition of obscenity and so witnesses should have to describe what counts as obscene and arousing .
The first prosecution witness , the senior private secretary to the vice - president who opened the Post 's letter , was roundly embarrassed by having to describe arousal .
Critics of the government
The pictures are graphic .
They show a woman in the process of giving birth to a baby in the breech position - when the baby 's legs come out first .
Its shoulders , legs and arms are visible , but the head has not yet been delivered .
The photos were apparently taken in the grounds of Lusaka 's main hospital .
The nurses were on strike and the woman had been turned away from two clinics .
By the time doctors operated , the baby had suffocated .
Ms Kabwela says she was given the photographs by the woman 's relatives .
President Banda expressed his outrage at a news conference , calling the photographs pornographic .
Pornography is illegal in Zambia and Ms Kabwela was arrested soon afterwards and charged with distributing obscene material with intent to corrupt public morals .
She faces five years in jail .
In her view , and in the view of campaigners for press freedom , the case is political .
The Post - Zambia 's most popular newspaper - has relentlessly pursued the government with allegations of corruption and the president has made no secret of his dislike of the paper .
“ She came across as a lovely young girl , and I ’m sure it was n’t a nice feeling for the judge to send someone like this to prison  but someone is dead because of a text message , ” said Bill Sykes , the officer who responded to the crash and led the subsequent investigation .
But many young people , among them the dead woman ’s own siblings and friends , disagreed , sympathizing also with Phillipa Curtis .
“ I think Phillipa ’s sentence was long enough , as she seemed like such a normal girl , ” said Gemma Pancoust , the victim ’s cousin and close friend , with whom she liked to sing karaoke to Dolly Parton ’s “ 9 to 5 . ” “ Until Tory ’s death I texted while driving , as have most people .
I do n’t think she realized the danger she was causing . ”
Indeed , the victim herself had sent a text message and talked on her cellphone ( using the speaker function ) while driving before her car broke down , according to the testimony of a friend with whom she had the 20 - minute phone conversation .
It is illegal in Britain to use a hand - held phone while driving , and drivers using hands - free phones may be fined if they are deemed not in control of the vehicle .
Although most European countries and a minority of American states now ban the use of hand - held cellphones while driving , Britain has become one of the more aggressive countries in attacking the problem , according to Ellen Townsend , policy director for the European Transit Safety Council , which advises the European Commission .
Britain ’s new guidelines state that using a hand - held phone when causing a death will “ always make the offense more serious ” in terms of punishment and lead to prison time .
Texting is given special treatment .
Ms. Curtis was found guilty and sent to prison even though she was not texting at the time of the accident , because the new guidelines regard “ reading or composing text messages over a period of time ” as “ a gross avoidable distraction . ”
Its effect , British judges have ruled , may go beyond the moment of composing a message .
Such behavior is categorized the same as driving while drunk or high on drugs , as well as racing another driver .
Image Prosecutors said the driver of the other car was distracted by texting .
On the night of Nov. 20 , 2007 , the victim , Ms. McBryde , was on her way to visit a friend when she got a flat tire at night on the highway .
Sergei Fedorov : “ No hard feelings against Bowman .
Now ” ( Photo © Elsa / Getty Images )
Former Detroit Red Wing Sergei Fedorov sit down for an interview with KHL magazine “ Hot Ice ” , where he talked about his escape in the United States after the USSR collapse and about the adaptation towards a new way of live .
But the most interesting part was when he talked about his relationship with Scott Bowman .
I understand it now : Scotty Bowman had too many hot potatoes on his hands that he needed to juggle to keep the team successful .
But back then , I think North American coaches still had n’t realized that Russians play every game from the heart , that it ’s not routine .
For years those reproaches were all we heard : “ The Russians have no idea what a playoff is , they have n’t felt the Stanley Cup … ” Nowadays , plenty of people have proved that was n’t the case .
Look at Zhenya Malkin !
If they had let us show what we could do back then the way they ’re letting him in Pittsburgh , there would have been a nuclear revolution in hockey .
Although , then the outflow of Russian hockey players leaving for the NHL would have been even stronger .
So there were pluses and minuses to that underestimation .
And when he asked if he holds a grudge against Scott Bowman , he replied :
There ’s no point holding a grudge for so many years .
You only make yourself worse .
But I really did n’t understand it then .
He also looked to have n’t forget the popular claim made by his former head coach , who said that “ Fedorov has got anything but a big hearth ” .
If he really did say something like that , then that ’s the only reason .
I would n’t have understood it then , of course , but I do now .
Had he tried to say something like that about a Canadian or an American I think they would have just fired him .
But you could say that about a Russian .
Whom do we have to complain to ?
Fedorov also found the time to claim the superiority of the Soviet hockey of old even over the Canadians :

Bruce Springsteen cancels show in Kansas City
Bruce Springsteen cancelled his performance with the E Street Band in Kansas City after the death of Lenny Sullivan , his cousin and assistant road manager .
“ Lenny Sullivan , Bruce ’s cousin and the assistant road manager of the E Street Band for the last ten years , passed away today at the age of 36 , ” announced in a statement on Springsteen ’s website .
“ A warm and sensitive person , he was beloved by Bruce , the Band , the crew , and the entire Thrill Hill family . ”
Sullivan was found dead by the police in his hotel room at the InterContinental Hotel on Monday evening , hours before their scheduled show .
The cause of death was not suspicious according to Kansas City police Capt .
Rich Lockhart , but they are still investigating .
All the tickets for the show will be refunded .
“ Bruce and The Band deeply appreciate the understanding of our Kansas City audience and look forward to returning at the earliest opportunity , ” the statement read .
Westfield has drawn criticism over a Facebook application that may be in breach of the social networking site ’s terms and conditions , despite the two companies collaborating to develop it .
The application updates a user ’s status with a Westfield - branded message to promote its Gift Card .
It requires the user to opt in so that their status is updated to “ All I Want for Christmas is a Westfield Gift Card ” , with extra copy stating that the user has now gone into the draw to win a $ 10,000 gift card .
So far over 200,000 Facebook users have opted into the application and updated their status .
But the promotion has also attracted a backlash from other users , complaining that the promotion is taking over the social networking site as friends ’ status updates that feature the Westfield branding , clutter their screens .

Facebook groups have also been created in opposition to it .
One group , known as If All You Want For Christmas Is A Westfield Gift Card , I Do n’t Want To Know , currently has over 3,300 fans .
Separately , there is concern that the promotion contravenes Facebook ’s own rules .
In section 4.2 in its terms and conditions , it states :
“ In the rules of the promotion , or otherwise , you will not condition entry to the promotion upon taking any action on Facebook , for example , updating a status , posting on a profile or Page , or uploading a photo . ”
The Facebook application is part of a wider campaign , created by M&C Saatchi and its DM and digital operation Mark , to promote its gift card .
The application is the competition component of the campaign which launched on November 1 .
It is being supported by radio , letterbox drops and in - centre point of sale .
The Facebook application was launched on November 24 .
In a statement Westfield said : “ [ The ] Christmas Gift Card promotion on Facebook is a registered promotion .
Westfield worked closely with Facebook to develop the competition and Westfield has legal advice that the promotion does not breach the Spam Act . ”
Facebook declined to comment .
MURDOCH FANS THE FLAMES ….
It seemed , for a while , like the political world was prepared to move beyond the animosity between Fox News and the White House .
Presidential aides seemed to cut back on noticing the Republican network ’s partisan efforts , and Fox News returned to more routine , everyday bashing of Democrats .
Indeed , just 13 days ago , we learned that White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs met personally with Fox News SVP Michael Clemente .
There was talk of a “ truce . ”
It was time to move on .
Or so we thought .
just four days after the reported “ truce , ” Chris Wallace gave Rush Limbaugh a half - hour of airtime on “ Fox News Sunday , ” which the right - wing radio host used to make one ridiculous attack against the president after another .
There was no obvious reason for the interview .
And just a few days after Wallace ’s love - fest with Limbaugh , Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch told Sky News Australia that Glenn Beck ’s infamous anti-Obama tirade —
Beck called the president a “ racist ” with “ a deep - seated hatred for white people or white culture ” — was accurate .
SKY NEWS : The Glenn Beck , who you mentioned , has called Barack Obama a racist and he helped organize a protest against him .
Others on Fox have likened him to Stalin .
Is that defensible ?
MURDOCH : No , no , no , not Stalin , I do n’t think .
I do n’t know who that , not one of our people .
On the racist thing , that caused a grilling .
But he did make a very racist comment .
Ahhh … about , you know , blacks and whites and so on , and which he said in his campaign he would be completely above .
And um , that was something which perhaps should n’t have been said about the President , but if you actually assess what [ Beck ] was talking about , [ Beck ] was right .
A few things .
First , Murdoch may not watch Fox News , but on - air efforts to equate Obama with Stalin are fairly common .
Second , Beck was “ right ” when he called the president a “ racist ” with “ a deep - seated hatred for white people or white culture ” ?
Murdoch is n’t even willing to distance himself from obvious insanity — which just so happens to have displeased 81 advertisers ?
And third , within seven days of a reported “ truce ” between the Republican network and the Democratic White House , this is what we ’re seeing .
I guess the “ truce ” is over ?
A definitive discussion about the best CA legal .223 autoloader
I 've been considering three :
The Ruger Mini -14 with the thumbhole stock .
I like quite a few things about this rifle :
1 : the thumbhole stock feels like a pistol grip when you hold it and there are no fixed - mag restrictions with this particular one .
Apparently this IS illegal without a fixed mag .
So it 's definitely out .
2 : the wide variety of accessories and mods available
3 : If , god forbid , I ever have to defend myself with it , no prosecutor ( if it comes to that ) will have a " scary " looking " assault weapon " to show a jury and make me look like some gun-crazed whack - job .
Cons :
1 : I hear accuracy and reliability are n't all that great
2 : the price for a new one starts well - above 1k .
3 : Mags are expensive .
The Kel - Tec SU - 16
Pros :
1 : It 's cheaper than the mini - 14 by quite a bit .
2 : It 's compatible with AR - 15 mags
3 : from what I hear , the accuracy and reliability are a bit better than the Mini-14
Cons :
1 : it looks " scary " ( scarier than the mini - 14 anyway )
2 : not as many accessories available
and finally ,
The Saiga .223
Pros :
1 : they 're cheap
2 : reliable
3 : Can Take AR mags
Cons :
1 : it 's " scary "
2 : Not too accurate
( Admittedly , I do n't know too much about this rifle )
EDIT : Everyone seems to be pushing for an OLL AR - 15 .
And as this is supposed to be the definitive .223 autoloading thread , I would be remiss to not include them .
So , why do n't you guys start throwing out some suggestions keeping in mind 1 : affordability , 2 : reliability , and 3 : accuracy
EDIT 2 :
So it 's down to two choices on the AR configs for me :
Something like this :
Pros :
1 : the U15 stock , which allows me to use detachable mags .
2 : Accurate
3 : Reliable
Cons :
1 : More expensive than the Saiga or the Kel - Tec
2 : I get no other evil features
3 : It 's **** ing ugly .
( is there any way to remove that stock rod sticking out the back of it ? )
Or this :
Pros :
1 : Dead **** ing Sexy
2 : With a bullet button , I 'm allowed all the evil features I want .
3 : Accurate
4 : Reliable
Cons :
1 : More expensive than the Saiga or the Kel - Tec
2 : I have to use a bullet button ( although this might not be the worst thing ever )
3 : Again , " scary . "
But a lot of the comments so far have put me at ease .
How bad is the bullet button , really ?
Is it that big a pain in the ***?
As of right now , I 'm leaning towards the AR , but please feel free to educate me about the pros and cons of each of these rifles .
Also , if you feel I might be better served by any other options , please let me know .
I will be using this gun primarily for target shooting and home defense .
I seriously doubt I 'll ever go hunting with it ; I already have some bigger caliber bolt - action rifles for that .
( I already own a Mossy 500 , for those of you suggesting I buy a shotgun )
What 's up guys .
After searching the forums for a bit , I could n't find any conversations about what the best .223 auto loaders are for different situations .
I 've been considering three : The Ruger Mini - 14 with the thumbhole stock .

Alfano il bugiardo : Inchieste su Berlusconi solo dopo il 1994
L'ultima bugia del Ministro Alfano : " Nessuno è riuscito a rispondere alla domanda su come mai tutte le inchieste si siano concentrate su Berlusconi dal 1994 in poi . "
( Il giornale 23 novembre 2009 )
Non è vero che nessuno l'ha smentita , o meglio in TV ( visto che la verità in TV non passa ) non è stata fatta passare ma in rete la verità passa e come .
Tanto per ripetere una volta di più , elenco tutti i procedimenti a carico di Berlusconi nati prima della sua discesa in campo , tanto che “ Altri commentatori affermano invece che la fondazione fulminea di un nuovo partito , Forza Italia , sarebbe stata solo un metodo per evitare la bancarotta o addirittura il carcere grazie alle cosiddette leggi ad personam varate dai governi da lui presieduti ( Wikipedia ) ” .
Veniamo ai dettagli :
1979 , Berlusconi riceve una visita della Guardia di finanza negli uffici della Edilnord S.a.S. Intestata a Umberto Previti , il cavaliere afferma di essere solo un consulente esterno addetto alla progettazione di Milano 2 ma in realtà Berlusconi era proprietario unico della Edilnord .
I Finanzieri Massimo Maria Berruti , Salvatore Gallo ( iscritto alla loggia P2 insieme a Berlusconi ) e Alberto Corrado , nonostante riscontrino delle anomalie nei rapporti tra Berlusconi e alcuni misteriosi soci Svizzeri archiviano cosi l'ipsezione .
E ' solo un caso ma Berruti fa carriera , entra a lavorare in Finivest come avvocato viene poi arrestato ( 1985 ) nello scandalo Icomec ( assolto ) torna in cella nel 1994 ( insieme a Corrado ) per il depistaggio dell ' inchiesta sulle tangenti alla Guardia di Finanza .
Oggi è deputato del PDL e condannato in via definitiva a 8 mesi per favoreggiamento .
1987 , Berlusconi a seguito di un articolo di Epoca sulla sua iscrizione alla P2 , querela il giornale : " Non ricordo la data esatta della mia iscrizione alla P2 , ricordo comunque che è di poco anteriore allo scandalo [...]
Non ho mai pagato una quota di iscrizione , né mai mi è stata richiesta " .
I giornalisti , tutti assolti , presentarono a loro volta una controquerela per falsa testimonianza , il 22 luglio 1989 Gabriele Nigro firmò una Sentenza istruttoria di non doversi procedere perché il fatto non costituisce reato .
Sentenza impugnata davanti alla Sezione istruttoria della Corte d'Appello di Venezia che , nel 1990 , dichiara il reato contestato commesso ma estinto per amnistia ( varata pochi mesi prima ) .
1983 , i telefoni di Berlusconi furono messi sotto controllo in un indagine per traffico di droga , indagine poi archiviata .
Il famoso avviso di garanzia ricevuto al seguito del rinvio a giudizio per concorso in corruzione ( la famosa inchiesta alla Guardia di finanza da cui è uscito assolto anche grazie alle dichiarazioni di Mills ) fa riferimento ad indagini iniziate nel 1991 ( Mondadori ) , 1992 ( Mediolanum ) e 1994 ( Tele + ) .
Alfano sembra ripetere come un pappagallo le affermazioni del suo padrone , Berlusconi , infatti , ha più volte ribadito la stessa cosa arrivando addirittura a denunciare i giudici di Milano per “ attentato ad organo istituzionale ” , nelle motivazioni dell ' archiviazione della denuncia si legge : “ Risulta dall 'esame degli atti che , contrariamente a quanto si desume dalle prospettazioni del denunciante , le iniziative giudiziarie [...] avevano preceduto e non seguito la decisione di " scendere in campo ” ( Carlo Bianchetti , Giudice per le udienze preliminari del Tribunale di Brescia 15 maggio 2001 )
Un Ministro di cotanta caratura si dovrebbe vergognare di andare in giro a dire tutto queste falsità .
Nel prossimo post analizzeremo anche le altre affermazioni del Ministro riportate da Il Giornale di famiglia .
Comcast , the 2nd largest cable and Internet provider in the US , has released the details of their new “ network management ” system recently .
The company came under fire last year when it was revealed that they were silently blocking some peer - to - peer network traffic , prompting a rebuke from the US Federal Communications Commission .
While Comcast is no longer targeting specific network protocols , they have essentially imposed a cap on the amount of bandwidth you can use before being throttled .
This is in addition to the maximum of 250 GB of data you are allowed per month before they will warn and then terminate your service for a year .
Subscribers using over 70 % of their allotted bandwidth for 15 minutes , will be “ throttled ” .
Also , if the portion of the Comcast network that you are connected to becomes congested and your traffic is identified as the culprit , you will be “ throttled ” .
In either case , your connection will be “ throttled ” until such time as your bandwidth usage goes below 50 % for at least 15 minutes .
Throttling in practice means network packets get prioritized lower than those of customers that are not throttled .
By default Comcast ’s network traffic is prioritized as “ Priority Best Effort ” , or PBE for short .
When you are throttled , those packets are changed to just “ Best Effort ” prioritization , or BE for short .
What does this mean for gamers ?
If you are anything like me , Thursday evening you do a lot of downloading on the PSN .
Or maybe you like to watch movies or TV shows from the PSN Video Store .
In any case , say that you have a 10 Mbps download speed .
If you are somehow using 7 Mbps of that 10 Mbps connection for more than 15 minutes , the Comcast network is going to start to deprioritize your traffic .
With any luck , you are the only person in your neighborhood that is doing this and you will be fine .
More likely , your packets will start to take longer to get from the PSN down to your PS3 .
If you are just downloading games or demos or videos , this will just mean your throughput will drop slightly .
Instead of a 20 minute download taking 20 minutes , it might take 22 minutes or 25 .
Hopefully you are n’t trying to stream an HD movie , or even worse , trying to play anything with an online component .
With typical Internet traffic like web browsing and e-mail this is generally not as much of a problem .
For these applications the major factor in perceived “ speed ” is your available bandwidth .
If you happen to get throttled your web pages might take a little bit longer to load , and your e-mail will download a little bit slower .
However , when it comes to online gaming , more important than bandwidth and throughput is “ latency ” .
Latency is the amount of time each packet takes to make the trip between your PS3 and the game ’s servers and back .
Or , in the case of games that use peer - to - peer networking , to the host ’s PS3 and back .
This is your “ round trip time ” or RTT .
The longer your RTT the more “ lag ” you will perceive when you are playing online .
In general your RTT is going to be higher the farther that you are geographically from the destination .
Also , if the destination has a “ slower ” connection or is congested , your RTT will be higher ; the packets will have to queue up and trickle through , increasing the RTT .
But now , in addition to geographically induced and bandwidth induced latency , if you have triggered a throttling event during a period of congestion , your RTT is going to skyrocket as well .
Your network traffic is only going to be able to move across the network after all non-throttled traffic has moved across .
If there are non -throttled packets waiting to be sent out through the network , those packets will be sent before yours .
Just hope that nobody is about to start streaming a Netflix movie while you line yourself up for that headshot .
It will also be interesting to see whether Comcast is only keeping track of download throughput , or if they are also measuring upstream throughput .
Your typical multiplayer FPS generates about 40 Kbps of traffic .
Many online multiplayer games utilize peer - to - peer networking , which requires one player to be the host for any given match .
This means that your 40 Kbps of data becomes 40 * the number of players coming into your network .
For a typical 12 player multiplayer game , that ’s 480 Kbps .
While this is still only about 5 % of your 10 Mbps of downstream bandwidth , Comcast has a much smaller quota for upstream traffic .
If you have a 10 Mbps downstream , you more than likely have around 2 Mbps upstream .
480 Kbps is approximately 25 % of that upstream bandwidth , so you are already over 1 /3rd of your way to getting throttled if upstream bandwidth is being “ managed ” the same as download bandwidth is .
What effect do you think this new policy and others like it will have on online gaming ?
How will it effect efforts towards digital distribution , be it one - time game downloads from the PSN or future on - demand gaming applications like OnLive ?

Fern�ndez expuso al presidente nacional panista su proyecto en materia de seguridad p�blica , que tiene como ejes fundamentales la prevenci�n del delito y la participaci�n ciudadana , destac� el PAN en un comunicado .
A su vez , Nava asegur� que el Comit� Ejecutivo Nacional del PAN s�lo respaldar� " las acciones institucionales que emprenda el municipio dentro del marco de las leyes correspondientes " .

The great Victorian is probably even more ubiquitous now than he was in his lifetime .
How he remains such vital reading is an intriguing question
It seems that you cannot turn a corner this year without bumping into Charles Dickens .
So far we 've seen the release of four major novels based on the Victorian icon 's life : Dan Simmons 's Drood ( February ) , Matthew Pearl 's The Last Dickens ( March ) , Richard Flanagan 's Wanting ( May ) , and Gaynor Arnold 's Girl in a Blue Dress ( July ) .
Earlier this year BBC1's lush new production of Little Dorrit was nominated for five Bafta awards in the UK , and 11 Emmys in the US .
Newspapers and magazines have run stories on his relevance to the current global economic crisis .
And with the Christmas season now only four months away , it seems that there is no getting away from him any time soon .
As someone who teaches and writes about Dickens , the question of why we still read him is something that 's often on my mind .
But that question was never more troubling than one day , nearly 10 years ago , when I was standing as a guest speaker in front of a class of about 30 high school students .
I had been speaking for about 20 minutes with an 1850 copy of David Copperfield in my hand , telling the students that for Victorian readers , Dickens 's writing was very much a " tune - in - next - week " type of thing that generated trends and crazes , much as their own TV shows did for them today .
Then a hand shot up in the middle of the room .
" But why should we still read this stuff ? "
I was speechless because in that moment I realised that , though I had begun a PhD dissertation on Dickens , I had never pondered the question myself .
The answer I gave was acceptable : " Because he teaches you how to think , " I said .
But lots of writers can teach you how to think , and I knew that was n't really the reason .
The question nagged me for years , and for years I told myself answers , but never with complete satisfaction .
We read Dickens not just because he was a man of his own times , but because he was a man for our times as well .
We read Dickens because his perception and investigation of the human psyche is deep , precise , and illuminating , and because he tells us things about ourselves by portraying personality traits and habits that might seem all too familiar .
His messages about poverty and charity have travelled through decades , and we can learn from the experiences of his characters almost as easily as we can learn from our own experiences .
These are all wonderful reasons to read Dickens .
But these are not exactly the reasons why I read Dickens .
My search for an answer continued but never with success , until one year the little flicker came – not surprisingly – from another high school student , whose essay I was reviewing for a writing contest .
" We need to read Dickens 's novels , " she wrote , " because they tell us , in the grandest way possible , why we are what we are . "
There it was , like a perfectly formed pearl shucked from the dirty shell of my over - zealous efforts – an explanation so simple and beautiful that only a 15 - year - old could have written it .
I could add all of the decoration to the argument with my years of education – the pantheon of rich characters mirroring every personality type ; the " universal themes " laid out in such meticulous and timeless detail ; the dramas and the melodramas by which we recognise our own place in the Dickensian theatre – but the kernel of what I truly wanted to say had come from someone else .
As is often the case in Dickens , the moment of realisation for the main character here was induced by the forthrightness of another party .
And who was I , that I needed to be told why I was what I was ?
Like most people , I think I knew who I was without knowing it .
I was Oliver Twist , always wanting and asking for more .
I was Nicholas Nickleby , the son of a dead man , incurably convinced that my father was watching me from beyond the grave .
I was Esther Summerson , longing for a mother who had abandoned me long ago due to circumstances beyond her control .
I was Pip in love with someone far beyond my reach .
I was all of these characters , rewritten for another time and place , and I began to understand more about why I was who I was because Dickens had told me so much about human beings and human interaction .
There are still two or three Dickens novels that I have n't actually read ; but when the time is right I 'll pick them up and read them .
I already know who it is I 'll meet in those novels – the Mr Micawbers , the Mrs Jellybys , the Ebenezer Scrooges , the Amy Dorrits .
They are , like all of us , cut from the same cloth , and at the same time as individual as their unforgettable aptronyms suggest .
They are the assurances that Dickens , whether I am reading him or not , is shining a light on who I am during the best and worst of times .
Two soldiers serving with the International Security Assistance Force and operating in western Afghanistan have been reported missing .
The two soldiers , whose names and home countries initially were not announced , have been missing for two days , ISAF , the umbrella command for NATO and allied forces operating in Afghanistan , reported today .
The two soldiers were later identified as US paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division .
The Taliban claimed they have found the bodies of two paratroopers .
The soldiers went missing during “ a routine resupply mission in western Afghanistan , ” ISAF said in a press release .
ISAF and Afghan troops have launched “ exhaustive search and rescue operations ” in an effort to find the missing soldiers .
Twenty - five Coalition and Afghan security forces have been wounded during the search operation to recover the soldiers , the US military said .
Afghan officials have said that the troops were wounded during a friendly fire incident involving Coalition strike aircraft .
US , Italian , Spanish , and Lithuanian soldiers are currently operating in Regional Command – West , an area that encompasses Herat , Farah , Ghor , and Badghis provinces .
The Taliban insurgency has grown in Farah , Herat , and Badghis over the past two years .
The Taliban control districts in each of the three provinces , while violence against ISAF and Afghan forces and civilians has increased .
The Taliban captured one US soldier earlier this year .
The soldier was captured by the Haqqani Network in late June after leaving his post and wandering off of a combat outpost in Paktika province .
The Taliban released a videotape of the soldier , then news of the captive soldier dried up .

About three hours ago , the AP finally joined the Washington Post and some other national news organizations in reporting the “ troubling portrait ” of Nidal Malik Hasan , the man believed responsible for 13 deaths and dozens of wounded at the world ’s largest army base .
In hearing these details , many people wonder why the Army had ordered Hasan into a war zone — and perhaps why Hasan remained in the military at all :
For six years before reporting for duty at Fort Hood , Texas , in July , the 39 - year - old Army major worked at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center pursuing his career in psychiatry , as an intern , a resident and , last year , a fellow in disaster and preventive psychiatry .
He received his medical degree from the military ’s Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda , Md. , in 2001 .
While an intern at Walter Reed , Hasan had some “ difficulties ” that required counseling and extra supervision , said Dr. Thomas Grieger , who was the training director at the time . …
At least six months ago , Hasan came to the attention of law enforcement officials because of Internet postings about suicide bombings and other threats , including posts that equated suicide bombers to soldiers who throw themselves on a grenade to save the lives of their comrades .
They had not determined for certain whether Hasan is the author of the posting , and a formal investigation had not been opened before the shooting , said law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the case . …
On a form filled out by those seeking spouses through a program at the mosque , Hasan listed his birthplace as Arlington , Va. , but his nationality as Palestinian , Khan said .
“ I do n’t know why he listed Palestinian , ” Khan said , “ He was not born in Palestine . ”
USA Today has even more this morning :
U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul , a Republican from Austin , was briefed by military officials and said Hasan had taken some unusual classes for someone studying about mental health .
“ He took a lot of extra classes in weapons training , which seems a little odd for a psychiatrist , ” McCaul said .
McCaul said Hasan had received poor grades for his work at Walter Reed and was not happy about his situation in Fort Hood , where Hasan apparently felt like “ he did n’t fit in . ”
“ He ’s disgruntled because he had a poor performance evaluation , he does n’t believe in the mission , he ’s looking at getting transferred to Afghanistan or Iraq , ” McCaul said .
“ He ’s not happy about all that . ”
McCaul added that officials planned to interview Hasan to try to determine for sure that he was not working with foreign agents .
“ From an intelligence standpoint , that ’s key , finding out if he talked to anyone overseas , ” McCaul said .
With all of these red flags , why was Hasan still in position to get deployed into a war zone ?
Why had n’t the Army taken action to isolate Hasan , or remove him entirely ?
A Hot Air reader who served as a medical officer at Fort Hood earlier in this decade explains that the military has a great reluctance to act against his former colleagues , and that promotion of marginal medical officers is not unusual at all :
It is true that the promotion for medical and dental officers in the Army is extraordinarily easy .
Just as long as you do n’t kill anyone , fraternize with enlisted or come out of the closet , and get decent Officer Evaluation Reports , you ’ll easily make Lieutenant Colonel in 20 years .
With a little more work and additional schooling , you could make full Colonel .
But basically you can set your clock to getting promoted every 7 years .
So he may have had one bad report , but probably did barely enough to get him through the promotion board .
But we do n’t know what “ bad ” means …he may have simply failed the physical fitness tests , or he may have no clinical skills at all .
The Army has a unique way of handling providers who pose an obvious threat to soldiers they are supposed to care for .
We had one dental officer who practiced dentistry far below the standard of care .
He was moved first to doing examinations only ( the most benign job ) and eventually moved to an administrative job .
The Army unfortunately can’t fire anyone , they just take them out of the equation or move them around to where they ca n’t hurt anyone .
Being released from the military is a different story .
Hasan ’s obligation to the military depends on how much ROTC time , medical school time and residency time added up to .
So if the Army paid for his education , he is obligated to serve , and there ’s almost no way out of that .
He could pay the Army back that money and get out of the contract , but that ’s a long , long paper trail .
There ’s always the conscientious objector route , but if he was sincere , and not the loon he is appearing to be , his chain of command ( superior officers ) might have exempted him from deployment .
However , he is a medical officer and NOT a combat soldier , so that argument just about flies out the window , since his role is medical support , and not combat .
I ’ve heard a lot of ways out of deployment ( ie Ehren Watada , Tina Mahuika ) and each case is unique .
Ultimately the final decision can be influenced by the chain of command ’s perception of the officer .
So not only would the Army be highly reluctant to discharge him , Hasan probably had few options for leaving the service , assuming that the Army paid for his medical education .
That explains his rank , and his predicament in getting shipped out to Iraq and / or Afghanistan .
As a medical officer and not ( necessarily ) a combat officer , the conscientious objector route would not have applied anyway .
We ’ll keep up with this story during the day as more developments occur .
Update : I agree with Rick Moran to some extent that casting this as an example of a pending wave of Islamic jihad in the US is just a wee bit premature , as well as a pending wave of fraggings over US war policy , etc etc etc .
Hasan appears to be a lunatic whose motivations — at least as far as we know at this point — are entirely his own delusions .
We should n’t be afraid to report the facts , but we should be wary about drawing wide - reaching conclusions from them until we have a lot more certainty .
The American Medical Association on Tuesday issued a cautious but historically significant call to change America ’s marijuana prohibition laws , urging a “ review ” of the drug ’s status as a Schedule I drug .
At a meeting in Houston , the AMA ’s House of Delegates adopted a new policy that calls for “ marijuana ’s status as a federal Schedule I controlled substance be reviewed with the goal of facilitating the conduct of clinical research and development of cannabinoid - based medicines , and alternate delivery methods . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
That does not mean the AMA supports the legalization or decriminalization of marijuana .
Schedule I drugs are those considered to have no medical benefit and to be harmful when used under any circumstances .
As such , marijuana is currently grouped by the federal government with drugs like heroin and LSD .
By comparison , cocaine and methamphetamines are classified as Schedule II drugs , which may have some clinical benefits when used in the proper circumstances .
The AMA ’s stance could simply result in the rescheduling of marijuana as a controlled substance that has some medical benefit .
However , Aaron Houston , director of government relations for the Marijuana Policy Project , calls the move “ historic ” all the same , noting that it comes from “ what has historically been America ’s most cautious and conservative major medical organization . ”
“ Marijuana ’s Schedule I status is not just scientifically untenable , given the wealth of recent data showing it to be both safe and effective for chronic pain and other conditions , but it ’s been a major obstacle to needed research , ” he said in a statement .
“ It ’s been 72 years since the AMA has officially recognized that marijuana has both already - demonstrated and future - promising medical utility , ” said medical student Sunil Aggarwal in a press statement from Americans for Safe Access .
Aggarwal has been spearheading the effort by the AMA ’s youth wing to change the organization ’s attitude towards marijuana .
ADVERTISEMENT
ASA government affairs director Caren Woodson pointed out that the American College of Physicians , the country ’s second - largest medical group , called for a review of marijuana ’s status last year .
“ The two largest physician groups in the US have established medical marijuana as a health care issue that must be addressed , ” Woodson said .
“ Both organizations have underscored the need for change by placing patients above politics . ”
In its report ( PDF ) , the AMA stated :
ADVERTISEMENT
Results of short term controlled trials indicate that smoked cannabis reduces neuropathic pain , improves appetite and caloric intake especially in patients with reduced muscle mass , and may relieve spasticity and pain in patients with multiple sclerosis .
However , the patchwork of state - based systems that have been established for .medical marijuana .
is woefully inadequate in establishing even rudimentary safeguards that normally would be applied to the appropriate clinical use of psychoactive substances .
The future of cannabinoid - based medicine lies in the rapidly evolving field of botanical drug substance development , as well as the design of molecules that target various aspects of the endocannabinoid system .
To the extent that rescheduling marijuana out of Schedule I will benefit this effort , such a move can be supported .
The AMA ’s move is the latest in a series of small but significant shifts in attitudes towards the liberalization of marijuana policies .
ADVERTISEMENT
Last month , conservative columnist George F. Will said that the US is “ probably in the process ” of legalizing marijuana , pointing to the Obama administration ’s new policy to no longer raid medical marijuana clinics that are legal under state law , so long as those state laws are being observed .
( Though one California - based US attorney disputes that there has been any change in policy . )
Additionally , California is currently debating a proposal to decriminalize marijuana .
Massachusetts decriminalized marijuana in a state ballot last year .
And recent polls show that support for decriminalization of marijuana has reached a record high in the United States , with some 44 percent of Americans now in favor of reducing or eliminating criminal penalties for possession of the herb .
Like you , I 'm a completely selfish bastard who does n't give three figs about future generations .
I want to use my kettle whenever I want , as often as I please .
So what if it 's murdering the ice caps ?
What have polar bears ever done for us anyway ?
Name one good album by a polar bear .
You can't .
They do n't understand that respect is earned , not given .
Take a long , hard look at the next polar bear you come across .
Note how it makes no effort to engage you in conversation .
Ask to borrow its coat .
Not a chance unless you kill it with a breezeblock or something .
Check out the size of its belly : someone could do with shifting a few pounds , that 's for damn sure .
Endangered ?
Enfattered , more like .
Blah blah Clarkson blah .
We 're screwed , of course .
Humankind will happily swerve the planet into climatic meltdown for the sake of heating a few patios .
Everyone knows this , we 're just hoping we can ignore our way out of it , like a passenger staring fixedly at the in - flight entertainment system on a flight where all four engines have failed .
Still , if you 're in the mood for a novel take on just how screwed we all are , tune in to Bang Goes The Theory : Human Power Station ( Thu , 8 pm , BBC1 ) , a programme which manages to be both a characteristic chunk of breezy mainstream BBC edutainment and a violently discouraging portent of impending ruin .
The presenters smile as they deliver one piece of bad news after another : it 's a bit like being repeatedly punched in the face by a Butlins Redcoat .
The idea is a simple one , and pretty boring on the face of it .
They 've plonked an average suburban family in a house and asked them to behave as though it 's a normal day .
Unbeknown to said family , the house 's entire supply of electricity is being generated by a room full of human volunteers in a giant warehouse next door ; 80 of them , all sitting on bikes .
If mum switches the telly on , 20 of them have to start pedalling .
If dad has a shower at the same time , 40 more have to join in .
And if one of the kids simultaneously decides to microwave an Action Man , it 's all hands to the pump ( or rather feet to the pedals ) .
Hanging on the wall in front of the cyclists is a big screen displaying a continual live feed from the house , which is a nice device because it means the knackered pedallers gasp with horror and desperately call for more people to leap in the saddle and help each time a family member approaches , say , the dishwasher .
This is where the fun comes in : it 's basically like an episode of Big Brother with a sternly philanthropic sense of purpose and a curious emphasis on household appliances .
The interplay between the oblivious onscreen family and the anonymous army generating their power reminded me of The Numbskulls , the vintage Beezer comic strip depicting tiny and often bemused workers toiling inside a man 's brain .
The main difference is that the Numbskulls were n't perpetually hammering away on exercise bikes , pissing litres of sweat through every pore .
The room in which the " human power station " is housed must reek like a submariner 's bunk bed on National Underwater Thermostat - Tinkering Day .
As a frightening visual illustration of just how much energy we consume in an average day , it largely succeeds .
But as an hour of TV entertainment , it 's slightly less convincing .
About halfway in you 'll probably fancy a break .
I left the show running for a bit , wandered into the kitchen and boiled a kettle , thereby killing eight more polar bears .
Like I said at the start , we 're all screwed .
My advice : buy shares in penguin coffins today .
And get used to the way the human power station works , because the Chinese will probably be forcing us all to take part in something similar in 10 years ' time , as an eco-friendly means of keeping their mass prisons illuminated .
Happy Christmas .

The Fed ’s balance sheet contracted for the second straight week , dipping slightly to $ 2.120 trillion from $ 2.123 trillion .
Nearly all of the drop came from a decline in central bank liquidity swaps , as foreign demand for dollars continues to wane .
Nearly all of the programs set up as emergency facilities to prop up the financial system were essentially flat .
Direct - bank lending rose a bit , but remains at low levels compared to a year earlier .
The Fed expanded its purchases of Treasurys and agency debt , though its holdings of mortgage - backed securities declined for the second straight week .
The Fed started a program in March to ramp up such acquisitions in order to keep long - term interest rates low .
The central bank announced in August that it will be buying more Treasurys through the end of October , and said last month that it will be buying MBS into 2010 .
In an effort to track the Fed ’s actions , Real Time Economics has created an interactive graphic that will mark the expansion of the central bank ’s balance sheet .

Fraud allegations have led to an audit of some ballot boxes
The United Nations has again been forced to defend its role in Afghan presidential elections after a US newspaper published voter turnout data .
The data showed evidence of electoral fraud and had been kept confidential by the UN 's chief envoy , Kai Eide .
His deputy , Peter Galbraith , has accused him of refusing to reveal the data because it reflects poorly on President Hamid Karzai .
The UN said it was not allowed to make a formal complaint regarding fraud .
The data , published by the Washington Post , shows that in some provinces Hamid Karzai recorded tens of thousands more votes than estimates of the number of people who voted .
The information was gathered by UN field staff , but their boss , Mr Eide , did not hand it over to the bodies investigating fraud .
Senior officials at the UN defended him , stressing that the UN 's role was to provide technical assistance for the election , and it was not allowed to formally file complaints of fraud .
The director of Electoral Assistance Division , Department of Political Affairs , Craig Jenness said only Afghan people - including candidates , voters or observers - can file complaints .
" The UN , the European Union , individuals who are not participants in the process have no right to go to the Electoral Complaints Commission , fill out their very specific form , attach their evidence , and ask that the case be adjudicated .
" So when the UN says we did n't submit a complaint , we did n't forward this that is what we 're saying . "
However , some of the information had been passed on through informal contacts , officials said .
Personal agenda claim
They urged patience , saying an investigation is underway , and ballot boxes where voter turnout was high were being checked .
Nevertheless , the publication of the data threatens to worsen a credibility crisis not only for the election , but for the United Nations .
The public dispute between Mr Eide and Mr Galbraith has escalated , with a flurry of accusations .
Mr Galbraith has accused his boss of backing Mr Karzai , while the UN officials said Mr Galbraith has a personal agenda .
The UN officials confirmed reports that he had advocated an unconstitutional change of government as a response to evidence of widespread fraud .

A bug in Microsoft 's Internet Explorer browser is causing more than 50 million files stored online to leak potentially sensitive information that could compromise user privacy , a security researcher said .
The documents stored in Adobe 's PDF format display the internal disk location where the file is stored , an oversight that can inadvertently expose real - world names and login IDs of users , the operating system being used and other information that is better kept private .
The data can then be retrieved using simple web searches .
Google searches such as this one expose almost four million documents residing on users ' C drives alone .
Combined with searches for other common drives , the technique exposes more than 50 million files that display the local disk path , according to Inferno , a security researcher for a large software company who asked that his real name not be used .
" If they have those kind of PDFs , somebody can use search engines to find out user names or do more reconnaissance on the operating systems used , " he told The Register .
" That actually invades the privacy of a user . "
The potentially sensitive data is included in PDFs that have been printed using Internet Explorer .
The full path location is appended to its contents as soon as the Microsoft browser is used to print the document .
Although the data is n't always exposed when the document is viewed with Adobe Reader , it is easily readable when the file is opened in editors such as Notepad , and the text is also available to Google and other search engines .
This PDF , for example , was stored at C : \Program Files\Wids7\WizardReport.htm at time of printing .
The path makes it clear that the file was stored on a Windows machine that has software from Worldwide Instructional Design System installed .
Other PDFs give up directory names that reveal authors , projects or other data that may have been designated confidential .
The only way to remove the path is erase the text in an editor and save the document .
All versions of IE suffer from the bug .
A Microsoft spokeswoman said company engineers are working to reproduce the reported behavior .
" We can confirm that this is not a vulnerability , " she wrote in an email .
Adobe representatives did n't reply to requests for comment .
Inferno's report is here . ®

This week , President Obama makes his first state visit to China .
What kind of country will he find there ?
We tend to imagine China as a monolith : 1.3 billion people sharing the same language , history , and culture .
The truth is far more interesting .
China is a mosaic of several distinct regions , each with its own resources , dynamics , and historical character .
As a traveler , teacher , and professional investor who has been exploring China since 1986 , I ’ve come to think of these regions as the Nine Nations of China ( inspired , in part , by Joel Garreau ’s Nine Nations of North America ) .
Taken individually , these “ nations ” would account for eight of the 20 most populous countries in the world .
As China ’s economy becomes more integrated , these regional differences are taking on greater importance than ever before .
Each of the Nine Nations faces a unique set of challenges and opportunities in carving out its own competitive niche .
Anyone who wants to do business in China , make policy towards China , or simply comprehend the dramatic changes happening there should understand the Nine Nations and the role each of them is playing in shaping China ’s future .

On Tuesday September 9 2001 , his diary records , Tony Benn went shopping .
Specifically , he went looking for his " favourite triple - cheese pizzas " , which had inexplicably disappeared from the shelves of his local supermarket .
" I have , " he notes , " eaten two of them every day for years . "
At first glance , this revelation may appear to raise important questions as to the continued health of our treasured Last Living Socialist , the only triple - cheese pizza commonly available from UK supermarkets being , as far as I can see , the Chicago Town Deep Dish Triple Cheese Pizza , which costs £ 1.65 for two at Tesco and contains , according to the Food Standards Agency , a healthy 30 % of a person 's recommended daily fat intake per portion .
But could it be that such fears are unfounded ?
For the past 4,500 weekday mornings ( or 17 years ) , for example , Lee and Mary Humphrey , both 84 , of Eastbourne , Sussex , have walked into their local McDonald 's and proceeded to eat a double hamburger each plus a shared large fries .
No harm done .
Likewise , young Craig Flatman from Suffolk , you may recall , grew into a strapping 6ft 1in , 11 - stone teenager on a diet consisting exclusively of five rounds of jam sarnies a day since the age of four .
Similarly , perhaps , former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright 's usual supper , when she 's at home , is reportedly " cottage cheese with ketchup " .
Crime queen Ruth Rendell has confessed that she will probably eat " bread and gruyere cheese , a salad and fruit " for lunch " every day for the rest of my life " .
Geneticist Steve Jones has munched on " a boring vegetarian salad " in his university canteen every day for 30 years .
And no less a deity than actor Rupert Everett has not cooked since 1981 , far preferring to " go to the same restaurant every day and have exactly the same food " .
So might repetitive eating actually be good for you ?
It was Wittgenstein , after all , who once remarked : " I do n't mind what I eat , as long as it's always the same thing . "
Though he was also partial to playing chess without a board or an opponent , " staring moodily at objects , moving them in relation to one another , laughing to himself and shouting ' Check ! ' "
So on balance , maybe not .
At least this virtual orgy came in the wake of our association .
For legions of British women , gaming is the ghost at the feast in their relationship .
A sufferer recounts : “ My husband is obsessed with Nintendo DS games – Zelda , in particular : his great love , and definitely the third person in our marriage .
He can not even go to the loo without her .
When we had our first child , I would find him trying to squeeze in a round : child propped in his arms , bottle held in place by his chest , leaving hands free for the console . ”

The judge described the outcome as sad but inevitable A father who went to the High Court to try to stop a hospital turning off his seriously ill baby son's life support machine has dropped his objections to the move .
The outcome has prompted a mixture of sadness and relief .
For six days they had sat in the bland surroundings of Court 50 at London 's High Court listening to others talking about their baby son's quality of life .
A host of paediatricians , nurses , and experts went into the witness box .
Many of them urged a judge to decide that this profoundly disabled 13 - month - old boy should be allowed to die .
It was , they said , no longer in his best interests to keep him alive .
The estranged but devoted parents of the baby , known only as RB , had endured this often harrowing evidence stoically for much of the time .
As day seven began , it was clear something had changed .
The baby 's father , AB , and mother , KM , sitting just a few spaces apart on the wooden benches , were in tears .
Only in their 20s themselves , they each had the emotional support of their mothers .
As soon as the judge , Mr Justice McFarlane , took his seat , the father 's barrister asked for the media to be excluded from court .
Palpable sense
It was more than two hours later before we were allowed back in to hear the news .
AB had dropped his opposition to doctors withdrawing his son's life support .
All parties were now in agreement .
The ventilator keeping baby RB alive should be switched off .
They now wanted privacy ... to spend what little time remained with their beloved son
Father drops right to life fight
There was an almost palpable sense of relief tinged with tragedy .
The tragedy was that all of us present now knew that Baby RB was not long for this world .
The relief was that it would not fall to a court to decide between the competing views of doctors , nurses and the mother on one side , and the child 's father on the other .
One sensed that the judge was relieved too that his role had been reduced to merely endorsing the views of others more intimately involved in the case of Baby RB .
He described the outcome as sad but inevitable .
Mr Justice McFarlane did not have to do anything other than make an official order allowing the withdrawal of the baby 's ventilator .
' Immense stress '
He chose to say more , issuing what amounted to a tribute to the dedication and love shown to Baby RB by his parents .
He said they had been at his side throughout his short life .
" They have put their own adult lives on hold , " he said .
" The stress has been immense , it has cost them their relationship , but still they work together and do what they can to support their son .
" When faced with the awfulness of the situation in which they found themselves , these two young people have stepped up to the plate and discharged the responsibility that life had thrust upon them by each showing 100 % commitment to their child in a manner which can only command profound respect and admiration . "
So , as KM and AB left court , they might have drawn some comfort from the judge 's words , but their thoughts and hearts will have been with their little child , in a hospital 's intensive care unit , breathing only with the help of a machine .
Soon - at a time they and the son's doctors decide is right - that machine will be switched off .
They now wanted privacy , they said in a joint statement , to spend what little time remained with their beloved son .

Asked by the TV journalist Jean - Philippe Schaller if it was necessary for her to be no taller than the President 's 5ft 5ins - a height which rises to around 5ft 7ins thanks to his stacked heels - she replied : " There you have it . "
According to a new study by geologists at the University of Toronto and the University of Maryland , the wealth of some minerals that lie in the rock beneath the Earth 's surface may be extraterrestrial in origin .
" The extreme temperature at which the Earth 's core formed more than four billion years ago would have completely stripped any precious metals from the rocky crust and deposited them in the core , " says James Brenan of the Department of Geology at the University of Toronto and co-author of the study published in Nature Geoscience on October 18 .
" So , the next question is why are there detectable , even mineable , concentrations of precious metals such as platinum and rhodium in the rock portion of the Earth today ?
Our results indicate that they could not have ended up there by any known internal process , and instead must have been added back , likely by a ' rain ' of extraterrestrial debris , such as comets and meteorites . "
Geologists have long speculated that four and a half billion years ago , the Earth was a cold mass of rock mixed with iron metal which was melted by the heat generated from the impact of massive planet - sized objects , allowing the iron to separate from the rock and form the Earth 's core .
Brenan and colleague William McDonough of the University of Maryland recreated the extreme pressure and temperature of this process , subjecting a similar mixture to temperatures above 2,000 degrees Celsius , and measured the composition of the resulting rock and iron .
Because the rock became void of the metal in the process , the scientists speculate that the same would have occurred when the Earth was formed , and that some sort of external source - such as a rain of extraterrestrial material - contributed to the presence of some precious metals in Earth 's outer rocky portion today .
" The notion of extraterrestrial rain my also explain another mystery , which is how the rock portion of the Earth came to have hydrogen , carbon and phosphorous - the essential components for life , which were likely lost during Earth 's violent beginning . "

While it was full of ambition and great ideas , it ultimately boiled down to a fairly repetitive experience with plenty of potential but even more gameplay " issues . "
For the the sequel , the team at Ubisoft Montreal attempted to fix those mistakes , building upon the solid foundation of the original — and it worked .
AC2 is the game we all wanted Assassin 's Creed to be two years ago .
The game takes place shortly after the original , and following a brief sequence in the modern day , Desmond is once again thrust into the past .
This time it 's 15th century Italy , three centuries after the first game .
The story takes place from the perspective of Ezio Auditore da Firenze , a young nobleman from a rich family who spends his time and money on women and wine .

Soon , though , Ezio is forced out of his fast - living lifestyle as he takes up the role of assassin in order to exact revenge for his family .
The story itself is epic in scope — jumping forward years at a time at different points throughout the game — and it 's surprisingly easy to follow for those who missed out on the first game .
Aside from a few modern day sequences and references to the past , AC2 does a good job of standing on its own in a narrative sense .
What makes the story truly interesting , though , are the characters .
For the most part the plot is straightforward , filled with plenty of mysteries and a seemingly unending supply of targets for Ezio 's hidden blade .
But the mix of fictional characters and real - world historical figures really helps bring the Renaissance world to life and turn what could have been a fairly bland story into something interesting .
Just be sure to turn on the subtitles , as a fair amount of dialog is spoken in Italian .
Since you start following the memories of Ezio from a relatively young age , this provides a narrative explanation for one of the better aspects of the game : you are constantly learning new abilities .
Untrained as an assassin , Ezio learns as the game progresses , and so does the player ( and Desmond , apparently ) .
And these new skills are many ; you 'll learn new skills for most of the game , ranging from new assassinations to improved climbing abilities .
Many of the new skills you learn are also tied to new weapons and gadgets , provided by none other than Leonardo da Vinci .
These run the gamut from flash bombs to a miniature pistol to a rudimentary — and very cool — flying machine .
What 's disappointing , though , is that as interesting as some of these gadgets are , there is really no need to use them outside of one or two missions .
In most cases it 's easier to simply use your trusted assortment of blades .
Which brings us to the combat .
The first game was heavily criticized for its bland and repetitive fighting system .
AC2 attempts to remedy this by adding depth to the gameplay , allowing players to counter and use timing - based attacks to their advantage .
It also offers the ability to pick up the weapons of fallen enemies and use them in combat .
What 's most disappointing about the upgraded combat is that it 's not necessary for the best .
While it certainly makes things easier if you 're playing more skillfully and waiting for the right time to strike , spamming the attack button will often work just as well .
This is especially true when you 're stuck battling a large group of enemies , which can happen far too often .
The free - running has also been improved this time around .
Climbing feels less automatic , and , though you 'll occasionally dive into a bale of hay unintentionally , the controls are fairly intuitive .
And there is just something truly satisfying about running across the rooftops of Venice , watching the beautifully rendered , sun-drenched world of late medieval Italy pass you by .
It 's also important to note that AC2 is a huge game .
Like , really , really big .
The main storyline is substantial enough — lasting approximately 15 hours if you barrel straight through it — but there is so much extra content that it 's almost overwhelming at times .
There is a bevy of side - missions to complete , but the game also features extras like a fully - functioning economy .
You are given a small villa to renovate , and you can earn money and gain access to cheaper goods by doing so .
Most interesting is a segment of the game called The Truth .
Scattered throughout the world are numerous strange symbols , which can be deciphered by solving various , sometimes difficult , puzzles .
Each symbol unlocks a brief video sequence , which , when strung together , help provide further detail to the story .
The game also features a ton of back story , allowing you to read up on most of the important characters and locations , helping to further flesh out the world .
It took this many people to make Assassin 's Creed 2 .
And that 's probably AC2's greatest strength .
It can appeal to both to the sort of gamers who just want to make their way through the story as quickly as possible , and the kind who like to take things slowly , savoring the experience .
Both will be satisfied .
Of course there are other minor nitpicky issues — the present - day segments are boring , some of the NPC AI can be frustrating , the larger - scale battles look and feel awkward , etc . — but they do n't take away from the overall experience in any drastic way .
Assassin's Creed 2 is a massive game , created by a massive team , and weighed down by some massive expectations .
Fortunately , it lives up to the potential created by its predecessor , delivering possibly the best third - person action game of the year .

Blake Mycoski did n't just want to start a charity to put shoes on the feet of children who needed them — he wanted to do something more sustainable , something that did n't rely on asking for donations .
So Mycoski started TOMS
Shoes , a for - profit company that gives one pair of shoes to a child in need for every pair they sell .
Mycoski's inspiring message is about the necessity of innovative thinking .
According to Geoffrey Canada the American school system is broken when it comes to teaching children in inner-city schools , and most people would n't disagree with him .
But Canada 's inspiring approach to fixing the problem is something that no one before him had tried — a complete overhaul of the social infrastructure .
Canada created a " conveyor belt " in a Harlem neighborhood that touches the lives of children and their families from birth through college .
Canada shows us that sometimes you have to take a radical approach .
Ben Underwood was blind , but while he was alive , he got around almost as well as people who can see , and even played video games with his friends .
That 's because he had done something that 's very unusual : Ben Underwood taught himself how to echolocate .
Underwood trained his ears to listen for the echoes that tongue - clicking sounds that he produced made as they bounced back off of objects .
He then processed that information to figure out where physical objects lie around him .
Though Underwood sadly passed away earlier this year , his inspirational story proves that no obstacle is insurmountable .

Executive summary
The most significant recent climate change findings are :
Surging greenhouse gas emissions : Global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels in 2008 were 40 % higher than those in 1990 .
Even if global emission rates are stabilized at present – day levels , just 20 more years of emissions would give a 25 % probability that warming exceeds 2°C .
Even with zero emissions after 2030 .
Every year of delayed action increase the chances of exceeding 2 °C warming .
Recent global temperatures demonstrate human - based warming :
Over the past 25 years temperatures have increased at a rate of 0.190C per decade , in every good agreement with predictions based on greenhouse gas increases .
Even over the past ten years , despite a decrease in solar forcing , the trend continues to be one of warming .
Natural , short - term fluctuations are occurring as usual but there have been no significant changes in the underlying warming trend .
Acceleration of melting of ice - sheets , glaciers and ice - caps : A wide array of satellite and ice measurements now demonstrate beyond doubt that both the Greenland and Antarctic ice - sheets are losing mass at an increasing rate .
Melting of glaciers and ice - caps in other parts of the world has also accelerated since 1990 .
Rapid Arctic sea-ice decline : Summer - time melting of Arctic sea-ice has accelerated far beyond the expectations of climate models .
The area of summertime sea-ice during 2007 - 2009 was about 40 % less than the average prediction from IPCC AR4 climate models .
Current sea - level rise underestimates : Satellites show great global average sea - level rise ( 3.4 mm / yr over the past 15 years ) to be 80 % above past IPCC predictions .
This acceleration in sea - level rise is consistent with a doubling in contribution from melting of glaciers , ice caps and the Greenland and West - Antarctic ice - sheets .
Sea - level prediction revised :
By 2100 , global sea - level is likely to rise at least twice as much as projected by Working Group 1 of the IPCC AR4 , for unmitigated emissions it may well exceed 1 meter .
The upper limit has been estimated as – 2 meters sea - level rise by 2100 .
Sea - level will continue to rise for centuries after global temperature have been stabilized and several meters of sea level rise must be expected over the next few centuries .
Delay in action risks irreversible damage : Several vulnerable elements in the climate system ( e.g. continental ice - sheets .
Amazon rainforest , West African monsoon and others ) could be pushed towards abrupt or irreversible change if warming continues in a business - as - usual way throughout this century .
The risk of transgressing critical thresholds ( “ tipping points ” ) increase strongly with ongoing climate change .
Thus waiting for higher levels of scientific certainty could mean that some tipping points will be crossed before they are recognized .
Using gravity measurement data from the NASA / German Aerospace Center 's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE ) mission , a team of scientists from the University of Texas at Austin has found that the East Antarctic ice sheet - home to about 90 percent of Earth 's solid fresh water and previously considered stable - may have begun to lose ice .
The team used Grace data to estimate Antarctica 's ice mass between 2002 and 2009 .
Their results , published Nov. 22 in the journal Nature Geoscience , found that the East Antarctic ice sheet is losing mass , mostly in coastal regions , at an estimated rate of 57 gigatonnes a year .
A gigatonne is one billion metric tons , or more than 2.2 trillion pounds .
The ice loss there may have begun as early as 2006 .
The study also confirmed previous results showing that West Antarctica is losing about 132 gigatonnes of ice per year .
" While we are seeing a trend of accelerating ice loss in Antarctica , we had considered East Antarctica to be inviolate , " said lead author and Senior Research Scientist Jianli Chen of the university 's Center for Space Research .
" But if it is losing mass , as our data indicate , it may be an indication the state of East Antarctica has changed .
Since it 's the biggest ice sheet on Earth , ice loss there can have a large impact on global sea level rise in the future . "
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , developed the twin Grace satellites .
The University of Texas Center for Space Research in Austin has overall Grace mission responsibility .
Grace was launched in 2002 .

BHA : From buses to billboards : the next stage of the Atheist Bus Campaign is unveiled for Universal Children 's Day
Billboard adverts have gone up today in London , Edinburgh , Cardiff and Belfast , as the internationally renowned poster campaign which began this year on London buses launches its second phase .
So much money was donated towards the campaign after the bus posters had been launched that the campaign organisers announced that any further money raised would be put towards new adverts later in the year .
" One of the issues raised again and again by donors to the campaign was the issue of children having the freedom to grow up and decide for themselves what they believe , and that we should not label children with any ideology , " said Ariane Sherine , original creator of the Atheist Bus Campaign .
" I hope this poster campaign will encourage the government , media and general public to see children as individuals , free to make their own choices , and accord them the liberty and respect they deserve . "
The posters display some of the labels routinely applied to children that imply beliefs such as ' Catholic ' , ' Protestant ' , ' Muslim ' , ' Hindu ' or ' Sikh ' mixed up together with labels that people would never apply to young children such as ' Marxist ' , ' Anarchist ' , ' Socialist ' , ' Libertarian ' or ' Humanist ' .
In front of the shadowy labels are happy children , with the slogan , ' Please do n't label me .
Let me grow up and choose for myself ' in the now world - famous font of the Atheist Bus Campaign .
The billboards are being unveiled to coincide with 20 November , Universal Children 's Day , which is the United Nations ' day of worldwide fraternity and understanding between children ' .

" We urgently need to raise consciousnesses on this issue , " said Richard Dawkins , Vice President of the BHA , President of RDFRS , and co-sponsor of the campaign .
" Nobody would seriously describe a tiny child as a " Marxist child " or an " Anarchist child " or a " Post - modernist child " .
Yet children are routinely labelled with the religion of their parents .
We need to encourage people to think carefully before labelling any child too young to know their own opinions and our adverts will help to do that . "
Andrew Copson , BHA director of Education , said , " The labelling of children becomes even worse when it is implemented as a matter of public policy .
One of the issues we hope to highlight with these adverts is the continuing and increasing segregation of children according to parental religion in state - funded " faith schools . "
Social cohesion and preparation for life in a diverse society is best achieved in inclusive community schools , where children from different backgrounds learn with and from each other without being divided by labels that they are not old enough to have chosen for themselves . "
The billboards will remain up for two weeks .
The BHA has launched a fundraising campaign to coincide with the unveiling of the billboards which will raise money for campaigns to phase out state funded ' faith schools ' .

The Atheist Bus Campaign 's appeal for donations to fund the bus adverts was launched in October 2008 , aiming to raise just £ 5,500 .
Within four days it had raised £ 100,000 in individual donations from the general public and went on to raise over £ 153,523 , smashing its original target by 2791 per cent .
Spin -offs from the campaign have included bus and other advertising campaigns organised by humanist organisations all over the world and a book edited by Ariane Sherine , ' The Atheist 's Guide to Christmas ' , the proceeds of which are being donated to Terrence Higgins Trust .
In 2009 Universal Children 's Day marks the twentieth anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the sixtieth anniversary of the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child .
Articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child include : Article 2 , where the child is ' protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status , activities , expressed opinions , or beliefs of the child 's parents , legal guardians , or family members ' ;
Article 13 which provides that the child should ' have the right to freedom of expression ; this right shall include freedom to seek , receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds ' ;
Article 14 which guarantees that states will ' respect the right of the child to freedom of thought , conscience and religion . '
The British Humanist Association ( BHA ) is the national charity representing and supporting the non-religious and promoting Humanism .
In education , it campaigns for inclusive schools with no religious admissions policies , balanced teaching about different beliefs and values , and no ' collective worship ' ; the BHA is in favour of the phasing out of state funded ' faith ' schools and campaigns nationally and locally for this cause .

Professional Knowledge Creation in the World - System
Building an anti-imperialist “ anthropology , ” plus an anthropology that studies imperialism , and that studies itself as a received invention of imperialism , means much more than just analyzing and questioning how anthropologists served this or that colonial venture .
It means totally unthinking anthropology as a social science ; more than that , it means totally unthinking social science .
For whatever discussions of “ decolonizing anthropology ” have achieved , this ground was never covered in those discussions .
In the previous posts the discussion was centered on opening questions in a critique of the relationship between anthropology and imperialism , along with questions concerning the terms and concepts that , initially , appear to be central to the debate .
Here we focus on the wider intellectual and geopolitical context of anthropology ’s institutionalization , and the received baggage of 19th century European social science .
In particular , I resort to Immanuel Wallerstein for his analysis of the institutionalization and formalization of the social sciences , and how the very process of institutionalization created the knowledge boundaries , categories , and concepts we use today .
Not least among these received conceptual boundaries , fundamental to the division of knowledge into “ social sciences , ” is the arbitrary construction of “ society , ” “ economics , ” and “ politics . ”
Moving beyond the Eurocentrism of the social sciences also means getting past the false divisions in knowledge created by these institutionalized conceptualizations .
The particular works by Immanuel Wallerstein to which I will be referring , or that shape the overall discussion in some way , are :
Wallerstein , Immanuel M. 2006 .

( Ch. 2 , “ Can One Be a Non-Orientalist ?

( Ch. 8 , “ A Comment on Epistemology : What is Africa ? ” 127-129 ; Ch. 9 , “ Does India Exist ? ” 130-134 )
I strongly recommend these for a start .
One really cannot “ do ” or “ write ” anthropology innocently any more after reflecting on these works .
The Institutionalization of the Social Sciences
In Open the Social Sciences , the Gulbenkian Commission led by Wallerstein , highlighted the main historical trends that led to the institutionalization of knowledge in universities .
“ The need of the modern state for more exact knowledge on which to base its decisions , ” they observe led to the emergence of new , though still uncertain , categories of knowledge already in the 18th century .
The university was until then a largely moribund institution , at least since the 16th century , having been too tightly linked with the Church .
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries , however , the university was largely revived as the primary locus for the creation of knowledge ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 6 ) .
The revival of the university was not actually led primarily by the natural scientists , but rather those who stood to lose most from the development of a hierarchy of a value emerging from the split between science and philosophy ( see the “ two cultures ” below ) .
Instead , it was “ historians , classicists , scholars of national literatures … who did most to revive the universities in the course of the nineteenth century , using it as a mechanism to obtain state support for their scholarly work ” ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 8 ) .
They sought the alliance of natural scientists in promoting the new university structures , in order to profit “ from the positive profile of the natural scientists , ” and in the process reinforcing the distinction , and the tension , between the humanities / arts and the sciences ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 8 ) .
“ The intellectual history of the nineteenth century is marked above all by this disciplinarization and professionalization of knowledge , ” the Commission argued , pointing to “ the creation of permanent institutional structures designed both to produce new knowledge and to reproduce the producers of knowledge ” ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 7 ) .
In the wake of the French Revolution , and especially in Great Britain and France , the pressure for political and social reorganization were felt strongly by the powers that be .
In place of a belief in the “ natural order ” of things , many now recognized the normalcy of change , and argued that ,
the solution lay rather in organizing and rationalizing the social change that now seemed to be inevitable in a world in which the sovereignty of the “ people ” was fast becoming the norm , no doubt hoping thereby to limit its extent .
( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 8 ) .
“ But if one were to organize and rationalize social change , ” the Commission points out , “ one had first of all to study it and understand the rules which governed it ” ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 8 ) .
Hence the proclaimed need for a “ social science . ”
Social science was charged with developing “ systematic , secular knowledge about reality that is somehow validated empirically ” ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 2 ) .
The classical premise of science at this point was two - fold : one , the Newtonian vision of a symmetry between past and future , and two , Cartesian dualisms of humans and nature , mind and matter , and so forth .
Accompanied by notions of progress , and a finite , knowable world , the aim was to “ facilitate the explorations and exploitation demanded by progress , and to make practical and realizable Western aspirations to dominion ” ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 4 ) .
Exploration , exploitation , and rapid social change , all pointed to the need to investigate order , and for that Newtonian physics offered the most useful support .
It was especially in the period from 1850 to 1914 , when we witness a university boom in Europe , North America , and Australia , with many new universities being founded in that very period , that we also see the disciplinarization of knowledge in the form of the social sciences as we know them today ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , pp. 12-13 ) .
The five primary social sciences were history , economics , political science , sociology , and anthropology .
Owing to the struggle between science and philosophy , and the social prestige of science , the primary emphases of these “ social sciences ” were the “ emphasis on the existence of a real world that is objective and knowable , the emphasis on empirical evidence , [ and ] the emphasis on the neutrality of the scholar ” ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 15 ) .
Between 1850 and 1945 , the new social science disciplines were institutionalized : “ This was done by establishing in the principal universities first chairs , then departments offering courses leading to degrees in the discipline ” ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 3 ) .
“ Training ” was institutionalized as was “ research ” : “ the creation of journals specialized in each of the disciplines ; the construction of associations of scholars along disciplinary lines ( first national , then international ) ; the creation of library collections catalogued by disciplines ” ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 3 ) .
Of course one of the key elements in this institutionalization was for the social sciences to stress the differences between them , what made them unique , and thus what required that a special place be made for them in the new universities .
Institutionalization , disciplinarization , expanding world capitalism , and rapid social change thus all combined to create and shape the social sciences as we have known them .
Each of these is tied into the others .
The Eurocentrism of Social Science
Wallerstein ’s core argument is that the creation of the structures of knowledge , specifically the institutionalization of the social sciences , is a phenomenon that is inextricably linked to the very formation and maturation of the capitalist world system ( or what others might loosely , and less comprehensively , refer to as imperialism or capitalist hegemony ) .
There is nothing that is either natural , logical , or accidental about the institutionalization of the social sciences .
The structures of knowledge are accepted ways of producing knowledge of the world .
In particular , the universalism - particularism dichotomy , and all framings of knowledge that fit within or between that polarity ( of especial relevance to anthropology ’s intellectual mission , and central to the revival of cosmopolitanism ) , is part of the intellectual double bind of the capitalist world system ( see Wallerstein , 1991 , p. 128 ) .
In broad terms , “ social science has been Eurocentric throughout its institutional history , ” Wallerstein explains , “ which means since there have been departments teaching social science within university systems ” ( 1999 , p. 168 ) .
There should be no surprise here , he adds , since social science “ is a product of the modern world - system , and Eurocentrism is constitutive of the geoculture of the modern world ” ( Wallerstein , 1999 , p. 168 ) .
In particular , “ as an institutional structure , social science originated largely in Europe ( Wallerstein , 1999 , p. 168 ) .
By “ Europe , ” Wallerstein means primarily western Europe and North America .
One could broaden that , using native studies discourse , to mean Europe and European settler states .
Even with that more expansive definition , Wallerstein observes that “ the social science disciplines were in fact overwhelmingly located , at least up to 1945 , in just five countries – France , Great Britain , Germany , Italy , and the United States ” ( 1999 , p. 168 ) .
“ Even today , ” he continues , “ despite the global spread of social science as an activity , the large majority of social scientists worldwide remain Europeans ” ( Wallerstein , 1999 , p. 168 ) .
Penetrating deeper , Wallerstein argues that ,
Social science emerged in response to European problems , at a point in history when Europe dominated the whole world - system .
It was virtually inevitable that its choice of subject matter , its theorizing , its methodology , and its epistemology all reflected the constraints of the crucible within which it was formulated .
( Wallerstein , 1999 , p. 168 )
The Eurocentrism of social science has come under increasingly vigorous attack , especially in the period since 1945 with the formal decolonization of Africa , Asia , and much of the Caribbean , and Wallerstein sees this attack as “ fundamentally justified . ”
Moreover , he argues , that “ if social science is to make any progress in the twenty - first century , it must overcome the Eurocentric heritage that has distorted its analyses and its capacity to deal with the problems of the contemporary world ” ( Wallerstein , 1999 , pp. 168-169 ) .
To do this , we must understand what constitutes Eurocentrism and its “ many avatars ” ( Wallerstein , 1999 , p. 169 ) .
There are at least five distinct yet overlapping ways that social science is Eurocentric , as Wallerstein explains .
The Eurocentrism of social science is expressed in “ ( 1 ) its historiography , ( 2 ) the parochiality of its universalism , ( 3 ) its assumptions about ( Western ) civilization , ( 4 ) its Orientalism , and ( 5 ) its attempts to impose the theory of progress ” ( Wallerstein , 1999 , p. 169 ) .
While “ institutionalized social science started as an activity in Europe , ” Wallerstein ’s argument is about much more than this important historical and cultural recognition .
The problem with Eurocentric social science is that it has been “ charged with painting a false picture of social reality by misreading , grossly exaggerating , and / or distorting the historical role of Europe , particularly its historical role in the modern world ” ( Wallerstein , 1999 , p. 177 ) .
“ Whatever Europe did , ” Wallerstein affirms , “ has been analyzed incorrectly and subjected to inappropriate extrapolations , which have had dangerous consequences for both science and the political world ” ( 1999 , p. 178 ) .
The Received Baggage of the 19th Century
The “ two cultures ” division is one of the most fundamental bases for the modern world - system ’s structures of knowledge .
By the “ two cultures ” Wallerstein is drawing on the work of C.P. Snow , and referring to the division between the sciences and the humanities .
“ No other historical system has instituted a fundamental divorce between science and philosophy / humanities , ” Wallerstein observes ( 1999 , p. 183 ) .
It took about three centuries for this rupture to become triumphant in Eurocentric thought , and to become institutionalized .
Now that this has taken place , the “ two cultures ” is “ fundamental to the geoculture and forms the basis of our university systems ” ( Wallerstein , 1999 , p. 183 ) .
It is this very split , between the two cultures , that enabled “ the modern world to put forward the bizarre concept of the value - neutral specialist , whose objective assessments of reality could form the basis not merely of engineering decisions ( in the broadest sense of the term ) but of sociopolitical choices as well ” ( Wallerstein , 1999 , p. 183 ) .
Indeed , one of the central foundations of the Eurocentric social sciences is this very idea of “ objective science ” :
The idea that science is over here and sociopolitical decisions are over there is the core concept that sustains Eurocentrism , since the only universalist propositions that have been acceptable are those that are Eurocentric .
Any argument that reinforces this separation of the two cultures thus sustains Eurocentrism .
If one denies the specificity of the modern world , one has no plausible way of arguing for the reconstruction of knowledge structures , and therefore no plausible way of arriving at intelligent and substantively rational alternatives to the existing world - system .
( Wallerstein , 1999 , p. 183 )
With the split between the two cultures , the alternative to “ science ” was seemingly plagued by “ a lack of internal cohesiveness , which did not help its practitioners plead their cause with the authorities , especially given their seeming inability to offer ‘ practical ’ results ” ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 6 ) .
This story should be very familiar to anthropologists , in their drive to create “ applied anthropology ” and anthropology in the service of military , intelligence , and colonial administration .
The opinions of the authorities , especially those promising funding , and demanding practical benefits , have weighed heavily .
From early on , “ it had begun to be clear that the epistemological struggle over what was legitimate knowledge was no longer a struggle over who would control knowledge about nature ( the natural scientists had clearly won exclusive rights to this domain by the eighteenth century ) but about who would control knowledge about the human world ” ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 6 ) .
One can sum up in this way the key dichotomies that arose from the 19th century institutionalization of the social sciences , dichotomies that are vital to sustaining the Eurocentrism of the social sciences :
science versus philosophy / humanities
discontinuity - continuity
state - centrism in analysis
idiographic versus nomothetic
determinism versus agency
objectivity versus subjectivity
politics versus economics
In review :
Anthropology ’s Baggage
The Gulbenkian Commission devoted attention to each of the five social sciences .
What follows is their description and analysis of the emergence , institutionalization and disciplinarization of anthropology .
At the most basic level , the expansion of the modern world - system involved the European encounter and usually conquest of the peoples of the rest of the world .
In particular , those people who were organized in social structures that Europeans classed as small , without written records , and not part of a geographically wide ranging religious systems , were classed as “ tribes ” or “ races . ”
They became the domain of what would later be called anthropology .
Anthropology had largely begun as a practice of explorers , travelers , and officials of the colonial services of the European powers , and then subsequently became institutionalized as a university discipline ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , pp. 20 - 21 ) .
Anchored within the structures of the university , anthropologists were constrained to maintain the practice of ethnographic fieldwork “ within the normative premises of science ” ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 21 ) .
Some were of course attracted to ideas of a universal natural history of humanity , with assumed stages of development , but their discipline was one pressed into studying particular peoples , requiring a very specific methodology , that of fieldwork .
Consumed with the ostensible interest in human difference , and the particulars of non-European modes of being , anthropologists largely adhered to an idiographic epistemology , with some lingering desires for developing nomothetic propositions ( Gulbenkian , 1996 , p. 22 ) .
Anthropology ’s special baggage then – in the preliminary type of analysis offered by the Gulbenkian Commission – was idiographic research , focused on the non-West , and in particular focused on tribes ( not the non-Western “ high civilizations ” that were more the domain of the Orientalists ) .
As we go further , this analysis will be deepened significantly , but it will be useful to remember some of the broad historical forces at work , as presented in this essay .
A beauty pageant where the only contestants are women with breast implants and facelifts suffered an unexpected setback when the favourite collapsed under the weight of her silicone chest .
Beautiful blonde Alexandra Horvath , 23 , stumbled and fell off her stiletto heels under the weight of her silicone implants .
The implants caused Alexandra to lose her balance as she strutted her stuff in six - inch high heels .
She toppled off the catwalk shortly after parading in front of judges — tearing a ligament and ending up in hospital .
A friend said : ' She had not got used to the extra weight on top and her new hair extensions got in her eyes - she just lost her balance and tore a ligament in her foot badly . '
Miss Plastic features ‘ Man Made ’ patients of the country ’s leading surgeons showing off everything from boob jobs and liposuction to hair transplants .
Reka Urban , a 22 - year - old hostess from Hungary , won the contest in her home country last weekend .
The contest was organised by doctors and women who had cosmetic surgery but were angry about being banned from conventional beauty contests .
Two of the 20 finalists had previously been thrown out of pageants after judges found they had false boobs .
The pageant ’s organiser Miss Reka Bodis said : “ The entry requirement is a surgical procedure done under general or local anaesthesia .
“ Unfortunately , Hungarians are still negative about cosmetic surgery and a lot of stereotypes are going about .
“ We are not seeking to promote extremely large breasts and the like . ”

If you �re looking for an introduction to the extra-legal horrors of Guant�namo , and the casual , almost mundane manner in which randomly - seized prisoners , who were not even screened according to the Geneva Conventions , found themselves the victims of a torture policy designed to make them reveal their mostly non-existent secrets , then you may like this article , which I wrote for the Future of Freedom Foundation , for whom I write a weekly column .
I . The mesh - wire cages , suitable only for animals , are empty now and overgrown , but they will stand forever as a symbol of the Bush administration�s inept , brutal and destructive " War on Terror " policies , implemented in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the US mainland on September 11 , 2001 .
This is Camp X - Ray , the first of the prison camps at the US naval base in Guant�namo Bay , Cuba , and it was here that the grimly iconic photos were taken , on January 11 , 2002 , showing the first prisoners arriving at the prison from Afghanistan .
The images of these shackled and dehumanized figures , clad in orange , kneeling on gravel in painful stress positions , and with their eyes and ears blocked , have come to define the " War on Terror " as much as the notorious photos of abuse in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
At the time , the administration claimed that the prisoners were " the worst of the worst . "
On January 22 , defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld declared , " These people are committed terrorists .
We are keeping them off the street and out of the airlines and out of nuclear power plants and out of ports across this country and across other countries . "
On a visit to Guant�namo on January 27 , he claimed that the prisoners were " among the most dangerous , best - trained , vicious killers on the face of the earth . "
In the weeks that followed , however , this hardcore rhetoric slipped , when Brig .
Gen . Mike Lehnert of the Marines , who was the prison�s first commander , admitted , " A large number claim to be Taliban , a smaller number we have been able to confirm as al - Qaeda , and a rather large number in the middle we have not been able to determine their status .
Many of the detainees are not forthcoming .
Many have been interviewed as many as four times , each time providing a different name and different information . "
Although no one knew it at the time , this frank admission neatly encapsulated all that was wrong with Guant�namo .
Following a Military Order issued in November 2001 and an Executive Order issued in February 2002 ( PDF ) , the administration had labeled all the prisoners as " unlawful enemy combatants , " who could be held without charge or trial , and had , moreover , deprived them of the protections of the Geneva Conventions , but in fact little was known about any of them .
In Afghanistan , where most of the prisoners had been held and processed before their long flight to Guant�namo , in brutal , makeshift prisons inside the US bases at Kandahar airport and Bagram airbase , the US military had been ordered to dispense with the Geneva Conventions �
Article 5 competent tribunals .
The hearings , which involved calling witnesses close to the time and place of capture , were a traditional manner of separating soldiers from civilians caught up in the fog of war .
During the first Gulf War , for example , the military held 1,196 competent tribunals , and in nearly three - quarters of them the prisoners were found to be innocent and were subsequently released .
Moreover , as Chris Mackey ( the pseudonym of a former interrogator at Kandahar and Bagram ) explained in his book The Interrogators , this lack of screening was compounded by instructions from the Pentagon , which stipulated that all " non-Afghan Taliban / foreign fighters " were to be sent to Guant�namo .
As Mackey noted , " Strictly speaking , that meant every Arab we encountered was in for a long - term stay and an eventual trip to Cuba . "
The same , it transpired , happened to the majority of the 220 or so Afghans who were also bound like beasts and flown to Guant�namo .
It took years for the truth to emerge : that there had been no screening process for the " worst of the worst , " and that , although perhaps 40 of the 779 prisoners who have been held at Guant�namo were involved with al - Qaeda , the other 95 percent were either completely innocent men � humanitarian aid workers , missionaries , economic migrants , drifters or others fleeing religious persecution � or foot soldiers for the Taliban , recruited to fight an inter-Muslim civil war that began long before 9/11 .
Some of these men may well have held anti-American sentiments � based , it must be said , on America�s foreign policy , rather then a hatred of Americans and American values � but few , if any had any meaningful knowledge of al - Qaeda , the 9/11 attacks , or any other terrorist plots ( until a handful of significant prisoners were transferred into Guant�namo from secret CIA prisons in September 2006 ) , and no one knew the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden , despite being asked ad nauseam .
For terror cells to be successful , secrecy is the key .
As few people as possible must know the plans , and in this al - Qaeda had been particularly successful .
For the rest of the prisoners � the Afghans � the truth was equally bleak .
Dozens were unwilling Taliban recruits , forced to serve on pain of death or punishment , and numerous others were betrayed by rivals , who took advantage of the gullibility of the US forces .
Deprived of useful intelligence in Afghanistan for at least a decade , and unwilling to risk US troops in a full - scale invasion , the administration arranged for Special Forces to topple the Taliban by forging alliances with various warlords , whom they recruited to fight their battles for them , even though they had no knowledge of the complicated tribal nature of Afghan society , and were blind to the fact that the corruption of many of their new - found allies had prompted the rise of the Taliban in the first place .
Towering over all these failures was the money : Toyota Landcruisers stuffed full of dollar bills , used to secure the warlords � dubious services , and bounty payments of $ 5,000 a head for " al - Qaeda and Taliban suspects . "
These offers were printed on leaflets prepared by the military�s PsyOps teams and airdropped into villages , where , as the leaflets proudly proclaimed , " You can receive millions of dollars for helping the anti-Taliban force catch al - Qaeda and Taliban murderers .
This is enough money to take care of your family , your village , your tribe for the rest of your life � pay for livestock and doctors and school books and housing for all your people . "
In Pakistan alone , President Pervez Musharraf bragged , in his 2006 autobiography , that in return for handing over 369 terror suspects ( including many transferred to Guant�namo ) , " We have earned bounty payments totaling millions of dollars . "
The notorious PsyOps leaflet , offering substantial rewards for " al - Qaeda and Taliban suspects " II .
Long before any of this came to light , however , the administration compounded its initial failure to screen the prisoners by embarking on a cruel and misconceived attempt to unlock their mostly non-existent secrets .
The end result resembled nothing less than the activities of the witch - hunters of the seventeenth century .
The administration began with a presumption of guilt , and any protestation of innocence was regarded as the sign of a terrorist trained to resist interrogation by al - Qaeda .
Those who confessed � however implausible their confessions � were rewarded , while those who remained silent � either because they were genuine terrorists or , at the other end of the spectrum , because they had no intelligence to provide , and were unable or unwilling to dissemble � were subjected to an array of " enhanced interrogation techniques , " which , under any criteria other than those embraced by the administration , would have been regarded as torture .
The authorization for the use of " enhanced interrogation techniques , " beyond those approved in the Army Field Manual ( in which physical violence is prohibited and the emphasis is on psychological maneuvers with a proven track record ) , was signaled in August 2002 .
In an extraordinary document , known as the " torture memo " after it was leaked in 2004 , a number of government lawyers in the Justice Department�s Office of Legal Counsel , which interprets the law as it applies to the Executive , attempted to redefine torture .
Under the terms of the UN Convention Against Torture , to which the US is a signatory , torture is defined as " any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted on a person . "
However , the lawyers � John Yoo and Jay S. Bybee , under the guidance of David Addington , General Counsel to Vice President Dick Cheney � decided that , for interrogation to count as torture , the pain endured " must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function , or even death . "
The definition of torture was adjusted partly so that the most senior figures in the administration � including President Bush � could keep a straight face when they declared that America " does not torture , " but it was also revised so that the use of techniques previously regarded as torture , such as waterboarding ( an ancient torture technique that involves controlled drowning ) , could be used on an a number of " high - value detainees " held in secret CIA prisons .
The general population was not subjected to the worst of these techniques , but in the fall of 2002 , in response to requests from senior officials at Guant�namo for the approval of harsher techniques to " break " what were regarded as particularly uncooperative prisoners , Donald Rumsfeld approved a number of previously prohibited techniques , mainly drawn from the US military�s SERE program ( Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ) , which trains the US military to resist interrogation if captured by enemy forces .
These included the use of prolonged solitary confinement and sleep deprivation , 20 - hour interrogations , forced nudity , forced grooming ( the shaving of hair and beards ) , the use of extreme heat and cold , sexual and religious humiliation , and the use of painful stress positions .
Regarded individually , the majority of these techniques would fit the UN definition of torture , but when they were applied together , as they frequently were , there was no doubt that the administration had crossed a line that should not have been crossed , and that Guant�namo had become an experimental prison , focused on interrogation ( which itself contravenes the Geneva Conventions ) , in which the use of torture had become commonplace .
III .
It was inevitable , of course , that America�s leaders would react to the attacks of September 11 , 2001 with a show of colossal force .
The world�s preeminent military power had not been attacked on its own territory since Pearl Harbor in 1941 , and was hardly likely to sit back after such a devastating and symbolic terrorist attack .
However , those in charge could hardly have been less qualified to react to the attacks in an appropriate manner .
Behind the presidential fa�ade of George W. Bush , most of the key decisions about America�s response to the attacks were made by Vice President Dick Cheney , with support from defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld , and crucial advice from key lawyers including David Addington and John Yoo .
All believed that presidential power had been unjustly eroded since the scandal that forced the resignation of Richard Nixon ( under whom both Cheney and Rumsfeld had served ) .
Addington and Cheney had become friends in the Reagan administration , as they tried to shield the President from the fallout from the Iran - Contra scandal , and Yoo , a latecomer , had swallowed their rhetoric whole .
For these men , it was , therefore , predictable that the response to the 9/11 attacks would be a wide - ranging " War on Terror " � rather than a targeted pursuit of a small number of criminals � which granted the President the right to indulge his powers as Commander - in - Chief without any outside interference , but it also played more generally into their long - cherished desire for unfettered executive power .
First they secured Congressional approval for the Authorization of Use of Military Force , the founding document of the " war , " which authorized the President " to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations , organizations , or persons he determines planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , or harbored such organizations or persons . "
The rest followed more stealthily under the cover of these sweeping wartime powers : the warrantless wiretapping of US citizens ; the Military Order giving the President the right to seize and detain " enemy combatants " indefinitely , or to prosecute them in special trials by Military Commission ; a memo of January 2002 dismissing the provisions of the Geneva Conventions as " quaint " and " obsolete " ; the Executive Order removing the prisoners � protections under the Geneva Conventions ; the " torture memo " of August 2002 ; and the approval for reverse engineering SERE techniques for use on prisoners at Guant�namo .
Significantly , not everyone working behind the scenes in the " War on Terror " was happy with these developments .
Amongst the most critical were several of the agencies working on interrogations at Guant�namo , who were appalled .
The FBI , the Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) and even the Defense Department�s own Criminal Investigation Task Force ( CITF ) all refused to take part in coercive interrogations , and Alberto J. Mora , the Navy�s General Counsel , even took his complaints to the Pentagon .
In January 2003 , he threatened to reveal publicly the details of the program unless the " enhanced interrogation techniques " were withdrawn .
Rumsfeld agreed , but immediately set up a working group to approve the techniques in a mildly amended form , although Mora was not informed .
When the Abu Ghraib scandal broke in April 2004 , Mora realized the extent to which he had been sidelined .
He told the journalist Jane Mayer , " Everything we had warned against in Guant�namo had happened � but in a different setting . "
IV .
While these struggles remained largely hidden from view , however , other challenges were more difficult to dismiss .
Legal challenges to the legitimacy of Guant�namo began almost as soon as the prison opened in January 2002 , although it took nearly two and half years for the cases to reach the Supreme Court , allowing the administration a shockingly large window of opportunity to indulge in its extra-legal abuses .
In many ways , the Guant�namo project�s viability was shattered on June 29 , 2004 , when the Supreme Court ruled , in Rasul v. Bush , that the prisoners had habeas corpus rights ; in other words , the right to ask a judge why they were being held , under the 800 - year old " Great Writ , " a cornerstone of American justice , inherited from the British , which prevents arbitrary detention .
Crucially , the Rasul verdict allowed lawyers to visit the prison ( to begin filing habeas petitions on behalf of the prisoners ) and finally pierced the veil of secrecy that had been necessary for systemic abuse to take place .
In other respects , however , the administration refused to be swayed by Rasul .
Instead of allowing the prisoners access to the US courts , as the Supreme Court intended , the authorities introduced administrative reviews � the Combatant Status Review Tribunals ( CSRTs ) � to ascertain whether , on capture , the prisoners had been correctly designated as " enemy combatants . "
These were a pale mockery of the Article 5 competent tribunals , not just because they took place two and a half years too late , and half a world away from the time and place of capture , but in particular because of reasons identified in June 2007 by Lt. Col .
Stephen Abraham , a veteran of US intelligence , who had worked on the tribunals .
In an affidavit for one of the Guant�namo cases , Lt. Col .
Abraham declared that the entire process relied on intelligence " of a generalized nature � often outdated , often ' generic , � rarely specifically relating to the individual subjects of the CSRTs or to the circumstances related to those individuals � status , " and was designed , essentially , to rubber - stamp the prisoners � prior designation as " enemy combatants " without any meaningful review .
Lt. Col . Abraham was undoubtedly correct , as the steady flow of released prisoners � stories has demonstrated in the years since the CSRTs were convened .
Appallingly , however , America�s politicians have never stood up to the administration�s crimes .
In response to Rasul , Congress obliged the administration by passing the Detainee Treatment Act ( DTA ) , which cast the prisoners � habeas appeals into a legal limbo , and in 2006 , after the Supreme Court made another ground - breaking decision , ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld ( PDF ) that the Military Commission trial system was illegal , they compounded the error by passing the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) , which revived the Commissions , further stripped the prisoners of their habeas rights , and , for good measure , reinforced the President�s right to seize and detain anyone he regarded as an " enemy combatant " ( PDF ) .
These failings were only finally addressed in June 2008 , when , in a third significant decision regarding Guant�namo ( Boumediene v. Bush ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the prisoners had constitutional habeas corpus rights .
Six and a half years after Guant�namo opened , this ruling finally meant that the prisoners � cases would be heard in a US court .
This was a belated triumph for justice ( although both the Bush and Obama administrations have since done all in their power to delay the progress of the habeas cases ) , but it was not enough to undo the damage that had already been done .
For most of the prisoners released from Guant�namo , it was politics rather than justice that secured their freedom .
The lawyers � struggles , and the interventions of the judiciary , were enormously significant , but when it came down to it , public pressure in the prisoners � home countries , and diplomatic pressure exerted by their home governments , played a more significant role .
The real failure lay with Congress , which capitulated when confronted by an Executive branch that regarded its influence with disdain , and , it must be said , with the American public , who were prepared to let their President and Vice President seize dictatorial powers , undermine the US Constitution , shred the Geneva Conventions , spurn habeas corpus , tear up the Bill of Rights , discard the Army Field Manual , create a system of show trials for terrorists out of thin air , spy on American citizens with impunity , and pour scorn on the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment .

Ultra-Powerful Laser Reproduces How Star's Jets Travel through Interstellar Space
A multi-trillion - watt laser at the University of Rochester has simulated a stellar jet — an outpouring of matter from a fledgling star — with unprecedented realism .
The achievement , which is detailed in the latest issue of the Astrophysical Journal , is the latest in a series of experiments in which scientists from around the world have converged on the University of Rochester 's Laboratory for Laser Energetics ( LLE ) to recreate astronomical events in a laboratory .
The team , led by Pat Hartigan at Rice University , used the LLE 's Omega laser , one of the most powerful lasers in the world , to reproduce the way a stellar jet behaves when it slams into giant clouds of dust and gas that exist where stars are born .
" The LLEs ' Omega has become the premier facility for laboratory astrophysics experiments because it can explore situations too complicated to study in any other way , " says Adam Frank , professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester and one of the computational scientists in the study .
" Even 3 - D computer simulations often lack the resolution to study these new aspects of stellar jet evolution properly .
The Omega laser let us create a tiny artificial jet and blast it into a foam cloud to see what happens .
The results gave us new insights into what happens in nature on scales a trillion trillion times larger . "
Frank explains that stellar jets form when magnetic fields around a newly born star force matter to shoot from the star 's poles at hundreds of miles per second .
This relatively simply method of creation suggests that the jets themselves should be fairly simple in shape , but stellar jets usually take on convoluted and varied shapes .
Frank says that some of this complexity may be due to interactions with the surrounding stellar environment .
In its recent experiments , the group using the Omega laser found that jets will be strongly deflected when they run into a dense cloud , creating a high - speed splatter of plasma .
For the jet - cloud experiment , the scientists at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics fired the Omega at a marble - sized piece of titanium .
In just a few millionths of a second , the Omega laser released multi-trillion watt bursts of energy �more power than is in the entire electrical grid of the United States �making it among the three most powerful lasers in the world .
The laser almost instantaneously heated the titanium into a plasma and propelled it toward a sphere of plastic embedded in foam .
Frank says the titanium plasma acts very much like a stellar jet , and the sphere acts very much like interstellar gas .
" The deflection and splatter we saw in the experiments showed us key features of how real astrophysical jets will respond in complicated environments , " says Frank .
" But this was a really complicated experiment which could only have been done on the LLE 's Omega laser .
It 's really helping us think about these jets in new ways . "
One of the novel aspects of the program was the acquisition and use of new astronomical data to compare to the simulation .
" This had never been done before " says Frank .
Hartigan used high - power telescopes to get new images of Herbig Haro 110 , a stellar jet hundreds of light years away , which is being deflected by a nearby star - forming cloud .
" We used those images to compare with the experiments which then helped us think about the whole jet cloud deflection process differently .
This is the first time that new astrophysical data has been taken explicitly for a laboratory astrophysics experiment "
This research was funded by the Department of Energy , the National Science Foundation and NASA .
It was part of the National Laser User Facility program run by the LLE where researchers from around the country and can use the Omega system for cutting - edge science .
The team included Frank , Hartigan and J. M. Foster and P. A. Rosen of the Atomic Weapons Establishment , Aldermaston U.K. ; B. H. Wilde and R. F. Coker of the Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , N.M. ; J. F. Hansen of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , Calif. , B. E. Blue of General Atomics , San Diego , Calif . ; and R. Carver of Rice University .
" Our group was run by an astronomer from Rice , had plasma physicists from around the country and the world and it utilized the amazing talent at Rochester 's LLE , " says Frank .
" It 's really a unique opportunity and a unique program . "
The Umpire was built in 1941 by George and Glenn McElroy , the Ohio brothers considered to be the Stradivariuses of ventriloquist dummies .
The figure stands six feet tall and was meant to work the plate at a girls ’ softball game .
( Remote - controlled sewing - machine motors raise each arm to call balls and strikes . )
But the Umpire never ended up being used .
He ’d been packed in plastic in a garage and then a basement for five decades — chipped in places and blighted by mold — by the time the stand - up comedian and ventriloquist Jeff Dunham got him last spring .
Dunham , who builds the dummies he uses and restores antique ones as a hobby , went to work .
He was finishing the job one night last July , gluing on a new , male - patterned ring of hair and comically bushy eyebrows .
Dunham is 47 , with feathery brown hair and a habit of curling his mouth into an overbite when he finds something hilarious .
He beams with regular - guyness .
Recently , Forbes listed him as the third - highest - earning comedian in America , after Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock , both of whom make their piles largely on television syndication and film royalties .
Dunham has neither ; his first series , “ The Jeff Dunham Show , ” had its premiere on Comedy Central on Oct. 22 .
Instead , he has toured relentlessly for 25 years .
In the past year , he has played 150 shows and grossed $ 38 million in ticket sales , far more than any other comic .
Last November , Dunham separated from his wife of 14 years , with whom he has raised three daughters .
His new girlfriend , Audrey Murdick , who is 29 and also his nutritionist , was helping with the Umpire , handing Dunham swatches of eyebrow .
He was matching his work to a photo on his MacBook .
It showed the McElroys standing with the just - completed Umpire in their workshop .
It ’s a famous photo ; later , when I met some of Dunham ’s ventriloquist friends , they knew what time the clock in the background showed .
As a boy , Dunham saw the picture in a ventriloquism museum every summer , while attending a ventriloquist convention in Kentucky .
“ I ’d think , Man , I want to see him , ” he told me , smoothing down the Umpire ’s lapels .
“ The fact that I ’m standing here fixing him up is too wacky . ”
It was wacky .
Especially because we were in the back of Dunham ’s mammoth black tour bus , outside the Prairie Capital Convention Center , an arena in Springfield , Ill. , where he had just performed for a sold - out crowd of 7,000 as part of his summer tour .
For close to two hours , Dunham had loosed a big stew of jokes , ranging from goofy to racist and homophobic , but which — delivered by puppets , with Dunham making disapproving faces — managed to feel almost wholesome , and even a little square .
An exchange with Walter , Dunham ’s crotchety - old - man character , went like this :
Dunham : “ Your wife is supposed to be your soul mate . ”
Walter : “ I think she ’s my cell mate . ”
It was followed by a story about making a sex tape .
Peanut , a hyperactive purple Muppetish dummy , kicked off his portion of the show just by saying different words for breasts — “ bodacious ta - tas ” got the biggest laugh — and closed with a bit about ordering Chinese food , done in a preposterous Fu Manchu accent .
By the encore , when Dunham brought out his redneck character to do a routine from his first DVD , all 7,000 people in the arena were ecstatically chanting the dummy ’s punch lines together — a choir of thrown voices .
( Dunham : “ Do you have a drinking problem ? ” Everyone : “ No !
I ’ve pretty much got it figured out ! ” )
Then , when it was over — after Dunham fired some balled - up Jeff Dunham T - shirts into the upper decks with the kind of air - powered bazooka you see during N.B.A. halftimes — he literally ran out the arena ’s back door and onto his bus , where he went back to work on the Umpire .
Mikhail Gorbachev , head of state of the Soviet Union when it withdrew from Afghanistan , has two words for Barack Obama : get out .
Gorbachev , now 78 , said in an interview in Berlin that he sees no chance of American success in Afghanistan even with more troops .
" I believe that there is no prospect of a military solution , " he said .
The U.S. " should be preparing the ground for withdrawal rather than additional troops . "
Gorbachev noted there was little chance that Obama would take his advice .
Maybe yes , maybe no .
ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos offers a ray of hope .
He says Obama is looking for " off ramps " out of Afghanistan , that Obama ’s not satisfied with what he ’s heard so far from his advisers , and well he should not be .
In early 2009 when Gen. Mark McKiernan was still in charge of Afghanistan , then brand new President Obama nixed a full bore surge of troops there because McKiernan could n’t say what he ’d do with them and the Joint Chiefs of Staff could n’t describe an end state for the conflict .
We still do n’t have a coherent strategy for Afghanistan and there ’s no end state in sight .
If we continue to pour blood and money into Afghanistan , we ’ll be there for at least another 20 years , and if we ever leave , we ’ll have done more harm than good .
We ’re just recruiting terrorists .
Obama would do well to sack most of his senior advisers .
Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman , Adm . Mike Mullen , is as full of gas as the Goodyear Blimp .
He has said , " If we do n’t get a level of legitimacy and governance [ in Afghanistan ] , then all the troops in the world are n’t going to make any difference . "
But he ’s also part of the triumvirate that includes Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who want Obama to send 30,000 or more additional troops to Afghanistan .
We wo n’t get legitimacy and governance in Afghanistan .
Hamid Karzai and his family are among the biggest crooks on the planet , and the CIA has been funding them .
And we ’re stuck with them .
Pakistan is controlled by its military and its Inter - Services Intelligence Agency ( ISI ) .
ISI has ties to all of the terrorist groups in the region , according to Pakistan ’s former military leader Pervez Musharraf .
Maybe that give some credence to reports that Hillary Clinton has taken to dealing directly with Pakistan ’s military and the ISI .
But why should we even be bothering with these people ?
They ’re not worth the trouble .
Any assertion that we ’re in Af - Pak because of terrorism , or 9/11 , is a crock of horse mustard .
We ’re not even sure whom we ’re fighting there .
There are probably fewer than 100 al - Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan , and less than 300 of them in the tribal areas of Pakistan .
We and our NATO coolies already have more than 100,000 troops in the theater .
The Taliban , who are n’t a threat to our national security , number at best around 25,000 .
We already have a force advantage — when we count Afghan security forces , of 12 to one .
If we give Stan McChrystal the U.S. troops he wants , and plus up Afghan forces to 400,000 as he projects , we ’ll end up with an astronomical numeric advantage .
And it wo n’t do a bit of good .
We ’re experiencing the kind of madness C.S. Forester described in The General , a novel of World War I that notes how career British military officers drove their country to mindless slaughter of its youth and how mindless and spineless politicians let them get away with it .
Forester is the one who compared the senseless trench warfare of the Great War to a group of dimwits haplessly trying to pull a screw out of the floor with a hammer claw , never imagining they could accomplish the task easily with a screwdriver .
Today ’s American generals figure they can keep their wars going as long as they keep the friendly casualties low .
They know , at some level , that the wars they ’re in are unwinnable .
But they do n’t want to lose them , and as long as they can keep them going they wo n’t lose .
That ’s the crux of the Long War strategy , which is n’t so much a strategy as it is a theology , or an ideology , or something akin to voodoo .
The dudes behind the Long War — the top tier of which includes Gen. David Petraeus and Adm. Mike Mullen — are n’t interested in defending America .
They ’re interested in preserving the military - industrial - congressional complex , and the trillion - plus dollar annual bite it takes out of the federal budget .
( Plausible estimates place our military spending at almost $ 1.5 trillion , 54 percent of annual federal government spending . )
The latest media swag , from the increasingly war - friendly Washington Post , says that " Military planners will present President Obama with several options for how to proceed in Afghanistan on Wednesday afternoon that at a minimum would send 20,000 additional U.S. troops . "
How tragic .
20,000 troops wo n’t make a bit of difference in that conflict .
It will just put 20,000 more American kids in harm ’s way for no purpose .
We committed a half - million troops to Vietnam and they did n’t to a bit of good there .
Gorbachev is right .
We should be preparing to haul buns out of Afghanistan , not getting stuck further in the crack than we already are .
In a Veterans ’ Day speech , Obama said , " As long as I am Commander in Chief , I am going to do right by [ its service members ] .
American will not let you down , we will take care of our own . "
If Obama is serious about that promise , he ’ll follow Gorbachev ’s advice , not the hawkish screech chorus of his generals and their supporters in Congress and the press .
Obama met today with his national security team for the eighth time for another skull dig , possibly the last one until he announces what he ’s going to do about Af - Pak .
If Obama really wants out of Afghanistan , he does n’t need an off ramp .
He just needs to pull off the road his generals and the hawks in Congress want him to take .
Just say nyet , Mr. President .
Pull the plug on this misadventure .
Karl Eikenberry , U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan and former general in command of forces in the country , has warned Obama against sending additional troops as well .
The good news : Obama has rejected the four options that his national security team has presented him .
It ’s sounding more every day like he ’s come to his senses , and understands Afghanistan is not a " war of necessity , " and wants a way out .
As Seymour Hersh told Rachel Maddow on MSNBC Wednesday night , Obama may be putting his foot down .
Let ’s hope so .
It ’s about time .
Richard Mack ’s story is taken from his chapter , “ Prohibition : The Enemy of Freedom , ” in the book , The New Prohibition : Voices of Dissent Challenge the Drug War ( 2004 ) .
Other highlights include the following .
Marijuana made him happy :
The marijuana made me somewhat dizzy , and I do mean somewhat ; it was certainly minimal , and it made me a little happy and I got the “ munchies . ” ( p. 16 )
Alcohol made him gag ( literally ) although he reports Hamm ’s beer “ went down the easiest ” ( p. 16 ) :
I saw people who smoked pot all day and others who drank all day .
The pot smokers were much more in control of their physical and mental faculties than the drinkers were .
In all my twenty years of law enforcement I have never seen a person who has smoked marijuana to be in a condition of staggering , slobbering , and throwing up .
Too many times , however , I have seen booze drinkers in such a condition , and much worse .
( p. 16 )
Debating arresting his friend , Ted , whom he met as an undercover :
Ted and I were different .
He smoked , he drank , at times he used marijuana , and his morals were not in line with my Mormon background .
But he was a good man .
He cared about his children , and he was a hard worker .
He was loyal and understanding , and he had a great sense of humor ….
Why were we arresting people , some really decent people , for smoking marijuana ?
Should we arrest all the “ Teds ” in the country ?
Take his sports car , ruin his career , give him an arrest record and some jail time , and maybe overall just teach him a lesson ? ( pp. 13-14 )

According to police , Oliver was spotted putting a brown Polo shirt valued at approximately $ 110 into a shopping bag .
He was cited at 1:45 p.m. , and Tennessee 's game that night kicked off at 7 p.m .
Oliver 's punishment was handled internally , but he was taken off the dress roster for that game and banned from team activities , according to Tennessee athletic department spokesperson Tiffany Carpenter .
Four days after Oliver 's run-in with the law , Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin went on the SEC coaches teleconference and praised his team for not having any arrests in 11 months .
Then early the next morning , freshmen Nu'Keese Richardson , Mike Edwards and Janzen Jackson were arrested and charged with attempting to rob two people sitting in a car outside a convenience store near campus .
Vols coaches are holding out hope that the charges against Jackson may still be dropped , although Kiffin would n't comment specifically Tuesday on the chances of Jackson returning to the team .
" We do n't have all [ Jackson 's ] information in , " Kiffin said .
" I can't get into too much detail with it .
But the easiest thing to look at is that he was released right away and was treated differently in this matter .
You can tell that by what has come out .
I can't get into too much more detail than that until we get the information in . "
Following his arrest , Jackson 's bond was reduced and he was released on his own recognizance .
The other two players had to post bond before being released .
Jackson is also one of the better freshman players in the SEC and has been a key component in the Vols ' defense .
He has n't played in the last two games but had started in all but the opener at free safety prior to his suspension for the Memphis game .
None of the three players arrested last week made the trip for the Ole Miss game .
Kiffin said Jackson 's suspension for the Memphis game was an administrative suspension , but sources have told ESPN.com that a failed drug test was one of the factors that led to Jackson 's suspension .
Kiffin called it a sad day in having to dismiss Richardson and Edwards but said the team was more important than any one or two players .
" Our No. 1 rule is to protect the team , " Kiffin said .
" As the head coach , I have to make decisions that sometimes you do n't want to make .
It was a sad day yesterday for those two kids .
I wish them the best of luck .
They obviously made a very poor decision .
We can't allow that to be a part of our team .
That decision - making can't be anywhere near what we are doing .
" The last thing I want is to have something like that go on and keep people around who do that , then go in on someone 's couch and say , ' When you come here , we 're going to have a great culture .
This is the best place for your son . '
I had to make the best decision for our team , " he said .

An Auckland computer programmer strangled his girlfriend to death then lived with her decomposing body for nearly a month , a court has been told .
Gordon Hieatt , 48 , is accused of murdering his " on-again , off again " girlfriend Nuttidar Vaikaew , 48 , between April 17 and May 12 this year .
Thai national Ms Vaikaew , known as " Sky " , worked as a prostitute out of her flat in Warwick Street , Western Springs prior to her death .
The court heard that Hieatt had moved in with her several months before the incident .
At a depositions hearing at the Auckland District Court this morning prosecutor Rachael Reed said the accused had killed his girlfriend after having an argument with her in early April .
Ms Vaikaew had not been seen by neighbours or her landlord for nearly a month and so on the afternoon of May 12 her landlord , Ray Goffin , went to visit her home .
After knocking several times on the door of Ms Vaikaew 's flat , Hieatt answered the door and said to Mr Goffin , " I am Gordon , Nuttidar 's boyfriend , Nuttidar is sick and she has been sick for a few days " .
Mr Goffin became suspicious and rang police , Ms Reed told the court .
When police arrived at the home and enquired after Ms Vaikaew , Hieatt answered the door and told them : " She 's dead and has been dead for four weeks .
We had an argument and I killed her , " the court heard .
Police discovered her body in the bed in the lounge room , covered by sheets and bedding , Ms Reed said .
Later Hieatt told police he had " choked " Ms Vaikaew on April 17 .
" He said they had an argument and it got out of hand , " Ms Reed said .
The police will call nine witnesses over the two - day depositions hearing .

映画『ボヘミアン・ラプソディ』公開時に書いた文章で、とても評判が良かったエントリである。
で、このエントリのはてなブックマークだが、本文執筆時点で
4users である……って、はぁ？
そんなわけはない。今週のはてなブログランキング〔2018年12月第1週〕にランキング入りもしているくらいで、その時点のブックマーク数は 294users である。
さらに Wayback Machine を調べてみると、2019年9月5日時点で、ブックマーク数が 303users なのが分かる。
いったいどうなってんだ？ 落ち目の定評があるはてなだから、ユーザ数の減少もあるだろう。意識的にブックマークを外したユーザもいるかもしれない。しかし、10や20じゃなく、およそ300減るなんてべらぼうな話だ。
本件についてははてなに通知済で、6月15日にただいま調査中の報告を受けているが、いまだ回復していない。
そして、先日もっとすごい事例を見つけた。

これはワタシのブログで最大のはてなブックマーク数を誇るエントリである。いや、「である」でなく「だった」と過去形にすべきだろう。なぜなら、本文執筆時点のはてなブックマーク数は

これは壮絶である。このエントリははてなブログランキング
2月17日版で1位に輝いたエントリで、その時点でブックマーク数は 938users だった。それが今は 3users（笑）。
こちらも Wayback Machine を調べると、2019年4月10日時点で 951users である。見る影もないとはこのことである。
このエントリは前述の通り、ワタシのブログの中で最大のはてなブックマース数だったから気づいたが、同じように数百単位でブックマークが消える現象が他のエントリについても起こっているかもしれない。もちろんワタシ以外のユーザの皆さんにも。
はてなブックマーク数が多かろうが少なかろうがどうでもいいともいえる。数が多かったらワタシにお金が入るわけでもないし、逆にそれが激減したからといって、それに応じて読者の数が激減するわけでもないだろう。
しかし、（ワタシは利用していないが）ブログのサイドバーにそのブログにおけるはてなブックマークの人気エントリを表示させているユーザがいる。そのブログにとって代表作といえるエントリがそこにあるべきなのになかったら、はてなはユーザに損害を与えていると言えないか。
少し前にもはてなブログからのはてなダイアリーへのリンクの飛び先がおかしい現象やはてなブログで asin 記法が正しく機能していないところがある話を報告させてもらったが、不具合でははてなブックマークも負けていないのかもしれない。
今のはてなの技術陣にこの問題の解決は期待できないが、現象の再現を見つけたので良い機会としてブログでとりあげさせてもらう。

Editor 's note : Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable , a popular blog about social media .
He is writing a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNN.com .
London , England ( CNN ) --
If Rupert Murdoch gets his way -- and he's not simply bluffing -- you may one day need to " Bing it " rather than " Google it " to find news stories online .
Murdoch 's News Corp. , which owns the Wall Street Journal and New York Post , among others , reportedly has discussed with Microsoft a plan to remove its newspaper content from Google 's search results .
If it 's enacted , news consumers would have to head to Microsoft 's Bing to find stories from some of the world 's biggest news sources .
Other news companies have signaled they may follow suit .
They could receive payment from Microsoft for doing so .
The idea is preposterous .
Online news distribution has created increased competition and caused greater efficiencies , and Murdoch is determined to lay the blame for this seismic shift on Google , which delivers more than 25 percent of traffic to his WSJ.com property .
The search engine company is made of " content kleptomaniacs " , Murdoch roars , and he says Google needs to pay up .
That argument is the digital equivalent of chastising the paperboy for delivering your newspapers door to door -- and then demanding he pay for the privilege .
If the Microsoft deal proceeds , it will be a losing proposition for both consumers and News Corp. itself .
Only one participant will come out ahead : Microsoft .
Meanwhile , the greatest beneficiaries would n't be those cutting the deal -- the thousands of news sites competing with News Corp. would see a boost in their Google rankings .
Consumers lose
The move would almost certainly be harmful to news consumers : Removing content from Google is akin to banning the leading news agent from selling your newspapers .
How many hoops will readers jump through to find News Corp. content rather than that of rival publications ?
Those consumers made aware of the change will be forced to switch search engines , while the uninformed majority will simply receive a poorer search experience at Google .
The more serious concern is that the move sets a precedent .
Microsoft is said to be talking to multiple news organizations about de-indexing their content from Google , while the Denver Post and the Dallas Morning News indicated on Tuesday that they too may pull some of their stories from the search giant in favor of a paid deal with Bing .
If search engines cut deals with content creators to exclude competitors , there will cease to be a single index of the entire Web .
Consumers will need to hop from one search engine to another to find the information they desire .
WSJ ?
You need Bing for that .
New York Times ?
Google has the exclusive search rights .
Competitors gain ground
De-indexing pages from Google will mean reduced traffic and thus ad revenues for News Corp .
The WSJ alone could face an estimated $ 15 million decline in revenue .
Microsoft 's offer could provide adequate recompense .
But the true price is far greater : News Corp .'s exclusion from the online conversation .
The deal would convert mass media properties to niche publications , available only to those die - hard fans prepared to venture beyond Google 's vast index .
News Corp.'s absence would likely create a virtuous circle for Murdoch 's competitors .
Those looking to cite news articles online typically turn to Google for their research .
Citations will instead go to those News Corp. competitors that rank highly in Google 's results .
As they draw more links , these sites will rise yet higher in Google 's rankings , driving further traffic and links .
Microsoft lands a marketing pitch
News Corp.'s competitors aside , another clear victor is Microsoft .
If the software giant can convince multiple news outlets to ink similar deals , the company could claim a marketing coup .
In a recent blog post , Web entrepreneur Jason Calacanis proposed a new Microsoft ad campaign : " Want to search the New York Times , Wall Street Journal , USA Today and 3,894 other newspapers and magazines ?
Well , then do n't go to Google because they do n't have them !
Go to Bing , home of quality content you can trust ! "
Despite a victory for its competitor , reports suggest Google would see little impact on its bottom line .
Bernstein Research analyst Jeffrey Lindsay notes that " the financial impact of News Corp . 's abstention of Google would be small because news is one of the less attractive areas for keyword advertisers . "
A closed model for an open Web
News Corp .'s posturing attempts to force the toothpaste back into the tube .
In the print era , content and distribution were scarce ; to control them was to exert massive influence and gain an insurmountable lead .
In the world of the Web , by contrast , content is abundant and distribution is virtually free .
To limit distribution , then , is an attempt to seize back control .
It 's an effort that likely will prove futile .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore .
Simon Mann has been urged by Foreign Office officials to remain silent about the coup attempt that left him languishing in an African prison , and settle for a " quiet life " with his wife and family in the UK , The Independent on Sunday has learnt .
The veteran mercenary returned to Britain last week after he was pardoned by oil - rich Equatorial Guinea 's President Teodoro Obiang Nguema – the man he had planned to overthrow five years ago .
Mann , with the gratitude of a man sprung 34 years before his sentence was due to run out , apologised for the plot that ended with his incarceration in the notorious Black Beach jail .
He swiftly made it clear he wanted revenge on those he believes made him the " fall guy " – notably the Lebanese millionaire , Ely Calil , and Sir Mark Thatcher , son of the former British prime minister .
Mann 's friends confirmed yesterday that he wanted " justice " for both men – not only for allegedly leaving him to carry the can for the disastrous coup attempt , but also for failing to look after his wife and children while he was in captivity thousands of miles away .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yet they also revealed that Mann has already been subjected to government pressure to keep his mouth shut .
" The Foreign Office did n't do anything to help get him out of that place , but they have been very quick to try to get him to play ball now he is back , " one close friend said .
" Simon has been told it would be in everyone 's best interests if he could just draw a line under this whole thing .
We know the Foreign Office wants to get on - side with EG [ Equatorial Guinea ] as quickly as possible but , frankly , it is also in their own interests for people to stop asking questions about this whole affair . "
Jack Straw , Britain 's foreign secretary at the time of the attempted coup , initially denied that the Government knew about it in advance , but was later forced to admit that he did know .
Whether any attempt was made to stop it , or encourage it , is not known .
Mann has claimed that the UK , US , and Spanish governments all had prior knowledge .
It is clear that , despite the blissful photographs with his wife , Amanda , in the New Forest , Mann 's return home is no neat and happy ending to the sorry saga .
For many individuals , organisations and foreign governments , it could initiate an uncomfortable fresh chapter as questions are asked about the circumstances behind the audacious attempt to depose a hardline ruler and take control of his nation 's oil supplies .
This weekend , as Mann ponders going public with his story – via a newspaper buy - up or , eventually , a book deal – the first significant questions over the credibility of the " coup plot " are beginning to emerge .
Not least among them is whether the operation was ever a real " goer " , as one critic described it : how an experienced former SAS man seriously expected to capture an entire state with just 60 men , and why stopping in Zimbabwe en route was deemed a sensible part of the strategy .
Their plane , a Boeing 727 , was reportedly on the military side of the airfield , and beside it were 50 heavy machine guns , 20 light machine guns , 100 rocket - propelled grenade launchers , 61 assault rifles and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition .
Inconspicuous is not a word that leaps to mind , which , in turn , suggests possible explanations .
It was either a bafflingly naive diversion for a team so steeped in the ways of Africa to make .
Or the conspirators thought the necessary people in Zimbabwe had been squared .
Reports in the Daily Mail claim that the call then went out for Sir Mark Thatcher to use his influence to get Mann and co liberated .
Sir Mark , the paper says , had done oil deals with the Mugabe regime , and often claimed to have considerable pull with the country 's leadership .
But Sir Mark – famous for translating his three Harrovian O -levels and the helpfulness of his surname into a successful life as a trader in commodities ( and with connections that have never entirely been explained ) – allegedly declined to help , and Mann languished in prison .
At around this time , word seeped out that Sir Mark was involved with the plotters .
So , one fine , cocktail - sipping day , he was arrested in his luxury home , tried for financing a helicopter that would have been used in the coup , and fined .
Sir Mark claimed he thought the money was for an air ambulance .
After Mann had been shipped to Equatorial Guinea for trial , he further alleged that Sir Mark , far from being the bankroller of a chopper , was in fact " administrator " of the putative coup .
Now Mann is back and , whether civil servants or his former allies like it or not , he is determined to make sure no one will be able to forget the escapade .
It is clear his former captors share that view .
" One should not underestimate the extent to which the EG government wants this to be the start of a process that gets to the truth about this operation , " one of Mann 's former colleagues said .
" They want an ' in ' with the world community , but not at the expense of getting at those who tried to undermine them .
Simon was genuinely freed on compassionate grounds , but he co-operated with the EG authorities and told them just who was responsible for this whole operation . "
This declaration will fray the nerves of Mann 's alleged comrades .
Mr Calil , who denies financing the plot and Sir Mark have both welcomed Mann 's release in recent days ; Mr Calil , dubbed " The Cardinal " by Mann , has even expressed the hope that " we can talk " .
He has the most to lose – in terms of his reputation , at the very least – if he were linked to the plot .
But his friends maintain he has already been assured by British authorities that he would face no action over the affair .
The claim is in line with the gathering pessimism over Scotland Yard 's ability – or will – to bring anyone else to book .
The EG government alleges that Mann , Sir Mark and others concocted their plot during meetings in London in late 2003 and early 2004 .
But a senior Home Office source said that , although the Metropolitan Police visited Mann at least three times in prison , and received relevant documents from the EG authorities , they were " essentially going through the motions " .
He added : " They are being asked to nail someone for perhaps planning an operation that in the end did n't take place .
I do n't see any will to ask any officer to push this too hard . "
Legal experts now warn of the dangers of pinning a case on Sir Mark , partly because of an apparent lack of credible proof , but also because he has already been convicted of a similar offence on the same evidence .
Although it remains illegal to conspire against another government while in the UK , no one has ever been prosecuted for the offence .
The Met yesterday conceded that an investigation into the Mann affair was " ongoing " , but refused to give further details , including the number of staff engaged in the operation .
Equatorial Guinea dropped its attempts to sue Mr Calil and Sir Mark – and British " security consultant " Greg Wales – after the case reached the House of Lords .
Any chances of getting at the truth – in court or otherwise – appear to rest with Mann alone .
The mercenary claims to have the material – including details of email exchanges with Mr Calil and Sir Mark , and bank details involving front companies in the Channel Islands and elsewhere , which allegedly detail the financial preparations for the operation .
Mann , who is preparing to speak to Met officers later this month , also has a powerful incentive for revenge against his former colleagues .
" He feels incredibly strongly that these people could have come to his rescue , or at least helped his family while he was in captivity . "
Whether he has the ammunition , or the will , to extract revenge is quite another matter .
1 in 6 Americans Live Below the Poverty Line The Census Bureau estimates that 47.4 million Americans are living in poverty .
Oct. 20 , 2009  --
The Census Bureau said today that it estimates 47.4 million Americans are living in poverty , which is 7 million more than the estimate it released earlier this year and translates to one in six Americans .
The disparity between the two estimates comes partly from a difference in the definition of poverty .
The Census Bureau based its earlier estimate on income level -- households falling below a certain level are considered to be living in poverty .
The White House 's Office of Management and Budget mandates that federal agencies use that formula .
The OMB currently sets the poverty line at anything below $ 22,050 a year for a family of four .
But the National Academy of Science offers a different formula , which the Census Bureau used to determine this week 's alternate estimates .
The National Academy of Science 's formula takes into account factors such as where people live , out - of - pocket medical expenses , and the cost of child care .
" We have n't seen rates this high , especially for certain groups , for 25 , 30 years , " said Ron Haskins , senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , and a former White House and congressional advisor on welfare issues .
Today 's numbers show that 7.1 million Americans 65 and older live in poverty -- that 's 3 million more than the previous estimate .
Additionally , 27 million people between the ages of 18 and 64 and 13.3 million children live in poverty .
At the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles , nearly every room -- even offices -- have been converted into shelter space .
A year ago , L.A. County had 5,700 homeless families .
Today there are 8,100 .
Last spring , Colin Kakiza and his family had to move to the Union Rescue Mission after they lost everything because of the tough economic times .
Six months later , he now works there .
" As much as we 're hearing a lot of good news about stimulus packages and turning the economy around , I think beneath the surface we 're still seeing unemployment and foreclosures really bringing forth this new face of homelessness , " Kakiza said .
Life Below the Poverty Line
Monique Sims and her husband lost jobs in construction and retail .
With a new baby and a 12 - year - old son , the couple is struggling to make ends meet .
" For my son , he 's always had everything he wanted , and we have n't been able to give him anything for zero income .
He understands , but it 's hard , " Sims said .
" Next year it will be worse , no question , " Haskins said .
" One of the main causes is rising unemployment and the numbers we have now is only through 2008 . "

Since 2009 , this potatoes au gratin recipe has been a holiday favorite for so many of you .
We ’re sharing it again with you all along with a brand new video .
Enjoy !
With Thanksgiving just a drop of a leaf away , it ’s time to start planning the feasting menu .
Since Diane and I are always working the day before and the day after , we stay local and spend Thanksgiving with Diane ’s family .
The menu is a classic ethnic Thanksgiving , where traditional dishes are entwined with cultural ones .
Turkey , stuffing , potatoes , cha gio ( eggrolls ) , nuoc cham for everything , bun bo hue .
Diane ’s mom takes care of the Vietnamese dishes & we ’ll do the American ( although sometimes we ’ll help a bit with the Viet , too ) .
There is no way that we would get to do everything ourselves .
Stampeding horses could n’t keep Diane ’s mom from cooking .
Us either .
Video showing us making the Potatoes Au Gratin Recipe :
One “ everyone - will - boy cott - if - it - is n ’t - there ” dish that is demanded are these legendary Potatoes Au Gratin .
I do n’t say this lightly .
These Potatoes Au Gratin are amazing , creamy , tender and addicting .
All they need is some time in the oven .
Simplicity can be heavenly , especially when you use good technique , and that completely surmises this Potatoes Au Gratin recipe ( when they are this good , they should always be capitalized . )
It is just a handful of ingredients , the prep is simple and as long as you remember to tend to your taters a couple times as they cook , they are utterly phenomenal .
Because of the simplicity of the ingredients , the little details make all of the difference in the final outcome .
Skip the garlic rub on the baking dish & the flavors wo n’t be complete .
If you use pre-ground pepper and nutmeg instead of the fresh cracked and grated stuff , it wo n’t taste the same .
Same if you use regular table salt instead of sea salt or even Kosher salt .
Not quite as tasty .
If you are using the pre-ground stuff ( please try not to , but sometimes circumstances will dictate that you have to ) cut back on the measurements because each of the ingredients in this recipe have more fluff then their commonplace counterparts .
For the potatoes , good Russets are the best economical choice but if you want to go high - end , grab some Yukon Golds or something similar ( 75 % of the time we use Russets . )
Get the best cream you can ( all creams are not equal ) , then remember to tend to the potatoes as they cook .
A few times while they bake , with the back of a large spoon you ’ll break the crust the cream is starting to form .
This will allow the cream to slowly cook into the potatoes without burning on top and it helps keep the top layer of potatoes from drying out as everything bakes .
For the last 20 - 30 min.
you ’ll leave everything untouched so it will develop a final finishing crust .
The final Potatoes Au Gratin will have a heavenly texture of softened , creamy layered potatoes topped with a golden slightly firmer crust .

All ingredients are approximations .
If you learn to cook this recipe by feel and it becomes very easy to make smaller or larger dishes to suit the occasion .
Total Time 2 hrs Servings : 8 servings Ingredients 4 pounds ( 1800g ) Potatoes , washed and dried
2 whole Garlic Cloves
1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons Kosher or Sea Salt , or to taste
2 teaspoons fresh cracked Black Pepper , or to taste
3/4 teaspoon freshly grated Nutmeg , or to taste
2 1/2 cups ( 600 ml ) Heavy Cream Instructions Preheat oven to 350°F
Crack the garlic cloves break them up slightly then rub the insides of a 9 " x11 " baking dish .
Set aside .
Peel and thinly slice the potatoes - about 1/8 " thick .
Put the sliced potatoes into a large bowl .
Season potatoes with salt , black pepper , and nutmeg .
Get your hands in there and toss the slices to coat evenly .
Slap a potato slice against your tongue to test for seasoning .
It should be noticeably seasoned but not overpoweringly so .
Layer potatoes into the prepared baking dish , smoothing the top so everything is fairly level .
Pour cream over potatoes just to the point where you can press down on the top layer and the potato slices disappear under the cream .
Give a couple presses down on the potatoes then taste cream for seasoning again .
You should just marginally taste the salt .
Add a sprinkle more if needed .
Bake for a total of about 1 1/2 hours ( larger batches will take longer ) .
Every 20 - 30 minutes or so , open the oven and with the back of a large spoon , break the crust the cream is starting to form .
On the final " crusting breaking " the consistency of the cream should noticeably thicker and have absorbed into the potatoes a decent amount .
For the final 20 - 30 minutes , leave everything untouched to form a golden top .
Cream should be nearly all broke down and absorbed with just a bit of creamy , buttery - ness between the potato slices .
Remove from oven allow to cool a bit before serving .
It will retain an intense heat for at least 10 - 15 minutes .

back Microsoft patents file rights management Systems and / or methods are described that enable a user to elevate his or her rights .
In one embodiment , these systems and / or methods present a user interface identifying an account having a right to permit a task in response to the task being prohibited based on a user 's current account not having that right .
Microsoft obtained yesterday patent 7,617,530 , a " rights elevator " : People familiar with UNIX or Linux recognize immediately the file rights management that is inherent in the security that these operating systems offer .
In particular , the command line instruction sudo does exactly what this patent claims : it allows a user to see a file or run a command for which it has no privileges .
The sudo command dates back to around 1980 .
The file rights management predates this by many years .
Is somebody asleep at the wheel at the US Patent Office ?

I have no idea if this patent would withstand the scrutiny typically associated with litigation , I find it remarkable that you apparently have not studied either the references cited during its prosecution , the file history associated with the patent , and its allowed claims .
Considering just the cited references , it appears that many are directed to the systems you note in your article .
For an organization that prides itself on " facts " to support its positions , this seems to be an uncharacteristic departure .
[ Comment at 11/11/2009 09:41 AM by MLS ] Ummm ... did you actually read the claims ?
They include a lot of limitations that go a bit beyond " sudo " -- they are actually pretty narrow as claims go .
As I 'm sure you know , you can't evaluate a patent based solely on the title and description , yet that 's what this post does .
I would expect this sort of breathless , hyperbolic , fact - free article from Slashdot or some other non-IP source , not this blog .
1 . One or more computer - readable media having computer - readable instructions therein that , when executed by a computing device , cause the computing device to present a user interface in response to a task being prohibited based on a user 's current account not having a right to permit the task , the user interface comprising : information indicating the task and an entity that attempted the task ; a selectable help graphic wherein responsive to receiving selection of the selectable help graphic , the computer - readable instructions further cause the computing device to present the information ; identifiers , each of the identifiers identifying other accounts having a right to permit the task , wherein the identifiers presented are based on criteria comprising : frequency of use ; association with the user ; and indication of sufficient but not unlimited rights ; one of the identifiers identifies a higher - rights account having a right to permit the task , wherein the one of the identifiers comprises : a graphic identifying the higher - rights accounts associated with the user ; and a name of the higher - rights account ; an authenticator region capable of receiving , from the user , an authenticator usable to authenticate the higher - rights account having the right to permit the task , wherein : the authenticator comprises a password , and the authenticator region comprises a data - entry field configured to receive the password .

As I read the documentation , I still do not see the substantial innovation compared to what UNIX and Linux have been offering for a long time .
It is true that right - management pop-ups do not offer all this breadth of information about which account would allowed to do the task , but that is not the core of the patent , these are just bells and whistles that could easily be implemented if people actually cared about them .
The only account that truely matters in the superuser account ( or Administrator on Windows ) , and one can elevated oneself to superuser with sudo .

@CK
I 'm not a lawyer , but I read the claims as best I could and I can't see a substantial difference between what this patent cover and what sudo does .
I 'm only familiar with sudo as a hobbyist Linux user who occasionally drops to the command line to write simple scripts or perform system updates , but it appears to me that sudo , in combination with other , already existing programs ( multiple programs working together is the Unix way of doing things ) , seems to achieve the same thing being talked about in the part you posted .
Are the first two comment authors familiar with sudo ?
If so , maybe a plain English interpretation or example would help me understand how this is supposed to be different from it , but from the outset the similarity is so great as to make me skeptical of the idea that any great advancement has been made that 's worthy of granting a monopoly , that is , if I were in favor of the patent system in the first place . ;)

Christian is right about the lack of information on a typical sudo pop-up window , but if the main advancement described by the patent is to present the user with a bunch of information explaining all the details about the temporary increase in a user 's privileges , then that 's not only a very weak innovation , but also poor user interface design .
It 's largely accepted that the vast majority of users do n't read pop -up windows if they can possibly avoid it , they just click on them to make them go away .
If you work with enough regular users , you 'll see this constantly .
They do n't care what it says , they just want it gone .
Joel goes so far as to say you should act like the user can't read when writing software :

[ Comment at 11/11/2009 11:40 AM
by Michael ] @CK it is * absolutely * sudo as it's implemented in X ( Gnome , KDE , LXDE etc )
Just so were on the same page .. you seem awfully quick to point out that the patent is very specific , yet you seem to have no idea about how these systems work .
I suspect the examiner also saw lots of big words and thought that they sounded unique without really understanding what they mean , and I can bet they have no clue how * nix works .
Since this is an exact description of that system .
This patent is garbage , but its one more that they can use to spread FUD to linux adopters ... which is all that matters .
The threat of litigation is enough to scare anyone into buying your product .
God bless America !

Is n't one of the criteria for getting a patent supposed to be " not obvious to someone skilled in the art " ?

Detailed Description
Perl 6 is a major revision to the Perl programming language , which introduces elements of many modern and historical languages .
There are currently multiple implementation projects of Perl 6 underway , the most actively developed one is Rakudo , which is based on the Parrot virtual machine .
Benefit to Fedora
Providing Perl 6 support makes Fedora an attractive platform for developers .
Rakudo will enable developers to write new applications or port existing ones .
By offering Perl 6 at the current state Fedora once again proves it 's foundations Features and First
Scope
Package reviews
Continuous updates each month
How To Test
Test that rakudo builds on the parrot RPMs provided in Fedora .
Use the test suite included in Rakudo to verify that it actually works : make test will run a suite of tests , designed to make sure that the Rakudo compiler is basically working and that it 's capable of running a simple test harness .
make spectest will import relevant portions of the official Perl 6 test suite from the Pugs repository and run all of the tests that are currently known to pass .
User Experience
Rakudo will enable developers to write new applications or port existing ones to Perl 6 .
Although Perl 6 is still in development and no official release date has been set , the specification is feature complete and mature .
Rakudo has released 19 stable releases so far .
Both parrot and rakudo do one stable release each month and developers will get them easily without hassle on a regular schedule .
Dependencies
Parrot >= 1.4 : Review , in Fedora >= 10 )
, in Fedora >= 10 ) Rakudo : Review
( Note that parrot is a build dependency and not required at runtime . )
Contingency Plan
Drop the rakudo package from Fedora 12 .

The war on drugs has failed , but what should replace it ?
A powerful argument for defenders of the status quo has been that there is no viable alternative – that any softening - up on drugs would surely lead to anarchy , death , mass madness or worse .
But there are viable alternatives and today they are spelled out thoroughly and carefully in After the War on Drugs : Blueprint for Regulation .
Written by Steve Rolles and fellow campaigners from Transform : Drug Policy Foundation , the book is launched today in the House of Commons .
Blueprint shows that it is possible to have a grown - up drugs policy – one that lets people enjoy the drugs they like , in the ways they choose , within the context of a regulated market , with policies that reduce harm to users and protect society as a whole .
Anarchy is not the inevitable outcome of ending prohibition .
We have five major options and it's up to us to choose .
These five , according to Blueprint , are :
1. Prescription – a medical model with strict control by professionals .
2. Pharmacy sales – with trained pharmacists who could offer advice and over - the - counter sales .
3 . Licensed sales – something like we have now for tobacco and alcohol , with age and other limits .
4. Licensed premises – something like the Amsterdam coffee shops
5 . Unlicensed sales with a more or less free market .
The last option does not seem very appealing , and Blueprint describes it as handing control of drug markets to exploitative profiteers just as surely as prohibition .
So we probably have to find a solution with one of the other options .
But the real point of this book is to show that change is possible .
We can – and must – envisage " a world in which non-medical drug supply and use is addressed through the right blend of compassion , pragmatism , and evidence - based interventions focused on improving public health " .
I was especially interested to learn what Blueprint says about specific drugs and how they might be handled .
LSD , for example comes into the section on psychedelics , which points out that , though non-addictive , almost never fatal , and with no withdrawal effects , these drugs can precipitate psychotic episodes or lead to traumatic experiences and bad trips .
They are also used widely for religious and sacred rituals and in some countries there are functioning legal frameworks for allowing such use .
When drugs are used in this way they are usually taken only rarely , with many safeguards and in a social situation that provides a lot of support for people who may get into trouble using them .
How nice it is to have this kind of responsible drug - taking discussed seriously .
Blueprint comes up with a discussion model for psychedelics based on membership of psychedelic groups or clubs , and licensed vendors with specific responsibilities as well as licensed users .
Does this make sense ?
Would it work ?
I do n't know .
But then no one knows .
I can only say that I would welcome such a step .
If LSD were legally available I personally would like to take it quite rarely – perhaps once a year or so – for the extraordinary insights it can give and the lessons it teaches .
I am not alone : an online survey by Erowid of thousands of experienced LSD users showed that most would want to take it about once a year if it were legal .
I am much encouraged by Blueprint .
I 'm sure it does n't have all the answers , but what it does offer is this : when the election comes , and if drugs become an issue , no one can say there is no alternative to prohibition .
They can hold up Blueprint and say : " Here are the alternatives " .
Any of them must be better than the terrible harms that are currently being done to individuals and the whole of our society " clearly fuelled by the prohibitionist drug policies our governments pursue " .
A slimy foam churning up from the ocean has killed thousands seabirds and washed many others ashore , stripped of their waterproofing and struggling for life .
The birds have been clobbered by an unusual algae bloom stretching from the northern Oregon coast to the tip of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state .
" This is huge , " said Julia Parrish , a marine biologist and professor at the University of Washington who leads a seabird monitoring group .
" It 's the largest mortality event of its kind on the West Coast that we know of . "
The culprit is a single - cell algae or phytoplankton called
Akashiwo sanguinea .
Though the algae has multiplied off the coast of California before , killing hundreds of seabirds , the phenomenon has not been seen in Oregon and Washington , and has never occurred on the West Coast to this extent , Parrish said .
" We 're getting counts of up to a million cells per liter of water , " she said .
" Think about that .
That 's pretty dense . "
Marine biologists said it is not clear why the algae are multiplying , though they do flourish in warm weather .
Recent storms could have contributed to the problem , with crashing waves breaking them up .
Helping the birds
The Wildlife Center of the North Coast said it needs cash donations to buy fish to feed the birds , along with good used towels , large dog kennels to carry birds and bleach , as well as experienced volunteers .
Contact the center via its
Web site at www.coastwildlife.org or by mail at : Wildlife Center of the North Coast P.O. Box 1232 Astoria , OR 97103
The algae get whipped by the surf into something akin to a sticky soap that looks like the top of a root beer float .
The foam can be deadly to seabirds because it washes off the natural oils that keep them waterproofed .
Without that protection , they get cold , wet , eventually dying of hypothermia .
When they wash ashore , they are covered in foam .
" It looks like they 're lying in a sea of bubble bath , " said Greg Schirato , regional wildlife program manager for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife .
He said thousands had died .
This algal bloom , unlike the toxins produced by blue - green algae , poses no threat to humans or pets .
But the bloom could kill fish by clogging their gills , said Zachary Forster , phytoplankton specialist at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife .
" We have n't seen any instances of that , " Forster said .
The first seabird die - off in the Northwest occurred in mid-September , with swarms of dead and dying birds washing up on beaches around Kalaloch on the Olympic Peninsula .
At least a thousand scoters , or sea ducks , were killed , Parrish said .
" Then it subsided and we thought it was over , but it started up again , " she said .
This time Oregon was hit as well .
On Tuesday , birds flooded ashore on the Long Beach Peninsula and on beaches as far south as Cannon Beach , prompting an outpouring of calls to the Wildlife Center of the North Coast near Astoria .
The center , the only wildlife rehabilitation facility serving the northern Oregon and Washington coasts , is working around the clock treating more than 500 birds .
" We 're in an emergency crisis mode , " said Dr. Virginia Huang , president of the center 's board .
Not only are volunteers retrieving struggling birds in northern Oregon and Long Beach , but officials from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife are also trucking them in from the Olympic Peninsula .
Barbara Linnett , a volunteer at the wildlife center , said the majority of seabirds that have poured in are common murres , common loons , red - throated loons and grebes .
The center feeds them vitamins and fluids to hydrate them , then puts them in shallow pools of water .
Swimming in clean water -- and preening -- helps the seabirds rebuild their waterproofing .
Linnett hopes some of the birds can be released in a few days .
In the meantime , marine biologists from Oregon , Washington and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service are watching conditions closely , hoping that this was a freak event .
The last time it occurred was in 2007 in Monterey Bay , when hundreds of seabirds were killed .
" That event enabled us to figure out what is happening here , " Parrish said .

Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury 's struggle in Bangladesh has played out dramatically : his 2003 arrest ; his 2005 release ; [ 1 ] middle of the night battles to prevent his re-incarceration ; accolades for his stance as a " Muslim Zionist " ; [ 2 ] and resolutions from the U.S. Congress and others in 2006 and 2007 .
[3 ]
Things have now settled into a Kafkaesque routine without visible end , one where the process is the punishment .
Already unpopular with Bangladeshi Islamists , whose madrasas ( Islamic schools ) he exposed as centers for radicalization , [ 4 ]
Choudhury infuriated them in 2003 by breaking his country 's clampdown on positive news about Israel and Jews .
[ 5 ]
On November 29 , as he made to board a plane for Israel , the authorities moved against him , seizing him , taking his passport , and placing him in solitary confinement . [ 6 ]
His interrogators daily dragged him from his cell and tortured him , demanding he confess to being a Mossad agent . [ 7 ]
For seventeen months , they denied him adequate food , medical care , and sanitary conditions ; in Stalinist fashion , they placed him in a wing for the criminally insane . [ 8 ]
Crowds pressured his family to denounce him .
They beat his brother , who complained to the police , but the authorities backed off , blaming the Choudhurys as allies of the Jews . [ 9 ]
After his April 30 , 2005 release , Choudhury continued to publish , despite periodic attacks .
He has said , " If I went through this and stopped now , it would be worth nothing . " [ 10 ]
Last year , he was abducted by Bangladesh 's Rapid Action Battalion , [ 11 ] whose captives often " disappear , " but pressure from supporters forced his release within hours .
This February , operatives of Bangladesh 's ruling party beat him and sequestered his newspaper office .
Police never ordered Choudhury 's attackers to quit the premises , and as of this writing , still refuse to prosecute them though they carried out their crimes openly and with police knowledge . [ 12 ]
Choudhury faces capital charges of " sedition , treason , and blasphemy " [ 13 ] despite government admissions that they maintain these only to appease their Islamists . [ 14 ]
The 2009 elections and a new government changed nothing .
May 26 , 2009 , marked Choudhury 's fifty - second court appearance in forty - nine months .
The authorities forced him to wait outside the courtroom for hours , only to be told that his case was continued because the government 's sole witness did not show . [ 15 ]
Such prosecution drains his economic and emotional resources even as the possibility of incarceration or execution looms over him .
Choudhury 's supporters in and out of the U.S. Congress have blocked trade legislation benefiting Bangladesh , threatened its appropriations , and passed a resolution urging Bangladesh to drop the charges and end Choudhury 's harassment . [ 16 ]
" We 've done everything except send in the Marines , " said one U.S. official . [ 17 ]
Despite its being the world 's seventh most populous country , Bangladesh has never been a high U.S. priority .
Henry Kissinger 's quip about Bangladesh being " an international basket case " still undermines U.S. interest .
But Bangladesh , a breeding ground for Islamist terrorists , has strategic importance , and Choudhury 's case has implications that go beyond justice for one individual .
To overcome U.S. apathy and win justice for him requires three initiatives :
1 ) Implementation of previous Foreign Appropriations language to cut aid for noncompliance with U.S. House Resolution 64 by continuing the admittedly false prosecution and Choudhury 's harassment .
2 ) Rejection of proposed legislation offering tariff relief and other trade benefits .
3 ) Exclusion of Bangladesh from U.N. peacekeeping missions , to which it provides more troops than any country save Pakistan .

Indian officials are investigating the leak of a radioactive substance into drinking water at an atomic power plant in the south of the country .
Fifty - five workers at the Kaiga plant needed medical treatment for excessive exposure to radiation after tritium contaminated a water cooler .
Officials said the leak might have been deliberate .
" Mischief is not ruled out .
Investigations are on , " plant director J P Gupta told Reuters news agency .
The 55 workers had returned to their duties at the plant , Mr Gupta added .
" This incident has in no way affected the public , safety , health and environment . "
The highly protected Kaiga plant is on the west coast of India , 450 km ( 280 miles ) from Bangalore .
Tritium , also known as Hydrogen - 3 , is used in research , fusion reactors and neutron generators .
The Labyrinth Aquarium looks like a giant atomic particle science project that also happens to display tropical freshwater fish .
This very innovative and rare aquarium is offered in three colors .
The tables are produced in cherry , black or carbon fiber and they conceal the rare filtration and lighting components .
Fish swim freely throughout the entire aquarium .
Designed for tropical freshwater fish .
The table is optional .
Filters and all equipment still included if purchased without table .
Priced at $ 6500 , this aquarium is a luxury only the opulent few can afford .
And surprisingly not , it sells at a shop known as Opulent Items .

Zero-Tolerance Policies
Recent stories have documented the ridiculous effects of zero- tolerance weapons policies in a Delaware school district : a first - grader expelled for taking a camping utensil to school , a 13 - year - old expelled after another student dropped a pocketknife in his lap , and a seventh - grader expelled for cutting paper with a utility knife for a class project .
Where ’s the common sense ?
the editorials cry .
These so - called zero - tolerance policies are actually zero- discretion policies .
They ’re policies that must be followed , no situational discretion allowed .
We encounter them whenever we go through airport security : no liquids , gels or aerosols .
Some workplaces have them for sexual harassment incidents ; in some sports a banned substance found in a urine sample means suspension , even if it ’s for a real medical condition .
Judges have zero discretion when faced with mandatory sentencing laws : three strikes for drug offences and you go to jail , mandatory sentencing for statutory rape ( underage sex ) , etc .
A national restaurant chain wo n’t serve hamburgers rare , even if you offer to sign a waiver .
Whenever you hear " that ’s the rule , and I ca n’t do anything about it " — and they ’re not lying to get rid of you — you ’re butting against a zero discretion policy .
These policies enrage us because they are blind to circumstance .
Editorial after editorial denounced the suspensions of elementary school children for offenses that anyone with any common sense would agree were accidental and harmless .
The Internet is filled with essays demonstrating how the TSA ’s rules are nonsensical and sometimes do n’t even improve security .
I ’ve written some of them .
What we want is for those involved in the situations to have discretion .
However , problems with discretion were the reason behind these mandatory policies in the first place .
Discretion is often applied inconsistently .
One school principal might deal with knives in the classroom one way , and another principal another way .
Your drug sentence could depend considerably on how sympathetic your judge is , or on whether she ’s having a bad day .
Even worse , discretion can lead to discrimination .
Schools had weapons bans before zero - tolerance policies , but teachers and administrators enforced the rules disproportionally against African - American students .
Criminal sentences varied by race , too .
The benefit of zero - discretion rules and laws is that they ensure that everyone is treated equally .
Zero-discretion rules also protect against lawsuits .
If the rules are applied consistently , no parent , air traveler or defendant can claim he was unfairly discriminated against .
So that ’s the choice .
Either we want the rules enforced fairly across the board , which means limiting the discretion of the enforcers at the scene at the time , or we want a more nuanced response to whatever the situation is , which means we give those involved in the situation more discretion .
Of course , there ’s more to it than that .
The problem with the zero - tolerance weapons rules is n’t that they ’re rigid , it ’s that they ’re poorly written .
What constitutes a weapon ?
Is it any knife , no matter how small ?
Should the penalties be the same for a first grader and a high school student ?
Does intent matter ?
When an aspirin carried for menstrual cramps becomes “ drug possession , ” you know there ’s a badly written rule in effect .
It ’s the same with airport security and criminal sentencing .
Broad and simple rules may be simpler to follow — and require less thinking on the part of those enforcing them — but they ’re almost always far less nuanced than our complex society requires .
Unfortunately , the more complex the rules are , the more they ’re open to interpretation and the more discretion the interpreters have .
The solution is to combine the two , rules and discretion , with procedures to make sure they ’re not abused .
Provide rules , but do n’t make them so rigid that there ’s no room for interpretation .
Give the people in the situation — the teachers , the airport security agents , the policemen , the judges — discretion to apply the rules to the situation .
But — and this is the important part — allow people to appeal the results if they feel they were treated unfairly .
And regularly audit the results to ensure there is no discrimination or favoritism .
It ’s the combination of the four that work : rules plus discretion plus appeal plus audit .
All systems need some form of redress , whether it be open and public like a courtroom or closed and secret like the TSA .
Giving discretion to those at the scene just makes for a more efficient appeals process , since the first level of appeal can be handled on the spot .
Zachary , the Delaware first grader suspended for bringing a combination fork , spoon and knife camping utensil to eat his lunch with , had his punishment unanimously overturned by the school board .
This was the right decision ; but what about all the other students whose parents were n’t as forceful or media - savvy enough to turn their child ’s plight into a national story ?
Common sense in applying rules is important , but so is equal access to that common sense .

( NEW YORK ) Fortune -- Dear Annie :
A few months ago I lost a middle - management job at a company where I worked for 14 years .
I received four promotions during that time , but it had been quite a while since I actually interviewed for a new job .
I 've gone on several interviews in the past few weeks , which I know I was lucky to get , but they 've all been dead - ends .
A friend suggests that I hire a coach to help me polish my interviewing skills and figure out what I 'm doing wrong .
Your thoughts ?
- Rusty
Dear Rusty :
You are n't necessarily doing anything wrong .
With unemployment now at 10.2 % nationally , and much higher in some states , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates that there are 6.3 job hunters for every available job .
That 's three times the average that prevails in a healthy economy , the BLS notes , so the numbers may simply be working against you .
That you 've gotten several interviews in the past few weeks is a good sign .
And it 's certainly true that a competent coach could help you improve your interviewing technique .
( For tips on locating one , see " How to Find the Right Career Coach . " )
But before you invest in a coach , see if you 're making an easily avoidable mistake you could clear up on your own .
" The competition is tough enough without giving potential employers reasons not to hire you , " says Tim Schoonover , chairman of outplacement and leadership - development firm OI Partners .
Here are the most common errors career coaches at OI Partners see -- and how to fix them :
10 .
Over -explaining why you lost your last job .
It 's okay to mention that your last position was eliminated , but then move on to what you can do for this employer .
9 . Conveying that you 're not over it .
" During interviews , some people are acting wounded , angry or sad , " Schoonover says .
These are normal emotions after a layoff but they do n't belong in a job interview -- or you may " seem unstable and communicate that you do n't grasp the business reasons for layoffs , " he adds .
What 's the worst blunder you 've made in a job interview ?
Leave your comments at the bottom of this story .
8. Lacking humor , warmth , or personality .
Many anxious job candidates are " one- dimensional during interviews , and are too focused on getting their talking points across , " notes Schoonover .
" Do n't forget to show qualities that can be a real plus in the decision - making process , including humor in good taste , warmth , and understanding . "
One thing interviewers want to know , of course , is how pleasant you would be to have around the place every day .
7 . Not showing enough interest or enthusiasm .
After all , " companies are looking for people who are excited about working with them , " Schoonover says .
6. Inadequate research about a potential employer .
It 's essential to be up on the latest news , so be sure to Google the company before the interview .
Be prepared with well - informed , thoughtful questions about its products or services and its future plans .
Many applicants are n't bothering , Schoonover says , and it shows .
5. Concentrating too much on what you want .
Focus more on what the interviewer is saying .
Listening carefully is crucial in steering the conversation toward how you would fit in and what you have to offer .
4 . Trying to be all things to all people .
" Devote most of your effort to talking about what you know you do well , and do n't try to stretch your actual qualifications too far , " Schoonover advises .
A good rule of thumb :
Do n't apply for any job unless you have at least 75 % of the stated qualifications .
3. " Winging " the interview .
Schoonover hears from many hiring managers that candidates often are n't ready to answer difficult questions .
So rehearse .
" Prepare and practice a 90 - second verbal resume , and some answers to possible questions , so that you come across as succinct , " he suggests .
2. Failing to set yourself apart from other candidates .
" You have to make the strongest possible case for why you are the best person for the job , " Schoonover says .
" Specifically address what impact you can have on sales , profits , costs , or productivity within the next three to six months .
Use quantifiable achievements from past positions to back up your performance promise . "
And the No. 1 mistake OI Partners ' coaches see job hunters make :
1. Failing to ask for the job .
" You have a much better chance of getting the job if you ask for it , " says Schoonover .
" Close the interview by summing up what you can bring to the job , and ask for the opportunity to deliver those results . "
Talkback :
Have you ever made a blunder in a job interview ?
If you 're a hiring manager , what are the worst moves you 've seen interviewees make ?
Is there any way to win an employer over after making such a mistake ?

Rogers Communications Inc. can no longer claim without qualification that it has " Canada 's most reliable " wireless network , the Supreme Court of British Columbia has ruled .
Rival Telus Corp. had asked the court for the ruling , arguing that new networks it and Bell Canada put in place this month had made Roger 's long - standing claim no longer valid .
Telus has won a court order against Rogers 's claim it has Canada 's most reliable wireless network .
While Justice J. Christopher Grauer agreed , he would n't go as far as to order Rogers to pull any advertising or promotional material , saying he wanted to make the scope of the limitation on Rogers as narrow as possible .
The judge ordered the two parties to work on the wording for a court order and adjourned the matter until Friday .
All this will be good news for the advertising industry , said Gavin Graham , director of investment at BMO Asset Management .
" It 'll be up to Telus to tell a positive story — not so much that Rogers can't advertise itself as the most reliable any longer , " he said .
Graham predicted Telus will launch a new ad campaign .
" To tell a good news message , you have to spend lots and lots of money , " he said .
" You ca n't just tell the other guys to stop making what are now inaccurate statements . "
It also means Rogers has to find a new hook for its ads , Graham said .
With new players entering the industry after Ottawa auctioned off parts of the wireless spectrum earlier this year , the public is going to be bombarded with mobile phone ads , he said .

Introduction
What is progaming ?
Progaming ( short for professional gaming , also known as e-Sports ) is the term used by people to refer to video games being played in a competitive and professional manner .
Progaming is used as a broad term , as there are many video games being played professionally all around the world , such as Counter - Strike , Halo 3 and Warcraft III .
So what does Teamliquid . net do ?
Teamliquid.net focuses on the most popular e-Sport in South Korea , Starcraft .
We offer up to date results and statistics as well as promoting discussion about every facet of Starcraft Progaming .
Okay , so why does Teamliquid focus on Starcraft ?
Starcraft in Korea is nothing but a phenomenon .
There are twelve , fully professional gaming teams owned by massive companies called chaebols ( with the exception of the Air Force team ) which compete in just about every Starcraft competition out there .
Prize pools go from $ 50,000 up to $ 200,000 .
Full - time , professional players earn salaries ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 200,000 .
There are two dedicated channels focused mainly on providing Starcraft - related content , and there are even Starcraft camps which parents send their children to to learn more about the game .
Who runs professional Starcraft in Korea ?
The current administration that controls professional gaming overall in South Korea is the Korean e-Sports Players Association , known as KeSPA .
Currently , Blizzard is disputing this control , and has bestowed broadcasting rights and control over SC : BW leagues to Gretech Corp , the owners of GOM TV .
Blizzard has given the two broadcasting companies , MBCGame and Ongamenet , until August 2010 to purchase licenses that will allow them to broadcast professional Starcraft .
KeSPA will most likely take legal action against Blizzard in an effort to keep control .

All the information you need to watch live can be found here How does a person become a progamer ?
There are two ways of earning a progaming license and thus , being able to compete in the Proleague or Offline Preliminaries .
1 ) You can enter a tournament which is known as the Courage Tournament .
The Courage Tournament is held often and is very , very tough to advance through .
The number of licenses given out depends on the number of participants .
Those who sign up are split up into groups of 64 and one advances per group .
2 ) You can be given an exemption by a professional team and be ' given ' a license .
Licenses are given like this in rare occasions where the gamers are very talented , very young , or occasionally , a foreigner .
Teams usually have three or four of these to give out every year .
History of Starcraft Progaming
History
Things did n't really get started in Korea until Brood War came along .
Sure , Honest won a ladder tournament , and a few others had been climbing the ranks ( notably HOT - Forever , Honest [ S.G ] and Ssamjang ) , but Brood War was still dominated by Western / Non-Korean players .
This was about to change , but not yet .
Grrrr ... ( Giyom ) , a French - Canadian who had always been a top Starcraft player , went to Korea to compete in the Sports Seoul Tournament .
He finished 2nd .
Around this time the first " Knights Bridge of Korea " tournament was arranged , better known as KBK .
A number of western players attended , among them was NTT ( Dutch Terran player ) who played brilliantly , but lost out near the end .
The final was between TheMarine and I.Love_Star , where TheMarine came out on top .
Back in the west , Grrrr ... won both the Brood War Season 3 ladder tournament and the massive Blizzard World Championship in dominating style .
Soon after this , he moved to Korea to make a living out of gaming .
He was massively dominant , beating most of the Koreans and dominating tournaments , including a win at the Hantaro Starleague and the following King of Kings tournament , a winner 's tournament OGN ( OnGameNet ) used to arrange at the end of each year .
Around this time ( 2000 ) the first WCG ( World Cyber Games , known then as the World Cyber Challenge or WCC ) was arranged , with the young zerg GoRush triumphing over I.Love_Star .
In the same year the Norwegian Terran / Zerg player Slayer won the 2nd KBK , again beating I.Love_Star .
He was the first player to demonstrate extreme dexterity , amazing everyone with his hand - speed and play .
After his KBK win , Slayer was offered to stay in Korea and play professionally but he declined , deciding to go back to Norway .
The first official OSL ( OnGameNet Starleague ) was also arranged in 2000 .
The zerg star SKELTON made it through both Grrrr ... and Kingdom to the finals , but was stopped stone cold by the amazing GARIMTO who dominated him 3 - 0 and took the first official Starleague title .
Meanwhile , in the Game - Q World Invitational , things were heating up .
The popular zerg master Byun was completely dominated by a young terran .
With stunning macro , rock solid defense and previously unseen dropship harassment he took the win and made his first claim to the throne of professional Starcraft .
With this win , the emperor , Boxer , had arrived .
The Game - Q tournaments eventually died out due to a lack of funding , but even without these Boxer dominated 2001 completely and utterly .
He absolutely obliterated Grrrr ... in one of the famous " Last 1.07 patch " matches ( which are famously known for being the only games that had an entrance fee to watch ) , then went on to secure the first WCG crown ( no longer WCC at that time ) , the Hanbitsoft OSL , the Coca - Cola OSL and ended the year with a solid run for the SKY 2001 prize , but was stopped at the last possible point by the returning GARIMTO .
GARIMTO winning led to the creation of the legend of the fall theory .
This theory simply states that a Protoss will win the Fall Starleague season each year .
2001 saw Starcraft change rapidly .
Boxer put his magic into the terran race , changing gameplay radically .
Fortunately , GARIMTO , the old protoss master , came through and single - handedly saved the protoss race from Boxer ’s dominance .
Two important young players came into the scene , the first one being Yellow .
His amazing lurker and zergling combination play and incredible 2nd place vs Boxer ( 3 - 2 ) , who at that point was considered invincible , made him the 3rd King of Starcraft .
We also saw the first signs of the greatness that lay within Reach , with his amazing win over Boxer in the SKY 01 round of 16 , a massive game where Reach smashed Boxer 's incredible metal armies with a tornado of protoss troops .
As they say , the rest is history .

The Current State of Progaming
Progaming continues to grow and flourish within South Korea .
There are currently two full time cable gaming channels ( MBC and OnGameNet ) where StarCraft constitutes the main attraction .
In addition , online media players such as GOM and DAUM have both served as major sponsors for Starleagues , and are carrying lots of StarCraft content .
This section breaks down what competition is available for fans and gamers .
What tournaments are there at the moment ?
There are currently four individual leagues , two for each channel .
The premiere leagues , called StarLeagues ( OSL for OnGameNet and MSL for MBC ) are where the top qualifiers play .
In order to reach the top level , there is a complex qualification system that a player must compete in .
To read about each process , click the spoilers below .
There is also a team league in which the 12 professional teams compete against each other .
This is called the Proleague and is hosted by both OnGameNet and MBCGame ; information on this tournament can be found below .

Using this article you will get the basic idea of how you could use NDepend to control / analyze your application .
It allows to apply design rules and refactor code .
Table of Contents
In today 's world when you are developing a real world application with huge codebase , lots of attributes that we have to think .
Few of them are Maintainability , Understandability , Clarity , Dependency , Product Superiority etc .
We do lots of hard work to maintain our code , make the code well commented so that future developers might understand the code better , we find dependency between two or more assemblies and try to minimize dependency , limit the no of Lines of Code and so on and finally do testing before release the product for future use .
While doing this , we loose lots of our time which might have been used to Development for better coding .
What if everything is done without thinking of anything at all ?
Yes , NDepend [ ^ ] allows you to handle large project to get summary of everything at any instant .
Thus , without depending upon the fact of how big the assembly is , how many types are there in your assembly , how much lines of code is there in your project ; you can easily determine the quality of code and what are the sections that the code should be looked upon and Refactored .
Patrick Smacchia , A C# MVP , introduced NDepend in 2007 .
The primary motive of NDepend is to allow the Architect to get clear idea about cross dependencies between objects , level of association between them and to find the condition of code easily .
I will discuss how we can use NDepend in our application to manage our code easily .
Many of us would agree that avoiding dependency cycle between components is the primary principle of Good Software Design .
If a component A depends on B , B depends on C and C again depends on A , the component A cannot be tested or developed independently without B and C .
Thus A , B and C forms an indivisible unit .
This indivisible unit has high cost than the individual units when it comes to the point of maintainability of code .
It is suggested that maintaining 1,000 lines of code will likely cost three or four times more effort than what is required to maintain two 500 LOC independent blocks .
Thus for any rational architecture , one accepts each component being 500 - 1,000 lOC and there is no dependency cycles between those .
Dependency structure matrix is used to get the knowledge on by which extent a namespace is dependent to another .
The console helps you to get the idea about the dependency between one class with another .
Let us look at the picture below :
The blue cell shows a dependency between the two namespaces in x and y axis .
For example , the down left cell ( 0,12 ) shows that the namespace Spring .
Proxy is indirectly using the namespace Spring .
Threading with a shortest path of length five .
By shortest path I mean the items are not dependent directly rather it depends on assemblies that inturn dependent on another and finally to it .
The black cell shows that there exists a dependancy cycle between 2 namespaces .
For example , the couple of cells [ 9,7 ] and [ 7,9 ] reveals that the namespaces Spring .
Validation and Spring .
Core .* belong to a dependency cycle of shortest length five .
The red box around the black cells states that every component are directly or indirectly defendant on each other and hence creating a super - component which cannot run independently .
You can refactor your code structure to eliminate the dependancy between code .
You can read more about Dependency Cycles from here [ ^ ] .
Another useful and unique feature that NDepend provides to us is CQL .
It allows to write queries on .NET objects .
This is really helpful to deal with large amount of codebase .
We might use simple SQL like query to find our desired need .
For instance , suppose we think to get all methods that have more than 200 number of lines ( The idea is always to have less than 200 no of lines in a single method for better code structure ) .
We might use simple Query like :
SELECT METHODS OUT OF NAMESPACES " MyApp.MyNamespace1 " , " MyApp.MyNamespace2 "
WHERE NbILInstructions > 200 ORDER BY NbILInstructions DESC
Thus it will search within MyNamespace1 and MyNamespace2 and try to find the methods that are having more than 200 LOC and list in order of LOC in the console .
If we want to get types that implements IDisposable we write :
SELECT TYPES WHERE IsClass AND Implements " System . IDisposable "
In addition to this , CQL supports inbuilt functionality to incorporate rules to your .NET applications .
After all those initial discussion it is the time now to grab some practical knowledge on how you could use NDepend .
I will discuss with other UI elements provided within the NDepend console when needed .
The unique feature of NDepend is to provide a quick overview of all the changes that are made between two builds .
NDepend gives a superior UI to compare between two builds .
We can easily make use of CQL to see what are the methods that are changed , what are Removed , what are changed and so on .
Let us give a quick example on that :
In the above figure , you can see how to start comparing builds between assemblies .
Start Visual NDepend .
Choose 2 version of a CodeBase .
.
In the dialog that appears , select 2 assemblies which you want to compare .
You can also select more than one assemblies which has dependencies between one another .
And Click OK
After initial Build Process , it opens up the Compare console as the figure below .
In the figure you can see 4 sections : Class Browser :
In this section , the console shows the hierarchy of class structure to determine what are changed in assembly .
As you can see , it clearly demarcates each Namespaces .
StrikeThrough Namespaces denotes present in Older version , but removed in newer version ; Underlined means Modified in Newer version . , and Bold nodes are newly added .
Thus from this tree we could have clear idea about what is changed between the two versions .
Metrics :
It represents the Metrix of all the methods that are defined in the two assemblies .
If you hover mouse over any of this section it tells about the No of lines and the name of the method , as shown in the figure above .
Info :
This section shows the summary of the currently selected Item , such as Number of IL Instructions , Lines of Comments , No of Lines , Cyclometric Complexity etc .
CQL Query Section
This section allows you to define custom CQL queries to filter output .
You can define CQL like : SELECT NAMESPACES FROM ASSEMBLIES " XXXX.AssetTracker .Data " WHERE NbLinesOfCode > 100
It will list all the namespaces under Assembly XXXX .
AssetTracker .
Data where Linesofcode exceeds 100 .
These 4 sections could be used to grab the entire knowledge about all the changes that are made between the two assemblies .
Instead of typing the queries yourself , you can also find the most appropriate queries by right clicking on the Namespace andas shown in the figure above .
The types will be listed in the CQL Query Results for you .
After comparing codebase , let us analyse our code .
To Analyse , choose Analyze a set of .NET assemblies from the initial screen of Visual Ndepend console .
From the Dialog box that appears , choose the dlls that you want to analyze and click Ok .
The process will build the assemblies , analyze it and produce you a report .
If you see the report , you could get a clear idea of what is done in those dlls , Dependency matrices etc .
To inspect more let us see the picture below :
SELECT TYPES FROM ASSEMBLIES " XXX .
Framework " WHERE IsPublic
Here the CQL returned the output of all the Namespaces which are public in the Assemblies .
The List says there are 60 types of such Types with each defining the no of lines in it .
The panel below gives the analysis of search statistics .
In addition to all those features , NDepend also allows you to integrate with Visual Studio .
From the console Click on Install to open up this window :
The dialog installs NDepend plugin to Visual Studio .
It also allows you to install Reflector into visual studio .
The buttons appear in the dialog will help doing this .
Now from your Visual Studio IDE we can get access to CQL queries and easily check Dependancy matrix .
Anytime just right click on the code and you will find NDepend Context menu option .
Thus we can also easily access the CQL queries directly from Code .
This gives additional benefit to have better grasp on our code while writing .
NDepend also allows you to write Constraint directly into your code .
It generally uses XML file to store this constraint .
IF you add NDepend .
CQL.dll to your project , you might add
[ NDepend.CQL.CQLConstraint ( " WARN IF Count>0 SELECT METHODS WHERE NbLinesOfCode > 400 " ) ]
to directly warn me when the code compiles without following the constraint .
To download this tool follow this link .
First of all I must thank Pattric , to let me try this and also giving me the honor to write about the great tool he developed .
There are lots of terms here which are very new to me and learned while learning .
So if I make any mistake , just let me know , so that I could update the article .
Initial Build : 4th November 2009 .
This is the initial introduction of NDepend .
Comments are welcome .
TORONTO --
The NHL's 30 general managers agreed Wednesday to study the idea of making blindside hits to the head illegal next season .
A group of seven GMs will be formed within the next month to specifically study the issue and report back to the full group at the next general managers ' meeting in March .
" Everybody in the room knows this is an important subject .
It 's going to require further discussion because it's not a simple subject , " NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said after the meeting wrapped up .
" I do think there 's a sense that when there 's a shot to the head for a player who 's in a vulnerable position , or is unsuspecting , that 's something that perhaps can and should be addressed . "
The crushing blow by Philadelphia Flyers captain Mike Richards on Florida Panthers star winger David Booth earlier this season was the kind of blindside hit most of the GMs at the meeting believed possibly should be made illegal .
According to the current rulebook , it is considered a legal hit .
" The Booth hit in particular I personally feel that if that was my son I would n't want for that to be the way he was hit , " Pittsburgh Penguins GM Ray Shero said .
" What Mike Richards did was within the rules we have currently .
That 's not the issue .
The issue is making the game as safe as can be .
" I do n't think we 're looking for a big rule change but maybe we can tweak something .
There 's not many of these a year , fortunately .
There might be four or five .
But when they happen , they 're catastrophic . "
Hits to the head have resurfaced this season as a hot - button topic around the NHL , and the subject was reignited by the Richards hit .
The Flyers star was not suspended by the league because it was a clean hit with his shoulder .
Booth remains out with a concussion .
The general managers also seriously discussed the issue last season at the March meetings , but could not come to a consensus .
" It 's a topic that is hard to get everybody to see it the same way , " Nashville Predators GM David Poile said .
" I think every manager is a good and concerned citizen , we do n't like when players get hurt , we do n't like it when somebody gets taken off on a stretcher .
" But over the course of one game , there 's 40 - plus hits , so you multiply that out , that 's 50,000 - plus hits over the course of a season .
There 's no manager that wants to take hitting out of the game .
For these 10 or so hits , what 's the right thing to do ? "
But now it appears there 's at least a movement toward possibly eliminating blindside hits .
" A player should have an ability to anticipate a hit , prepare for a hit or avoid a hit , " Toronto Maple Leafs GM Brian Burke said .
" If he does n't have those , then I think the onus has to shift to the hitter .
He 's got to deliver a safe hit ...
It 's never going to be a safe workplace , but we 've got to make it as safe as we can . "
If the GMs do officially recommend at their March meetings to made blindside hits illegal , then the competition committee ( comprising players and team executives ) also would need to approve it before the NHL's Board of Governors has the final say in June .
" It was quite a bit different , some of the guys who have taken a strong position that it may take hitting out of the game have adjusted their views a little bit , " Carolina GM Jim Rutherford said .
" If we continue down what was talked about today then we will see a change .
" It will be on the agenda of the next meeting and I think if we got the direction that it appeared we were going , you will see a change for next year . "
Burke is one of the former hard - liners who has softened a little on the issue .
A big concern for the group has traditionally been that a rule banning head shots might inadvertently lead to the elimination of all bodychecks .
One thing that stands out for NHL disciplinarian Colin Campbell is just how much the sport has changed and evolved .
He sat down and watched a game from the 1970s recently and noticed how much less physical play there was .
" The hitting today is so much more evident , " Campbell said .
Player safety was a key theme from Wednesday 's meeting as the GMs also looked at some new equipment .
Mark Messier made a presentation on behalf of manufacturer Cascade Sports , which has designed a helmet aimed at limiting concussions .
Messier made a few sales as Burke indicated he wanted to get some for the Toronto Marlies AHL team .
Some of his colleagues were impressed by it as well .
" I like the look of it and think it 's an advancement in technology that any player should be open to , " Vancouver GM Mike Gillis said .
Among the other agenda items discussed Wednesday :
- Deputy commissioner Bill Daly scolded the GMs for long - term contracts designed to circumvent the cap and provided an update on the three deals ( Chris Pronger , Marian Hossa , Roberto Luongo ) currently being investigated by the league .
- A financial update on next year 's salary cap , which is n't expected to change drastically .
Information from The Associated Press and ESPN.com 's Pierre LeBrun was used in this report .

The most unbelievable thing about Going Rogue , by the author - function " Sarah Palin , " is that it 's supposed to be self - serving .
The problem a self - serving narrative about Sarah Palin confronts is that it's about Sarah Palin , whose entire life , it appears , consists of worse and worse attempts to create self - serving narratives explaining away bigger and bigger fuck - ups .
Going Rogue 's burden is that it must claim to be the definitive , encyclopedic explanation , the final excuse , for a long history of failure begat by failure ; it 's an epic of failure , if you will , and if the goal here is some kind of ultimate vindication , well , it is monumentally unsuccessful .
Going Rogue is , at bottom , the story of every one of Sarah Palin 's projects ending in grotesque catastrophe ; it is only self - serving in the sense that these catastrophes either prove benign or turn out to be some other schlub 's fault .
If everything I knew about Sarah Palin came from this book ( and basically it does ) , I would say her life has been like a play in which a deus - ex - machina descends at the end of every act to bestow peace and harmony , except the deus forgot to put on pants and everyone 's just standing around going " uhhhh ... " and then the lights go out and the scene changes .
When Palin wraps up her tenure as Wasilla mayor , everyone she knows hates her , and she 's jobless .
Then she gets a job !
But then she quits .
When she completes her first annual budget as Governor , she alienates the entire Alaska legislature because some " legislative director " forgot to send a letter explaining her " funding criteria " to the legislators .
Then a budget passes !
And the legislature still hates her .
At the end of her pregnancy with Trig , she " confessed to Todd that [ she ] may not have handled the whole pregnancy announcement thing right . "
Not to mention the whole delivery thing .
But then of course Trig is delivered safely into the cruel cruel world of moose chili and having your image " desecrated " on the internet .
Over and over again Palin lives this story of confounding and infuriating everyone around her , generating whole collective atmospheres of absurd malevolence and malevolent absurdity .
And then everything just gets resolved .
How ?
I do n't know -- it 's a mystery !
But maybe it's the magic of NO ABORTIONS EVER ???
Finally , in the " Going Rogue " chapter , the intermittent ( and increasingly frequent ) cracklings of bald absurdity and maximum roguishness just break through the signal of normalcy once and for all , setting in for the entire period between August 29 and November 4 , 2008 .
In theory this is the part that people read the book for , but as I came to this point my desire to continue was tempered by my desire to light myself on fire .
The only benefit I got from this section was that it reminded me just how asinine the McCain campaign was .
( Remember when Palin 's Yahoo account was hacked ? )
One big reveal : Steve Schmidt apparently thought Palin 's brain was n't getting enough carbohydrates to function properly , which is why we 've been hearing Palin complain about being told what to eat .
Palin relates on page 285 :
He then launched into a discussion of nutrition physiology , holding forth on the importance of carbohydrates to cognitive connections and blah - blah - blah .
And in one sublime sentence , an agglomeration of comedy gold on the scale of Scrooge McDuck 's money bin , in which Palin says Steve Schmidt is a dick for suggesting she can't make cognitive connections while making a cognitive connection with " blah - blah - blah , " we discern the yawning abyss of stupid through which Sarah Palin stumbles as she fails at everything , I can't take any more , the end .
Adolescents with psychiatric symptoms such as attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , social phobia , hostility and depression may be more likely to develop an Internet addiction , according to a report in the October issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , one of the JAMA / Archives journals .
Although the Internet has become one of the most significant information resources for adolescents , addiction to the Internet can negatively impact school performance , family relationships and adolescents ' emotional state , according to background information in the article .
" This phenomenon has been described as Internet addiction or problematic Internet use and classified as a possible behavior addiction , " the authors write .
Previous studies report that 1.4 percent to 17.9 percent of adolescents are addicted to the Internet in both Western and Eastern societies ; therefore , there have been suggestions to add Internet and gaming addictions to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders .
" Identification of the risk factors for Internet addiction is therefore of clinical significance for the prevention of , and early intervention into , Internet addiction in adolescents . "
Chih - Hung Ko , M.D. , of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital and Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung City , Taiwan , and colleagues examined the relationship between psychiatric symptoms such as ADHD , social phobia and hostility and Internet addiction in 2,293 seventh - graders ( 1,179 boys and 1,114 girls ) from ten junior high schools in southern Taiwan .
Researchers also noted differences in the predictive value of these psychiatric symptoms between males and females .
Psychiatric symptoms were determined through self - reported questionnaires .
Internet addiction was assessed by the Chen Internet Addiction Scale ( CIAS ) at baseline and at six , 12 and 24 months with scores ranging from 26 to 104 .
Participants scoring 64 or higher were classified as being addicted to the Internet .
Of all participants , 233 ( 10.8 percent ) were classified as having Internet addiction and 1,929 ( 89.2 percent ) were classified as not having an Internet addiction .
The researchers report that although depression , ADHD , social phobia and hostility were found to predict the occurrence of Internet addiction in the two - year follow - up , depression and social phobia predicted Internet addiction among only female adolescents .
Additionally , the most significant predictors of Internet addiction in male and female adolescents were hostility and ADHD , respectively .
" These results suggest that ADHD , hostility , depression and social phobia should be detected early on and intervention carried out to prevent Internet addiction in adolescents , " the authors conclude .
" Also , sex differences in psychiatric comorbidity should be taken into consideration when developing prevention and intervention strategies for Internet addiction . "
Editorial : Internet Addiction May Be a 21st - Century Epidemic
" Our culture both mandates and facilitates time spent online , " write Dimitri A. Christakis , M.D. , M.P.H. , of the Center for Child Health , Behavior and Development , Seattle , and Megan A. Moreno , M.D. , M.P.H. , in an accompanying editorial .
" Woven as it is into the fabric of today 's society , the potential for Internet use to lead to overuse and ultimately to addiction is concerning … "
" Part of the failure to recognize this potential 21st - century epidemic is the simple fact that many of us , Blackberry in hand , check e-mail more than we would like .
The inherent difficulties in defining Internet addiction and our own need for rectification should not prevent us from recognizing an emerging epidemic , " Dr. Christakis and Dr. Moreno continue .
" As pediatricians and indeed as parents , we have all experienced the pull that the Internet can have on children . "
" If all at - risk children achieve sufficient exposure to become addicted , the prevalence of Internet addiction may easily approach the 2 percent to 12 percent of children reported in other countries , quickly ranking it among the most common chronic diseases of childhood , " they conclude .
" Our intention in raising this concern is not to be alarmist but rather to alert pediatricians to what might become a major public health problem for the United States in the 21st century . "

China launches anti-dumping , anti-subsidy probe into US autos
( Xinhua )
Updated : 2009-11-06 20:02
BEIJING : China 's Ministry of Commerce ( MOC ) said Friday it had launched anti-dumping , anti-subsidy investigations into US - made off - road vehicles and sedans with engine displacements of 2.0 liters and above .
The decision was made after the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers ( CAAM ) filed an application for the investigations , the MOC said in a statement posted on its website .
CAAM , representing Chinese car - makers , said US car makers had unfairly benefited from 31 government subsidy programs .
The MOC decided to investigate into 24 of them .
The ministry said it held consultation with its US counterpart on Tuesday and made the decision in accordance with China 's anti-dumping and anti-subsidy laws .
The investigations would commonly be ended before November 6 , 2010 , but might be extended by another year if necessary , the MOC said .
The M0C announcement came one day after the US Commerce Department set preliminary anti-dumping duties on imports of Chinese - made oil pipes , which was the biggest US trade action against China .
As a result , a 36.53 - percent tariff will be imposed on oil country tubular goods ( OCTG ) from 37 Chinese companies , while some other companies will be levied a preliminary dumping rate of 99.14 percent .
They are in addition to the preliminary extra duties of 10.69 percent to 30.69 percent which the US Commerce Department announced in September for Chinese oil pipes .
The US move drew strong objection from China .
" China is resolutely opposed to US abuse of protectionism .
And ( China ) will take measures to safeguard the interests of domestic industry , " MOC spokesman Yao Jian has said .
On September 15 , the MOC said it planned to investigate the alleged dumping of auto and chicken products from the United States .

SEATTLE -- Conservatives here , a droll minority , say that under this city 's quota system , when a conservative enters the city , one already here is required to leave .
They also say Washington is actually two states :
There is what you can see from atop this city 's Space Needle -- meaning , this liberal city -- and there is everything else , extending to the Oregon , Idaho and Canadian borders .
On Tuesday , Washington residents will vote in a referendum that has national significance because of a controversy about disclosing the names and addresses of those who signed petitions to trigger the referendum .
Disclosure threatens the right to privacy , which is under assault by a spreading movement -- call it thuggish liberalism -- that uses intimidation to suppress political participation .
The referendum is on a new state law that some say establishes same - sex marriage .
This is a matter about which people differ .
What is , however , unambiguously wrong is the attempt by some supporters of the law to force disclosure of the names and addresses of the 138,000 people who signed the petition bringing about the referendum .
This can have no other purpose than to make it possible to harass those signers .
Those favoring disclosure say it is mandatory under the state 's Public Records Act .
If so , that act is unconstitutional .
In the 1950s , Alabama tried to compel the NAACP to disclose its membership list .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that disclosure would burden the freedoms of expression and association that the First Amendment protects .
Advocates of compelled disclosure predictably invoke Louis Brandeis ' axiom that sunlight is the best disinfectant .
But what is the supposed infection ?
The Supreme Court has held that disclosure requirements serve three government interests :
They provide information about the flow of political money , they deter corruption and avoid the appearance thereof by revealing large contributions , and they facilitate enforcement of contribution limits .
These pertain only to financial information in candidate elections .
These cannot justify compelled disclosures regarding referendums because referendums raise no issues of officials ' future performance in office -- being corruptly responsive to financial contributors .
The only relevant information about referendums is in the text of the propositions .
In 1973 , Washington 's secretary of state ruled that signing an initiative or referendum petition is " a form of voting " and violating voters ' privacy could have adverse " political ramifications " for those signing .
In 2009 , some advocates of disclosure plan to put signers ' names on the Internet in order to force " uncomfortable " conversations .
Larry Stickney , a social conservative and president of the Washington Values Alliance , says disclosure of the identities of petition - signers will enable " ideological background checks " that will have a chilling effect on political participation .
He frequently encounters people who flinch from involvement with the referendum when they learn that disclosure of their involvement is possible .
He has received abusive e-mails and late - night telephone calls , and has seen a stranger on his front lawn taking pictures of his house .
The Wall Street Journal 's John Fund reports that some Californians who gave financial support to last year 's successful campaign for Proposition 8 -- it declared marriage to be only between a man and a woman -- subsequently suffered significant harm .
For example , the director of the Los Angeles Film Festival , who contributed $ 1,500 , was forced to resign .
So was the manager of a fashionable Los Angeles restaurant who contributed just $ 100 .
Charles Bouley , a gay columnist , has honorably protested such bullying .
He says people " have the right to be wrong , " and reminds gay activists : " Even Barack Obama said marriage was between a man and a woman at a time when we needed his voice on our side on equality .
He let us down , too , remember , and many of you still gave him a job . "
Obama 's home phone number ( 202-456-1414 ) and address are known , but it is hard to harass someone surrounded by Secret Service protection .
Less - insulated Americans are vulnerable .
Currently , liberals enthralled by intimidation are trying to abolish secret ballots in unionization votes .
And when Humana , the private health insurance provider , recently warned its customers about some provisions of Congress ' health care legislation , the Obama administration 's reaction was essentially a quote from a Ring Lardner short story : " Shut up , he explained . "
It is time to speak up about thuggish liberalism , especially when it tries to suppress participation in referendums , which often involve contentious issues .
The Supreme Court has blocked disclosure of the 138,000 names .
It should block the spreading infection of using disclosure as a tool of liberal coercion .

Even a broken clock is right twice a day .
Oh I bet you heard that before , but imagine with me for a second that you are paid every time that broken clock shows the correct time .
Now , let ’s also say that you are able to hit a button to randomize the time on that clock as many times as you want and when it hits the correct time , you get money .
What would you do ?
Would n’t you try to hit that button as many times as you could , assuming that the time it takes to do so is worth your while ?
I would .
In fact , I have proof , because this is pretty much how real life works and I have been known to experiment .
I never know whether I will be rewarded for my actions , but we are all ultimately paid according to the results that we achieve .
There are some consequences of failure , but for the most part , more actions leads to more positive results .
No one ever knows for sure whether success will come out of every project he / she gets involved in , but that should n’t be an obstacle .
Even if I jump into something new and do n’t get the desired result , I have gained a great deal of knowledge .
Now , that ’s power .
My boss used to love asking me to do everything because I almost never say no .
At some level , one can argue that I was being taken advantaged of but it also gave me incredible exposure .
Exposure that led to experiences few receive , especially considering my age .
I mean , who would ever get a chance to help design an interior of a business building from the ground up , be in a a pressurized sales position handling multimillion dollar accounts , run an IT team and negotiate with its vendors at the same company ?
As I hopped within the company from job to job , it was insanely difficult but everything I did helped me so much .
Negotiation ?
Check , relationship building ?
Check .
Operational and technical skills ?
More checks .
It ’s not how much you read .
It ’s how much you have done and know .
Sometimes , you have to say no to stay focus , but there ’s incredible power with taking action and telling yourself yes .
Yes , you can do it .
Yes , you should do it .
Yes , you need to do it .
Get started .
From career to family to personal finance .
Get off your a** and do something about it .
About one million folding pushchairs manufactured by the British company Maclaren are being recalled in the USA because of 12 reports of fingertip amputations after children caught their hands in the hinge mechanism .
The product recall affects nine models of " umbrella " strollers which fold up for easier storage .
Maclaren USA received 15 reports of children placing their finger in the hinge , resulting in 12 reports of amputations .
Many of the same models are available in the UK but a spokeswoman for Maclaren said last night that talks with British trading standards authorities have not resulted in a recall in this country .
The affected models are manufactured in China and are distributed worldwide .
They include the Volo , Triumph , Quest Sport , Quest Mod , Techno XT , TechnoXLR , Twin Triumph , Twin Techno and Easy Traveller and sell for up to £ 245 each .
The recall covers pushchairs manufactured between 1999 and 2009 .
" Maclaren consulted with Trading Standards in the UK and , as our products conform to European safety standards ( EN1888 ) , it was agreed no action was deemed necessary " said a spokeswoman .
She confirmed that the same models with the same mechanisms to those being recalled in the USA are also sold in the UK , but stressed they conform to different trading standards in Europe and the USA .
She was not able to confirm whether the hinges of the UK models were any different to their American counterparts .
The US Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a statement today " the stroller 's hinge mechanism poses a fingertip amputation and laceration hazard to the child when the consumer is unfolding / opening the stroller " .
Now I have done it – spoken the unmentionable .
The Canadian Maple Leaf has been tarred , tainted , and tarnished and …. and directly blemished by name => Maple Leaf Tar Spot Rot .
What is there – a fungus among us ?
The Mysterious Rot Spots appearing on Canadian Maples this Fall in TO
Well as it turns out – yes indeed there is a Fungus Amongus – Rhytisma acerinum .
And the culprit is the fungus plus its co-conspirator :
Infected Fallen Leaves Spread the Blight
The problem is twofold .
Leaves a few decades ago got either burned or mulched and composted .
Raking and bagging is the current treatment .
The only problem is that if only a small number of infected leaves are left behind [ think of the parks in Toronto ] the fungus often survives the winter and then in the Spring those leftover infected leaves produce spores which are carried in the wind to reinfect the newly emerging Maple Leafs .
Here is what the University of Guelph , Pest Diagnostic Group has to say :
In the spring , spores are produced within the black stroma and are carried by air currents to young maple leaves where they start new infections .
Unlike many other foliar diseases , Rhytisma do not continue to cause new infections throughout the summer .
Infections first show up as yellow or pale green spots on the leaf surface in the early spring or summer .
The black , raised tar - like spots of R. punctatum and R. acerinum develop within these spots by mid to late summer .
Leaves , which are severely infected , may be shed .
Although the spots are conspicuous and detract from the appearance of the leaves , tar spot seldom is so injurious in home gardens to justify spraying with a fungicide .
As symptoms develop late in the growing season , the overall health of trees is usually not affected .
And that is the second problem – the fungus is not so bad .
Not so bad or disastrous means that the order of the day is generally to tolerate the problem , live with the unsightly fungus amongus , in short – to grin and bear the Toronto Maple Leafs .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As the H1N1 swine flu virus starts its second major sweep through the U.S. , business owners are bracing for the impact of a worse - than - usual flu season on their workforces .
That 's reviving debate on a contentious issue :
What kind of sick leave should companies offer employees -- and should it be mandated by law ?
" On the one hand , you have all of our top officials saying , ' Do the responsible thing .
If you 're sick , stay home , ' " says Debra Ness , president of the National Partnership for Women and Families , a Washington , D.C. - based advocacy group that is pushing for paid sick leave laws .
" You have advice from the Centers for Disease Control on exactly how many days you should stay home , and how many days we need to keep kids at home .
And at the same time , we have a country where almost half the workforce does n't have a single paid sick day . "
Currently , 48 % of the U.S. private - sector workforce can't take paid leave without advance notice , according to the National Partnership .
In response , unions and worker advocates have intensified their campaign for local laws requiring businesses to offer paid sick leave .
San Francisco voters passed a law requiring paid sick leave for all workers , full - or part - time , by referendum in 2006 , and Washington , D.C. , followed with its own law last year , though it exempted new hires and restaurant staff who earn part of their pay in tips .
Now 15 states and cities have paid sick leave bills in the works .
Earlier this year , Connecticut narrowly missed becoming the first state to mandate paid sick time , when the state legislature fell one vote short of passing a bill that would have required businesses with 50 employees or more to provide up to six and a half paid sick days per year .
With swine flu panic beginning to build -- reports of flu - like illness are already up sharply three months before the traditional start of flu season -- some elected officials are taking the opportunity to press for new legislation .
" This is definitely pressing because of all the projections of how the swine flu and the regular flu season will be affecting people , " says Shula Warren , chief of staff for New York City council member Gale Brewer .
Mandated leave
In May , Brewer introduced a sick - leave law modeled on San Francisco 's : nine days a year of paid time off for workers at businesses with 10 or more employees , five days for those at smaller businesses .
The legislation , which already has 38 of the city 's 51 council members as sponsors , would also allow workers to use sick time to care not only for ill children , but also for kids whose schools are closed because of swine flu fears .
" A child ca n't stay home without a parent staying with them , " Warren says .
" So if the parent does n't have paid sick time , the child mostly likely goes to school , and the parent goes to work . "
In response , the chambers of commerce from each of New York 's five boroughs have banded together to form the 5 Boro Chamber Alliance to fight the paid - leave bill .
Their main concern is what they see as an excessive number of days required , and the inflexibility it would impose on small business owners .
" Government is trying to do something that 's well - intentioned , but they have no idea what the effect is on a small business owner , " says Jack Friedman , executive vice - president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce .
" So our business owners are coming back to us and saying , ' We already offer our employees some sick days -- five sick days , six sick days .
And the difference between what we 're offering and what the government is requiring us to offer could cost our business tens of thousands of dollars . ' "
For many workers , though , even five sick days is an unheard - of benefit .
As part of its soon - to - be - released annual Unheard Third survey of 1,212 New Yorkers , the Manhattan - based Community Service Society is estimating that 39 % of all workers -- amounting to 1.3 million people citywide -- have no paid leave of any kind .
In the leisure and hospitality industries , which include restaurants and food service , only 23 % are allotted paid sick leave .
Nationwide , the same trend holds :
The proportions of workers without paid leave are higher in lower - wage industries , including food service , nursing care , and retail workers .
" Oftentimes , the folks who are most in contact with the public are the ones who are least likely to have paid sick days and be able to stay home when they 're sick , " says the National Partnership 's Ness .
Preparing for an outbreak
The federal government has already stepped up its warnings to business owners :
The Department of Homeland Security recently released a guide for small businesses on how to handle the onset of flu season .
Included are recommendations to reduce the spread of infection in the workplace , such as providing no - touch trash cans and hand sanitizer and assigning a " workplace coordinator " for flu issues .
The federal guidelines also call for encouraging employees to work from home if necessary , and for " flexible , non-punitive , and well - communicated " leave policies .
Yet advocates of mandatory paid leave argue that without a guarantee that they 'll be paid for time off , employees may just show up for work regardless of their health or the effect on their fellow workers .
Organizations that work with restaurant workers report that when members try to call in sick , " Either they 're told , ' Just do n't bother coming in at all ever again , ' or they 're told , 'okay , that 's fine , but you 're going to lose your Friday and Saturday shift , ' " Warren says .
In response , some workers may choose going to work infectious rather than risking their livelihood .
Friedman acknowledges that leave time at restaurants and other businesses with no paid leave " needs to be something addressed . "
Yet he worries that the terms of the New York bill are unnecessarily broad .
Gil Cygler , whose All Car Rent A Car employs about 60 people in locations across New York City , says he already provides his workers with five sick days , two weeks vacation , and personal and bereavement leave .
" I do believe people should be entitled to some sick time , " Cygler says .
" But it 's very difficult when you have the government coming in and telling you how many days you have to give . "
If nothing else , he suggests , there should be lower requirements for businesses with fewer workers per site -- " We have some offices with one or two people in them " -- or tax credits to help ease the costs of providing paid sick time .
Spencer Rothschild is the operator of Barrio Foods , which runs three restaurants in Brooklyn as well as the cafe at the Brooklyn Public Library .
He 's well aware of the flu warnings :
He 's already posted timers in his kitchens that go off every 30 minutes , reminding everyone to wash their hands .
Like virtually all other restaurateurs , though , he does n't offer paid sick leave to his roughly 50 employees , and does n't plan to .
" I think it 's a little hefty for small businesses to have to consider , " he says .
" Obviously , we feel for everybody , and we wish we could afford to do it . "
He also worries that guaranteed sick time would lead to employees calling in sick when healthy just to use up their paid time : " Is n't that the way corporate America has proven it to be ?
If you know anyone who works there , they 're counting their days and going on extra vacations . "
Rothschild says he's " a firm believer " in parental leave policies , in part because they can't be abused .
But for sick leave , he 'd rather continue dealing with it on an ad - hoc basis .
" If you have one employee that every so often you have to say , ' Hey , I think your coughing wo n't work in this environment , ' it is very different than granting carte blanche to everyone , " he says .
Council member Gale Brewer 's office says it intends to work with local business owners to modify the bill to avoid any " unintended consequences , " and has already scheduled an early - October meeting with members of the 5 - Boro Alliance .
( Cygler says he plans to attend . )
Meanwhile , all the local battles could become moot if Congress ever takes up the Healthy Families Act , which would provide up to seven paid sick days a year at all companies with 15 or more employees .
Initially spearheaded by the late Sen . Ted Kennedy and now taken up by Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , and Rep. Rose DeLauro , D - Conn. , there 's been no action on the bill since June .
Legislators hope to introduce it as part of a family leave reform package when Congress finally moves on from health care reform .
If so , it could remove at least one complaint many business owners have about providing paid leave :
That it puts them at a disadvantage to competitors who do n't .
" I wish we lived in a world where we could count on everybody to do the right thing , but unfortunately we don't , " says Ness .
" And the employers that do the right thing often would tell you :
They would like it to be a more level playing field . "

Three boys have been arrested in connection with the so - called " ginger attacks , " instigated by a Facebook message , in which at least seven red - haired children were beaten up at a Calabasas middle school , a sheriff 's spokesman said this morning .
Two 12 - year - old students at A.E. Wright Middle School were arrested on suspicion of battery on school property , and a 13 - year - old boy was accused of threatening to inflict injury " by means of electronic communication . "
" The charge against the 13 - year - old male is commonly referred to as cyber - bullying , something that is occurring way too much , " said Steve Whitmore , spokesman for the L.A. County Sheriff 's Department .
The children were booked Wednesday before being released to the custody of their parents .
No court date has been set for their initial appearance at Sylmar Juvenile Hall .
Sheriff ’s detectives are continuing to investigate the assaults and have identified eight boys at the school as subjects of the investigation .
Authorities believe the attacks were spurred by a Facebook message about “ Kick a Ginger Day , " inspired by the television show " South Park . "

A gigantic , multi-million dollar bronze statue rising over the skyline of the Senegalese capital is causing a colossal storm for the man who conceived it .
Senegal 's President Abdoulaye Wade has called it " African Renaissance " but his critics say it reveals more about the continent 's poor governance than its renaissance .
We should see how we share the benefits .
The state will go with 65 % and l shall take 35 % for myself
President Abdoulaye Wade
When it is finished , the statue will be taller than New York 's Statue of Liberty - it had been said it would be bigger than the Eiffel Tower in Paris .
It depicts three figures - a man holding a woman behind him and a child aloft and pointing out to sea .
Mr Wade wants it to represent the new aspirations of a younger generation and to become a money - making tourist attraction .
But there have been gasps about the $ 27 m ( £ 17 m ) price tag and the fact that it is being made by North Koreans .
" I hear some people compare the Renaissance statue to the Eiffel Tower , " says Amadou Camara , who teaches economics and is the director of the Commerce and Business Institute in Dakar .
" But the French had first sorted out their food before they built the Eiffel Tower . " ' Not African ' Art-lovers have also expressed concern .
For some it has a Stalinist feel reminiscent of communist regimes , while others simply say it has no real soul or African appeal .
" To have a work of art in the town , it 's very good .
The only thing is , for me , it 's not typically African , " says Alassane Diagne , an art promoter in Dakar .
" I do n't understand why we did n't have an African artist . "
Joel Dussy
Fall , the owner of one of the country 's best - known art galleries is also confounded by the fact it was not designed and built in Africa .
But it is the revelation that the president himself wants to earn money from the venture that has really shocked city residents .
When he visited the building site in September , he explained how the money generated from people visiting the site and its museums would be shared .
" The land is state property and the fees to build the statue have been paid by the state ... but I am the designer , the one who conceived it , " said Mr Wade .
" So we should see how we share the benefits .
The state will go with 65 % and l shall take 35 % for myself . "
There 's not a single large monument to visit in Dakar , so I believe this has come at the right time
Painter Kalidou Kasset Ousseynou Nar Gueye , an expert in intellectual property law , has written articles of protest in Senegalese newspapers , saying Mr Wade has no right to earn royalties from the project .
" As a designer , he is entitled to have a payment if ever he was the designer , but this is the down - payment which is paid once , " he says .
He also says as a public servant , the president cannot claim copyright over ideas conceived as a function of his office .
" I strongly believe the president of the republic has no legal ground to claim a payment of 35 % of all the money derived from La Renaissance , " he said .
Mr Camara says the president 's demands are that of a businessman rather than a man of the people .
" Since the beginning of the world , I have never heard , I have never seen , or never read , that a president has created something for his country , and is demanding 35 % in return , " he says .
" This should belong to Senegal - that is if any income is generated , all of it - 100 % - should be allocated to Senegal . "
Unused land However , the project has its defenders , including painter Kalidou Kasset , who believes it can only do good for the arts scene .
Some critics feel the statue has a Stalinist feel " We have a problem with large monuments in the cultural field and the artists have always denounced that situation , " he says " So if structures are built , it only can make the Senegalese artists happy and there 's not a single large monument to visit in Dakar , so I believe this has come at the right time . "
Aliou Sow , a government minister , argued when the ruckus first began that the land used to build the monument was sitting unused and drying under the sun .
President Wade should be praised for making good use of it , he said .
But the reactions which followed prompted him to join the rest of the government and keep quiet .
Well , quiet at least until next April when the monument is to be officially unveiled during a ceremony the government wants to be " big " and " memorable " .

The things people post on Facebook have gotten them in trouble with spouses , their employers , the law ( or not , as the case may be ) , and now their insurance companies .
A 29 - year - old Canada woman is now battling her insurance company , Manulife , after her sick leave benefits were revoked thanks to photos she posted on her Facebook page .
She was n't skipping out on work and she did n't even post a public update , but the company somehow managed to find her private photos and has decided to stop paying out .
Nathalie Blanchard took leave from her job at IBM a year and a half ago after being diagnosed with " major depression , " according to CBC News .
At that time , Manulife began paying out monthly sick leave checks as part of her benefit package — until Blanchard posted photos to her private Facebook profile depicting her having fun at her own birthday party .
The company apparently decided that people diagnosed with depression are incapable of having fun for even short periods of time , because Manulife pulled Blanchard 's benefits with no notice .
When she called to inquire about the checks , Manulife said she appeared to be " available to work " thanks to Facebook .
Whether Blanchard is , in fact , available to work remains an unanswered question to most of us — an answer that her doctor should determine , not us , and certainly not Manulife after seeing a few fun-looking photos .
Blanchard even claims she was following her doctor 's recommendation to go out and socialize , noting that she still has the same problems despite having a good time at the party .
" I do n't think for judging a mental state that Facebook is a very good tool , " Blanchard 's attorney Tom Lavin told CBC .
There 's another disturbing aspect to this story aside from an insurance company taking action on what it seems to think is insurance fraud .
Manulife confirmed that it does , in fact , use social networking sites to investigate clients , but Blanchard supposedly posted the photos to her very locked - down profile — she said she keeps it private to the world at large and only allows individually approved friends to see the things she posts .
If this is true , how did Manulife manage to get ahold of her photos , and should privately posted photos be considered open evidence in a situation like this ?
Of course , most people can access private photos posted to Facebook if they know the direct image URL — including photos that were deleted from Facebook , as we learned earlier this year .
Blanchard could have had a " friend " who decided to tip off Manulife with a few helpful links , reemphasizing the need for tight privacy controls .
No matter how hard you lock down your Facebook profile , a friend ( or an insurance company who knows who your friends are ) can expose everything you post — private or not .

Blowing the Whistle , will not be published by Triumph Books , an imprint of Former NBA referee Tim Donaghy 's exposé , , will not be published by Triumph Books , an imprint of Random House , after " independent evaluation " of some of his allegations .
Excerpts from the book , published on Deadspin.com , allege NBA referees — including current ones — showed favoritism to some players and coaches and disdain for others , prompting Donaghy to bet a certain way .
Donaghy was sentenced to 15 months in prison in July 2008 for his role in a betting scandal , including accepting money from a gambler in exchange for inside information on NBA games .
" After a close legal review of the final manuscript of Blowing the Whistle by Tim Donaghy , and our independent evaluation of some of the author 's sources and statements , Triumph Books and Random House have decided not to go forward with the book 's publication .
Our decision is wholly our own and was made without consultation with any outside parties or individuals , " Random House spokesman Stuart Applebaum said in a statement .
Donaghy is free to pitch his book to another publisher , Applebaum said .
The NBA and the referees union maintain Donaghy acted alone in his illicit exchanges and that the league 's referees are impartial .
The book was scheduled for release at the beginning of the NBA season but was cancelled " several weeks ago , " Applebaum said .
The NBA denied threatening Random House with a lawsuit , league spokesman Tim Frank said .
" When you publish controversial books , as we often do , it is not unusual for interested parties to contact us with their opinion about our prospective publication , " Applebaum told USA TODAY .
" We always listen to what 's being said .
The decision as to whether we publish a book is always our own decision based on the manuscript and its veracity and accuracy . "
Applebaum would not say if the NBA contacted Random House .
" In 2008 Mr. Donaghy 's allegations were thoroughly investigated by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney 's Office .
We are reassured that the U.S. Government completed its investigation finding that the only criminal conduct was that of Mr. Donaghy , " Elizabeth Ventura , senior vice president of communications for the NBA , said in a statement .
After the Donaghy case surfaced , the NBA appointed independent investigator Lawrence Pedowitz to review its officiating program and " Pedowitz 's review revealed that the NBA 's core values of neutrality and accountability were not compromised by anyone other than Mr. Donaghy , " Ventura said .
Donaghy latest claims from the unpublished book will be turned over to Pedowitz , Ventura said .
In their statement , the referees union said : " The National Basketball Referees Association is disappointed , but not surprised , with the actions taken by Tim Donaghy .
This continues to be the Tim that we know .
He repeatedly attempts to highlight himself in the media , but the 59 NBA referees will continue to officiate games with the utmost integrity and the focus will remain on the 2009 - 2010 NBA Season . "

Batman 's cool .
I mean , he 's a scientist , and he 's a detective , and he 'll kick you in the face soooo hard that you 'll probably , I dunno , end up not really having all of your face anymore .
Only , he would n't do that unless you really asked for it , like if you were a bad guy and you were kidnapping some kids or maybe if you had a gun that did n't belong to you .
Batman works the nightshift , because that 's when his costume looks best , and he's got a huge cave with all kinds of gadgets .
He also has a butler who gets him soup !
And sometimes , he has a twelve year old boy who runs around with him in spandex and -
And what , exactly ?
Not sure .
The official line is " helps him fight crime , " but , um , I can't think of many crime - fighting type situations where you 'd say , " Man , I could totally foil these bad - guys if I just had a partner who can't get a learner 's permit ! "
It 's all very suspicious .
Robin was initially created to give comic book readers an identification character , but he 's been causing all sorts of trouble over the years , because no matter how you look at it , he does n't make any sense .
At least not any healthy sense , if you get me .
In " Handsome Ransom , " we get a few new members to the Venture - verse , as well as the return of some old favorites .
The episode does n't play the same games with chronology as last week 's , preferring instead to tell its twisted tale of icky love lost , found , then lost again as straightforwardly as possible .
While the results are n't as exhilarating as " Heart of Steel , " " Ransom " still largely fun and occasionally squirm - inducing , which , let 's face it , is pretty much the ideal state for the show .
The Monarch and Dr. Girlfriend are back , and up to their old tricks ; only this time , having kidnapped Hank and Dean , the Monarch demands a $ 10 million ransom for their return .
He argues that hitting Doc Venture in the pocketbook is going to ruin the guy 's day a lot faster than the nuttier schemes they 've tried in the past , and in a way he 's right .
Venture 's money problems have been a big part of the series since the first season , and given that he lacks the inventive know - how of his brother , or the people skills necessary to fake his way through any business situation , it 's doubtful those problems will get resolved any time soon .
But Venture 's lack of funds is so deep that Monarch 's demands do n't really hit him that hard — he ends up getting the money off Bill Quizboy and Pete White .
Really , though , while the machinations of the Monarch and Doc are fun , the real heart of the episode is Captain Sunshine , a super - hero a , um , colorful costume , cheery mansion , and serious , serious issues .
He swipes Hank away from the Monarch and , due some mild misunderstanding between the two ( Hank is having problems with his father ; from what we 've seen so far this season , he 's developed the most of the two Venture boys , post — clone , and one of those developments is teenage surliness ) , offers Hank the job of Wonder Boy , sidekick and , ah , who knows what else .
In case the two Batman meta - references were n't enough , Sunshine is voiced by Kevin Conroy , arguably the definitive Batman actor ( he did the voice for Batman : The Animated Series , as well as most of its spin - offs ) .
Conroy does a great job — I would n't have known it was him if I had n't known he was guest - voicing — and the parallels between side - kicking and sex are taken about as far as they can go without being completely off - putting .
My only issue with this is , we already have Sgt.
Hatred on the show as a regular , do we really need more pedophile gags ?
" Ransom " manages to dodge this by making Sunshine 's relationship with his Wonder Boys so specific that it does n't seem repetitive , especially given the fact that Batman - doing - Robin jokes have been around since Wertham 's Seduction of the Innocent ( if not before ) .
But while I appreciate the mythology here , especially the brief - glimpses of Sunshine 's history , especially his co-super - heroing buds at Channel 5 , I 'm not entirely convinced teenage - boy - [ bleep ] ing is the best well to be returning to .
That caveat aside , I laughed a lot , and having a parody of Robin does seem like an inevitability for Publick and Hammer 's unique brand of whimsy .
So long as next week does n't feature some kind of Teen Titans - inspired orgy , I 'd say we 're golden .
Stray Observations :
Here is an email from " FJ " regarding his attempt to enter the mortgage modification program at Fannie Mae. " FJ " writes :
Hey Mish ,
I always found it humorous when you posted people 's dealing with their mortgage lender , hence my personal submission .
We applied for Fannie Mae 's mortgage modification program only to be denied during the probation period for paying too early .
Evidently , paying your mortgage one day early signifies an " over willingness " to pay ( i.e. keep current ) and from FNM 's perspective .
That means you can afford the original payment .
Here was my response :
" Look man , I 'm on my second layoff in 2 1 / 2 years and my wife 's company is hanging by a thread so I think I 'll stop paying you now .
For the next 6 - 12 months I 'll save what would normally be spent on carrying / maintaining our underwater mortgage , while you run through the process of foreclosing .
My loan 's non-recourse so no worries there .
And we 'll have no problem renting a home just as nice for 1/3 the cost .
The way I see it , I need incentives to stay . "
And that 's where I left it .

On Saturday , T - Mobile and Danger issued a statement to their customers , warning that the data " that is no longer on your Sidekick almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft / Danger . "
Bad news , T - Mobile Sidekick owners : your data may be gone for good .
Last Monday , when their Danger Sidekick devices lost data services , losing access to their address books , calendars , and other services which Danger owner Microsoft had stored in the cloud .
On Saturday , T - Mobile and Danger issued a statement to their customers , warning that the data " that is no longer on your Sidekick almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft / Danger . "
" That said , our teams continue to work around - the - clock in hopes of discovering some way to recover this information , " the two companies added .
" However , the likelihood of a successful outcome is extremely low . "
Although Danger is owned by Microsoft , a proponent of cloud - based computing , where data is stored and possibly reproduced across a number of services , apparently only one server was used .
The loss is undoubtedly more acute for Danger , which touted the server - based model as one that promised an advantage over its competitors .
" Our architecture shifts heavy processing tasks to our server instead of client devces [ sic ] , creating the power and economic advantage of the Danger solution , " Danger claims .
" The system components work together to provision and manage all user services and user data , and allows our developer community to create premier mobile content . "
The two companies strongly recommended that users not totally discharge the Sidekick battery or remove it , as that would eliminate the address book and other stored data from the Sidekick 's memory .
" We continue to advise customers to NOT reset their device by removing the battery or letting their battery drain completely , as any personal content that currently resides on your device will be lost , " the Danger / T - Mobile statement said .
But one of the proposed solutions in the linked FAQ to restore contacts suggests doing just that , removing the battery and placing it in another T - Mobile device , to try and save contacts to the SIM .
Other suggestions include emailing contacts from Outlook or Gmail in vCard format .
T- Mobile had already begun promising customers who had been hit by the outage a month of free data service .
T - Mobile also implied that more compensation would be coming soon : " We also are considering additional measures for those of you who have lost your content to help reinforce how valuable you are as a T - Mobile customer , " the company said .
Kennedy Space Center , Florida ( CNN ) -- NASA launched its
Ares I - X rocket Wednesday , after multiple delays over two days because of bad weather .
The 327 - foot rocket -- which NASA considers the world 's largest -- took off at 11:30 a.m. ET , 30 minutes before a noon deadline for the launch .
It rose about 24 miles .
About two minutes after liftoff , the first - stage , reusable rocket booster fell into the Atlantic , where it was to be picked up by a ship .
It was the first flight test for the Constellation Program , NASA 's next - generation spacecraft and launch vehicle system .
The rocket 's launch is part of NASA 's mission to someday return astronauts to the moon and later travel to Mars .
NASA spokesman George Diller , who was moderating the launch preparations for broadcasters , communicated the frustration as launches were repeatedly called off with just minutes to go .
After 11 a.m. , it appeared there would be a narrow window for a liftoff , and a half - hour later the rocket roared skyward .
" I can't tell you how proud I am of all of you , " Ed Mango , Ares I - X launch director , told engineers and others inside the center after the launch .
" That was just one of the most beautiful rocket launches I 've ever seen . "
" It shows what we can do when we have a common goal . "
As the clock ticked toward noon , NASA officials nervously awaited all - clears for technical items and a weather clearance from weather officer Kathy Winters who , time and again , said conditions were " red , " meaning a no - go .
A reconnaissance plane was giving her frequent weather reports .
She kept looking for a break in the high - level clouds .
" It 's a very dynamic situation , " Winters said .
Before the launch , the space agency had begun negotiating with the Air Force to see if a Thursday launch attempt was possible .
Failing that , NASA could n't have tried again until November 16 .
NASA 's primary concern was the high - level , cold clouds that can cause triboelectrification , or the production of a kind of static electricity , similar to what happens when you walk across a carpet , then touch something .
If static surrounds the rocket , it can interfere with radio signals sent by or to the rocket .
The Constellation Program has been developing new vehicles to replace space shuttles , which will be phased out in 2010 .
If the program moves forward , the Orion capsule atop the Ares rocket will not be ready to take astronauts into space until at least 2015 , leaving a gap of at least five years in which the only way the United States would be able to put humans in orbit would be by hitching a ride with the Russians .
Part of the test rocket mission is for scientists to try out three massive main parachutes , measuring 150 feet in diameter and weighing one ton each -- the largest rocket parachutes ever manufactured .
The parachutes are a primary element of the rocket 's deceleration system , NASA says .
After the rocket is successfully launched , the parachutes are to open at the same time , " providing the drag necessary to slow the descent of the huge solid rocket motor for a soft landing in the ocean , " the agency says on its Web site .
The two parts of the rocket are to separate at about 130,000 feet .
The top of the rocket , known as the upper stage , includes a mock Orion crew capsule and a launch abort system .
The upper stage will continue its ascent until gravity forces its return to Earth , after which it will fall into the Atlantic Ocean .
The launch comes at a critical time , when NASA is waiting for President Obama to decide future funding for the agency .
An independent committee reviewing the future of space flight recently reported that the U.S. space program appears to be pursuing goals that exceed current funding .
The committee also recommended to the White House that funding for NASA 's under - construction international space station should be extended until 2020 .
CNN 's Kim Segal and John Zarrella contributed to this report .
As we 're all undoubtedly aware , old gadgets do n't really die -- they just get modded eternally ( as the continued appearance of Atari on these pages will attest ) .
Another case - in - point : the Sony VAIO UX490N .
It 's been a while since we laid eyes on one of these bad boys , but apparently there 's been plenty of hacking goin ' on ever since , including : upgrading the SSD to the RunCore Pro IV 128GB and swapping out the 1.2GHz CPU for a 1.33 GHz Core 2 Duo ( overclocked to 1.438GHz ) .
And that 's just the beginning -- the cats over at the Micro PC Talk forums have also installed a voice - capable HSPA modem , swapped out the old wireless card for one that supports a / b / g/n WiFi , and installed partitions for Windows XP Pro , Windows Vista Business , Windows 7 Ultimate and Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.7 .
Impressive stuff , all that : but what if we told you that one fearless individual has applied every one of those changes to a single device ?
And that battery life was pretty much unaffected ?
Well , you 're probably going to want the details , right ?

“ Powerlessness .
Utter powerlessness .
At first I was angry , then I learned to live with it . ”
These are reportedly the words of Belgian man Rom Houben , believed for over 20 years to be in a vegetative state .
Houben drew the attention of the global media this week when it emerged that he may have been conscious the whole time .
Videos appeared of him typing his thoughts into a touch screen ; he was even reported to be writing a book about his experiences .
Then doubts surfaced as to whether Houben really was typing , because his finger is guided by an aide .
Steven Laureys of University of Liège in Belgium , who first diagnosed Houben as being conscious in 2006 , told New Scientist how he knows he was right – and showed his anger at the speculation over the typing .
From the online videos , it looks as if when Rom Houben types , his eyes are closed , he types surprisingly quickly and that his hand is guided by an aide .
Can we be sure the words attributed to him are really his ?

What is happening now is very regrettable .
I feel sorry for Rom and about what some people have written on the net .
He knows what people are saying , and one can only try to imagine what he has already been through .
He has gone from being ignored for many years and considered vegetative to being recognised as conscious .
And now he is again being treated as if “ it is impossible , he cannot be a cognitive being ” .
Should I respond to that ?
I do n’t want to .
I accept some people may have been insensitive , but could it be possible that he is n’t really communicating through the finger - guided touch screen ?
I am a scientist , I am a sceptic and I will not accept any communication device if it is not properly tested .
But I am not the one who made him communicate with the touch screen , I was just there to help him get rid of the diagnosis of vegetative state .
And I do n’t think one can say , based on videos on the internet , something meaningful about the use of the touch screen .
Did you ever communicate with him in any other way ?
He has undergone a very extensive medical and neurological assessment – but as his physician I can not tell you more .
I am in a difficult position : do you want me to put his medical record on the internet , or show the videos we made for his assessment ?
I do n’t think you would like it if I put results of your IQ test on the internet .
Can you say what makes you so sure he is conscious ?
When I first saw Rom three years ago , he had been diagnosed as being in a vegetative state .
We used the Coma Recovery Scale – Revised ( PDF ) , which is a bedside behavioural assessment done in a very standardised way , and which you do repeatedly so as not to miss any signs of consciousness .
And he showed minimal signs of consciousness .
So we did n’t even need fancy scanning methods to change the diagnosis .
Then he had a brain scan – and we saw near - normal brain function .
What kind of a brain scan did you do ?
He had many scans – but I do n’t want to go into this .
We can limit ourselves to one brain scan , a PET scan , which is very straightforward .
It measures the brain energy used by injecting radioactively labelled glucose .
How did this indicate he was conscious – I thought we did n’t yet have a signature of consciousness ?
You are right , we do n’t have the neural correlate of consciousness .
However , there is a whole literature on the brain ’s metabolic activity in the vegetative state and on its activity when it is functioning normally .
We wrote a paper on this in Lancet Neurology in 2004 , in which we reviewed how PET scanning has shown high metabolic levels in the brains of patients in a locked - in syndrome compared with those in a vegetative state .
However , what is still a major challenge is to disentangle vegetative from a minimally conscious state and other disorders of consciousness .
This is not as black and white .
Can you elaborate ?
In July we published our paper in BMC Neurology showing that 41 per cent of vegetative patients may actually be minimally conscious , based on the Coma Recovery Scale – Revised .
Rom is different to this because he has more than minimal brain function – his brain scans show that he has near normal function .
But he has still put a human face to the very important problem of assessing consciousness , the importance of using a standardised scale and the power of neuro - imaging .
Are you following up with these people too ?
Yes , we are following up with all the patients .
So far we have only shown they are in a minimally conscious state , whereas Rom has a higher level of consciousness .
TOKYO | Hyundai Motor Co. - not the up - and - coming Chinese , nor the leaner , meaner Americans - is the automaker that has the Japanese seriously worried .
Talk to any Japanese auto executive , and the official is likely to say the South Korean automaker is rapidly emerging as the competitor most feared by Japan ’s world - leading car companies .
“ Hyundai is awesome , ” Honda Motor Co. Chief Executive Takanobu Ito said in an interview this week .
“ They are undoubtedly a threat because their products are cheap , and the quality is improving . ”
Nissan Motor Co. Senior Vice President Shiro Nakamura agreed .
He compared the rise of Hyundai to Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea , which has grown to rival Japan ’s Sony Corp. , and said its cars were riding on their reputation for quality and affordability .
It may take another decade for China ’s automakers to start seriously competing with Nissan , but Hyundai was there already , he said .
“ Hyundai is the biggest threat for the Japanese automakers , ” Mr. Nakamura said .
“ They have the technology , but they seem to have cheaper labor . ”
To compete , Japanese manufacturers need to start relying more on their creative “ sensibilities ” to add value to a product , almost like a European designer bag , Mr. Nakamura said .
Buyers must want to pay more in the same way Japanese gourmet delicacies called “ kaiseki ” can command higher prices than some Korean dishes , he said .
“ We have to offer the equivalents of sushi , tempura and kaiseki to compete against Korean barbecue , ” Mr. Nakamura said .
Hyundai , which boasts Kia Motors Corp. as an affiliate , recently grabbed 5 percent global market share for the first time , despite a declining global market .
These days , Hyundai and Kia form the world ’s fifth - largest automative group and have seen sales surge in the U.S. and Europe , with only Toyota Motor Corp. , the world ’s biggest automaker , outselling it among the Japanese .
In the U.S. , Hyundai was the only one among the major automakers , including the Japanese , to record better sales last month , up 27 percent from September 2008 .
The Japanese automakers have been battered by last year ’s financial crisis , although they are counting on expansion in emerging markets to offset declining sales in established markets such as the U.S. , Europe and Japan .
Nissan , Japan ’s No. 3 automaker , based in Yokohama , lost $ 185 million for the quarter ended June 30 .
Hyundai , by contrast , earned $ 691 million in the April - June period - a quarterly record for the company .
Christopher Richter , auto analyst at Calyon Capital Markets Asia in Tokyo , said Hyundai was growing not only in the U.S. market , where it was taking advantage of a weakened GM to grab sales , but has been strong for years in emerging nations , such as China and India .
Although both the Korean won and Japanese yen have been strengthening , eroding the value of overseas earnings for both exporting nations , the yen ’s jump has been bigger , further putting the Japanese at a disadvantage , Mr. Richter said .
He said the smaller Japanese makers , such as Nissan and Mazda Motor Corp. , were especially at risk because their products did n’t rank as high in quality surveys as Toyota and Honda , and compete more directly with Hyundai offerings .
“ They are not an act you want to dismiss lightly , ” he said .
“ They are increasingly going to create a bigger challenge to the Japanese . ”
Hyundai spokesman Oles Gadacz said the company had no comment .
Tokyo - based Honda , with its longtime strength in smaller models reputed for mileage such as the Fit subcompact , has emerged from the global recession in better shape than other Japanese automakers .
But the nation ’s No. 2 automaker barely eked out a $ 84 million profit in the April - June quarter .
Honda ’s Mr. Ito acknowledged as possible threats the U.S. automakers , including General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. , which have been reshaping their businesses and preparing smaller fuel - efficient models that are likely to compete better against Honda models .
But he appeared to be merely being polite in talking about the Americans and turned adamant when the topic became Hyundai .
“ Its growth is fantastic , ” said Mr. Ito .

A day after the New York Yankees came back to win Game 3 , Johnny Damon became the difference - maker with a two - out , ninth - inning , game - saving performance .
The Yankees took a 3 - 1 World Series lead with a 7 - 4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies just after the reigning champs had started a rally in the seventh inning .
Chase Utley took CC Sabathia ’s 107th pitch of the evening into the right - field bleachers to make it a one - run game on his third bomb of the Series .
An inning later , Pedro Feliz nailed a 97 mph Joba Chamberlain fastball the opposite direction to tie it up .
Enter the once unhittable Brad Lidge .
However , an impostor ( the same wannabe who stood in his place time and again this season ) stood on the mound and completely blew it .
The Phillies closer — an incredible 48 - for - 48 in save opportunities last season — sent Hideki Matsui and Derek Jeter packing to kick off the inning .
Then Johnny Damon stepped up to the plate and Citizen ’s bank was going nuts .
Nine pitches later , the left fielder was standing on first base after punching one into left field .
What he did next really won the game for the Yanks : he stole second with Mark Teixeira at the plate , then third when he saw it was wide open and ready for the taking with Pedro Feliz covering second and his head up his rear .
Alex Rodriguez then came up with probably the biggest hit of his life to drive in Damon before Jorge Posada brought in two more .
And maybe none of that would ’ve been possible without Damon ’s heads - up sprint from first to an uncommanded third base .
New York ’s A.J. Burnett , on short rest , will face the unstoppable force known as Cliff Lee for Game 5 in the house of the - 157 favorite Phillies at 7:57 pm ET on FOX .

H ere ’s my proposed constitutional amendment .
It ’s not complicated .
“ It shall be unlawful for any person or corporation to display any election campaign ads on television .
The Congress shall have the power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article . ”
If , within ten years after enactment , the amendment has raised the level of political discourse in our country ( as I believe it will ) , I would then propose an expansion of the prohibition , something like this :
“ It shall be unlawful for any advertising agency to have anything whatsoever to do with any political campaign . ”
I know , I know .
Banning all TV election campaign ads would violate the First Amendment ’s guarantee of freedom of speech .
But wait !
Here ’s why I ’m suggesting that the U.S. Congress initiate the process for amending the Constitution :
For several years , the standard tool for persuading voters to support or reject a candidate or an electoral proposition has been the 30 - second TV ad , usually negative .
For the most part , these ads are uninformative , misleading , dishonest , deceptive , manipulative -- and from the point of view of helping the voter to make a rational decision on how to cast his or her vote -- utterly useless .
The targeted candidate does n’t get a chance to rebut the distortion or half - truth until later , sometimes much later .
Meanwhile , the distortion seeps into the TV viewer ’s brain , well , like sewage into a sump .
Ninety per cent of all political TV ads this electoral season are expected to be negative .
Of them , many if not most will contain distortions or outright lies .
Since the Republicans excel at this endeavor , the election results could again be disastrous .
We 've got to come up with a long - range solution to the scurrilous - ad problem .
From the racially fear - mongering Willie Horton TV ad used against Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign , to the sickening Osama bin Laden ad used to trash a severely disabled war veteran , Democratic Georgia Senator Max Cleland in 2002 , to the Swift - Boat smear of John Kerry in 2004 , to the current flock of ads -- like the one of a jailhouse - gang - in - a - prison - cell recently used by Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum against Democratic candidate Bob Casey -- these artifacts of propaganda add nothing to rational decision - making .
Of course , encouraging voters to make a reasoned decision is n’t what the game is about .
It ’s all about emotion , and these days the emotion being “ marketed ” is fear .
In recent years , political parties and groups have spent billions of dollars on these TV ads , which has been extremely profitable for advertising agencies .
They ’ve sharpened their skills enormously since Joe McGinnis wrote The Selling of the President in 1968 .
Putting ad agencies out of the elections business would be a praiseworthy act of patriotism .
Do n’t worry ; they wo n’t starve .
Since ad agencies are so good at what they do , they ’ll still be able to sell cars , trucks , beer , perfume , real estate and whatnot , using sex , faux - patriotism , snob appeal and reverse snob appeal .
Academics argue over whether negative campaign ads are intended to disgust segments of the public to the point of discouraging them from voting ( “ demobilization ” ) , or whether the ads are intended merely to convince voters to vote against the ads ’ targeted candidates .
It does n’t matter which academics are right .
The point is that America would be better off if these ads simply disappeared from our TV screens .
In their place , candidates and supporters / opponents of propositions should be required to debate one another on TV ( or , in a possible compromise proposal , to provide rebuttal time within their ads ) .
In that kind of exchange , the debaters could rebut each other ’s claims and misrepresentations , and the public could better assess the contenders .
Since most people ( except for the internet - oriented 18 to 36 - year - old segment of the population ) get their news from TV , this reform would go a long way towards improving our democracy .
Is my constitutional amendment such an outrageous idea ?
Maybe not .
Consider some of the other amendments to the U.S. Constitution that have been proposed in recent years .
Constitutional amendment proposals to reverse Supreme Court decisions have included banning abortion , allowing prayer in public schools , displaying the Ten Commandments on public property , and criminalizing flag burning by political protesters .
In June , President Bush proposed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage -- which certainly does n’t threaten the republic .
On the other hand , a manipulated electorate does .
These right - wing proposals were ( and remain ) very controversial and divisive .
They supposedly reflect the notions of morality held by some Americans .
But is n’t lying about a political opponent immoral ?
Why should anyone oppose the scuttling of a delivery system for deception , manipulation and political poison ?
Well , some people might , so let them be heard .
My modest constitutional reform may not eliminate entirely the polluting aspects of political smear tactics in election campaigns , but it would at least vaporize the worst of them from the most powerful medium -- television .

Russia delays Iranian reactor , Turkey awaits response on uranium storage
Iran wants nuclear plant to be operational in 2011 : IAEA Vienna ( AFP ) Nov 16 , 2009 - Iran has told the UN atomic watchdog that a second uranium enrichment plant is expected to be up and running in 2011 , the International Atomic Energy Agency said Monday .
Iran , which is already enriching uranium in defiance of UN sanctions at a plant in Natanz , recently revealed to the IAEA that it is building another inside a mountain near the holy Shiite city of Qom .
That second smaller site is meant as a back - up should Natanz be bombed by , for example , Israel .
Tehran plans to have it operational by 2011 , the Islamic Republic told the IAEA in a letter dated October 28 , 2009 .
The letter was cited in a new restricted report by the IAEA on its six - year investigation into the Islamic Republic 's controversial nuclear programme .
In its letter to the IAEA , Iran stated that the work on turning the site into an enrichment plant had started in the second half of 2007 .
" The construction is still ongoing .
Thus the plant is not yet ready for operation and it is planned to be operational in 2011 , " the IAEA quoted the letter as stating .
A copy of the report was obtained by AFP .

Moscow ( UPI ) Nov 16 , 2009
Russia said the launch of a nuclear power plant it is building in Iran will be delayed , in a move observers say is linked to the slow progress in the nuclear conflict with the Islamic Republic .
" We expect serious results by the end of the year , but the launch itself will not take place , " Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko was quoted by the BBC as saying .
" The engineers have to reach their findings . "
The plant at Bushehr in southern Iran was due to go online by the end of this year .
The minister said the plant 's construction at Bushehr in southern Iran " is defined absolutely 100 percent by technological conditions , " but observers believe the delay is due to the stalemate in the conflict over Iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program .
The International Atomic Energy Agency , the U.N. nuclear watchdog , Monday issued a report critical of Iran after officials there in September unveiled a previously secret enrichment site that is being built around 20 miles north of Qom .
The revelation increased doubts that there are no more other secret sites , the IAEA said , " and gives rise to questions about whether there were any other nuclear facilities in Iran which had not been declared . "
Russia and the United States over the weekend warned Iran not to ignore a recent compromise proposal that would keep negotiations running .
U.S. President Barack Obama said in Singapore that he was unhappy about Iran 's seeming unwillingness to agree to a plan drafted by the West aimed at removing concerns that the Iranian civil nuclear energy program was a cover to make nuclear weapons .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , after talks with Obama on Sunday , urged Iran to accept an offer to have its uranium enriched in Russia and France or face further diplomatic consequences .
Backed by the consent of Washington , Moscow and Paris , the United Nations has put forward a proposal to have a major share of Iran 's low - level uranium sent to Russia for processing .
The processed uranium would then go to France , where the country 's nuclear industry would convert it into fuel rods for use in Iranian reactors .
However , Tehran has missed a deadline to respond to the proposal .
Obama after the start of his presidency offered Iran direct negotiations regarding its nuclear program ; he has previously said that Tehran needed to prove it is willing to find a compromise in the conflict by the end of the year .
The Bushehr plant will feature two pressurized water reactors and is estimated to cost around $ 1 billion .
The uranium used there will be imported from Russia and also returned there to make sure it is not used to build a nuclear weapon .
Work at the facility was begun in 1974 with German aid , but the project was terminated after the Islamic revolution of 1979 .

Turkey awaits Iran response on storing uranium : minister
Ankara ( AFP ) Nov 16 , 2009 - Turkey is awaiting Iran 's response on an offer to store Tehran 's enriched uranium stockpile , but the proposal faces opposition in the Islamic Republic , Turkey 's foreign minister was quoted as saying Monday .
" The Iranians trust us ... but there is a great opposition within Iran .
They say the problem is not Turkey , but the fact that the uranium will be taken abroad , " the mass - selling Hurriyet daily quoted Ahmet Davutoglu as saying .
" From our point of view , the door is open .
We will store that ( the uranium ) as a kind of a trustee , " he told reporters accompanying him on a trip to Spain .
The proposal is part of efforts to ease Western fears that Iran 's nuclear programme is aimed at building an atomic bomb .
Addressing a business forum in Madrid on Monday , Davutoglu said there had " recently been a new proposal ... , whether Turkey could play a role for the exchange of these different levels of enriched uranium .
We are looking at this in a very positive manner . "
He said he spoke with Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , following a visit to Turkey by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last week .
" We hope that there could be a creative solution , and such a solution as a first step would help to overcome the psychological barrier .
" What we expect from everybody now is to make this a technical process of negotiation rather than an issue of political rhetoric or mutual statements which may harm the process . "
Last week , the New York Times reported that the US administration had told Iran that it is willing to allow the country to send its uranium stockpile to any of several nations , including Turkey , for safekeeping .
Citing unnamed administration officials and diplomats , the newspaper said the overtures had been made through the IAEA , with ElBaradei acting as the intermediary .
But Iran has ignored all of the proposals , it said .
Under a plan put forward by the IAEA on October 21 , Iran would ship out its low - enriched uranium , equivalent to more than 70 percent of its estimated stocks , and Russia would further enrich it before France turned it into fuel for a Tehran reactor .
The proposals are designed to assuage fears that Iran could otherwise divert some of the stocks and enrich them further to the much higher levels of purity required to make an atomic bomb .
World powers have endorsed the plan but Iran , which insists its nuclear programme is peaceful , has yet to give a final response .
Davutoglu on Monday praised " the new approach of President Obama which is a real window of opportunity " which could allow a solution diplomatic means .

You have free reign over your choice of packages to include or dismiss with Synaptic
Mainstream Linux distro developers have to make decisions that affect thousands of potential users .
Should they include or remove a particular package ?
Should they apply a patch that may break compatibility with older machines ?
These matters are discussed fiercely in forums where trolls growl , flames burn and project leaders defend their decisions against an onslaught of dissident .
But as an individual you have none of these issues .
You can install and remove packages as and when you want to , and you can choose whether to install free or non-free software on your system .
Why should you have to live with community decisions when you can make Linux work your way ?
However , the distribution you install will likely contain drivers and components that you do n't really want or need on your system .
Not only that , the software you always install on every new system has to be downloaded and installed separately each time , which is time - consuming and inconvenient .
That 's where we come in .
If you spend more time programming than you do playing games , you could replace the game packages with your favourite IDE .
Or why not remove drivers for hardware you 'll never need and save disk space ?
Those of you who found useful speed increases in last issue 's Supercharge Linux feature could even apply those tweaks automatically from the install stage .
Whether you 're tailoring a system for a particular machine or plotting to knock Ubuntu off its perch , there are myriad tools out there to help you do it .
Some are easier to use with less potential for customisation , while others are more difficult to configure but give you maximum control .
We 'll cover the pitfalls and which areas you can tweak and tailor to suit your needs , but in the end you are in control , and can apply as many or as few changes as you want – it 's your Linux , your way .
Tailor Ubuntu for your own ends
If you 're fed up with installing the same components each time you install Ubuntu , you 'll find this is by far the easiest way to customise your install CD to include those packages .
You 'll need 5 GB spare space on your hard drive , an Ubuntu install ISO and Ubuntu Customisation Kit installed from your package manager .
Once you have these resources available to you , simply launch UCK and follow the on -screen instructions .
You 'll find that most of the usual steps you would have had to take in the past to edit your live CD are all automated .
Add this to the intuitiveness of the GUI and it's easy to see that anyone with the inclination can customise their copy of Ubuntu quickly and easily .
You can edit Ubuntu as much or as little as you like but you 'll be the one calling the shots .
A common pitfall within the UCK setup is to miss the dialog that enables you to change which packages are included or omitted by default , with the result you wind up with a standard Ubuntu install disc with a custom name , which is n't overly useful !
To ensure you gain access to Synaptic , answer ' Yes ' when you 're asked whether you want to customise the CD manually during building .
This will give you a dialog that offers to open Synaptic or a terminal , or continue the installation .
Decisions , decisions
In our example ( cunningly called BobBuntu ) we installed the Medibuntu repository ( see LXF124 's tutorial on Ubuntu PPAs for more insight on this ) by opening the terminal from the dialog , and ran the following command :
wget http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/jaunty.list
--output-document=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list
You can then install the GPG key for the repository by typing :
apt - get update && apt - get install medibuntu - keyring && aptget update
This third - party repository gives us access to all kinds of non-free software such as Adobe Reader , Skype and codecs for restricted media formats .
Firing up Synaptic from the dialog should now show Skype packages available when you search for it ( you may need to reload the list of packages ) .
In BobBuntu we also stripped out OpenOffice.org and replaced it with AbiWord and Gnumeric , then removed Ekiga and replaced Firefox with Epiphany .
You can include your own choice of software from a Launchpad PPA and any third - party repositories , or remove packages you rarely use simply by checking and unchecking boxes .
Once you have committed your changes by clicking on Apply you can then proceed to the build stage , which will produce your live CD image in the / tmp / remaster - newfiles / directory as lived .iso .
When the build is complete you can burn this to CD or try the image out in a package such as VirtualBox to try your own personalised Ubuntu respin .
Ubuntu Customisation
Kit has an excellent array of features .
You can easily select packages , desktops and locales for instance , and you can also include Wubi if you 're distributing your respin to Windows users .
SATANIC DESIGNS :
Whatever your niche , there 's a Ubuntu respin out there for you
However , UCK does lack a few of the features that make the other tools and services worth considering .
For example , you can't define the look and feel of your Ubuntu respin without extensive terminal wizardry , and you can't create a boot image for a live USB ( though you can do this from your new live environment ) .
You 're also bound to Ubuntu as your host system and an Ubuntu variant as your final product , but despite these shortcomings UCK is a great introduction to distro development and is the ideal tool for those of you who simply want a copy of Ubuntu that installs and runs your favourite working environment from the outset .
Well dang , that was unexpected !
For you guys , anyway ( I hope ) .
I had it planned ALL ALONG MUAHAHAHAcoughcoughcoughbuglgbgluhglh

But give a society too much debt – either in its private sector or the public sphere – and someone ’s going to get killed .
That ’s why the present situation is such a delight to serious economists ; it offers more data points .
We get to see how much straw the feds can add before the poor camel ’s back breaks .
What ’s the best way to get through a debt crisis ?
Straight through was our advice last week .
For at least a thousand years , the business cycle went round and round without help from central bankers or economists .
It is only since these geniuses have been on the case that really serious problems have arisen .
The Panic of 1920 – in which the US government did nothing but cut taxes and spending – was quickly forgotten .
The Panic of 1929 , on the other hand , was followed by massive rigging and jiving by the authorities .
It took 20 years and a world war to overcome ; today it is still remembered today as the Great Depression .
Martin Wolf , speaking , gravely , for the world ’s intelligentsia in The Financial Times last week , proclaimed that : “ the only thing worse than rescuing the system would have been not rescuing it . ”
But he is wrong ; of all the many blessings economists may bestow upon a grateful people , improving the economy is not one of them .
An economy is a natural thing .
It can be improved by the striving of entrepreneurs , the prudence of bankers , and the sweating of field hands .
But when it comes to the macro-economic policy , forbearance is the quality that pays .
Any initiative on the feds ’ part inevitably makes things worse .
The Bubble Era , like the Great Depression , was largely –but not completely – the result of government initiative .
Artificially low interest rates – intended to counter the modest downturn of 2001 – sent the wrong message .
Consumers – notably those in Britain and America – bought things they could n’t afford .
Producers – notably those in Asia – made things for which there was no real market .
Debt piled up .
Mountains of it .
As consumers bought more and producers made more the economy grew .
But much of the economic “ growth ” of the 2001 - 2007 period was fraudulent .
It was based on debt spending , not on genuine increases in purchasing power .
Debt pretends to be real money .
It looks like the real thing , but it is not .
It stimulates the economy like counterfeit money .
It causes production and consumption , but of the wrong sort .
Former Reagan era Office of Management and Budget director David Stockman estimates the level of “ counterfeit GDP ” at $ 4 trillion in the US alone .
The fraud was discovered , though misunderstood , when sub - prime debt began to implode .
The economy had been kissed hard ; millions of houses had been built , bought and sold .
Now , owners could n’t pay for them .
All of sudden , the counterfeit money began to shrivel up .
Lenders , investors , and householders all began to de-leverage ; paying down the debts as fast as they could , defaulting on those they could n’t .
Rather than come to the obvious conclusion , that they should never have meddled with the economy in the first place , the feds began rescue operations on a breathtaking scale .
The British government increased spending to 140 % of revenues .
America now runs a stimulus program nearly equivalent , in economic impact , to WWII .
Not since 1945 have the two pages of its ledgers – debits and credits – told such different stories , with almost $ 2 of spending for ever $ 1 in tax receipts .
Britain will add almost 50 % to its government debt in the next three years .
David Stockman expects the publicly held US national debt to almost double in the next five years .
Even at those levels , many economists think the government should do more .
Nobel Prize winner , Paul Krugman is one .
Richard Koo is another .
They ’ve warned that the US ( and by extension much of the rest of the world ) could suffer a Lost Decade , like Japan , if the government slacks off before consumers have finished de-leveraging .
At least they understand what is going on .
Too bad they missed the point of it .
The problem is too much debt , not too little spending .
Leveraging up the public sector does n’t help .
Even government debts must be paid – if not by the borrower , then by the lender .
The feds are smooching more ardently than any debt lover in history ; next , we get to see who dies…or at least who defaults .
Until next time ,

About 150 protesters peacefully left the main administration building at UC Davis shortly after 11 p.m. Tuesday after protest leaders and university officials reached an agreement .
There were no arrests .
Beginning at about 8 a.m. , a handful of demonstrators quietly sat and studied in the lobby of Mrak .
By about 3 p.m. , their number had grown to about 200 .
In a half - page written statement released late Tuesday night by university officials , the demonstrators agreed to immediately leave Mrak without incident and to respect the hours of operation of university facilities .
In turn , Janet Gong of Student Affairs made five written commitments to the demonstrators , most of which were related to the arrests last week of 52 who were protesting recent student fee hikes and declined to leave Mrak after numerous requests by campus officials .
The five commitments are :
1 . The University agrees to review the arrest of the young woman ( " B.H. " ) immediately , irrespective of whether a formal complaint is filed with the Campus Police .
The University also acknowledges that it maintains a formal complaint process and will also respond to any complaints that may be submitted .
2 . The University has the right and responsibility to speak with District Attorney 's office in this situation and will do so not later than Wednesday , November 25 .
The University agrees to take an affirmative position of advocacy with the District Attorney and to ask him to strongly consider his option of not filing charges .
3 . Given the cooperative nature of the Thursday , November 19 event and in the spirit of continuing dialogue , the University will not pursue student disciplinary actions .
4 . The University agrees to engage in further discussions regarding Cooperative Housing on the campus in a mutual desire to promote sustainable , affordable cooperative living facilities and opportunities on the campus , including any potential use of existing facilities for non-housing purposes .
5 . The University agrees to enter into further discussions on all other demands with a representative group , as early as Monday , November 30 .
Chancellor Linda Katehi is scheduled to meet with students to discuss a variety of their concerns from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday , Nov. 30 , in the ARC ballroom .

Kevin Carson Interview
Kevin Carson , an American political theorist and a contemporary leader in discussions concerning mutualism and author of three extremely important books on co-operation , mutualism and capitalism ( Studies in Mutualist Political Economy , Organization Theory : A Libertarian Perspective , and The Iron Fist Behind the Invisible Hand ) .
Describing his politics as being " the outer fringes of both free market libertarianism and socialism " , he certainly will find a welcoming audience among our group - which is why he 's been asked several difficult questions .
The Iron Fist Behind the Invisible Hand is available in html format and Studies in Mutualist Political Economy and Organization Theory : A Libertarian Perspective are both available as PDF files .
Firstly , thank you Kevin for agreeing to this interview with The Isocracy Network .
Thanks for inviting me .
Could you begin by giving a description of mutualism from the initial definition offered by the anarchist Proudhon to contemporary examples and your own involvement in this sort of analysis of political economy ?
Well , first of all , it 's important to distinguish between mutualism as a general form of praxis , and mutualism as a theory .
Mutualist practices ( friendly societies and lodges , guilds , arrangements for mutual aid , etc. ) are probably old as the human race .
Proudhon , Owen , Warren , et al simply created a theoretical framework that emphasized such forms of organization as a building block of society .
It 's a bit like the centipede trying to figure out how it 's been walking all this time , or the man who was astonished to learn he'd been speaking in prose all along and did n't even know it .
For that matter , there have been important anarchist thinkers like Kropotkin who emphasized mutual aid and other mutual organizations , without in any strict sense being mutualists .
Cooperatives and mutuals have been central to the counterinstitution - building of much of the decentralist Left in the U.S. since the 1960s , but their thought is not explicitly mutualist either .
In fact , I 'd go so far as to say that most of the important examples of mutualist practice ( the cooperative movement , the local currency and alternative credit movements , etc. ) are not explicitly or self - consciously mutualist in ideology .
Having read Proudhon for some years , his thought is so complex and at times even seemingly self - contradictory , that I still hesitate to summarize it .
But I 'd venture to say , as an approximation , that his programme centered on 1 ) abolishing artificial property rights in land and artificial scarcity of credit , so that the working class could secure cheap access to the prerequisites of production ; and 2 ) organizing the economy around associations of producers .
Of course Proudhon was an important founding thinker for anarchism as a whole as well as for mutualism ; so these ideas , in modified form , have heavily influenced later collectivist , communist and syndicalist variants of anarchism .
Mutualist praxis was central to the Owenite movement in the UK ( e.g. Owenite craft unions organized cooperative production and distribution by strikers in their own shops ) , as well as such things as the Rochedale cooperatives , the Chartists , and land colonization movements .
Owenism , by way of Christian socialism and guild socialism , probably had a significant ( if indirect ) influence on distributism .
In the U.S. mutualism 's primary founder was the Owenite Josiah Warren .
Warrenism , cross- pollinated with J.K. Ingalls ' occupancy - and - use view of land ownership and William Greene 's mutual banking theories , together led to the plumbline individualism of Benjamin Tucker .
Tucker focused almost entirely on the abolition of artificial property rights and privilege in land and credit , assuming that when the legal props to rent and interest were removed and cheap land and credit were universally available , the forms of organization would take care of themselves .
He displayed almost no interest whatever in cooperatives , associations for mutual aid , etc. , as such .
Dyer Lum , John Beverley Robinson , and Clarence Swartz , all heavily influenced by Tucker , supplemented his focus on eliminating monopolies with some positive speculation on cooperative forms of organization ; in so doing , they represented a partial fusion of Tucker 's version of individualism with the older cooperativist tradition of Proudhon and Owen .
Lum , in particular , was also friendly to the radical labor movement and had fairly close ties to the I .
W.W .
Would a highly successful large worker 's cooperatives , like the John Lewis Partnership in the UK , and the Mondragón Corporation in Spain [ centered in Basque Country ] serve as evidence that mutualist economics can and does work in the large scale ?
Are credit unions evidence that mutualist economics can replace capitalist banking ?
Although I 'm quite friendly to both Mondragon and credit unions , and consider their influence to be decidedly positive , I believe their form is still distorted considerably by the capitalist milieu within which they exist .
I like Mondragon 's federated system of cooperative producers , distributors and banks within a single umbrella organization .
But it 's much too centralized a system in my opinion , with worker representation only effected at the level of the board of directors for the system as a whole ; below the level of the Mondragon system as a whole , it 's a fairly top - down system of conventional management , with no significant self - management at the level of individual departments or factories .
I would greatly prefer local markets with lots of stand - alone cooperative manufacturing shops on the Emilia - Romagna model , integrated with cooperative banks in some sort of barter or local currency network of the sort promoted by Tom Greco .
Most credit unions , unfortunately , have adopted the culture of the conventional banking industry , and have almost no ideological affinity for the larger cooperative or counter - economy movement .
Of course they are still greatly preferable to capitalist banks ; being controlled by many small , local depositors , they are far less prone to the excesses of the capitalist banking system that we 've seen in recent years .
Proudhon , although arguing that he opposed the idea of individuals deriving an income through rent and investments , said that he never wished " to forbid or suppress , by sovereign decree " such activities .
A contemporary mainstream economist may argue that Proudhon 's position here would be particularly utopian in those markets that have high barriers to entry or other monopolistic features , that a worker 's cooperative versus an entrenched capitalist enterprise in such a market would require a miracle on the scale of David vs Goliath for success .
That sounds a bit like Tucker 's pessimistic view of things in his later years , when he seemed resigned to the idea that the large industrial trusts had grown to the point that their market power would persist even after the Four Monopolies were removed .
I think such a view neglects the extent to which capital - intensiveness is a source of high overhead cost and inefficiency , and is only made artificially profitable by the state 's subsidies and protections .
In fact production as such has become far less capital - intensive over the past three decades , with the old mass - production core outsourcing increasing shares of total production to flexible manufacturing networks and job - shops , and some of them retaining little more than control over marketing and " intellectual property . "
The development of cheap , small - scale CNC tools in the 1970s meant that the capital outlays required for manufacturing imploded by one or two orders of magnitude .
That was the beginning of a long shift from older mass - production industry to Emilia - Romagna , the Toyota supplier network , the job - shops of Shenzhen and Shanghai , etc .
The process continues even further in the same direction with the desktop manufacturing revolution of recent years : cheap , homebrew CNC machines scalable to the small shop and garage .
When physical capital costs are so low , most of the financial role of the old industrial core is becoming redundant .
And with small - scale production driven by local orders on a lean , demand - pull , JIT basis , marketing is similarly redundant .
" Intellectual property " is the main surviving buttress to the old corporate walls , and it 's becoming increasingly unenforceable .
A follower of Henry George would argue in the realm of natural resources it would be impossible for success and that land - rents should be socialised .
How would you respond to these claims ?
I 'm quite friendly to George , and think the lines between individualism and Georgism are a lot less harsh than ( say ) Tucker would have believed .
But I believe a great deal of rent could be eliminated simply by removing subsidies to economic centralization and positive externalties created by taxpayers -- not to mention by removing state enforcement of title to vacant and unimproved land .
If as much urban infrastructure as possible were funded by user fees , and cities broken up into lots of mixed - use neighborhoods in which residential areas had their own miniature " downtown " cores , differential rent would be far less significant .
I think a majority of George 's aims could be achieved by Tucker 's means , or even by a throughgoing application of Rothbard 's means .
With examples of worker 's self - management in the former Yugoslavia , and modelling by economists such as Jaroslav Vanek and Benjamin Ward , it has been shown in some cases ( especially in critical infrastructure ) it is advantageous for labor - managed firms , in their objective of increasing income per worker , to either lay - off workers or - like a monopolistic capitalist firm - to reduce productivity and thus derive monopoly profits .
How would a contemporary version of mutualism prevent these problems ?
It 's been a long time since I read Vanek 's work on worker - managed economies , but my immediate reaction is that there 's probably no fool - proof set of governance rules .
When the firm is controlled by capital - owners , they 'll behave in such a way as to maximize returns on capital ; when it 's controlled by managers , as in most large Western corporations , they 'll maximize benefits to management at the expense of both labor and capital .
At least in a worker - managed firm , the decisions will reflect the interests of a bare majority , which can't be said of the other two mechanisms .
Beyond that , I think the answer to the kind of behavior you describe lies in exit as much as in voice : the lower the capitalization requirements and the lower the barrier to entry for most forms of production , and the lower the cost threshold for comfortable subsistence , the less catastrophic changes in employment will be .
I 'd like to see an economy where a much larger share of total consumption needs are met through production for subsistence or barter in the household / informal sector , and the average time spent in wage employment is much less than at present .
That would mean a significantly larger share of the population would be self - employed than at present , a very large share would work hours that we would regard as " part - time , " household arrangements for pooling wages and hoarding labor - time would be much more resilient , and even wage - earners would tend to accept as normal prolonged periods of unemployment during which they lived off subsistence resources while waiting for a job to their liking .
Pro-capitalist neoliberals , such as George Reismann , Roderick T. Long have criticised your advocacy of mutualism .
Reisman and Long both argue that you do not support John Locke 's ownership of landed property that has been mixed with labour or , to use the peculiarly U.S. vernacular , " homesteading " .
It seems that both this critics have fundamentally misunderstood Locke 's concept of land ownership , which recognises a public cost for exclusion and use in addition to the right of added value .
How do you respond to these criticisms ?
To be frank , I can't say with any degree of confidence what Reisman understands about anything .
But I think Long acknowledged Locke's Proviso and explicitly characterized his own position as " non-Proviso Lockeanism . "
I 'm not a Georgist myself , although I 'd be well - disposed to a local property rules system based on some form of common ownership and community collection of rent .
In any case , justifiably or not , when answering Lockean critics I tend to tacitly work from the premise that " Lockean " means " non-Proviso Lockean . "
And for the most part , I think a radical and consistent application of non-Proviso Lockean rules would go most of the way toward achieving the aims of the Tucker - Ingalls land theory .
... all the fruits it naturally produces , and beasts it feeds , belong to mankind in common , as they are produced by the spontaneous band of nature : ...
Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided , and left it in , he hath mixed his labour with , and joined to it something that is his own , and thereby makes it his property ...
For this labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer , no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to , at least where there is enough , and as good left in common for others .
John Locke : Of Civil Government - Second Treatise
For that matter , over time I 've come to see the bounderies between the Tucker - Ingalls and non-Proviso Lockean systems as less distinct , and to perceive some practical problems with the Tucker system ( at least the more radical variant - - he seems to promote different versions of the system at different times ) .
At times Tucker himself seemed to concede the existence of house - rent , but to argue that the nullification of titles to vacant land would ( through market competition ) cause the land - rent component of rent to disappear and overall rent to fall to the value of rent on buildings .
Now , to me , that seems to imply that Tucker was n't necessarily ( at least at times ) dead - set against absentee ownership in principle .
That variant of his land theory , at least , seems to imply that the important thing was to eliminate large - scale absentee title to vacant and unimproved land .
In any case , I tend to think that doing so would go a long way to eliminating landlord rent through market competition .
Another critic , Walter Block argues that you are actually some sort of Marxist because you use the labour theory of value for deriving a theory of exploitation .
It would seem that ( a ) Block is unaware that Adam Smith and David Ricardo also used the labour theory of value and ( b ) using it to calculate a rate of exploitation is hardly the same as using it as an anchor to exchange values .
I think the Austrians also , for the most part , exaggerate the extent to which marginalism / subjectivism is a radical departure from classical labor and cost theories .
It 's closer to the truth to say that marginalism provides a mechanism for explaining the tendency that Ricardo et al described .
The marginalist / subjectivist claim that " utility determines value " is true in a technical sense , if you add the qualification " at any point in time given the snapshot of supply and demand in the spot market . "
But it 's not true in the ordinary way we use those words .
If you allow changes in supply over time to enter the picture , then supply alters until the utility of the marginal unit reflects the cost of producing it -- i.e. , exactly what Ricardo said .
It makes far more sense to treat marginalism as a complement or fulfillment to classical political economy , rather than as supplanting it .
Politically , where do you think mutualists should align themselves .
Should they spend their efforts in building cooperative organisations , like Proudhon 's advocacy of dual power ?
Or is there some mileage to be made in being involved in existing political organisations , such as the Labour Party - Cooperative Party groups in the U.K.?
What about in the United States ; is the Libertarian Party salvageable ?
I think by far the most important , and the most interest , of our tasks is actually building the kind of society we want , and doing so so far as possible without regard to the state .
But there 's something to be said for putting external pressure on the state , and participating in political coalitions to remove as much state interference with our activities as possible .
Of course the primary emphasis of such coalition - building should be forming pressure groups , rather than attempting to become part of a governing coalition .
A lot of this parallels Daniel DeLeon 's disputes with the anarchists in the I.
W.W. DeLeon argued that " building the structure of the new society in the shell of the old " ( i.e. building industrial unions to serve as organs of self - management ) would not be enough by itself .
So long as the capitalists controlled the state and its armed force , and the significant minority of people whose class interest was tied up with it , there was the danger of the " Iron Heel " being brought to bear against counter - organizations .
On the other hand , political victory alone was n't sufficient ; he gave the example of threats by Jay Gould to organize a national capital strike and lockout if the socialists ever captured the national government .
Workers , DeLeon argued , should be focused on building counter - institutions , but also be prepared to seize the commanding heights of the state long enough to dismantle them and prevent them from being used against themselves .
What we need is a primary focus on institution building , without entirely neglecting the need for a political movement to run interference for the counter - institutions .
What 's more , there 's the very real danger an authoritarian state might make a concerted effort to stamp out the counter - economy through ( for example ) the kinds of totalitarian surveillance Richard Stallman described in " The Right to Read , " intensified licensing and zoning to suppress low - capital producers , etc .
It 's a waste of effort and probably corrupting to seriously run our people for Congress or the White House .
But it 's perfectly sensible to carry out propaganda against legislation like the DMCA , to support lobbying campaigns organized by groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and NORML , etc .
Proudhon argued that through a society of contracts between individuals , a federal structure could arise .
This of course must presume that individuals have the capacity to engage in uncoerced contractual arrangements .
What other political requirements do you think have a particular priority in breaking down authoritarian elements in statist rule ?
Well , it could be that the authoritarian elements of statist rule will persist on paper right up to the point at which they become irrelevant .
But in my opinion it's at least worth a shot to pressure the state from outside , and form ad hoc alliances to pressure the state , in order to minimize its interference and fend off attempts at intensified interference .
That includes local efforts against licensing and zoning that impede household microenterprise and micromanufacturing , local pressure to defend peaceful squatters and vagrants , pressure against the regulatory suppression of self - organized mutual - aid efforts , pressure at the national level against further expanding " intellectual property " law , and so forth .
Kevin , thank you for your time and views
The following excerpt is from the blog " Surviving In Argentina , " by Fernando Ferfal Aguirre .
Ferfal lived through Argentina 's economic implosion in 2001 .
Here , he shares some of his secrets to survival .
So , guys , things do n’t look good .
It pains me to see America going through this and the consequences it will bring .
These are critical days .
Now is when we ’ll get a better picture of how bad things will actually get , how long until we see the economy back on its feet .
Instead of trying to guess what will happen , let 's go through some things you should to right now , if you have n’t taken care of them already .
First , how about what NOT to do ?
* Do n’t open your big mouth !
It ’s ok that you feel all nice and warm about the 1/5 / whatever year food supply you already have , but there ’s no need to talk about it with the guys at work , the neighbors , friends or even family that is not directly related .
Other than my wife and kids , these are things that we simply do not talk about with people that know us , know our faces , names and know where we life .
Next thing you know someone ’s knocking on your door , asking for favors you simply can’t afford .
Not long ago a friend asked if I could lend him a gun for self defense … yes , right .
Here , the owner of the gun is responsible for it and is not allowed to lend it to other non licensed persons .
Other than my brother , I ’m not giving a gun away to just anyone .
* Do n’t waste your money !
How many times have we read about paper money only being good for TP after a crisis ?
Though it may have happened in some extremely primitive nations , or countries destroyed by war , do not expect that to happen in USA .
It wo n't .
Rather the other way around , you ’ll consider it a precious commodity even more .
As prices go up , you ’ll save every penny .
If you already have savings you want to protect , buy precious metals , or if you have enough money , buy real estate .
It ’s a buyer ’s market right now .
A small apartment would be a good investment .
Give it a few months , you ’ll see rent prices go up in no time .
People ca n’t get loans to buy or they do n’t have the money , so people start renting more .
More demand , prices go up .
* Do n’t run for the hills
This is n’t a hurricane or flood , you ca n’t run from this .
Running to your bug - out location and “ living off the land ” is a terrible idea , almost as stupid as thinking about quitting your day job to start growing corn .
If you are a farmer and that ’s what you do for a living , that ’s just perfect .
But if you are doing it as part of preparedness for the end of the world , you need to think things a bit better .
For a farm to be a profitable , you need a margin of production large enough to make it economically sustainable .
Farming as a way of producing your own food is a terrible mistake .
Spending an entire day to produce the food equivalent of what you can buy with 15 minutes of your current salary is n’t smart .
Yes , inflation , I know about it , as a matter of fact I know about it very well , but the solution is n’t growing your own food , building your own car , building your own house , digging your own petrol site or fixing your teeth yourself . :)
The solution is making more money and reducing expenses as much as possible .
Money ( in one form or another ) makes the world go around and it ’s been this way for more than 10.000 years , wont change any time soon .
No more toys , guys , at least for a while .
Ok , now for things to do ...

New Orleans Saints receiver Michael Thomas returns to practice on limited basis
After missing the past two games due to a high ankle sprain suffered in the season opener , New Orleans Saints receiver Michael Thomas returned to practice on a limited basis Wednesday .
The HMAC construction turns a cryptographic hash algorithm into a keyed hash .
It is commonly used for integrity protection when the sender and recipient share a secret key .
It was developed to address various problems with arbitrary keyed hash constructions .
So why are developers still rolling their own ?
One of the original papers on keyed hash constructions describes the motivations for developing a standard for HMAC .
In 1995 , there was no standardization and cryptographers only worked from hunches as to what constituted a secure keyed hash .
This paper summarized two known attacks on some common schemes that had evolved in the absence of a standard .
The first construction the paper attacks is H(k || m ) , aka “ secret prefix ” .
The key and the message to be authenticated were concatenated and hashed .
The authenticator was the resulting hash .
This was fatally flawed , as I mentioned in my previous talks on web crypto .
Standard hash algorithms that use the Merkle - Damgard construction ( like SHA - 1 ) are subject to a length - extension attack .
An attacker can trivially create an authenticator for m’ where m’ = m 1 || pad || m2 if they have seen the authenticator for m1 .
( The “ pad ” value makes the input a multiple of the compression function block size and includes the total length hashed ) .
This flaw was most recently found in the Flickr API .
The second construction was H( m || k ) , aka “ secret suffix ” .
While the length - extension attack no longer applies because k is unknown to the attacker , this still maximally exposes you to weaknesses in the hash algorithm .
Preneel et al described two attacks on this approach .
The first attack is that secret suffix is weaker against offline second - preimage attacks .
That is , an attacker can take an authenticator for a known plaintext m and calculate their own plaintext m’ that hashes to the same value as the block just before k .
If the input to the hash function just before k is identical , then the output is also the same .
This means the attacker can just send m’ and the previously seen authenticator for m and the two will match .
For a secure cryptographic hash function , a second - preimage attack takes 2n tries where n is the hash size in bits [ 1 ] .
However , the secret suffix approach is marginally weaker to this kind of attack .
If an attacker has seen t text and authenticator pairs , then the effort is only 2n / t since they can attempt a second - preimage match against any of the authenticators they have seen .
This is usually not a problem since second - preimage attacks are usually much harder than finding collisions .
As they have aged , all widely - used hash algorithms have fallen to collisions before second - preimage attacks .
The other attack is much more powerful .
If the attacker can submit a chosen message to be authenticated , she can attempt an offline collision search .
In this case , an attacker searches for two messages , m and m’ , that hash to the same value .
Once they are found , she requests an authenticator for the innocuous message m .
Since a collision means the intermediate hash state before k is mixed in is identical ( an “ internal collision ” ) , the final authenticator for both will be identical .
The attacker then sends the evil message m’ with the authenticator for m , the two match , and the message is accepted as authentic .
This means the secret suffix construction is insecure if collisions can be found in the underlying hash function .
Due to the birthday paradox , this takes 2n / 2 work even for a secure hash function ( e.g. , 264 operations for a 128 - bit hash ) .
But it gets worse if the hash is weaker to collisions .
MD5 has multiple demonstrated collisions .
Many systems continue to use HMAC - MD5 because a collision alone is not enough to compromise it .
Because of the way the key is applied in HMAC , an attacker would have to generate an internal collision with the secret key , which is much harder than colliding with a chosen message [ 2 ] .
Although this may provide some immediate comfort , it is still important to move to HMAC - SHA256 soon if you are using HMAC - MD5 .
In contrast , MD5 with secret suffix is completely compromised due to collisions , especially with the recent advance in chosen - prefix collisions .
Currently , this takes about 30 seconds on a laptop .
To repeat , under no circumstances should you use an arbitrary hash construction instead of HMAC , and MD5 with secret suffix is completely broken .
If you were putting off moving away from MD5 ( m || k ) , now would be an excellent time to move to HMAC - SHA256 .

This is not true for longer messages .
Multicollisions can be used against each block of a longer message .

This is a very broad statement about HMAC .
A more detailed analysis of its security will have to wait for another post .
( CNN ) -- Uga VII , the University of Georgia mascot whose deeply furrowed face was a fixture at the school for more than a year , died early Thursday , the university said .
He was 4 years old .
The purebred English bulldog died of heart - related causes in Savannah , Georgia , according to its owner , Frank " Sonny " Seiler .
Fans knew Uga VII had arrived when the white dog , sporting a spiked collar and red Georgia University jersey , made his short strides along the football field 's sidelines .
He made his first appearance at the August 30 , 2008 , season opener , when Georgia faced off against Georgia Southern , the university said .
He was nearing the end of his second season with the team , the university said .
He was preceded by his father , Uga VI , the university 's winningest mascot , who died of congestive heart failure .
" This is a very sad day for the Seiler family but also for all Georgia people , " said Damon Evans , University of Georgia director of athletics in a university news release .
" Just as his ancestors , he had captured the hearts of college football fans everywhere as the country 's No. 1 mascot .
He had been truly embraced by all those who follow the Georgia Bulldogs across the country .
We will miss him dearly . "
Uga VII 's given name was Loran 's Best , the university said .
His death was unexpected .
" We are all in a state of shock , " Seiler said in the release .
" We had no warning whatsoever . "
A wreath will be placed on Uga VII 's doghouse on the sideline , the university said .
There wo n't be a live mascot to take his place at Saturday 's game against Kentucky .
Officials have not decided who will replace the white bulldog , but the decision is expected next year , Seiler said .
Until then , fans and Seiler will mourn the loss of the school 's favorite pooch .
" He was 10 - 3 last year , which is not bad for a freshman , " Seiler said .
" Uga VII was not as active or mischievous as his father but more distinguished .
He realized his role when he put his shirt on .
He was well - behaved and always appreciated the significance of his role . "
Type Ia supernovae are a mystery because no one can predict when or where one might occur .
But astronomers are hedging their bets on V445 Puppis .
A so - called “ vampire white dwarf ” that underwent a nova outburst after gulping down part of its companion ’s matter in 2000 , now , it appears this double star system is a prime candidate for exploding .
“ Whether V445 Puppis will eventually explode as a supernova , or if the current nova outburst has pre-empted that pathway by ejecting too much matter back into space is still unclear , ” said Patrick Woudt , from the University of Cape Town and lead author of the paper reporting the results .
“ But we have here a pretty good suspect for a future Type Ia supernova ! ”
This is the first , and so far only nova showing no evidence at all for hydrogen , and provides the first evidence for an outburst on the surface of a white dwarf dominated by helium .
“ This is critical , as we know that Type Ia supernovae lack hydrogen , ” said Danny Steeghs , from the University of Warwick , UK , “ and the companion star in V445 Pup fits this nicely by also lacking hydrogen , instead dumping mainly helium gas onto the white dwarf . ”
Click here to watch a movie of the expanding shell of V445 Puppis .
The astronomers have determined the system is about 25,000 light - years from the Sun , and it has an intrinsic brightness of over 10,000 times our Sun .
This implies that the vampire white dwarf in this system has a high mass that is near its fatal limit and is still simultaneously being fed by its companion at a high rate .
“ One of the major problems in modern astrophysics is the fact that we still do not know exactly what kinds of stellar system explode as a Type Ia supernova , ” said Woudt , “ As these supernovae play a crucial role in showing that the Universe ’s expansion is currently accelerating , pushed by a mysterious dark energy , it is rather embarrassing . ”
Woudt and his team used the ESO ’s Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) to obtain very sharp images of V445 Puppis over a time span of two years .
The images show a bipolar shell , initially with a very narrow waist , with lobes on each side .
Two knots are also seen at both the extreme ends of the shell , which appear to move at about 30 million kilometers per hour .
The shell — unlike any previously observed for a nova — is itself moving at about 24 million kilometers per hour .
A thick disc of dust , which must have been produced during the last outburst , obscures the two central stars .
As Steeghs said , one defining characteristic of Type Ia supernovae is the lack of hydrogen in their spectrum .
Yet hydrogen is the most common chemical element in the Universe .
Such supernovae most likely arise in systems composed of two stars , one of them being the end product of the life of sun - like stars , or white dwarfs .
When such white dwarfs , acting as stellar vampires that suck matter from their companion , become heavier than a given limit , they become unstable and explode .
The build - up is not a simple process .
As the white dwarf cannibalizes its prey , matter accumulates on its surface .
If this layer becomes too dense , it becomes unstable and erupts as a nova .
These controlled , mini-explosions eject part of the accumulated matter back into space .
The crucial question is thus to know whether the white dwarf can manage to gain weight despite the outburst , that is , if some of the matter taken from the companion stays on the white dwarf , so that it will eventually become heavy enough to explode as a supernova .
Read the team ’s paper .

The company responsible for an oil spill in the Timor Sea off the West Australian coast says it has stopped oil leaking from the well .
The West Atlas drilling rig has spewed hundreds of thousands of litres of oil into the Timor Sea since late August .
The rig 's operator , PTTEP Australasia intercepted the leaking well on Sunday morning , but the platform caught fire , hampering further efforts to cap the leak .
The company says tens of thousands of litres of heavy mud was used in the fourth and successful attempt to stop the leak but the well is yet to be plugged and permanently secured .
PTTEP says the main fire on the platform has been extinguished but other , minor fires are still burning .
Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett says the oil leak and fire has raised serious questions about the safety of a plan to pipe gas from the Browse Basin to Darwin .
The Japanese company Inpex had intially planned to bring the gas from the Icthys field to an LNG plant in the Kimberley , but negotiations failed with the previous Labor government .
It now plans to pipe the gas more than 800 kilometres to Darwin .
Mr Barnett says he is concerned about the risks involved .
" Well I think you 've again got to look at the issue of a pipeline 800 kilometres in length at deep water through geologically unstable part of the world and think is that the safest and best way to process that gas ? , " he said .
" I would say at face value no , you would bring it onshore at the closest land site . "
Yes , we have a relatively high median income , but our standard of living as measured by the Human Development Index of the United Nations ranks us only 15th in the world , behind , among others , Norway , France , Canada , and Australia .
Are they better than we are ?
Even our home ownership rate trails that of the citizens of Canada , Belgium , Spain , Norway , and even Portugal .
Consider what it means .
By what standard is one nation any greater than any other nation ?
Yes , the United States has vast material resources - we rank eighth in gross domestic product per capita - but we also have , according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , the “ highest inequality and poverty rate ’ ’ in the world , outside of Mexico and Turkey , and things are getting worse .
Nothing to boast of there .
There is nothing wrong with self - satisfaction or national pride .
But the incessant trumpeting of our national superiority to every other country in the world is more than just off - putting and insulting .
It is infantile , like the vaunting of a schoolyard bully that his Dad is better than your Dad .
It is wrong .
And it might be dangerous both to ourselves and to the rest of the world .
Think of World War II , America ’s entrance into which was strenuously resisted by the populace until Franklin Roosevelt carefully laid the groundwork and Pearl Harbor made it inevitable .
Think of civil rights , which Lyndon Johnson pressed despite widescale opposition , and not just in the South .
Even then it took more than 100 years .
Or think of the current health care debate in which Americans seem to desire some sort of reform , just not a reform that would significantly help people in dire need , while the Obama administration is pushing to provide that assistance .
In the end , government has inspired Americans far more than Americans have inspired their government .
They are too busy boasting .
Carter was speaking when Watergate was fresh , and government had been disgraced , but still .
The fact of the matter is that whenever anything really significant has been accomplished by our government , it is precisely because it was better than the American people .
THE HOARIEST and most oft - repeated cliche in American politics may be that America is the greatest country in the world .
Every politician , Democrat and Republican , seems duty bound to pander to this idea of American exceptionalism , and woe unto him who hints otherwise .
This country is “ the last , best hope of mankind , ’’ or the “ shining city on the hill , ’’ or the “ great social experiment . ’’
As if this were n’t enough , Jimmy Carter upped the fawning ante 30 years ago by uttering arguably the most damning words in modern American politics .
He called for a “ government as good as the American people , ’’ thus taking national greatness and investing it in each and every one of us .
Yes , the United States has the best system of higher education in the world , but , according to an Educational Policy Institute report , we rank 13th in the affordability of that education , and we are much less successful with lower education - 11th in the percentage of the 25 to 34 population with a high school diploma and 22d in science education .
And though Americans love to crow about the “ best health care ’ ’ in the world , the fact is that according to the World Health Organization Index , we actually rank 37th in the quality of our health care .
And we are still the only industrialized country in the world without a national health care system .
Even when one considers anecdotal evidence - “ If this is n’t the greatest country then why do so many people want to come here ? ’’ - the case is n’t particularly persuasive .
Mexicans cross the border to the United States for economic opportunity .
Turks go to Germany , Indians and Pakistanis to Great Britain , Arabs to France .
This is n’t a sign of our special greatness , just a sign that desperate people seek a more powerful economy for their betterment .
The point of all this is n’t that America does n’t have a lot to be proud of .
It does .
The point is that just about every country has a lot to be proud of , and America has no more right to assume it is the greatest nation in the world than does France , Switzerland , China , or Russia .
None of this would make much difference if the self - congratulation was just harmless bragging .
But there are consequences .
A country that believes it is the greatest in the world is also less likely to be constrained by that world .
One could argue that the Iraq war was a direct result of a sense of national infallibility .
So was our willingness to torture , our reluctance to admit our mistakes in Afghanistan , our culpability in the global recession , and our foot - dragging on global warming .
Such a nation is also less likely to introspect or to strive for true greatness because it believes its greatness has already arrived .
There is something bizarre about a country whose leaders have constantly to toady to their constituents and in which any criticism is tantamount to a lack of patriotism , but that describes America today .
Every politician feels compelled to ape Jimmy Carter ’s old words to the point where our alleged greatness has also become our national mantra .
It seems eons ago when Bobby Kennedy , a politician who did n’t like to stroke even his own supporters , actually scolded a rally for booing Lyndon Johnson because , Kennedy said , Johnson could n’t have done what he did in Vietnam if he did n’t have the American people , including Kennedy ’s audience , as his facilitators .
We are n’t going to hear that sort of honesty from political leaders any more because the American people are too thin - skinned and arrogant to tolerate it .
Arrogance in an individual is unbecoming .
It is no more becoming for a nation .
The Greeks understood that the gods punished mortals for their hubris - for feeling that they were godlike .
They knew that overweening pride preceded a fall .
One suspects that nations are no more immune to punishment than individuals .
A nation that brooks no criticism , a nation that feels it is always better than any other , a nation that has to be endlessly flattered and wo n’t face the truth , a nation whose people think they possess some special moral exemption and wisdom , a nation without humility is a nation spoiling for calamity .
We ’ve been living in a fool ’s paradise .
The result may be a government that is as good as the American people , which is something that should concern everyone .

Update : Check out the Levitation Wiki .
The last three days I have worked like crazy on a new project , and I ’m happy to release its first usable version to the public now .
The software is called Levitation and its purpose is to convert a MediaWiki database XML dump into a Git repository — including the complete history .
Why would I want to do that ?
Because of two reasons .
First ,
Git simply rocks , and I wanted to see whether it can be done .
Second , and more important :
There is currently a nerd uprising against the German Wikipedia and the exclusionist attitude that ’s prevalent there .
Quite a lot of people are talking about the possibility of forking .
People like me .
People from the CCC .
That is , people who actually have the knowledge and resources to do it .
Since maintaining a fork using the current MediaWiki software is pretty hard to do , this is an experiment whether a distributed approach would be better .
A system like Git makes it trivial to merge changes made in other forks into your own one ( and vice versa ) .
For example , it would be no problem for a single person to maintain a fork of the whole Wikipedia and keep it up - to - date , while having additional articles that would probably get deleted in the “ upstream ” Wikipedia .
If this system succeeds , we might be seeing not one , but 5 to 20 different “ flavors ” of Wikipedia soon , each with its own focus .
Not every flavor will be useful to more than a handful of people , but the best ones will succeed .
And if one starts to misbehave , the others can easily take its place .
Who knows , maybe there will even be some kind of WikiHub where people can maintain their own modifiactions to the mainstream Wikipedia , without requiring the massive amounts of servers the current , centralistic Wikipedia has .
Donnie McClurkin — guest of President Obama and speaker for Exodus International — condemns sexual honesty and sissifies LGBT Americans in three recent YouTube videos .
Blogger Rod McCullom reports :
In the first of three disgusting YouTube videos , McClurkin begins his rant against Tonex , the gospel star and minister who recently confirmed his long - rumored sexuality .
McClurkin says Tonex is a “ perversion ” and must pray away the gay : “ God did not call young people to such peversion .
Society has failed him , his church has failed him … I would be homosexual to this day if Jesus had n’t delivered . ”
McClurkin also rails against against openly gay youth as “ broken and feminine ” : “ I see feminine men , feminine boys , everywhere I go … No , do n’t applaud ‘ cuz it ai n’t funny .
It ’s because we failed .
I see them everywhere . ”
McClurkin spoke at a conference for the Church of God in Christ .
McCullom points out that the church is notorious for attracting closeted gay black men .
“ The rabidly anti-gay Church of God in Christ is well - known for attracting many closeted black gay men .
COGIC is also embroiled in numerous lawsuits , criminal investigations and internal church investigations around clergy sexual abuse . ”
Watch McClurkin preach anger , despair , stubborn prejudice , and hate :

We pull our information mainly from court documents and other neutral sources and lay out the information for you to come to your own conclusions .
Honestly , there is so much false and biased propaganda on the internet that we sometimes have a hard time separating out all unverifiable falsehoods .
If you see something like that , speak up please !
We promise that the information you find here is less hysterical and less one - sided than on the big paid anti-scientology information sites and we are trying hard to get better and better ...
Scientology Myths.info wants to find answers to the questions that are being asked all over the internet about Scientology , Scientologists , the Church of Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard .
Information about Dianetics and the leader of Scientology , David Miscavige , are sub -topics and touched at times .
Our goal is to find answers from independent sources , not only from Church of Scientology owned sites or anti-Scientology sites .
If you miss information , please contact us .
Personally , I did n't know about his past .
Ron Miscavige 's recent confessions about him beating up his wife for 10 years before joining the Church or hanging out with a rapist after leaving the Church .
All news to me .
So it 's up to you to make up your mind .
RonMiscavigeBook.com gives a load of data .
Start there .
I 'll update this article as the story rolls out .
For Scientologists , he comes under the heading of " slack , obnoxious and lying through his teeth . "
It might be true that he had some extra protection due to his last name .
But that stopped when he hooked up with people that are outspoken enemies of Scientology .
I mean , who in their right mind would support someone that is friends with people that attack your beliefs and basically want you dead ?
He must have lost a lot of friends with that .
Also not a surprise then that his family came forward with their experience with Ron Miscavige .
The Church put it out for everyone to see , here .

Big bonuses for execs of failing companies seems to be the common theme in business culture these days , and the East Valley Tribune and its parent company , Freedom Communications , apparently are no exception .
The Trib will cease to be after December 31 , putting an end to a newspaper that thrived for more than a century .
What you may not know is that as the paper was laying off employees and moving from being a daily to a three - day - a - week paper , Freedom Communications execs got about $ 2.6 million in bonuses .
Our friends at Heat City did the leg work on this one and got access to court documents filed in Freedom 's bankruptcy case .
If you 're one of the roughly 140 people laid off by the Trib , or someone who is just pissed to see another newspaper fail , get ready to blow a gasket .
According to Heat City , 19 of the company 's top brass split about $ 2.6 million in the first eight months of 2009 , as the company 's profits continued to dwindle to less than half of what Freedom pocketed in 2007 ( check out Heat City if you 're a visual learner and need illustrations ) .
As for the Trib itself , Julie Moreno , the paper 's publisher , took a $ 28,333 bonus in March , just a week before telling staffers they would need to take a week off without pay .
In total , Moreno got $ 65,456 in bonuses , according to Heat City , on top of a nearly $ 190,000 annual salary , all within three months of laying off 140 of her employees .
Freedom refuses to discuss the bonuses .
The company did not return our call this afternoon but tells Heat City " The company does n't have any comment beyond what has already been filed in court . "
Similarly , the East Valley Tribune will have no comment on anything at all starting January 1 .
Jack - o’- lanterns are n’t just for kids fumbling with safety knives anymore .
The art and craft of carving the perfect pumpkin has gone from simple Halloween tradition to passionate pursuit , fueled by geeky obsessions and modern tech .
Take the ghoulish gourd disembowelers at Maniac Pumpkin Carvers .
Run by Parsons School of Design grads Marc Evan and Chris Soria , the New York - based operation cranks out custom pumpkins covered with intricate designs .
“ Our inspiration comes from a steady flow of hot coffee and horror films , ” said pumpkin artiste Evan .
“ We love carving images based off the movies and comics we grew up with .
The movies that we can quote years later , that fueled our overactive imaginations and our scariest nightmares . ”
“ Our process starts with the design , ” Evan said .
“ We sketch out ideas on paper and then freehand them onto the pumpkins .
No patterns or stencils . ”
“ Where The Wild Things Are was such a formative book for both of us , ” Evan said , “ and with the release of the movie this year it was important for us to show our respect and tribute . ”
“ Just prior to Michael Jackson ’s passing this year , ” Evan said , “ we had both been discussing how being kids in the early ’ 80s , our first memories of nightmares and being terrified were from seeing Thriller for the first time .
So this year , we carved an homage to MJ . ”
Star Wars has also been a big influence .
“ My family and friends often chide me about my love for these characters because I have become so immersed in their lore over the years , ” Evan told Wired.com last year for our Star Wars geek - o’- lantern gallery .
“ But at the same time they love how it has influenced my own creativity and work .
As an homage to these great films and mythology I have carved my favorite Dark Lords of the Sith into pumpkins for Halloween . ”
Gremlins gets the Maniac Pumpkin Carvers treatment .
Mogwai like Gizmo look so cute until you get them wet .
The Magic School Bus , a series of children ’s science books , goes under the knife for Maniac Pumpkin Carvers .
October is always a busy month for Maniac Pumpkin Carvers , for obvious reasons .
Witches like this one and other Halloween classics show up in many of Evan and Soria ’s glorious gourds .
Evan and his crew use a variety of gear to gut and decorate their pumpkins : linoleum cutters , X - Acto blades , clay tools , items from kids pumpkin - carving kits and “ some homemade from bits of saw blades or other sharp objects , ” Evan said .
“ We carve the design in various stages , cutting to different depths , allowing different levels of translucency , to achieve the desired shading and light effects , ” Evan said .
This New York City skyline showcases the multilayered approach .
Even The Simpsons ‘ money - grubbing Montgomery Burns would approve of Maniac Pumpkin Carvers ’ booming business .
“ The Yankee Stadium order that we just finished processing was an amazing challenge , ” Evan said .
“ Fifty pumpkins , each with an intricate logo for the World Series .
We bribed some friends with beer and pumpkin seeds to come be our diggers — scooping , scraping and gutting the pumpkins .
The last step is turning the intricately carved work of art into what Evan calls “ a true lantern . ”
“ We get out our copper wire , wire strippers , fixtures and plugs and carefully wire our pumpkins so that they are true electrical lanterns that can be plugged into the wall , ” he said .
“ We try hard to keep the wet bits away from the metal bits … .
So far we ’re still here , ” Evan said .
“ There is something really cool about seeing a real , live pumpkin glowing with a 40 - watt bulb . ”

Unfortunately , Christian leaders all too often allow the missuses of scripture to pass by uncommented on when it suits their political / historical agenda .
Even worse , they sometimes misappropriate the scriptures themselves .
Case in point , President of Westminster Seminary and signatory to the declaration Peter Lillback issued a tour guide to Philadelphia , scripture proofs and all .

" The moral cowards listed above are expert at judging the " secular culture " and denouncing it but never at coming together to denounce their own blasphemous rabid followers . "
I challenge you to ask any one , or for that matter each and every one of the people listed above whether they agree with this statement I quoted from your article .
To a man everyone of them will denounce any and all violence against Obama .
I dare you .
Setting up a straw man is not journalism .

These folks all stand up when it never costs them anything , in other words against the Big Bad " World " but never speak against the commercial corruption of Christianity let alone the way it has become series of personality cults --- Warren , Graham etc. Post " Tea Baggers " anti health care reform these are the guys that did n't do anything about the Bush torture machine but are ready to parse theoretical details about stem cells .
Now that the right is gathering in its cave to threaten our President they the Christian leaders are back where they were in the 1900s to 50s see no evil when it comes to a black man their friends are fixin ' to lynch .
PS thanks for reading my article .

By the way I took your " dare " already .
All they all have to do is write a piece condemning both the tone and the substance of what is coming from the right vs the President and sign it .
Where is that ?
Or do n't you think there is any implied threat in wishing a man gone and his children fatherless ?
This is their scared Bible being quoted after all .

FS says : " The question is : can these two groups coexist peacefully within our borders ?
I ’m not so sure they can .
What is expressed here is n't two points of view but the raw truth about two countries within one border : Sane America and hater Cretin America . "
That 's about the best way I 've heard it put , fantastic .
Let me take it a step further : North / South ???
Red State / Blue State ???
Is that the dividing line ?
Republicans happen to be Red States happen to be the South .

You 're dead - on with the " American Taliban " thing , too .
You do n't mince words , Frank , and you 're dead - on with what you 're saying .
People are afraid to call them the " American Taliban " , but you 're right and that 's a perfect description .
And what enables them is people / media NOT " saying it like it is " , like you are .

Frank -
I think you are misquoting the first sample fromt he right .
He says " I mean you seriously believe that those of us who do n’t like Obummer really want him dead ? "
He is actually mocking the connection between the dislike of Obama and the desire to see him assassinated .
He is saying this is a ridiculous connection .
Now I think there are plenty who do make that connection .
But this " sample " does n't appear to be one of them .
You go on to misquote this same sample at the end of your article , saying that the silence of the listed religious leaders is akin to agreeing with " those of us who don ’ t like Obummer really want him dead ? " while conveniently leaving out " I mean you seriously believe that ... "
The dangerous cretins on the right say plenty that is abhorrent and treasonous that is directly quotable .
Take that numbskull David Black who had posted here of late .
You do a disservice to the left by misquoting the right .

The american left is just as bad as the american right .
they both denigrate the other .
There is no middle ground to go to .
Why ,
Is there some basic idiom or block in the mind that expouses only a hatred of those who do not agree with you , or them ?
Bullshit , as a relitive once said .
Remember both Stalin , Mao , and Hitler all had their day , just as Christ , Mohammad and Budda had their days .
One tried to convince you with the butt of a gun , the other tried to educate you with pearls before swine .
Think of the comparissons and relate that to today , and see the middle ground is getting smaller .

Patently untrue .
I wo n't bother to elaborate .
Stalin , Mao , and Hitler all had their day ... tried to convince you with the butt of a gun
They were all totalitarian megalomaniacs .
What did they try to " convince " people of ?
Their ideology was false , they knew it , they simply wanted supreme power .
They were not political in the sense that politics requires an exchange of ideas .
They existed to serve themselves and their cronies , to subvert all power to themselves .
I do n't understand your point in bringing them up at all - is it to make a comparison to Obama ?
If so , that is laughable .
Much as I take issue with Obama 's continuation of the Bush administration in many regards , he is doing so within the confines of our highly flawed contemporary " beltway " machine .
He does not possess a megalomaniacal bent , much as the right - wing media would have you believe .
He just gets some very bad advice .

Frank Schaeffer , Here 's my " GOLD STANDARD " on dangerous cults .
Meet the ABCDEF .

NOTE : It also applies to corporate owned media .
The only thing I can come up with to fight such cult dangers are to force the FCC to force networks to make their " public file " available online to the public , and use the comments in it to evaluate if the station is serving the public interest , and if they are not in the public interest to YANK their Station ID and Frequency Allocation .
You 'll also note the original FCC's Mission Statement is MISSING .

James @8 Those are nobel sentiments .
Some I agree with and some I do n't .
Personally I believe the left is getting shriller because we 're getting ignored ... The left has been denigrated and smeared since Reagan .
Only the right has had unfettered access to mainstream media and shaping the debate in public policy , any left ideas or policies are smothered in infancy .
America has become a right - wing authoritarian country ... even with Obama in the whitehouse .
The right which has lost the whitehouse , senate and congress would have the American public believe that the public sentiment is with them .
They have in effect neutralized the last 2 national elections .
They 're still driving public policy ; they 're doing it now with their media machine .
I have never seen a smaller group of folks drive the debate in policy issues .
That 's fascist .
I wish the Dems and Obama had the gonads to stand up to this without flinching .
But Dems have abandoned the left and gone for the middleground which is n't where the majority lies .... I submit to you that the left is ready some some leftist policies that would help alleviate poverty , give every American healthcare , restore the civil - constitutional rights that Bush - Cheney shredded and end the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Those are n't " middle ground " issues .... they 're issues that may restore America 's moral compass ...
As it is now America is being driven by an amoral , power mad , lying cabal .
When it comes to Truth and lies .... there is no middle ground .

[ W ] hen we talk about lying , and especially about lying among acting men , let us remember that the lie did not creep into politics by some accident of human sinfulness .
Moral outrage , for this reason alone , is not likely to make it disappear .
The deliberate falsehood deals with contingent facts ; that is , with matters that carry no inherent truth within themselves , no necessity to be as they are .
Factual truths are never compellingly true .
The historian knows how vulnerable is the whole texture of facts in which we spend our daily life ; it is always in danger of being perforated by single lies or torn to shreds by the organized lying of groups , nations , or classes , or denied and distorted , often carefully covered up by reams of falsehoods or simply allowed to fall into oblivion .
Facts need testimony to be remembered and trustworthy witnesses to be established in order to find a secure dwelling place in the domain of human affairs .
From this , it follows that no factual statement can ever be beyond doubt — as secure and shielded against attack as , for instance , the statement that two and two make four .
It is this fragility that makes deception so very easy up to a point , and so tempting .
It never comes into a conflict with reason , because things could indeed have been as the liar maintains they were .
Lies are often much more plausible , more appealing to reason , than reality , since the liar has the great advantage of knowing beforehand what the audience wishes or expects to hear .
He has prepared his story for public consumption with a careful eye to making it credible , whereas reality has the disconcerting habit of confronting us with the unexpected , for which we were not prepared .

It seems that this is another classic case where the antics of a handful of crazies are being used that to make a caricature of a much larger group of people who in no way countenance such things .
The scholars and pastors who signed the Manhattan Declaration , hardly represent the " far right " but are more in line with mainstream Evangelical Christianity ... such terms as " far right " and " far left " are terribly unfortunate anyway since they inherently suffer from a lack of nuance and often obfuscate issues , causing far more heat than light in public debate .

While appreciating the general sentiment --- yes , many of the big boys , on both sides of the aisle , are bought and paid for by the mega - corporations ---
I 'll still disagree with the sweeping " there is no longer any difference " sentiment .
The smaller difference :
One party serves as the operative for the corporations , the other ( often ) tries not to be , even while grappling with absurd realities of campaign financing , and the need to not turn those corporations * against * you , and in complete favor of your opposition .
A cynical tight - rope to walk , but still a difference in party mentality .
The bigger differnce :
The smaller things , that do n't make Fox " News " ever , or CNN / MSNBC most of the time .
Eg. , what has been quietly going on at the EPA is a sea change from the previous administration .
Are they perfect there ?
No .
Too slow still in many regards ?
Yes .
But every single day , virtually , some absurd corporatist , enviro - raping policy is being rolled back and returned to sanity .
It does n't make the big big headlines , but it means a very important to change to some very important issues .
Similarly , other below - the - radar differnces are vast , even if not making the big font headlines at HuffPo and friends .
I certainly understand the cynicism , but we should be work hard to guard against it , else why bother trying , working , educating , fighting to make anything better .
I 'll take no part in that .

He 's got nothing if not credibility on this very subject , and among these very people .

Like what ?
What " important American values " does Obama threaten ?
What would an extremist like you , do , if we had a president that you thought might destroy America ?
I can't speak for Frank ( which is who I presume you 're directing your comment to ? ) , but when we had a " President " who * did * destroy America , I raised holy hell , started a blog , made the case through actual , independently verifiable documentation showing how he was doing exactly that , called for legal accountability where he violated the law , and his impeachment for where he violated the Constitution and virtually every American value on which this country has stood .
I hope you 'll do the same .
( Hint : One of the best ways to assure this President and any future ones do not violate our Constitution and / or our values , is to hold the one who actually did do that accountable for having done so .
Sends a pretty good message to others , do n't ya think ? )
I never once suggested that he should be killed , as per Psalm 109:8 , or as per " Blood of tyrants ... " t- shirts , " We came unarmed this time " signs , etc. , and quickly condemned any and all who did anything even close to it .

The right wing are trying to make capital of the fact that Obama appears to be a right wing plant and I think he is .
However his assasination and their ascendance will bring something worse and the facists would love that .
Their propaganda machine is like an octopus .
There is no truth emerging from any side because they are feeding a compliant media with bucket loads of horseshit .
Paid corporate actors seem to have center stage and will create scenes of all descriptions to confuse the public .

In addition to being the bicentennial of Proudhon ’s birth , 2009 was the 160th anniversary of the publication of Proudhon ’s Confessions of a Revolutionary , one of his most anarchist works .
In it he denounced the unholy trinity of capitalism , religion and the state , which was to become a common theme in subsequent anarchist writings :
Capital , which in the political field is analogous to government , in religion has Catholicism as its synonym .
The economic idea of capitalism , the politics of government or of authority , and the theological idea of the Church are three identical ideas , linked in various ways .
To attack one of them is equivalent to attacking all of them …
What capital does to labour , and the State to liberty , the Church does to the spirit …
The most effective means for oppressing the people would be simultaneously to enslave its body , its will and its reason .
If socialism is to reveal its truly positive aspect , free from all mysticism , all it will have to do is denounce the idea of this trinity .
When Bakunin and James Guillaume put together a selection of Proudhon ’s writings in 1873 , entitled Anarchy According to Proudhon , they included extensive excerpts from the Confessions , as well as material from The General Idea of the Revolution in the 19th Century .
Both books , written by Proudhon while imprisoned for denouncing Louis - Napoleon Bonaparte as the personification of reaction , set forth Proudhon ’s anarchist analysis and response to the 1848 Revolution in France , not his subsequent and far inferior work , The Social Revolution Demonstrated by the December 2 Coup d’Etat , seized upon by Proudhon ’s critics to show he was a “ secret friend ” of the right ( for more on this , see my previous blog page entry , The General Idea of Proudhon ’s Revolution ) .
In the following excerpts from the Confessions , Proudhon argues that the majority always has a right of insurrection against the minorities which oppress them , but that when a democratic government is established based on universal suffrage and majority rule , minorities should limit themselves to what today would be called civil disobedience , the refusal to pay taxes , to serve in the military , and to obey the laws imposed upon them by the majority .
Later anarchists , for the most part , argued that oppressed minorities always have a right to revolt , even where the government is elected by majority vote , while pacifist anarchists , inspired by Tolstoy ’s doctrine of non-violent resistance ( Anarchism , Volume One , Selection 47 ) , preferred civil disobedience ( what Proudhon refers to below as “ legal resistance ” ) .
The following excerpts , translated by Martin Walker , are taken from Chapter 18 of the Confessions and will be included in the forthcoming collection of Proudhon ’s anarchist writings , Property is Theft !
A Pierre Joseph Proudhon Anthology , to be published by AK Press in 2010 ( the 170th anniversary of the publication of Proudhon ’s What is Property ? , in which he first proclaimed himself an anarchist ) .
Confessions of a Revolutionary , Chapter 18
As the question of legal resistance is of the highest seriousness , it being a part of republican law which is revived every day by the arbitrary nature of power and of the parliamentary majority , and because many people confuse it with the right to insurrection recognised by the Declaration of 1793 , I am going to give a short account of its true principles before accounting for the political course followed by [ Proudhon ’s newspaper ] the People in this situation .
What is the right to insurrection ?
How is one to understand the concept of legal resistance ?
In which cases may one or the other apply ?
If it were possible that the government were truly concerned with order , if it respected liberty and sought less to impose arbitrary decisions , it would make haste to deal with these questions officially and not leave the job to a journalist .
But the government hates all questions of legality above all things and hushes them up as much as it can .
What occupies it most is to persecute authors , printers , newspaper sellers , peddlers , bill - posters : it reserves its instructions and circulars for them [ Proudhon ’s newspapers were suppressed by the authorities and he was imprisoned for 3 years in June 1849 ] .
I will observe first of all that the rights of insurrection and resistance are peculiar to the period of subordination and antagonism : they fall into disuse when liberty is practiced .
In a democracy organized on the basis of the popular initiative with multiple locations of responsibility and no superior authority the exercise of such rights would have no grounds for taking place at all .
By the establishment of universal suffrage the Constitution of 1790 had already invalidated , while implicitly recognizing , the right to insurrection .
Imperial despotism , the Charters of 1814 and 1830 , the 200 franc poll tax suppressing the intervention of the masses in public affairs , all these re-established it .
The February [ 1848 ] revolution had once more abolished it , at the same time as the death penalty : the monstrous doctrine of the omnipotence of parliamentary majorities which the government would like to impose restores it again .
It is not , after all , to tell the truth , a principle of democratic and social institutions which we are going to discuss now : it is a principle of absolute and constitutional monarchy , an idea born of privilege .
Socialism repudiates the right to insurrection and legal resistance : it has only to make similar sanctions for its theory .
But , forced to defend itself on the terrain where the Constitution challenges it , it borrows the right from absolutists and doctrinaire politicians , authors or instigators of that Constitution , and uses it against them in the manner of an argumentum ad hominem , to use the scholastic expression .
The right to insurrection is that by virtue of which a people can claim its liberty , either against the tyranny of a despot or against the privileges of an aristocracy , without a previous denunciation as warning , and by force of arms .
It may happen , and hitherto this has been the almost constant state of the majority of nations , that an immense , scattered people , disarmed and betrayed , finds itself at the mercy of a few thousand satellites under the orders of a despot .
In this state , insurrection is fully justified and has no rules but prudence and opportunity .
The insurrections of the 14th July [ 1789 ] and 10th August [ 1792 ] were of this nature .
There was a chance that Malet ’s conspiracy in 1812 could have provoked an insurrection which would have been equally legitimate .
The insurrection of July 1830 , in which the country sided with the parliamentary majority against a king who violated a pact , was irreproachable .
That of 1848 , in which the majority of the country rose against the parliamentary majority to claim the right to vote , was all the more rational for having as its object the abolition of the right to insurrection by re-establishing universal suffrage .
So when the Convention [ of 1792 ] , after having organized the primary assemblies and re-consecrated universal suffrage , wrote the right to insurrection into the constitution of the year II , it was creating retrospective legislation , to be exact ; it took out a guarantee against a danger which no longer existed in principle .
The Constituent Assembly of 1848 acted in the same way when , having declared direct and universal suffrage in Article 24 , in Article 110 it adds that it entrusts the Constitution and the rights that it preserves to the guardianship and the patriotism of all the French .
In principle , let me repeat , universal suffrage abolishes the right to insurrection : in practice , the antagonism of the separate powers and the absolutism of majorities can cause it to be reborn .
How and in what cases is precisely what must yet be determined .
The right of insurrection has a particular characteristic , namely that it presupposes a people oppressed by a despot , a third estate by an aristocracy , the greater number by the lesser .
That is the principle , apart from which the right of insurrection vanishes at the same time as the conflicts of opinions and interests .
The social union effectively takes on a different character inasmuch as the practice of universal suffrage becomes more widespread and propagates itself , while the economic forces tend toward equilibrium ; the empire of minorities is succeeded by that of majorities , which latter is itself succeeded by that of universality , that is absolute liberty , which excludes any idea of conflict .
There is , however , one case when the right of insurrection might be legitimately invoked by a minority against a majority : that would be in a transitional society when the majority wishes to abolish universal suffrage , or at least limit its application , in order to perpetuate its despotism .
In that case , I maintain , the minority has the right to resist oppression , even by force …
We now come to legal resistance .
We have said that the right of insurrection cannot be allowed to pertain for a minority against a majority in a country where universal suffrage has begun to develop .
However arbitrary the decisions of that majority may be and however flagrant the violation of the pact may appear , a majority can always deny that there is a violation as such , which reduces the difference to a simple question of perspective and consequently offers no pretext for revolt .
Even if the minority invoked certain rights prior to or superior to the Constitution that it claims the majority has overlooked , it would be easy for the latter to invoke in its turn other prior or superior rights like the public safety by virtue of which it could legitimize its will .
This would be so effective that it would always be necessary to arrive at a definitive solution by voting , to appeal to the law of number .
So let us admit this proposition as proven : between the minority and the majority of the citizens as constitutionally manifested by universal suffrage an armed conflict is illegitimate .
A minority cannot be permitted to be at the mercy of a majority , however : justice , which is the negation of force , demands that the minority have its guarantees .
For it may occur as a result of political passions and the opposition of interests that the minority reacts to an action of the ruling majority by claiming that the Constitution has been violated , which the majority denies ; when the people are called upon as a final arbiter of this disagreement , being the supreme judge in these matters , the majority of the citizens joins the majority of representatives with uncompromising egoism in deliberately treading underfoot both truth and justice , though they are precisely the ones who should defend them according to the Constitution .
The minority , overtly oppressed , is then no longer a party in political and parliamentary opposition but a proscribed party , a whole class of citizens thus being placed outside the law .
Such a situation is shameful , is suicide , is the destruction of all social bonds .
Yet insurrection in the terms of the Constitution is forbidden : what can the minority do in this extreme case ?
When the law is audaciously violated ; when a fraction of the people is outlawed by society ; when the passionate impetus of a party has come to the point of saying :
We will never give in ; when there are two nations in the nation , one of them weaker and oppressed , the other more numerous which oppresses : if the division is admitted on both sides , my opinion is that the minority has the right to consummate this division by declaring it .
The social bond being broken , the minority is freed from any political agreement with the majority : this is expressed by the refusal to obey those in power , pay one ’s taxes , do one ’s military service , etc .
A refusal motivated in this way has been called legal resistance by journalists because the government has gone beyond the bounds of law , and the citizens remind it of that fact by refusing to obey it .

The song was published on the internet after the murder of Jason Johnson
Two rappers have been jailed for using an internet song to try to scare off witnesses to the murder of a 24 - year - old man in Ealing , west London .
The video warned people who talked to police about the murder of Jason Johnson could be shot .
Ishmael McLean , 22 , from Greenford , and Rowan Simon , 18 , from Ealing , west London , were found guilty of acting to pervert the course of justice .
McLean was jailed for four years and Simon was jailed for 30 months .
McLean was also sentenced to a year in jail for possessing ammunition , the term to run concurrently .
Message to community
The clip entitled " Wrong Team " , featured a backing chorus sung by several people with a burst of gunfire .
It was placed on YouTube with links to MySpace and Facebook profiles .
It was published on the internet following the murder of Mr Johnson , from Ealing , in November last year .
Oliver Glasgow , prosecuting , said the video to the song was clearly intended to frighten people off from speaking to the police .
Eight people , including McLean and Simon , were arrested following Mr Johnson 's shooting but were not prosecuted .
Mr Glasgow said a man claiming to be an eyewitness had been interviewed by police .
The defendants , without knowing the person 's identity , sent out a message to the community by publishing the rap on the internet .
' Grim prospect '
" Its connection to this case and its chilling message were immediately obvious to the officers , " Mr Glasgow told the court .
" The video had but one purpose - to threaten any witness to this incident to frighten them to such an extent that they would refuse to co-operate with the police .
" They made it clear exactly what it was they wanted to do to them .
" Namely , kill them or to use their own words , ' I can't wait for the snitch to drop , I still show up at his wake just to see him off ' . "
Old Bailey Judge Richard
Hone said the lyrics meant : " Those who went chitter - chattering to police were themselves in danger of being shot . "
He said police investigating gun crime were faced with a code of silence .
" It is a grim prospect for British justice , " the judge added .

Dorset Police 's website is an example of naming and shaming criminals Police should visit every victim of crime in England and Wales no matter how minor the offence , the home secretary has said .
Alan Johnson made the call as he launched an advertising campaign on what should be expected of police .
The campaign focuses on the " Policing Pledge " which sets out what officers promise to do in their community .
The Home Office also wants police forces and councils to use websites to name key local convicted criminals .
The campaign also highlights the idea of officers being highly visible on the streets and visiting people in their homes after a crime had been reported .
" My gut reaction is that a victim of crime should be seen and should be spoken to , " said Mr Johnson , launching the campaign .
" There may be practical reasons why you can't have a general commitment that covers all crime no matter how minor - there may be practical difficulties involved in that .
" But I think in general the principle and the sentiment is absolutely right . "
The idea of officers committing to visiting crime victims was pioneered by the former Essex chief constable , Roger Baker .
However , it has not been adopted by other forces .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The TV ad campaign aims to better explain the Policing Pledge , which has now been signed by each of the 43 forces in England and Wales .
The pledge was devised as part of a long - term Home Office review on how to improve the public 's trust in the criminal justice system .
Among the pledge 's contents is a commitment to make it easier to contact neighbourhood police teams who , in turn , are committed to spending 80 % of their time on duty in their community .
The document also promises that someone reporting a non-emergency crime can get an appointment with an officer within two days .
Name and shame plan
The Home Office says that in December forces and councils will be given new guidance from the Ministry of Justice on how best to name and shame criminals , over and above what appears in local media .
Both are being encouraged to improve the way they use their websites to publicise major convictions .
Dorset Police are already running a " Behind Bars " section on their website detailing the latest significant jailings .
The Home Office 's £ 1.9 m campaign involves adverts on television , radio and websites with leaflets distributed to six million homes .
HAVE YOUR SAY
All I would expect from a justice system is to see that justice is done
Dom the grumpy old man , Runcorn Last month , a report by Her Majesty 's Inspector of Constabulary , the national policing watchdog , said that 35 out of 43 forces had fallen short of the standards set out in their pledges .
It called on senior officers to do more to keep victims up to date on the progress of investigations and support dissatisfied members of the public .
Those concerns were echoed in a separate report by Sara Payne , appointed by the government as an independent victims ' champion .
She argued that the criminal justice system needed to do more to keep victims informed and help them to understand what happens to criminals who have blighted their lives .

This week we ’ve had a chance to play through the beginning of Borderlands , courtesy of 2 K Games .
What follows are some preview impressions of that co-op experience .
We expect to unleash a full RPS Verdict on the game later this month .
Playing the single - player version of Borderlands causes one single game feature to stand out .
When you are reduced to zero health you have some time in which you bleed to death .
This gives you a chance to revive yourself with a “ second wind ” by getting a kill .
In the co-op part of the game this makes perfect sense , as it ’s also an opportunity for your buddies to run over to you and help you up .
In the single player game , however , there are times when there is nothing to kill , and no buddy to help you .
You simply kneel there , bleeding to death .
And it ’s kind of heart - breaking .
This feature alone , I feel , demonstrates how Borderlands is meant to played with friends .
Once router port - fiddling is defeated that ’s easily done online by making your normal game an internet game , playing your own campaign , and then inviting chums when they ’re available .
We ’ve had a chance to do that , and we ’ve just finished the opening section of the game known as “ Arid Badlands ” , by playing through as a team .
Arid Badlands very much an introductory experience , with the chirpy robot character and a mysterious static woman explaining everything after you pass the character selection screen .
You ’re asked to help out a ramshackle frontier town which is sparsely populated by redneck characters .
You ’re a treasure hunter , looking for a mythical vault , and lots of people seem invested in your finding it .
Arriving via an armoured bus , you kill some bandits off and starting settling in .
Once you open up the main hub town , Fyrestone , then it feels a little like the opening stages of an MMO .
There ’s a strong whiff of those starter area cues you get in games that are longer - term and slower - paced than traditional shooters .
There ’s not much “ worldiness ” to it , with only a handful of friendly and rather characterless NPCs .
In fact , from what we ’ve seen there ’s little general activity in the world , but there ’s nevertheless some evidence of more complex infrastructure : wind - turbines , powerlines , and a neat vehicle system .
All this bodes well for the rest of the game , which should hopefully expand on the idea of Pandora as a world .
Although there ’s constant combat from the start , Fyrestone and the surrounding area feels low key and preparatory , and once early missions unfold then that air of RPG is even stronger .
The back and forth of minor quests , the mission dispensing characters and bulletin boards , the hit numbers bouncing from enemies , the stats and colours for weapon types – I almost expected the badlands to open up and reveal some kind of “ World Of Guncraft ” beyond .
And yet the best fun we ’ve had in the first part of the game has been thanks to the focus on gunplay .
Borderlands is embedded deeply in the shooter category , and it will send you running for cover and aiming for headshots .
Some of the fights we ’ve had have been ludicrous tooth - and - nail running battles , with a joyous chaos to them .
In this opening area there are two main kinds of enemies : skags , a kind of mutant dog - lizard thing , and bandits , who come in various shapes and sizes of mean and mutated .
Playing co-op hugely amplifies the chaos of a firefight because so many more high level enemies appear .
You ’re often dealing with multiple targets and trying to drag your friends to their feet while you yourself are under fire , as rabid midgets stab axes into you , and heavies hammer you with machinegun fire .
All this this drives the loot - hunger , of course , because co-op battles bring about more impressive enemies , and therefore even better drops .
With millions of weapons , various shields and other mods to play with , there ’s a whole load of tweaking to be done to your character , and swapping loot back and forth is going to become routine among friends .
I suspect , however , it ’s going to trickier to play with strangers : there ’s currently no formal system for loot sharing , meaning anyone can run in and grab whatever they like from the hundreds of stashes that you uncover .
A limited inventory space , however , means that the greedy run out of room rather promptly .
I ’m coming to love the art style and general attitude of the game .
The hand - drawn textures give the game a look that is clean and crisp while still being down and dirty .
It ’s comic book and playful , with a bold sense of thrills , and a good feeling for why we enjoy getting an even bigger gun .
While Arid Badlands is a brownish desert it nevertheless has a bunch of interesting design going on in it , not just in the visuals , but in way the sidequests and the main story arc interlock .
It ’s structured so that you have plenty of opportunity to back off and level up a bit before taking on more serious tasks .
Having taken down the early bosses and fought our way through what I suppose constitute the first “ dungeons ” in the game , we ’re certainly interested in seeing what comes next .
And for that , you ’ll have to wait for our next article .
The U.S. Mint has announced that will stop selling 1 - ounce gold bullion coins .
Demand has been so strong that they 've effectively run out of 2009 American Eagle coins .
They sold 124,000 coins in November alone , after selling 115,000 in October and September .
Have no fear , they plan to resume coin sales in early December .
Reuters via CNBC : Produced from gold mined in the United States , the 22 - karat American Eagles have been novel items among collectors and investors since their introduction in 1986 .
Each coin has a face value of $ 50 but it is sold by authorized dealers at a premium to the price of gold .
Madrid ’s expensively - assembled superstars put up a good fight , but Barca have drawn first blood in the title race …
Barcelona 1 - 0 Real Madrid - Line - Up / Stats
La Liga Fixtures , Results & Standings
After a deadlock in the first half , substitute Zlatan Ibahimovic became Barcelona 's newest darling when he scored the only goal of the game in the 159th edition of El Clasico to bag three points to the Catalans .
Injuries and fitness issues had deprived to threaten the world ’s Clasico of the biggest duel in football after reports emerged in the morning of matchday that neither Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo would start the game .
But the legions of fans and the global media were relieved to see both players in the starting XI , although the two other big guns , Ibrahimovic and Karim Benzema only started on the bench .
Barca wasted little time charging forward as Messi and Dani Alves looked to exploit Madrid ’s weak left - back spot immediately , but the Brazilian wasted two early crosses as he uncharacteristically over - hit them .
Kaka launched the visitors ’ first attack after four minutes when he lofted a through ball into the box but Gonzalo Higuain just could n’t control , leaving Victor Valdes to gather easily .
Cristiano Ronaldo ’s first meaningful contribution was to carve up an opening on six minutes when he easily breezed past Carles Puyol down the left flank and dinked a low cross to Marcelo , who miscued his half volley and sent it well into the stands .
Minutes later , Messi danced past three players and slipped in Thierry Henry into the area down the left channel , but his tame shot was saved comfortably by Iker Casillas .
Alves then sent yet another cross into empty space before Xavi pummelled in a 20 yard drive which sailed over the bar .
Ronaldo had a shooting opportunity of his own on 11 minutes as he stood over the ball for a freekick from nearly 30 yards out while deafening whistles rained down from the Camp Nou stands on 11 minutes when Ronaldo stood over the ball for a freekick from nearly 30 yards out , but his blistering effort crashed into Sergio Busquets in the wall , much to the delight of the Catalan faithful .
The best chance of the game came on 20 minutes .
Kaka careened down the left , cut into the middle and squared the ball to Ronaldo , but his low drive was kick - saved by Valdes , leaving the Portuguese in disbelief .
Barca ’s normally flawless passing game collapsed a minute later when they lost the ball in their own half and Ronaldo ’s deft backheel released Kaka , but Valdes dashed off his line to thump it clear .
The Blaugrana backline was sliced opened again on 25 minutes when Kaka teed - up an unmarked Marcelo , but Puyol lunged forward and blocked off the Brazilian ’s shot .
Casillas was finally called to make his first big save of the game on 36 minutes when he tipped over Henry ’s cheeky angled cross at the byline which was heading for the back of the net .
The Madrid shot - stopper then dived low to save Iniesta ’s left - foot drive as Barcelona looked to end the half the stronger , but both sides marched back into the dressing room even - stevens , although Los Blancos appeared the happier of the two sides with the way the contest was unfolding .
All the game needed was a goal to light the spark and Pep Guardiola decided to introduce the first of the two missing big guns as Zlatan Ibrahimovic replaced a quiet Henry after 50 minutes .
And the Catalans immediately upped the tempo .
But it was again Madrid who looked the more likely to score .
Barca failed to make the most of a corner and Sergio Ramos led the counterattack as he played in Higuain , who checked past one defender inside the box but Puyol again came to the rescue with a brilliant tackle just as the Argentine was about to pull the trigger .
The capital giants would pay for their profligacy as Barcelona surged infront on 55 minutes .
Dani
Alves drilled in an inch - perfect cross to Ibrahimovic , who stayed onside before he rifled in a masterful cushioned volley past Casillas at the back post .
But the Blaugrana were stunned on the hour mark when Busquets ’ clumsy handball earned him a second yellow card and Guardiola suddenly found himself a man short .
Ronaldo had another chance on 65 minutes but he thumped Marcelo ’s cross over .
That was his last contribution as Manuel Pellegrini made his first change , sending in Karim Benzema for ‘ CR9 ’ .
Gerard Pique almost killed off the contest in the 70th minute but hammered his header from a freekick agonisingly wide .
Straight to the other end , Kaka danced his way past Alves at the byline and cut it back to Benzema , but Puyol , for the umpteenth time , made a pivotal interception to block the French striker ’s close - range attempt .
Eric Abidal was next to queue up to become the hero for Barcelona when he latched onto Xavi ’s through ball but pulled his shot marginally wide of Casillas ’ left post .
Over at the other side , Benzema almost became Madrid ’s saviour when Xabi Alonso ’s corner bobbled into this path , but the former Lyon man ballooned his shot from five yards out .
With two minutes left on the clock , Messi thought he had the icing on the cake .
He ran onto Dani Alves ’ squared ball but he was denied brilliantly by Casillas in a one - on - one .
But it would be game over a minute later when Madrid ’s midfield talisman , Lassana Diarra was dismissed .
It was n't the goal rush fans around the world were expecting , as Barcelona did just enough to fight off a valiant Madrid in a fascinating encounter nonetheless .

Drugs sometimes have beneficial side effects .
A glaucoma treatment causes luscious eyelashes .
A blood pressure drug also aids those with a rare genetic disease .
The newest surprise discovered by researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is a gonorrhea medication that might help battle cancer .
" Often times we are surprised that a drug known to do something else has another hidden property , " says Jun Liu , Ph.D. , a professor of pharmacology and molecular sciences at Johns Hopkins and author on the study published Oct. 1 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
In this case , the surprise is a big one .
The drug , acriflavine , used in the 1930s for treating gonorrhea , has turned out to have the previously unknown ability to halt the growth of new blood vessels .
Preliminary tests showed that mice engineered to develop cancer had no tumor growth if treated with daily injections of acriflavine .
" As cancer cells rapidly divide , they consume considerable amounts of oxygen , " says Gregg Semenza , M.D. , Ph.D. , the C. Michael Armstrong Professor of Pediatrics and director of the vascular program at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering .
" To continue growing , a tumor must create new blood vessels to deliver oxygen to the tumor cells . "
Acriflavine stops blood vessel growth by inhibiting the function of the protein hypoxia - inducible factor ( HIF ) - 1 , which was discovered by Semenza 's team in 1992 .
When HIF - 1 senses that the surrounding environment is low in oxygen , it turns on genes necessary for building new vessels .
Though essential for normal tissue growth and wound healing , HIF - 1 is also turned on by cancers to obtain the oxygen they need to survive .
Most importantly , in order for HIF - 1 to work , two subunits must bind together like puzzle pieces .
Most drugs are unable to prevent protein binding because the drug molecules can be much smaller than the proteins they interact with .
A medicine must hit just the right spot , a critical domain or pocket on the surface of one protein to stop it from binding to another protein .
Even though drugs that stop binding are uncommon , they are such an effective means to stop protein function that Semenza decided to look for one that might block HIF - 1 .
To do that , he turned to the Johns Hopkins Drug Library , a collection of FDA - and internationally approved compounds in that was assembled by Liu .
advertisement
To visualize protein binding , scientists engineered a cell line so that when the HIF - 1 subunits came together , they would cause the cell to light up like a firefly .
They then tested each of the more than 3,000 drugs in the drug library in hopes of finding one that would turn out the light .
Acriflavine did , andfurther studies confirmed that it was binding directly to HIF - 1 .
" Mechanistically , this is the first drug of its kind , " says Liu .
" It is acting in a way that is never seen for this family of proteins . "
Liu hopes that acriflavine can one day be incorporated into chemotherapy cocktails , one drug among many that help fight cancer .
Hopkins is seeking even more new uses for old drugs .
So far , drugs in the library have been screened for use against malaria , tuberculosis , HIV and the Ebola virus .
In the future , Liu expects even more researchers to take advantage of the library , which is continuing to grow as more drugs are added to the collection .
" In the public domain , Hopkins has the largest drug library , " says Liu .
" The more drugs you have , the more possibilities , the higher the chance you rediscover something that will help . "
This study was funded by the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering and the Foundation for Advanced Research in the Medical Sciences .
Authors on the paper are KangAe Lee , now of Princeton University , Huafeng Zhang , David Z. Qian , Sergio Rey , Liu and Semenza , all of Johns Hopkins .
SOME earthquakes can leave a legacy of aftershocks that last for centuries .
Low - level seismic rumbles appear to foreshadow many quakes .
Yet not always : the 2008 Sichuan quake in China ( pictured ) came out of the blue .
These rumbles may not be precursors but aftershocks – readjustments at a fault following a larger event , in some cases centuries earlier .
Seth Stein of Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois , and colleagues analysed the rate of fault slip in various tectonic settings .
At plate boundaries , motion rapidly “ reloads ” a fault with new stress and changes conditions there , so tremors that can be clearly identified as …

That 's a high quality mousepad
Yesterday we reported on a big name EA title making it ’s way to the iPhone later this month , Rock Band iPhone .
It seems that was n’t all of the news EA Mobile had to share with us .
It seems another high profile title is going to be receiving the iPhone treatment .
Command & Conquer Red Alert for the iPhone will allow players to play across 12 combat levels as both Soviet and Ally factions , manage and command multiple units on the battlefield , and feature the ability to build your base and manage supplies with an “ easy - to - use combat system ” .
Depending on how easy the system is to use on the iPhone platform is yet to be seen , but since RTS games use heavy point & clicking , I do n’t see as how the game could fail .
The real test will be how “ easy ” it will be for players to take control of all of the action while still knowing what exactly is going on in the rest of the map .
No price has been revealed , but you can expect Command and Conquer for the iPhone / iPod Touch to be released on October 23 .

The Ugly Truth about Jobs Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke has given Americans a glimpse of the ugly truth about their future job prospects .
Simply put , companies have found that they can shed workers and rely on technological advances and overseas factories to operate with a lot fewer U.S. employees .
Email
Printer friendly Bernanke told the Economic Club of New York on Monday that some U.S. companies might begin to add workers to meet rising demand , but he added that “ other firms , facing difficult financial conditions and intense pressure to cut costs , seem to have found longer - lasting , efficiency - enhancing changes that allowed them to reduce their workforces .
…
“ To the extent that firms are able to find further cost - cutting measures as output expands , they may delay hiring . ”
In other words , Americans – from blue - collar manufacturing workers to white - collar office employees – wo n’t be needed as much in the future by companies that are squeezing more productivity out of the workers that remain and are shifting more jobs overseas .
That means U.S. unemployment can be expected to stay high and wages low , Bernanke said .
“ Given this weakness in the labor market , a natural question is whether we might be in for a so - called jobless recovery , in which output is growing but employment fails to increase , ” the Fed chairman said , suggesting strongly that the answer would be yes .
“ Since December 2007 , the U.S. economy has lost , on net , about 8 million private - sector jobs , and the unemployment rate has risen from less than 5 percent to more than 10 percent , ” Bernanke said .
“ Both the decline in jobs and the increase in the unemployment rate have been more severe than in any other recession since World War II .
“ Besides cutting jobs , many employers have reduced hours for the workers they have retained . …
These data suggest that the excess supply of labor is even greater than indicated by the unemployment rate alone .
“ With the job market so weak , businesses have been able to find or retain all the workers they need with minimal wage increases , or even with wage cuts . …
The best thing we can say about the labor market right now is that it may be getting worse more slowly . ”
Yet , while American jobs were falling off a cliff , productivity – defined as output per hour of work – was soaring , rising at a 5.5 percent annual rate this year , Bernanke said .
Put all this together and average Americans might want to rethink how they feel about their “ free - market ” economic system , now that many of them have been made surplus to it .
High unemployment also may cause a double - dip recession – and even more layoffs – because jobless Americans wo n’t be able to pay their mortgages or buy new cars or other consumer goods .
What to Do ?
So what can be done ?
The obvious answer is for the government to intervene in creating infrastructure jobs directly and encouraging the private sector to spread the available work around ( and not ship so much work abroad ) .
However , with the federal government deeply in debt ( thanks to George W. Bush ’s massive tax cuts tilted to the rich and because of his two open - ended wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ) , there is n’t much money to devote to any additional economic stimulus .
Thus , the Obama administration is faced with the dilemma of either borrowing more money or raising taxes on the rich to help pay for programs to increase jobs .
Neither prospect is politically attractive , since Democratic “ deficit hawks ” keep banding with Republicans to block any more borrowing and many politicians are terrified of raising taxes , even if only on millionaires .
Ironically , the current crisis could have one silver lining , if Americans finally opted for an economic strategy that raised taxes on the rich , who have benefited most from the technological advances and the expansion of international commerce , and shared those productivity gains with more people .
That might allow Americans to begin enjoying the future that seemed to be beckoning years back , when people thought that machines would make life easier for humans , not harder .
But many Americans have been sold on the right - wing and neoconservative message that any government effort to address the nation ’s domestic needs is dreaded “ socialism ” and that the government ’s primary -- if not only -- role must be to lavish money on the military to “ keep us safe . ”
That widespread belief system is the result of three decades of having drummed into their heads Ronald Reagan ’s catchy phrase that “ government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem , ” a theme repeated endlessly on right - wing talk radio , at Fox News and in a host of other conservative media outlets that dominate the American landscape .
Simultaneously , the American Left has done little to counter the Right ’s propaganda .
During those same three decades , progressives invested relatively little in building a message machine that could compete with the Right ’s giant megaphone .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The Left ’s Media Miscalculation . ” ]
This media asymmetry has had devastating consequences for the American political process .
In the 1980s , Reagan had a relatively free hand to go after “ big labor ” ; in the 1990s , working with the triangulating Clinton administration , Republicans pushed through “ free - trade agreements ” and bank deregulation ; and in this decade , Bush slashed taxes for the richest Americans .
The results are now apparent in home foreclosures , bankruptcies , crumbling infrastructure and neglected cities , as Michael Moore graphically demonstrated in his new documentary , “ Capitalism : A Love Story . ”
Stalemated But today ’s U.S. political / media process does n’t allow these problems to be seriously addressed .
The Washington conventional wisdom is still shaped by the powerful right - wing think tanks and defined by the vast right - wing news media .
Mainstream journalists mostly go along to save their careers .
Many laid - off “ Joe the Plumbers ” parrot the Right ’s fury about the “ class warfare ” of imposing higher taxes on millionaires .
Other rank - and - file Americans tie teabags to their hats and descend on Washington to participate in anti-government rallies , partly organized by corporate interests .
Over several decades of covering Washington ’s neoconservatives , I have marveled at their cynical but not -entirely - false view of the American people as cattle to be herded , corralled , occasionally stampeded and ultimately led to the slaughterhouse .
The hyped case for war with Iraq was a marvelous example of how the neocons could use lies and deceptions to get young men and women from small towns and big cities across America to go kill – and be killed by – troublesome Arabs in the Middle East , the neocons ’ favorite enemies .
These neocons ’ propaganda successes are directly attributable to their dominance of the Washington echo chamber , where they craft cleverly framed arguments from their positions at influential think tanks and then watch as their messages are amplified across the country by right - wing radio hosts , Fox News , the Internet and an array of print publications , including mainstream outlets like the Washington Post .
Only now – as the unemployment lines stretch , as medical insurance is denied , and as the sheriffs show up with foreclosure notices – are some Americans sensing the end of this strange journey , with the whiff of an unpleasant fate behind the doors of the slaughterhouse .

Male bed bugs get confused in bed .
Now a scientist has found a bug chemical signal that translates , “ Whoa , buddy .
I ’m a guy too . ”
Male bed bugs grasp and try to mate with any other member of their Cimex lectularius species that has had a full meal of blood recently , says chemical ecologist Camilla Ryne of Lund University in Sweden .
Single - minded males do n’t seem inclined , or even able , to distinguish other males from females at first .
At first contact , sex recognition for these insects works largely by trial and error , Ryne says .
What corrects those errors , she has found , is a blend of chemicals that earlier work has also described as the bed bug alarm pheromone .
“ This is the first time to my knowledge that anyone has shown that alarm pheromones are used for sexual recognition , ” Ryne says .
Females can release the substance when disturbed but typically do n’t when grasped by a male , Ryne says .
But males do exude the scent when grabbed by another male .
After a whiff of the stuff , misguided suitors back off , Ryne reports online October 24 in Animal Behaviour .
Considering that bed bugs are making a comeback as a pest in the industrialized world , “ knowing how they mate is important , ” says entomologist Joshua Benoit of Ohio State University in Columbus .
He too has been studying the alarm pheromone , and he agrees that the bugs use it in several ways .
Pheromones may have achieved their fame in popular culture as dizzying lures for the opposite sex , but biologists have discovered plenty of other kinds of pheromones .
Compounds can fuel aggression among male mice or urge baby rabbits to search for a nipple .
Bed bugs release the pheromone blend of the small , volatile molecules ( E ) - 2 - octenal and ( E ) - 2 - hexenal when disturbed , Ryne says .
A mating attempt might indeed be disturbing , since males deliver their sperm by what ’s called traumatic insemination .
They ignore the opening to the female reproductive tract and inject sperm with a needlelike appendage directly through the outer covering of a mate ’s body .
In the abdominal area most commonly pierced , female bed bugs grow a mass of the kinds of cells associated with immune defense .
Males , though , have no extra protection there .
To test the idea that the alarm pheromone helps mistakenly targeted males free themselves , Ryne painted nail polish over the glands that produce the substance , thus blocking its release .
Males that could n’t signal chemically ended up in longer embraces than males dabbed elsewhere with nail polish .
For a different test , Ryne collected the substance by washing disturbed males with a solvent .
When she applied wafted the extract over mating pairs of males and females , the males backed off .
The finding showed that even in the presence of a suitable mate , the signal disturbed the males , she says .
Ryne herself can smell the pheromone , she says .
It ’s a bit like almond , but not particularly pleasant .
“ Older people say that you used to be able to tell whose house had bed bugs because it had a peculiar smell , ” she says .

Another Minneapolis food co-op is on the move .
This time it 's Linden Hills Co-op , which plans to move a little less than a mile to the west to the former location of Sunnyside Market at 3815 Sunnyside Av. , near 44th and France Avenue S .
The move , expected next August , will cost $ 3.5 million and give the store about 50 percent more space than its current location at 2813 W. 43rd St .
A lease was signed last Friday , co-op spokeswoman Jeanne Lakso said .
Financing includes a bank loan , funding from the North Country Cooperative Development Fund , and $ 1.5 million in short - term loans from members .
The terms of those loans would be in the range of 3.5 to 5 percent for four to seven years , Lakso said .
No architect has been hired and no specific plans have been drawn up for the building that last housed a 14,200 - square - foot grocery store , but the co-op expects to have indoor and outdoor seating , more parking than its current location , a larger bakery and deli , a full - service meat and seafood counter , and more products , Lakso said .
It 's the second major expansion of a Minneapolis co-op in recent months , with the Seward Co-op finishing up its first year in a new location on Franklin Avenue .
That move was also partially financed by a $ 1.5 million commitment from members .
The Linden Hills Co-op reported $ 9.2 million in sales in its most recent fiscal year ended June 30 , a 10 percent increase from the previous year .
News of its move was first reported on Twitter by member David Brauer .

One of John Updike ’s novels was titled Memories of the Ford Administration ; needless to say , it was n’t about Gerald Ford — basically it was about sex , because Updike remembered the Carter years as the golden age of extramarital affairs .
Similarly , this post is n’t about Jimmy Carter – it ’s about macroeconomic theory .
( Sorry . )
For the late 1970s was when macroeconomics experienced its great divide .
It ’s a period engrained in the memory of those of us who were young economists at the time , trying to find our own paths .
Yet I have n’t seen a clear explanation of what went down at the time .
So here ’s a sketch , which I hope a serious intellectual historian will fill in someday .
As I remember it , it all began with the Phelps volume : Microeconomic Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory .
The issue these papers tried to resolve is nicely summarized here .
Keynes ( and , for that matter , Milton Friedman ) argued that a decline in aggregate demand due to , say , a fall in the money supply would lead to a fall in employment and output – and experience showed that they were right .
Yet standard microeconomic theory implies that production should respond only to changes in relative prices , not changes in the overall level of prices – and this in turn implies that money should be “ neutral ” : a 20 percent fall in the money supply should lead to a 20 percent fall in the overall price level , but no change in output or employment .
Phelps and others tried to explain why the economy looks so Keynesian in terms of imperfect information : workers and firms respond to a change in the price level as if it were a change in relative prices , because they ca n’t at first tell the difference .
Over time , however , they will realize their mistake – so that , for example , a rise in the inflation rate will reduce unemployment at first , but wo n’t do so on a sustained basis , because eventually inflation will get built into expectations .
So the new theory predicted the emergence of stagflation , a prediction that was duly confirmed .
But where do expectations come from ?
Robert Lucas married Phelps - type models of employment with rational expectations , the view that people in the economy use all available information to make predictions .
And this led to a startling conclusion : anticipated policies have no effect on employment .
Only surprise changes in , say , the money supply matter – which means that you ca n’t use monetary or fiscal policy to stabilize the economy .
The Lucas view took the economics profession by storm – not because there was any solid evidence for it , but because it was so clever , because it led to nice math , because it let macroeconomists give in to their inner neoclassicists .
But by the late 70s it was already clear that rational expectations macro did n’t work .
Why ?
Because people have too much information .
Think about the story of unemployment I ’ve just described .
It ’s a story in which a contraction in the money supply can produce a recession – but only as long as people do n’t know that there ’s a recession !
You see , if people do know that there ’s a recession , they know that the low prices they ’re being offered reflect low overall demand , not specifically low demand for their products .
In Lucas - type models , people were supposed to look at the prices they received , and optimally extract the “ signal ” from the “ noise ” .
The models broke down , however , as soon as you let people have access to any other information – say , by looking at interest rates , or reading a newspaper .
And the reality , of course , is that recessions persist long after everyone knows that there ’s a recession , so that the confusion required by Lucas - type models is long since gone .
I recall a seminar , I think in 1980 , in which Robert Barro was presenting a rational - expectations business cycle model .
Someone asked him how he could reconcile his model with the severe recession taking place as he spoke .
“ I ’m not interested in the latest residual , ” Barro snapped .
But by 1980 or 1981 it was basically clear to everyone that the Lucas project – the attempt to explain the evidently Keynesian behavior of the economy in terms of nothing but imperfect information – had failed .
So what were macroeconomic theorists supposed to do ?
The answer was that they split .
One faction said , in effect , “ OK : we ca n’t explain what we think we see in terms of full maximization .
So we have to assume that there are some limits to maximization – costs of changing prices , bounded rationality , whatever . ”
That faction became New Keynesian , saltwater economics .
The other faction said , in effect , “ OK : we ca n’t explain what we think we see in terms of full maximization .
So we must be interpreting the data wrong – things like changes in the money supply must not be driving recessions , because theory says they can ’t . ”
That faction became real business cycle , freshwater economics .
But here ’s the thing : at this point , the freshwater school no longer remembers any of that – largely because they purged Keynesian and even monetarist thought from their classes .
All they know is that Keynesianism was “ disproved ” , and that none of it – not even New Keynesian models with rational expectations ( an approach which , as Greg Mankiw says , “ provides a rationale for government intervention in the economy , such as countercyclical monetary or FISCAL POLICY . ” ) – is worth listening to .
So that ’s how we got to where we are today .
Cesc Fabregas , Kevin Nolan , Jermaine Beckford and Calvin Zola have been named as October 's star men .
Results of October 's Player of the Month
Premier League
Championship
League One
League Two
OCTOBER WINNERS AT A GLANCE
The results of October 's PFA Fans ' Player of the Month award are in and as usual there are some familiar names among those topping the polls .
To see how you can get involved in the voting for the monthly prizes click here Cesc Fabregas has cause for a double celebration after being named the PFA Fans ' Player of the Month in the Premier League .
The Arsenal skipper capped a fine October by leading his side to a precious victory against arch - rivals Spurs on Saturday - and he did so in fine style .
Fabregas , one of the most consistent players in the Premier League , scored Arsenal 's second in the 3 - 0 win at Emirates Stadium just 11 seconds after the re-start following Robin van Persie 's opener .
Harry Redknapp felt Spurs had gifted Fabregas his goal after a mazy run , and he said of his side 's defending : " Giving Fabregas the ball from the kick - off was Sunday morning football . "
Actually , it was quality Saturday lunchtime football on the part of Fabregas who left three Spurs players , including Ledley King , for dead before firing home .
His outstanding showing on derby day served to underline that he is a worthy recipient of October 's top flight gong .
In the Championship , Newcastle United currently lead the way - and few are more responsible for the Toon 's turnaround in fortunes than all - action midfielder Kevin Nolan .
Nolan was on target twice for the Magpies in October and is the club 's leading scorer with seven .
But there is , and always has been , more to his game than just goals .
His work rate is phenomenal and it is little wonder the Magpies fans love him - hence his award for fans ' player of the month in the Championship .
Jermaine Beckford is never far from the top of the tree when the votes for Fans ' Player of the Month in League One are totted up .
A regular monthly winner last season , and ultimately Fans ' Player of the Year , Beckford 's goals show no sign of drying up .
His strike in the 4 - 0 win over Yeovil at the weekend took his tally for October to three and his total for the season to 11 , and there should be plenty more to come .
Fans '
Player of the Month in League Two goes to Calvin Zola who has been earning plenty of plaudits as Crewe 's player of the moment .
Zola 's two goals in the 4 - 0 win over Cheltenham on Saturday took him into double figures and there will be plenty of clubs higher up the league ladder monitoring his progress between now and January .

For nearly a century , the Anti-Defamation League has stared unflinchingly into the dark corners of America ’s social psyche -- the places where combustible tendencies such as hatred and paranoia pool and , sometimes , burst into flame .
As a Jewish organization , the ADL ’s first preoccupation naturally is anti-Semitism , but in the last few decades it has extended its scrutiny to the whole range of bigoted malevolence -- white supremacy , the militia movement , neo-nativism and conspiratorial fantasies in all of their improbable permutations .
These days , the organization ’s research is characterized by the sense of proportion and sobriety that long experience brings .
That makes its recent report on the extremist groups and propagandists that have emerged since President Obama ’s election -- “ Rage Grows In America : Anti-Government Conspiracies ” -- particularly notable .
For the first time in living memory , the ADL is sounding the alarm about a mainstream media personality : Fox News ’ Glenn Beck , who also hosts a popular radio show .
The report notes that while “ other conservative media hosts , such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity , routinely attack Obama and his administration , typically on partisan grounds , they have usually dismissed or refused to give a platform to the conspiracy theorists and anti-government extremists . ”
By contrast , “ Beck and his guests have made a habit of demonizing President Obama and promoting conspiracy theories about his administration .
...
Beck has even gone so far as to make comparisons between Hitler and Obama . ”

What gives all of this nonsense an ominous twist is Beck ’s announcement that he intends to use his TV and radio shows to promote a mass movement that will involve voter registration drives , training in community organizing and a series of regional conventions that will produce a “ 100 - year plan ” for America to be read from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to a mass rally Aug. 28 .
As Beck wrote on his website , “ I know that the bipartisan corruption in Washington that has brought us to this brink and it will not be defeated easily .
It will require unconventional thinking and a radical plan to restore our nation to the maximum freedoms we were supposed to have been protecting .
...
All of the above will culminate in The Plan , a book that will provide specific policies , principles and , most importantly , action steps that each of us can take to play a role in this Refounding . ”
Hard times predictably throw up their demagogues .
Still , even allowing for the frenetic pace of our wired world ’s 24 - hour news cycle , it ’s remarkable how quickly the arc of Beck ’s career has come to resemble that of the Great Depression ’s uber - demagogue , Father Charles Coughlin .
In the months after the crash of ’ 29 , Coughlin turned what had been a conventionally religious weekly radio broadcast into a platform for championing the downtrodden working man .
He was an early supporter of the New Deal , coining the slogan “ Roosevelt or Ruin , ” but quickly turned on the president for a variety of complex ideological and personal reasons .
Coughlin flirted with Huey Long , launched an unsuccessful political party , published a popular newspaper , Social Justice , and even inspired and supported a kind of militia , the Christian Front , some of whose members were arrested by the FBI and charged with plotting a fascist coup .
As the 1930s dragged on , Coughlin , a longtime admirer of Francisco Franco , became virulently anti-Semitic , isolationist and pro-German .
He also was extraordinarily popular .
At their height , his weekly broadcasts attracted more than 40 million listeners .
Still , after he lashed out at German Jews in the wake of Kristallnacht , many major urban radio stations dropped his program .
Influential American prelates , the Vatican and prominent Catholic New Dealers had worked for some time to persuade Coughlin ’s superior , the archbishop of Detroit , to silence him .
Shortly before the U.S. entered World War II , a new bishop was installed , and Coughlin was ordered to cease broadcasting .
He accepted the clerical discipline and retired into a long life of bitter silence .

It ’s hard to imagine any contemporary cable system dropping Fox News simply because Beck is an offensively dangerous demagogue -- not with his ratings at least .
His new foray into politics , though , presents Rupert Murdoch ’s network with a profound challenge .
Is it willing to become the platform for an extremist political campaign , or will it draw a line as even the authoritarian Catholic Church of the 1940s did ?
CNN recently parted ways with its resident ranter , Lou Dobbs -- who now confirms he ’s weighing a presidential bid .
Does
Fox see a similar problem with Beck -- and , if not , why ?

Update : Professor Calamity on Democracy Now
SteamPunk Magazine author ( and , honestly , the inspiration for SteamPunk Magazine ) Professor Calamity is facing two felonies for allegedly running a twitter account .
He has been accused of running a twitter feed of police movements during the Pittsburgh G - 20 protests , protests for which the police are already being sued .
To add insult to felony charges , they raided his house in NYC for 16 hours , confiscating everything from hammers to computers to SteamPunk Magazine .
Their lawyer has already convinced a judge to put a stop on the police searching of their personal possessions , because the raid is absolutely insane .
Okay , Steampunk , here ’s your chance to prove you ’re a community .
Professor Calamity is one of our founding thinkers .
Even if he was n’t , he ’s one of us , and he ’s facing absolutely batshit bullshit charges and ought to be supported .
I ’m asking that we make this news , because it ought to be news .
This is insane .
Below is a report from one of the people who was present during the house raid in Queens :
On October 1st , 2009 , at 6:00 am , the Joint Terrorism Task Force ( a union of local police departments and the FBI ) , kicked out the front door to our home — an anarchist collective house in Queens , NY , affectionately known as Tortuga .
The first crashes of the battering ram were quickly followed by more upstairs , as the police broke in on 3 sleeping people , destroying bedroom doors that were unlocked .
Three more people , awoken by the most unpleasant means of bounding footsteps , splintering wood , and shouting voices , waited in the basement — their turn at drawn guns and blinding lights came quickly .
We put our hands out where they could see them .
They ordered us out of bed .
They would n’t let us dress , but they did put a random assortment of clothes on some people .
We were handcuffed , and although the upstairs and downstairs groups were kept separate initially , we were soon all together , sitting in the living room , positioned like dolls on the couches and chairs .
We were in handcuffs for several hours , and we were helpless as our little bird , a Finch we had rescued and were rehabilitating , flew out the open door to certain death , after his cage had been battered by the cops in their zeal to open the upstairs bedroom doors by force .
We shouted at them , but they stood there and watched .
And they stood and watched us for hours and hours and hours .
16 hours to be precise , 16 hours of the NYPD and FBI traipsing through our house , confiscating our lives in a fishing expedition related to the G20 protests of September 24th and 25th .
The search warrant , when we were finally allowed to read it , mentioned violation of federal rioting laws and was vague enough to allow the entire house to be searched .
They kept repeating that we were not arrested , that we were free to go .
But being free meant being watched by the FBI , monitored while using the bathroom , not allowed to make phone calls for hours or to observe them ransacking our rooms .
Being free meant they took two of us away on bullshit summonses , and even though this was our house , where we lived , if we left , we could not re-enter .
Three of us stayed to the bitter end .
Three of us stayed to watch the hazmat team come in to investigate a child ’s chemistry set , to see them search the garage on an additional warrant , to sign vouchers for all the things they confiscated as “ evidence ” — Curious George plush toys , artwork , correspondence with political prisoner Daniel McGowan , birth certificates , passports , the entire video archive of a local media collective , tax records , books , computers , storage devices , cell phones , Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs , flags , banners , posters , photographs and more than can be recounted here .
The apparent impetus for this raid came over a week ago , when two members of our household were arrested , once again at gunpoint , in the suburbs of Pittsburgh .
They are accused of being devious masterminds , of “ directing ” the rollicking G - 20 protests , of using technology such as Twitter to “ hinder apprehension ” of protesters .
The two were held on bail , one fetching the ridiculous amount of $ 30,000 cash , and released 36 hours later after the bond was posted .
As of this moment , no additional charges have been levied against the two , nor against any other housemates in the aftermath of the raid .
As anarchists , we are under no illusions about what the State is capable of .
We are not the first anarchists to have our house raided , and unfortunately as long as the State remains , we will not be the last .
We are , along with other targeted individuals like David Japenga , the outlets for the impotent rage the authorities feel when they lose control , as they did during the G - 20 in Pittsburgh .
We , that beautiful we , that include Tortuga House and all who find affinity with us , refuse the rigid forms the authorities try and cram a world bursting with infinite possibilities into —
He is not a leader , she did not act alone , they are not being directed .
Repression is a strategy that the state uses to put us on the defensive , to divert our energies from being a proactive force and instead deal with the terms it has set .
We will not lie and say this has not left us reeling , but as time and our dizziness pass , we know that friends surround us .
Our resolve is strengthened by this solidarity , and we will not be deterred by this state aggression .
We wish to thank all of our friends and comrades who have stood by us in these difficult few days .
Our lawyer filed an injunction on the raid the next morning ( October 2nd ) that was surprisingly granted - it forbids the authorities from fishing through our belongings until we head back to court on the 16th .
In the weeks and months to come we will do our best to share developments as they occur .

Election watchdog org demands accountability and the return of millions in fraudulently collected tax - payer dollars ...
Emily Levy Byon

Guest Blogged by Emily Levy of VelvetRevolution.us
Notorious electronic voting company Diebold , which has been hiding its election division under the name Premier Election Solutions , has bilked California taxpayers out of more than $ 100 million dollars for its failed , faulty , illegally certified electronic voting systems .
Velvet Revolution has now launched a new campaign : Diebold : Return Our Money ! at DieboldReturnOurMoney.com and we hope you 'll sign on in support .
California officials recently discovered that ALL of Diebold / Premier 's voting systems violate federal , and thus state , certifications guidelines !
These systems do some or all of the following in violation of those certification standards and laws :
delete ballots without notice
allow the " permanent " audit log records to be deleted
fail to properly record deletion of ballots
insert incorrect time stamps on audit log items .
Yet Diebold has falsely claimed , for years , they their systems meet all federal voting system standards .
Accordingly , VR demands that :
1 ) DIEBOLD : RETURN OUR MONEY !:
Diebold / Premier has accepted well over $ 100 million in county , state and federal taxpayer funds in California for services which the company knew it could not perform .
With California 's devastating budget shortfall of $ 45.5 billion dollars , we demand the return of these funds from Diebold .
The purchase price for hardware , software licenses , and maintenance fees should be returned to the State within 90 days .
If Diebold 's announced sale to Election Systems and Software , Inc. ( ES&S ) becomes final , California must be fully reimbursed nonetheless , whether from Diebold or ES&S .
2 ) SOS DEBRA BOWEN : DECERTIFY DIEBOLD !: Diebold / Premier products , currently used in 20 California counties ( and some 34 states across the country , by the way ) , violate federal voting system standards and must be immediately and permanently decertified for use in the state by Secretary of State Debra Bowen .
3 ) AG JERRY BROWN : PROSECUTE DIEBOLD !: California 's Attorney General Jerry Brown must immediately launch a comprehensive criminal investigation into Diebold / Premier 's knowing use and sale of faulty election systems that have undermined our elections .
Further , unless Diebold / Premier , within 90 days , refunds to California all monies paid for its fraudulent software and equipment , we call on the State of California to file suit against Diebold / Premier seeking the return of funds for breach of contract and fraud .
Visit the campaign page at DieboldReturnOurMoney.com to send a quick email to Diebold ( c/o the aptly - named company rep Chris Riggall ) , SoS Bowen and AG Brown .
Over 400 emails have already been sent in the first 48 hours of this campaign ...
As you may have heard , Diebold has recently been purchased by ES&S , its larger competitor .
This purchase adds to the myriad problems with electronic voting yet another : one company 's near monopoly on the industry .

A treasure trove of 4.4 - million - year - old fossils from the Ethiopian desert is dramatically overturning widely held ideas about the early evolution of humans and how they came to walk upright , even as it paints a remarkably detailed picture of early life in Africa , researchers reported Thursday .
The centerpiece of the diverse collection of primate , animal and plant fossils is the near - complete skeleton of a human ancestor that demonstrates our earliest forebears looked nothing like a chimpanzee or other large primate , as is now commonly believed .
Instead , the findings suggest that the last common ancestor of humans and primates , which existed nearly 2 million years earlier , was a primitive creature that shared few traits with modern - day members of either group .
The findings , analyzed in a large group of studies published Thursday in the journal Science , also indicate that our ancestors began walking upright in woodlands , not on grassy savannas as prior generations of researchers had speculated .
The discovery of the specimen called Ardipithecus ramidus “ is one of the most important discoveries for the study of human evolution , ” said paleoanthropologist David Pilbeam of Harvard University , who was not involved in the research .
“ The find itself is extraordinary , as were the enormous labors that went into the reconstruction of a skeleton shattered almost beyond repair , ” he said in an e-mailed statement .

“ It is so rare to get a more or less complete skeleton , ” said paleoanthropologist Andrew Hill of Yale University .
“ In the entire course of human evolution , at least until you get to Neanderthals , there are only three to four available .
We can always tell so much more from a skeleton ” than from the jawbones and skulls that are more commonly found .
The fossils described in the new studies were found 15 years ago in the Afar Triangle of Ethiopia by a team led by paleoanthropologist Tim White of UC Berkeley .
But White and his team have been relatively closemouthed about the fossils , and other researchers -- some of whom have accused him of hoarding the fossils for his own use -- have been eagerly awaiting more information .
Today , they are getting a surfeit : Eleven papers by 47 authors , and a similar number of short summaries prepared by each paper ’s authors .
The fossils were found in a layer of sediment sandwiched between two layers of volcanic ash , each dating from 4.4 million years ago -- indicating that the fossils are also of that age .

In addition to the nearly complete fossil specimen of the female primate , which investigators have dubbed Ardi , the team found more than 100 fossils from 36 other members of the same species .
“ These fossils are much more important than Lucy , ” the 3.2 - million - year - old specimen of Australopithecus afarensis that was found in the Afar desert in the 1970s , said paleoanthropologist Alan Walker of Pennsylvania State University , who was not involved in the research .
“ The reason is that when Lucy was found , we already knew the major features of Australopithecus from fossils found in the 1940s .
. . .
These fossils are of a completely unknown creature , and are much stranger and more primitive than Australopithecus . ”
The White team also found fossils of 29 species of birds , primarily small ones like doves , lovebirds , mousebirds , passerines and swifts , as well as several that were previously unknown .
Animal fossils included 20 new species of small mammals , including shrews , bats , rodents , hares and small carnivores , as well as larger animals , including baboons , colobus monkeys and spiral - horned antelopes .
Fossilized wood , seed and other plant remains indicate the presence of hackberry , fig and palm trees .
Collectively , these finds indicate that the environment was more humid and cooler than it is today , and contained grassy woodland with forest patches .

Today , the Afar is a desert .
But go back in a time machine and “ 4.4 million years ago , this was really a different world , ” White said .
“ We look up in the trees and we see that they are full of monkeys .
We look around on the ground and we see that there are a lot of kudus .
And we see an occasional hyena .
And we see elephants and we see lots of small mammals . ”
This whole collection of data “ gives us information we have never had before about human evolution , ” said paleoanthropologist C. Owen Lovejoy of Kent State University , one of the primary authors of the papers .
“ The whole savanna theory goes out the window in terms of it being the explanation for upright walking .
. . .
And the idea that we evolved from something like a chimpanzee also goes out the window . ”
Ardi stood about 47 inches tall and probably weighed 110 pounds .
Many researchers previously believed that such an early ancestor would , like modern chimps , be a knuckle - walker , using the knuckles for support while moving on all fours .
Instead , Ardi appears to have climbed on all fours on branches , but walked upright on the ground .
Her feet , like those of monkeys but not chimps , were designed more for propulsion than for grasping .
Her face had a projecting muzzle , giving her an ape - like appearance , but many features of her skull , such as the ridge above the eye socket , are quite different than those of chimpanzees .
Her brain is about the same size as Lucy’s .

Her hands lacked many of the specializations that allow modern - day African apes to swing , hang and easily move through trees .
Those specializations apparently evolved in large primates after they separated from the last common ancestor with humans more than 6 million years ago .
( Few fossils of such primates are available because they lived primarily in forests , which are not conducive to preservation of bone . )
The finds “ are turning evolution on its head , ” Lovejoy said .
The most controversial aspects of the papers involve the authors ’ -- particularly Lovejoy ’s -- interpretations of what the fossils say about behavior .
Of particular importance , he said , is that the sizes of males and females were about the same , and that the specimens do not have large , sharp canine teeth .
Both findings suggest that the fierce , often violent competition among males for females in heat that characterizes gorillas and chimpanzees was absent in Ardipithecus .
That implies , Lovejoy concluded , that the males were beginning to enter into monogamous relationships with females and devoted more time to caring for their young than did earlier ancestors .

“ This is a restatement of Owen Lovejoy ’s ideas going back almost three decades , which I found unpersuasive then and still do , ” Pilbeam said .
Hill was more blunt , calling Lovejoy ’s speculation “ patent nonsense . ”

RocketModeler III Version 1.2h Glenn
Research
Center
This is a beta 1.2h version of the RocketModeler III program .
If you find errors in the program or would like to suggest improvements , please send an e-mail to Thomas .J.Benson@nasa.gov .
The RocketModeler II and the original RocketModeler program , written by Eric Bishop , are also still available , if you prefer older versions of the program .
Due to IT security concerns , many users are currently experiencing problems running NASA Glenn educational applets .
The applets are slowly being updated , but it is a lengthy process .
If you are familiar with Java Runtime Environments ( JRE ) , you may want to try downloading the applet and running it on an Integrated Development Environment ( IDE ) such as Netbeans or Eclipse .
The following are tutorials for running Java applets on either IDE :
Netbeans
Eclipse
Other problems may occur while running the applet due to it being outdated .
Until it is updated , HERE is another application that demonstrates the simulator .
This page contains an interactive Java applet to explore the various factors which affect the flight of a model rocket .
All of the information presented by the applet are available within the Beginner 's Guide to Rockets .
You should start with the slide describing the parts of a full scale rocket .
RocketModeler III
With this software you can investigate how a rocket flies by changing the values of different design variables .
RocketModeler III ( RM - III ) is an extension of RocketModeler II ( RM - II ) Version 2.1f .
RM-III retains all of the functionality of RM - II , but the user can now have the program calculate a drag coefficient for your design .
The value for the drag coefficient is determined by a table look - up algorithm that was developed and programmed by Anthony Vila , a student intern from Vanderbilt University in the summer of 2009 .
The data used in the tables was obtained by wind tunnel testing conducted by Marie McGraw and Alexandra Bello as part of an extended shadowing experience in the spring of 2008 , just prior to their graduation from Magnificat High School in Rocky River , Ohio .
There are two versions of RM - III which require different levels of experience with the package , knowledge of aerodynamics , and computer technology .
This web page contains the on - line student version of the program .
It includes an on - line user 's manual which describes the various options available in the program and includes hyperlinks to pages in the Beginner 's Guide to Rockets describing the math and science of rockets .
More experienced users can select a version of the program which does not include these instructions and loads faster on your computer .
You can download these versions of the program to your computer by clicking on this yellow button :
With the downloaded version , you can run the program off - line and do not have to be connected to the Internet .
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
If you see only a grey box at the top of this page , be sure that Java is enabled in your browser .
If Java is enabled , and you are using the Windows XP operating system , you may need to get a newer version of Java .
Go to this link : http://www.java.com/en/index.jsp, try the " Download It Now " button , and then select " Yes " when the download box from Sun pops up .
This program is designed to be interactive , so you have to work with the program .
There are several different types of input " widgets " which you use to send and receive information from the program and to change the analysis and display results :
Information is presented to you using labels .
A label has a descriptive word displayed in a colored box .
Some labels give instructions for the next phase of design and launch , some labels express the state of the calculations .
Green " Go " labels on the Mission Control Panel indicate that everything is ready for launch .
Red " No - Go " labels indicate that a process has not been completed or that a problem has been encountered .
Problems are described in the text boxes located below the " Stability " status .
A Yellow " ? " indicates that the program does not have sufficient information to determine safety of your rocket : launch at your own risk .
For certain types of rockets , you can Orange " Override " the " Stability " status and launch .
Some of your selections are made by using a choice box .
A choice box has a descriptive word displayed and an arrow at the right of the box .
To make a choice , click on the arrow , hold down and drag to make your selection from the menu which is displayed .
Some selection are made by using the buttons on the panels .
To activate a button move your cursor over the button and click your mouse .
The different colored buttons have different effects :
Blue buttons are option buttons which you can select .
Most option buttons turn Yellow to indicate your current selection .
White buttons are processes which you must complete in order to launch your rocket .
Clicking on a process button causes the button to turn Yellow and a process input panel is opened at the lower right .
You indicate that the process is complete by pushing the white " GO " button on the input panel .
The " GO " button turns Green and the process label next to the process button indicates a Green " GO " when you are successful .
If the program detects some problem with your design , such as insufficient thrust or an unstable configuration , the process button will display a Red " No - Go " label .
You should have all process labels green and " Go " in " Mission Control " before you launch your rocket .
Based on user request , we have relaxed this condition and you can launch with Stability in a yellow " ? " status , or an Orange " Override " status .
You can use the Orange " RESET " button to return the program to its intial conditions at any time .
On each input panel , the current value of a design variable is presented to you in a text box .
Different colored boxes have different meanings : A white box with black numbers is an input box and you can change the value of the number .
To change the value in an input box , select the box by moving the cursor into the box and clicking the mouse , then backspace over the old number , enter a new number , then hit the Enter key on your keyboard .
You must hit Enter to send the new value to the program .
A black box with colored numbers is an output box and the value is computed by the program .
Orange numbers indicate trouble .
If the Cg or Cp output is orange , your rocket is unstable and you must change the design .
If the Weight output is orange , you have insufficient thrust to lift the rocket and you must either decrease the weight or increase the thrust .
For most input variables you can also use a slider , located next to the input box , to change the input value .
To operate the slider , click on the slider bar , hold down and drag the slider bar , or you can click on the arrows at either end of the slider .
If you experience difficulties when using the sliders to change variables , simply click away from the slider and then back to it .
If the arrows on the end of the sliders disappear , click in the areas where the left and right arrow Images should appear , and they should reappear .
SCREEN LAYOUT
The program screen is divided into three main parts :
On the upper right of the screen are the control buttons and labels .
The program has been constructed to simulate the processes that occur for real rockets including the design of the rocket , adding fuel to the rocket , setting the conditions at the launch pad , and finally launching the rocket .
There are buttons at the top of the program on the right for each of these processes within the " Mission Control " portion of the panel .
The particular process that you are currently working is colored " yellow " .
As the processes are sucessfully completed , the label to the right of the button changes from red " No - Go " to green " Go " condition .
All of the Mission Control labels should be " Go " to launch your rocket .
On the right of the screen are the input sliders and boxes that you use to change your design or to set flight conditions .
Details of the Input Variables are given below .
On the left of the screen is the graphics window in which you will see your rocket design , the test flight , and output data .
Details are given in Graphics .
GRAPHICS
You move the graphic within the view window by moving your cursor into the window , hold down the left mouse button and drag to a new location .
You can change the size of the graphic by moving the " Zoom " widget in the same way .
If you loose your picture , or want to return to the default settings , click on the " Find " button at the bottom of the view window .
The grid behind your design is toggled on or off by using the " Grid " button located above the Zoom widget .
There are three main graphics displays : During the " Design " and " Fuel " processes you see the design graphics .
As you change any input variable , like the tube length or fin geometry , the graphic changes .
There are two colored circles on the rocket .
The yellow circle is the location of the center of gravity ( Cg ) .
The black circle is the location of the center of pressure ( Cp ) .
The location of the Cg and Cp change during design and fueling .
For a stable rocket , keep the Cp below the Cg .
When the white " Fuel " button is pushed , the graphic includes some information about the propulsion system of your rocket .
The form of the graphic depends on the type of rocket .
During the " Pad " and " Launch " processes the graphic changes to display the flight graphics .
The location and orientation of the rocket is displayed during flight , although the rocket is not drawn to scale with the grid and surroundings .
After a successful flight you can save the flight trajectory by clicking the " Save " button below the zoom widget .
You can save 5 flights for comparisons .
You can erase all the saved trajectories with the " Clear " button .
During the flight you have two viewing options .
The default is the " Tracking Mode " option which keeps the rocket centered in the view window during the flight .
The zoom widget is disabled during tracking mode .
The other viewing option keeps the view fixed on the ground .
The " Find " button takes you to the launch pad .
Use the zoom widget and the graphic movement to examine the entire flight trajectory with this option .
Viewing options are toggled using the " Track " button located below the graphics window .
The blue " Data " button on the " Launch " input panel displays output graphics in the view window .
Data is displayed as " strip charts " of thrust , weight , drag , velocity , and height .
Depending on the rocket type , some of these variables do not change .
The horizontal grid increments are 1 second on the strip charts .
You return to the flight mode graphics by clicking the " View " button on the " Launch " input panel .
INPUT VARIABLES
Input variables are located on the right side of the screen .
You first select the type of rocket by using the blue buttons near the top of the screen : A Ballistic projectile is an object which has no propulsion system and is shot into the air at some initial velocity .
Gravity eventually brings the object back to the surface .
Ballistic objects have only one input panel which is located at the lower right .
You can select several different types of objects by using the choice box at the upper right of the input panel .
A representative weight , cross-sectional area , and drag coefficient ( Cd ) are then loaded onto the input panel .
You can reset these values as described above .
The launch speed must also be specified before launch .
You then click " GO " to complete the design and move to the launch pad .
An Air rocket is a special case of a ballistic projectile .
The weight and drag of the compressed air rocket is determined by your design and a check is made for rocket stability .
The fuel for the air rocket is compressed air .
You increase the pressure of the air by using a pump .
The program computes the launch speed based on an integration of Newton 's second law .
The launch speed depends on the length of the launch tube .
A Water rocket uses a plastic soda bottle for the body of the rocket .
You can choose between a 2 - liter bottle , 24 oz bottle , or 20 oz bottle by using the blue buttons on the input panel .
The yellow button indicates your choice .
You design the other parts of the rocket , including the nose cone and fins .
The fuel for the water rocket is water which is pressurized by an air pump .
You specify the amount of water , the air pressure , the diameter of the nozzle and the length of the launch tube .
Because water is forced out of the nozzle under pressure , the weight of the rocket and the stability of the rocket changes during the flight .
The Solid rocket is powered by a solid rocket engine that you purchase from a hobby store .
You design the shape of the rocket and the program checks for stability .
You fuel the rocket by selecting the number and type of rocket engine .
The thrust characteristics of many types of engines are modeled in the program .
During rocket Design , you have four choices of input panels ; Nose , Payload , Body , and Fins .
You select the input panel by using the blue buttons located above the graphics window on the left .
You can select to have the program calculate the weight and the drag coefficient of the rocket , or you can input the values .
You select the " Calc " or " Input " option using choice buttons on the Mission Control panel located next to the " Cd " and " LO Weight " displays .
The values of these parameters are input on the " Body " design input panel .
The weight that you input is the empty weight ( lift - off weight minus the weight of the fuel ) .
Because you are specifiying the empty weight of the entire rocket , and not the weight of each component , the program cannot determine the location of the Cg or the stability of the rocket .
If you select " Calc " , you must select the material for the part being designed by using the choice button at the top of the panel .
The density of the material is shown to the left of the choice button and is used in computation of the weight of the part .
The weight of the part affects the location of the center of gravity and the stability of the rocket .
There are input sliders and boxes on each panel which change the geometry of each part :
On the Nose panel , you can select the shape by using the choice box at the top .
For each shape , you can change the vertical length of the nose and the base diameter of the nose .
The program calculates the area and volume of the nose which is then used in the weight calculation .
At the bottom of the Nose input panel , you can select the type of recovery system by using the choice box and you can add ballast weight to the nose to keep Cg above Cp .
The nose drag coefficient is determined from the drag tables in the program .
When you finish the nose design you can select another part by using the blue buttons , or you can click " GO " to complete the design .
The Payload panel is used to design the section between the nose and the body of the rocket .
The payload sits inside of a tube , and you can specify the the weight of the payload by using the box and slider on the input panel .
Because many students use an egg as a payload , you can quickly select the weight and size of an egg payload with the choice button .
As before , you can vary the length and the diameter of the payload tube .
As the payload diameter is varied , the nose diameter is also changed , and the area , volume , and weight of the payload is calculated .
On most rockets there is a fairing or transition section between the payload and the body tube .
You can vary the length and material of the fairing .
When you finish the payload design you can select another part by using the blue buttons , or you can click " GO " to complete the design .
The Body panel is used to size the body tube of the rocket .
You can specify the length and diameter of the tube for the air rocket and the solid rocket .
For the solid rocket , the program insures that the tube diameter is large enough to hold the engine .
For all types of rockets you can add a fairing to the bottom of the rocket .
The exit diameter of the fairing is the nozzle diameter .
A fairing reduces the amount of base drag of your rocket .
You can choose to have the program calculate the drag coeffcient of the rocket , or you can choose to input your own value .
If the choice is " User Input " an input box and slider appear on the Body panel for you to set a value .
When you finish the body tube design you can select another part by using the blue buttons , or you can click " GO " to complete the design .
The Fins panel is used to design the shape and number of stability fins .
You can choose a trapezoidal or an elliptical class of geometry .
Rectangles , squares , rhombuses , and triangles are included in the trapezoidal class ; circles are a special case of the elliptical class .
You specify the location of the fins along the body tube as measured from the bottom of the rocket .
You also specify the length of the fin root along the tube , and the width of the fin from the surface of the tube .
For the trapezoidal class , you can specify the leading edge ( L.E. ) angle and the trailing edge ( T.E. ) angle as measured from the horizontal .
When you finish the fin design you can select another part by using the blue buttons , or you can click " GO " to complete the design .
After the rocket is designed , you use the Fuel input panel to specify the propulsion system inputs .
The type of input panel depends on the type of rocket .
A Ballistic object has no fuel , so the input panel is the same as the design panel .
An Air rocket has a pump with a beginning and ending volume that can be used to compute the pressure in the rocket .
You can choose to input the pressure by using the choice button on the input panel .
The pump pressure and length of the launch tube determines the launch velocity .
A Water rocket is filled to some level with water and then pumped to some launching pressure before launch .
You select the volume of water , the pump pressure , and the length of the launch tube and the program computes the weight of the water and the lift off ( LO ) thrust .
You must have lift off thrust greater than weight in order to launch .
For the Solid rocket , small solid rocket engines are inserted in the rocket .
The thrust and weight characteristics of these engines are described on a separate page .
With solid rockets , you can also choose a two - stage or clustered configuration of multiple engines .
When you finish fueling you click " GO " and proceed to the launch " Pad " .
On the launch Pad input panel you specify the flight conditions for your rocket .
The default location of your launch pad is on the Earth at sea level .
You may also launch from an " ideal " Earth , where there is gravity but no drag , or from the Moon , where there is no drag and 1/6th of the Earth 's gravity , or from Mars , where there is reduced drag and roughly 1/3rd of the Earth 's gravity .
You may change the altitude of the launch pad and the wind conditions on Earth or Mars .
You may choose to model the effects of weather cocking on the launch by using the choice box on the input panel .
And finally , you select the angle from the vertical and the length of the launch rail .
When you finish selecting your flight conditions click " GO " and proceed to " Launch " control .
If your rocket is unstable , or has insufficient thrust , pushing the Launch button will have no effect ; you will not see the Launch input panel displayed .
You will have to modify your design or generate more thrust .
The boxes below the " Stability " label will help you determine the problem .
We also color code the cg , cp , weight and lift off thrust to help you determine the problem .
For Water rockets , the cg changes during the launch as water is expelled from the rocket .
For this type of rocket , a yellow " Override " button will appear if the rocket is unstable .
Pushing this button allows you to continue continue on to launch .
On the Launch input panel you have a white button to " Fire " the rocket .
As the countdown begins , the button turns yellow , then green during the flight , and finally red after touchdown .
During the flight , the time and telemetry information changes .
You can interrupt the flight by pushing the blue " Pause " button .
You can then proceed a time step at a time by pushing the white " Step " button , or resume the flight by pushing " Resume " .
When your flight is finished , you can " Reset " the same flight conditions and shoot again by using the blue button , or you can re-fuel or change flight conditions .
At any time you can " Abort " the mission .
At the bottom of the " Launch Control " panel , the current and maximum values of the height , speed , and range ( distance from the launch pad ) are displayed .
The current value of thrust , weight , and drag are also displayed .
If a Water rocket is being launched , the instantaneous pressure and fuel weight inside the bottle are also displayed .
Have fun !

SAO PAULO ( Reuters ) -
In Brazil , famed for its tiny bikinis and carefree attitude , a university student has been expelled after violent protests by students outraged at the short outfit she wore on campus .
The Universidade Bandeirante ( Uniban ) said it had expelled the student , Geysi Villa Nova Arruda , 20 , for “ flagrant disrespect of ethical principles , academic dignity and morality , ” in a statement published in some Sunday newspapers .
Her dress sparked student protests on October 22 in this largely Roman Catholic country .
A video showed Arruda sitting in a classroom in a mid- thigh length red dress , then six military police officers protecting her as she left the campus wearing a white jacket .
A line of students stood by chanting “ whore . ”
Another video showed a mob stopping and kicking her car and blocking her when she tried to escape on foot .
Comments on Brazilian websites pointed out the irony of the hatred directed at Arruda by fellow students in a nation obsessed with physical beauty and said the university ’s actions were unfair .
“ Pure hypocrisy ... Once February and the Carnival comes round everyone will be naked and no one will find it abnormal , ” said one comment posted by a reader on the O Globo news website .
Uniban said it had also suspended a number of students identified by video footage and witness accounts of taking part in the violence last month .
The university ’s legal advisor said Arruda had been expelled for “ gestures ” and “ attitudes ” she had manifested rather than because of her short outfits .
He would not give details .

Shanghai Government requests Residents to not wear Pajamas in public
[ Netease ]
“ Not going outside wearing pajamas ” .
This is Shanghai city government ’s request for the residents of the city prior to the 2010 Shanghai World Expo .
However this provoked widespread controversy .
On one hand , wearing pajamas does not conform to international etiquette , but there are voices also advocating that if the government makes a rule restricting wearing pajamas , then society loses some of its freedom .
Since late July , committee head Shen Guofang ’s ( 沈国芳 ) had one more thing on his work list : to persuade the community residents not to wear pajamas when they go outside .
Shen is the “ Alley President ” of Shanghai Pudong New Area Changlidong road Qiba residential community .
At this stage , his work is divided into two parts , one is managing residential district daily affairs , and the second is “ Welcoming the World Expo ” .
The activity of “ Not going outside wearing pajamas , become a World Expo civilized person ” is one of the elements in the second part .
Everyone has been to Shanghai knows that people of Shanghai have the habit of wearing pajamas in public .
They can be seen in the alleys , farmers markets , supermarkets , streets even the famous shopping street Nanjing road .
Lady wearing patterned pajamas , and a pair of fairly sophisticated leather shoes , goes to buy a pack of slat in the alley , or with her hair full of pin curls taking out the trash .
This is seen as a typical picture of Shanghai culture .
However , when the bulldozers run over every alley , people still remember the old way of life , but the remaining pajamas habit suddenly becomes an enemy of “ the civilized ” .
The upcoming 2010 Shanghai World Expo , an event that represents modern civilization can no longer tolerate the ordinary people ’s “ bad habits ” .
Only two or three stops away from the World Expo site , Qiba residential community along with all the Expo areas in Pudong , will be sized up using standards of “ modern civility ” .
Shanghai residents must survive the stares of international eyes , “ This is an issue of our country ’s face . ”
Shen Guofang said .
Qiba residential district ’s “ civilized dress persuasion team ” has activities twice a week , each is one to two hours .
Shen Guofang said that the persuasion team has 10 volunteers , each wearing a red silk belt .
They are dressed neatly and stand at the entrance of the residential community .
When they see residents going outside wearing pajamas , volunteers approach the residents and dissuade them from going out like that .
“ The volunteers we have chosen are residents who have relatively high awareness , love the residential community and care more about the World Expo . ”
Shen Guofang said .
“ In just over an hour , hundreds of residents already accepted our persuasion , this event was very effective ” Qiba ’s website recorded the “ achievement ” of the first day of the activity .
The activity has been carried out for more than two months now , “ with good results , the number of people wearing pajamas outside has obviously been reduced . ”
Shen was satisfied .
For those who turn back the other way once they see the persuasion team , Shen thought that “ avoid avoid ” also shows improvement , at least they have civilized consciousness .
Around the same time , Pudong new district World Expo site ’s neighborhood committees all cracked down on the dress issue .
Shanggang community , Chuanxin community and Beicai community and so on , all carried out similar activities .
Su Meizhi ( 苏美芝 ) is one of the members of the “ civilized dress persuasion team ” .
She is in charge of the women and family planning ( China ’s policy of only one child per family ) in the neighborhood committee .
Prior to engaging in the persuasion work , Su Meizhi said she herself had the habit of wearing pajamas going outside .
But after persuasion team training , she paid more attention to her dress code , also persuaded her family not to wear pajamas going outside .
Neighborhood staff have changed their views , and then are persuading more people to change their views as well .
However years of habit is not easy to shake .
So , Shen Guofang thought of many creative ways .
One of them is to incorporate children to join the volunteer team during summer breaks .
“ They hold their uncle and aunt ’s hands and say ‘ auntie ( uncle ) , you cannot wear pajamas to go out on the street . ’
When people hear this they usually are very moved , for even children are persuading them and they feel more embarrassed . ”
Second is to emphasize the seriousness and significance of the World Expo in order to achieve a deterrent effect .
“ During the World Expo , the foreigners will come out from events holding their cameras into residential areas , it is very possible they will come to our community . ”
“ We are the masters .
Even small things when putting on the table become big deal ” , we cannot disgrace Shanghai .
Number three , use acquaintances and pay attention to the choice of words .
“ If you are too serious when talking to people about this issue , people sometimes cannot accept . ”
Shen Guofang said .
In this regard , his approach is to “ sidetrack ” and “ joke ” .
For example , up ahead comes an old acquaintance wearing pajamas , Shen Guofang will go up and say “ Hey , where are you going ah ? ” “ To buy food ah ? ” “ Huh , how come you come out wearing these ? ”
“ Ca n’t wear this next time anymore , this clothes does n’t look good , go back and change . ”
The tact is based on circling around and then going back to the subject of wearing pajamas .
Su Meizhi even works outside of her hours .
For some residents , her first attempts to change their minds would fail , but she would repeatedly talk to them , and reason with them privately ; of course , her tone was soft , and her face was with a smile .
“ In an international metropolis , the least you can do is to dress well .
It ’s not that you must wear brand name , but you must be dignified , and make a clear distinction between inside and outside ( of your home ) , this can be an indicator of the quality of the residents . ”
Su Meizhi said .
What ’s been taken off is not pajamas , it ’s freedom
“ None of your business ! ”
“ You are interfering too much ! ”
When asked about their views on “ not going outside wearing pajamas ” , some Shanghai aunties still stumbled their feet .
Although the neighborhood was positive about the work at the present stage but they also accepted the fact that some residents had difficulty to change their habits .
“ These things simply do not need to be exaggerated .
The World Expo is hosted in every country , what is the point being so excessive ! ”
Across street from Qiba , in Changsi community building number 37 , there is a resident woman often complained , her tone mixed with anger and impatience .
In the evening , she was dressed in teddy bear pajamas , a pair of leather sandals and went out to buy bread .
The street between Qiba community and Changsi community had a small supermarket , bank , clothing store , snack store , restaurants , pharmacy , stationery store and a farmers market etc .
Residents only walk a few steps to buy various items required .
Many Shanghainese do not understand , why are they required to change out of their pajamas when going shopping in front of their homes ?
I remember back the days in the movie “ Sleepless Town ” , wearing pajamas when going outside showed social status .
Let ’s imagine : a young lady just going outside to buy a lottery ticket , and she is required to change into her work shirt ; a man who works in a state - owned office during his day off , wants to buy the newspaper “ Everyone ” but discovered it is sold out at the newsstand in front of his house .
He forgets he is wearing pajamas , walks 2 more blocks on the street to find newspaper ; a middle aged woman wearing a huge hair clip is too lazy to cook for herself , so she walks to the farmers market to get some noodles , ( the woman speaks in Shanghainese ) “ do n’t want to change clothes for that . ”
There are a wide variety of views , so making Shanghainese taking off their pajamas is like taking off their Shanghai style !
Their reasons for going outside wearing pajamas seem to be reasonable : going somewhere not so far , not a formal occasion , not staying outside for too long .
Living facilities around the residence are closely integrated , also makes the argument more valid .
“ If anyone dresses up to go to the vegetable market , they will be the ones who stand out . ”
In their eyes , lazy nature living is part of the Shanghai Style .
While the habit of wearing pajamas is long and strong , it is a culture label .
In the old society , two types of people usually wear pajamas in public .
One is rich people , showing off their leisurely lifestyle .
The other is people of entertainment , such as dancers , to display charm .
After the founding of PRC , pajamas gained more popularity .
In the 70’s Shanghai pajamas on the streets became the city scenery , it was a fashionable trend , “ pajamas are beautiful ; ” “ pajamas show our more comfortable lives . ”
These were the thoughts of people who followed the trend at the time .
After the ear of pajamas being trendy , what was left became habit , plus the traditional living space was small , so the convenient pajamas stayed .
The most traditional residential buildings in Shanghai were the Shikumen or the alley housing .
Alleys crowded with residents are just like what it is described in “ 72 tenants , ” “ Rooms were small like the white pigeon holes , it was like the tenants were living in a cage ” .
Whether you knew each other or not , each household pulled a curtain and declared their own space .
There was no clear distinction between public space and private space , therefore people ’s clothes were not categorized as such .
In Stephen Chow ’s movie “ Kongfu hustle ” the “ Pig cage village ” is such scene .
The landlady played by Yuan Qiu had a head full of perm rollers , and her plump body was wrapped in large oversized pajamas .
That ’s right , this is how everyone remembered the most common dress of an auntie in the Shanghai alley .
“ Shanghai Online ” ( www.online.sh.cn) had a survey with the title “ Shanghainese love to wear pajamas on the street , what do you think ? ” ( Started at July 20th 2009 ) survey result showed the most common view was “ low class , uncivil ” , but only had 42.03 % of the votes .
“ Very normal , not uncivil , it ’s just convenient ” had 33.95 % of the votes , and “ Shanghainese wearing pajamas on the street is very normal , if you are not use to looking at it , then stop looking at it . ” had 24.02 % of the votes .
So more than half of the people do not oppose wearing pajamas .
As a native of Shanghai , Li Hoiyan is one of the people who do not oppose wearing pajamas on the street .
She lived in the alleys for nearly 14 years .
Although Li feels her aunties wearing pajamas outside is a bit indecent , but that familiar and warm feeling also makes her like it .
As for the Qiba ’s civilized persuasion activities Li Hoiyan thinks that they are making a fuss over nothing , that it ’s “ a bit silly ” , “ Do I need someone to manage what I wear ? ”
Also “ just because of the World Expo to engage in such activity is a bit fake . ”
As for the issue of shame , this native Shanghainese born in the 80’s said “ As long as we ( people of Shanghai ) do not feel ashamed ourselves , then we are not causing anyone to lose face .
I guess the people ( who made this proposal ) , experts and officials all are not Shanghainese . ”
A number of netizens also opposed the civilized dress persuasion activities .
A post on Tianya discussed the Shanghai pajama - wearing custom .
Some netizens after watching the news on persuasion activities said , “ Manyold grannies were not wearing pajamas , just some loose and relaxed clothes .
A gang of neighborhood committee people then surrounded and criticized granny .
It was unfair . ”
It seems that the Shanghai World Expo modern civility has to face the most powerful opponent : freedom of dress code .
Forcing into shape the citizen ’s characters ?
This tug of war on the dress issue of Shanghai has been around for a few years now .
A resident at Qiba community named Ju still remembered clearly when the mayor Yu Zhengshen ( 俞正声 ) was interviewed by the Hong Kong reporter Wu xiaoli ( 吴小莉 ) .
He recalled the mayor saying , “ Organizing the World Expo has three planed programs , in comparison with the plans of restoring city ’s appearance and improving city services , the progress on civilizing Shanghai residents was too slow .
Wearing pajamas was one of the bad habits Mayor Yu was talking about .
The president of Institute for Social Development , Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences Yang Xiong ( 杨雄 ) in 2006 conducted the “ Shanghai Family Survey ” , the survey showed that “ the phenomena of wearing pajamas outside has not been significantly improved .
16.5 % of the people said they or family members often wear pajamas going outside , 25 % said sometimes . ”
The seriousness of the problem of wearing pajamas had been repeatedly mentioned .
After the publication of the report , it has been widely cited in the international media , which makes Yang Xiong feel that Shanghai ’s pajamas might damage its international image .
A foreign student in Shanghai went to him and said his mother saw this report in England and said she was very surprised “ People in Shanghai still wear pajamas going outside ” .
the mother had said and then showed the newspapers to the foreign student in Shanghai .
“ Foreigners think that is very big news , and they are very concerned about it . ”
Yang Xiong said .
As for another negative aspect of pajamas on the streets , Zhang Nian ( 张念 ) from Tongji University , the Institute of Cultural Criticism thinks “ the rationality of the citizens is to keep caring about other people ’s presence while the relative indifference of this care is reflected in the sense of distance .
However , pajamas as a signal abolish the public rational sense of distance , which makes strangers feel discomfort . ”
In recent years , with the improvement of living standards , the dress issue in the city has gradually evolved into the issue of civility .
Shanghai media and all levels of government propaganda have never laid to rest on the issue of pajamas .
But the persuasion work driven by World Expo , the intensity was significantly greater than in the past , but the disputes were also much more vigorous .
Although the neighborhood committees are not as strict as the police catching drivers running a red light , in the eyes of the scholars , grassroots persuasion activities organized by the government are still very forceful .
In Yang Xiong ’s view , wearing pajamas on the streets is inconsistent with international etiquette and it should be changed .
“ But it also can not be said to be a moral issue , not even to be said as an issue with people ’s civility in Shanghai .
Sometimes we amplify the problems . ”
Hu Shoujun ( 胡守钧 ) a professor of Sociology at Fudan University said , “ Neighborhood committee can advocate not wearing pajamas to go outside , but they have no rights to prohibit or disguise their prohibition activities as persuasion .
Although he himself is strongly opposed to wearing pajamas outside , he is also opposed to the mandatory or quasi- mandatory banning of pajamas on the street .
“ For example , back then the Down to the Countryside Movement was not mandatory .
But ‘ I advise you to go , go to classes , learn about Chairman Mao ’s works ….’
After repeated nagging , we agreed to go .
I think it is bad If we follow these kind of things . ”
Zhang Nian thinks that traditional liberalism defines freedom on two fronts for individual rights : one is that it is voluntary , and second , that it does not constitute harm to others .
The “ others ” here can also be the public .
From these two fronts , the danger of wearing pajamas on the street is not significant .
“ The government agencies should be models of public characters , rather than forcing citizens to shape the public characters . ”
“ The World Expo will be in a more satisfactory state if on one hand , the efficiency and the level of governance according to the law is improved , and on the other hand the self - awareness of the residents is improved .
The government should not control too much , too detailed , too small of issues and try to do everything , or else the autonomous sense of community will disappear .
We must utilize the enthusiasm of each resident to be proud to participate in the World Expo . ” Hu Shoujun ( 胡守钧 ) said .
Approximately one or two hours away from the Expo area , Rixing residence in Hongkou district as early as end of last year ’s 500 day countdown to World Expo in Shanghai , already took the initiative to dissuade the wearing of pajamas in public .
Today , the neighborhood committee has been reluctant to talk about this matter .
“ This is not the main task at hand anymore , every 100 days there is a new initiative , we are following the plan , now we are at the sage of stopping people from running the red light . ”
The sign “ Do n’t go outside wearing pajamas , be a World Expo civilized person ” is still standing in front of Qiba residential community .
The security room staff said : this sign will stay through the winter , it will be taken down only when there are no more pajamas in public .

BBC News , Durban
South African businessman Milton Mbele broke all the traditional rules of a polygamous wedding when he recently married four women on the same day .
The four brides dressed in flowing white gowns walked down the aisle together , before saying " We do " to the 44 - year - old groom .
Mr Mbele says he did n't marry them purely for the spectacle but also because it made financial sense .
" I do n't know how much four different weddings would have cost me but I know doing it all at once saved money , " he explains .
" For example I only needed one tent , I needed to hire one caterer and one photographer for the entire ceremony . "
If I feel like taking another wife this is something that will be in the open
Milton Mbele " I began putting money aside for the event towards the end of 2007 and started collecting quotes for things like the tent and catering costs early last year . "
He says he loves all his wives - Thobile Vilakazi , Zanele Langa , Baqinisile Mdlolo and Smangele Cele - equally and also treats them that way .
Mr Mbele himself wears four rings on his finger - he says this is a sign of his commitment to all his wives .
The wives say they were shocked by the news that Mr Mbele wanted to marry them at once but add that they agreed because they love him .
Some two weeks after their much publicised two - day ceremony , Mr Mbele says he is overwhelmed by all the attention his wedding has attracted .
I met Mr Mbele and Smangele , at 23 the youngest Mrs Mbele , at a hotel in Durban - the pair were set to do a radio interview with a national radio station the next day .
' Our culture '
In their hotel room the pair sat comfortably on the bed while taking questions about their big day .
Mr Mbele , a Zulu businessman and municipal manager , says polygamy is still very much part of Zulu tradition .
Milton Mbele has four wedding rings " This is a proud part of our culture .
It has been practised for generations before us . "
" My grandfather himself had three wives , " says Mr Mbele , quickly adding that he is n't blindly following in his grandfather 's footsteps .
" I prefer polygamy to having many girlfriends which is what some married men do , " he says .
" If I love more than one woman , I would rather make it known to the other women in my life and make it official .
" If I feel like taking another wife this is something that will be in the open and my wives would know , " he says .
President Jacob Zuma , also a Zulu , has three wives .
But the practice has been met with criticism .
Inside polygamy
Some point out that it does not afford equal rights to men and women .
Women are not allowed to wed more than one husband , while a man can have as many wives as he wishes .
There are seven days in a week and I have four wives .
I will take turns visiting them and use the remaining three days to rest
Milton Mbele
In a polygamous marriage only the first wife is legally recognised , which could pose some difficulties in dividing the husband 's estate when he dies .
South Africa has the highest number of HIV - positive people in the world - some five million .
Since having more than one sexual partner increases the chances of contracting the virus , it is understandable that Smangele 's family had reservations about her entering into a polygamous marriage .
" My family was not pleased at first but they came around eventually , " she says .
They are taking the necessary precautions , which include regular HIV tests .
" I had my last test a few months ago when I was pregnant .
We are all disciplined about staying healthy , " she says .
The arrangements seem to have been carefully thought out down to the last detail , including how Mr Mbele will alternate between his four wives , who all live in different parts of northern KwaZulu - Natal province .
" There are seven days in a week and I have four wives .
I will take turns visiting them and use the remaining three days to rest , " he says .
At this point Smangele , who has been quiet with her head bowed until now , looks up and smiles at her husband .
The second day of the wedding was a traditional Zulu wedding ceremony
When asked how she feels about Mr Mbele 's visitation plan she quickly responds .
" I believe it will work .
I am used to living on my own and having him visit me on certain days so this wo n't be anything new to us , " she says , reaching for her husband 's hand .
In fact , Mr Mbele has already been in relationships with his new wives for several years .
He has three children with " first wife " Thobile , two with " wife - number - two " Zanele , one child with Baqinisile , referred to as " wife - number - three " and two children with " youngest wife " Smangele .
He also has three children from a previous relationship .
Mr Mbele is the breadwinner in all his homes - none of his wives is employed .
They say they are happy to be provided for by their husband .
He owns 100 cows and 250 goats and has a good job , so he is relatively wealthy , at least by traditional standards .
' Why we love him ' Earlier in the day , I spoke to Baqinisile , who lives in a large home which she says was a gift from her husband .
The yard has three separate houses ; the main house is made from orange bricks - it is the biggest and only one of its kind in the small village .
The Mbeles have postponed going on honeymoon to save money
She welcomes me into her home and ushers me to sit down on luxurious cream leather couches .
In an area where employment and the luxuries it affords are difficult to come by , Baqinisile is living a life some young women in the area would envy .
Baqinisile describes her husband , who she met in 2006 , as a fair man .
" He respects us and treats us all the same way , " " When he buys us clothes , he buys us similar things .
Also when he gives us money .
" I admire this about him because it shows me that he loves us the same way , " she says , adjusting her ring .
Both Baqinisile and Smangele admit they were against polygamy when they were growing up but have now changed their minds .
" When I saw what a loving man he is and how he much he values all of us , I knew that I would be able to share my life with him and everyone else , " says Smangele .
Although Mr Mbele says he minimised costs by having a mass wedding , he is still paying for it , so there will be no honeymoon for a couple of years .
But the entire Mbele family will not be going away together - he will take each wife separately in order of their hierarchy .

Paul Krugman explains why we can't settle for stabilizing the economy , and says unless there 's a bigger economic stimulus package , high unemployment is here to stay for a long , long time :
The effects of the stimulus will build over time — it ’s still likely to create or save a total of around three million jobs — but its peak impact on the growth of G.D.P. ( as opposed to its level ) is already behind us .
Solid growth will continue only if private spending takes up the baton as the effect of the stimulus fades .
And so far there ’s no sign that this is happening .
So the government needs to do much more .
Unfortunately , the political prospects for further action are n’t good .
What I keep hearing from Washington is one of two arguments : either ( 1 ) the stimulus has failed , unemployment is still rising , so we should n’t do any more , or ( 2 ) the stimulus has succeeded , G.D.P. is growing , so we do n’t need to do any more .
The truth , which is that the stimulus was too little of a good thing — that it helped , but it was n’t big enough — seems to be too complicated for an era of sound - bite politics .
But can we afford to do more ?
We ca n’t afford not to .
High unemployment does n’t just punish the economy today ; it punishes the future , too .
In the face of a depressed economy , businesses have slashed investment spending — both spending on plant and equipment and “ intangible ” investments in such things as product development and worker training .
This will hurt the economy ’s potential for years to come .
Deficit hawks like to complain that today ’s young people will end up having to pay higher taxes to service the debt we ’re running up right now .
But anyone who really cared about the prospects of young Americans would be pushing for much more job creation , since the burden of high unemployment falls disproportionately on young workers — and those who enter the work force in years of high unemployment suffer permanent career damage , never catching up with those who graduated in better times .
Even the claim that we ’ll have to pay for stimulus spending now with higher taxes later is mostly wrong .
Spending more on recovery will lead to a stronger economy , both now and in the future — and a stronger economy means more government revenue .
Stimulus spending probably does n’t pay for itself , but its true cost , even in a narrow fiscal sense , is only a fraction of the headline number .
O.K. , I know I ’m being impractical : major economic programs can’t pass Congress without the support of relatively conservative Democrats , and these Democrats have been telling reporters that they have lost their appetite for stimulus .
But I hope their stomachs start rumbling soon .
We now know that stimulus works , but we are n’t doing nearly enough of it .
For the sake of today ’s unemployed , and for the sake of the nation ’s future , we need to do much more .
Jane is your average programmer .
Jane works with Perl in her job .
She 's fortunate ; her company knows how to use CPAN effectively .
Whenever she needs to do something new , she searches CPAN for an appropriate distribution , evaluates it , and -- more often than not -- uses it to solve her problem .
Today Jane has another problem .
There 's a bug somewhere .
She runs her tests and narrows it down to some new code she 's written in the past week .
Her debugging leads her to a CPAN module she added a few days ago .
With a little more work , she discovers that one particular method does n't handle an edge case that her code provides .
Fortunately , that module 's page on search .
cpan.org has a link to a public source code repository .
She can check out the latest version and see if that solves her problem .
Today , it does n't -- but that 's okay .
The CPAN page also explains where the author prefers to receive bug reports .
Now Jane has options .
She can write a test with her example and attach it as a patch to apply to the repository .
She can write a general explanation and see if that triggers something in the author 's mind .
Jane 's motivated , today .
She writes a test .
She peeks inside the module 's implementation and realizes that a single line of code will make the test pass .
She writes that code -- and all of the tests pass .
She submits the bug report and her patches to CPAN 's bug tracker .
The author applies the patch and releases a new version of the distribution on the CPAN and the world is a little bit better for a little bit of cooperation between a couple of motivated people .
This is how Perl happens .
The Perl 5 core ?
Thousands of people have sent one or more little patch to correct a typo or add a new feature or update a core module or improve the documentation or fix a bug or speed up an existing feature or to make it work on a new platform .
That 's thousands of volunteers , motivated by the desire to make the world a little bit better -- sometimes for themselves or their employers and sometimes for other people .
The CPAN ?
Thousands of developers have donated code written for whatever purpose so that other people can use it freely .
Perl web sites ?
Perl mailing lists ?
Perl documentation and tutorials ?
The same .
None of this is by accident .
Improvements happen because they 're necessary and useful , but mostly because someone decides to take the Perl motto of JFDI ( Just Do It , Friend ! ) to heart .
That goes for Perl 5 , Perl 1 , Perl 6 , Parrot , CPAN , Catalyst , RT , Moose , CPAN Testers , and whatever other project in the Perl world you care to mention .
With people willing to invest an hour or two to make even a tiny improvement , we make big progress .
Just do it , friend .
Whatever you think about the leaked emails showing that " tricks " were used to " hide the decline " in the climate data , and the fact that the original source data showing historical climate information was destroyed , you should agree on two things .
The Carbon Footprint of War
First , as Harvey Wasserman notes , continuing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will more than wipe out any reduction in carbon from the government 's proposed climate measures .
Writing about the escalation in the Afghanistan war , Wasserman says :
The war would also come with a carbon burst .
How will the massive emissions created by 100,000 - plus soldiers in wartime be counted in the 17 % reduction rubric ?
Will the HumVees be converted to hybrids ?
What is the carbon impact of Predator bombs that destroy Afghan families and villages ?
The continuance of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars completely and thoroughly undermines the government 's claims that there is a global warming emergency and that reducing carbon output through cap and trade is needed to save the planet .
I can't take anything the government says about carbon footprints seriously until the government ends the unnecessary wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
For evidence that the Iraq war is unnecessary , see this .
Read this for evidence that the U.S. could have taken Bin Laden out years ago and avoided a decades long war in Afghanistan .
And for proof that the entire war on Muslim extremists is unnecessary for our national security , see this .
War is also very harmful to the economy .
See this , this and this .
Carbon Trading
Second , the proposed solution to global warming - cap and trade - is a scam .
Specifically :
The economists who invented cap - and - trade say that it wo n't work for global warming
Many environmentalists say that carbon trading wo n't effectively reduce carbon emissions
Our bailout buddies over at Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan , Morgan Stanley , Citigroup and the other Wall Street behemoths are buying heavily into carbon trading .
As University of Maryland professor economics professor and former Chief Economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission Peter Morici writes : Obama must ensure that the banks use the trillions of dollars in federal bailout assistance to renegotiate mortgages and make new loans to worthy homebuyers and businesses .
Obama must make certain that banks do not continue to squander federal largess by padding executive bonuses , acquiring other banks and pursuing new high - return , high - risk lines of businesses in merger activity , carbon trading and complex derivatives .
Industry leaders like Citigroup have announced plans to move in those directions .
Many of these bankers enjoyed influence in and contributed generously to the Obama campaign .
Now it remains to be seen if a President Obama can stand up to these same bankers and persuade or compel them to act responsibly .
In other words , the same companies that made billions off of derivatives and other scams and are now getting bailed out on your dime are going to make billions from carbon trading .
Consensus
Everyone should read the leaked emails and rationally think through what they mean .
But whatever one believes about climategate ( the leaked emails showing that " tricks " were used to " hide the decline " in the climate data and the destruction of the original source data ) , we should all be able to agree that :
Government , lenders , and various lender - sponsored " help " agencies have acted in unison , using fear mongering tactics and shame to manage the housing crisis for the sole benefit of lenders .

Note :
The PDF is 54 pages long and worth reading in entirety but I have condensed the discussion down to a very readable 3 - 4 pages of so .
There is little sense in putting such a lengthy snip into a huge blockquote that will take up a lot of space .
Instead , I will make it clear below when the article ends .
Abstract
Despite reports that homeowners are increasingly “ walking away ” from their mortgages , most homeowners continue to make their payments even when they are significantly underwater .
This article suggests that most homeowners choose not to strategically default as a result of two emotional forces : 1 ) the desire to avoid the shame and guilt of foreclosure ; and 2 ) exaggerated anxiety over foreclosure ’s perceived consequences .
Moreover , these emotional constraints are actively cultivated by the government and other social control agents in order to encourage homeowners to follow social and moral norms related to the honoring of financial obligations - and to ignore market and legal norms under which strategic default might be both viable and the wisest financial decision .
Norms governing homeowner behavior stand in sharp contrast to norms governing lenders , who seek to maximize profits or minimize losses irrespective of concerns of morality or social responsibility .
This norm asymmetry leads to distributional inequalities in which individual homeowners shoulder a disproportionate burden from the housing collapse .
II . Underwater and Staying Put
As further evidence that relatively few homeowners strategically default solely because they are underwater , housing markets with a sharply higher percentage of underwater homeowners as compared to the national average do not have sharply higher default rates .
As the chart below illustrates , this pattern of relatively low default rates compared to the percentage of underwater mortgages holds true almost universally across the hardest hit markets , with the default rate much more closely resembling the unemployment rate than the percent underwater :
III .
The Financial Logic of Walking Away
Before examining why more underwater homeowners are not strategically defaulting , it might be helpful to explore why they should .
A textbook premise of economics is that the value of a home , even an owner occupied one , is “ the current value of the rent payments that could be earned from renting the property at market prices . ”
In other words , when the net cost of buying a home exceeds the net cost of renting , one is better off renting .
The equation is not as simple , however , as comparing total mortgage payments to rent payments because home ownership carries certain benefits including tax breaks and the potential for appreciation .
Additionally , assuming a non-depreciating market , the portion of the mortgage payment that goes to principle rather than interest will eventually inure to the homeowner at the time of sale .
On the flip side , homeownership carries significant costs that renting does not , including maintenance , homeowner ’s insurance and substantial transaction costs upon selling .
In calculating whether to buy or rent , a potential homebuyer should compare the net cost of owning to the net cost of renting a similar home over the expected period of occupancy .
The costs of owning include the interest - only portion of the loan payment , property taxes , maintenance , homeowners insurance , and transaction costs upon selling , minus the expected appreciation and cumulative tax savings over the planned period of ownership .
As a rule of thumb , a potential homebuyer is generally better off renting when the home price exceeds 15 or 16 times the annual rent for comparable homes .
For example , a homeowner who bought an average home in Miami at the peak would have paid around $ 355,400 .
That home would now be worth only $ 198,00038 and , assuming a 5 % down payment , the homeowner would have approximately $ 132,000 in negative equity .
He could save approximately $ 116,000 by walking away and renting a comparable home .
Or , he could stay and take 20 years just to recover lost equity – all the while throwing away $ 1300 a month in net savings that he could invest elsewhere .
The advantage of walking is even starker for the large percentage of individuals who bought more - expensive - than - average homes in the Miami area – or in any bubble market for that matter - in the last five years .
Millions of U.S. homeowners could save hundreds of thousands of dollars by strategically defaulting on their mortgages .
Homeowners should be walking away in droves .
But they are n’t .
V. The Social Control of the Housing Crisis
Alarmed by the possibility that foreclosures may reach a tipping point , formal federal policy has aimed to stem the tide of foreclosures through programs designed to “ reduce household cash flow problems , ” such as the Making Home Affordable ( MHA ) loan modification program and Hope For Homeowners .
In other words , federal policy assumes that homeowners are – for the most part - not “ ruthless ” and wo n’t walk away from their mortgages simply because they have negative equity .
Most homeowners walk only when they can no longer afford to stay .
As evidence of this fact , only 45 % of homeowners would walk even if they had $ 300,000 in negative equity .
This percentage drops to 38 % among the subset of individuals who believe it is immoral to strategically default on one ’s mortgage ( a subset to which 87 % of homeowners belong ) .
These numbers suggest that the “ moral constraint ” is a powerful one indeed – and that , for most people , only the complete inability to afford their mortgage would push them to default .
On the other hand , the fact that 63 % of “ amoral ” individuals would default at $ 300,000 in negative equity , and 59 % would do so at $ 200,000 , suggests that federal policy can only proceed on the premise that affordability is the prime consideration as long as the moral and social constraints on foreclosure remain strong .
The government thus has an incentive , along with certain other economic and social institutions interested in limiting the number of foreclosures , in cultivating guilt and shame in those who would contemplate walking away .
Similarly , knowing that guilt and shame alone are not enough to prevent many individuals from defaulting once negative equity is extreme , these same institutions have an interest in increasing the perceived cost of foreclosure by cultivating fear of financial disaster for those who contemplate it .
At the political level , government spokespersons , including President Obama , have repeatedly emphasized the virtue of homeowners who have acted “ responsibly ” in “ making their payments each month ” .
The worst criticism has been reserved , however , for those who would walk away from mortgages that they can afford .
Such individuals are portrayed as obscene , offensive , and unethical , and likened to deadbeat dads who walk out on their children , or those who would have “ given up ” and just handed over Europe to the Nazis .
Indeed , a homeowner contemplating a strategic default would be hard pressed to avoid the message that doing so would place them among the most despicable members of society .
Moreover , a homeowner who turned to any number of credit counseling agencies would also find little sympathy - and much moralizing - should they announce their plan to walk on their “ affordable ” mortgage .
Gail Cunningham of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling declared for example in an interview on NPR : “ Walking away from one 's home should be the absolute last resort .
However desperate a situation might become for a homeowner , that does not relieve us of our responsibilities . "
Indeed , the uniform message of both governmental and non-profit counseling agencies ( which are typically funded at least in significant part by the financial industry ) is that “ walking away ” is not a responsible choice and should be avoided at all costs .
Social control of would be defaulters is not limited to moral suasion , however .
Predominate messages regarding foreclosure also frequently employ fear to persuade homeowners that strategic default is a bad choice .
Indeed , almost every media story on those who “ walk away from their mortgages ” condemns the behavior as immoral and enlists some “ expert ” to explain that foreclosure is , despite any claims to the contrary , a devastating event .
Similar warnings of disaster pervade the information given to homeowners by HUD - approved housing counseling agencies , such as the following from the Anaheim Housing Counseling Agency :
Losing your home can be the worst and most devastating event to you personally , and your credit history .
This is a scenario that you do n’t want to occur if you can avoid it !
Not only will you lose the comfort of your home and your investment , but a Foreclosure will stay pending on your credit history for as long as 10 years .
This will jeopardize your ability to qualify for any future home loan purchases , it may affect your ability to access loans for car purchase and other needed purchases , and loan costs are likely to be higher both in fees and interest paid .
As discussed above , fear alone is a powerful motivator .
But guilt and fear in combination are even more potent .
This may be because most individuals have a deep - seated , if ill - defined , sense that if they do “ bad things , ” bad things will happen to them .
Whatever the psychological underpinnings , most people simply do not believe they will escape punishment for their moral transgressions .
Guilt and fear of punishment go together .
As explored above , however , there is in fact a huge financial upside to strategic default for seriously underwater homeowners – an upside that is routinely ignored by the media , credit counseling agencies , and other political and economic institutions in “ informing ” homeowners about the consequences of default .
Moreover , the costs of default are not nearly as extreme as these same institutions typically misrepresent them to be .
In reality : homeowners face no risk of a deficiency judgment in many states or , regardless of the state , for FHA loans or loans held by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac ; even in recourse states , lenders are unlikely to pursue a deficiency judgment because it is economically inefficient to do so ; there is no tax liability on “ forgiven portions ” of home mortgages under current federal tax law in effect until 2012 ; defaulting on one ’s mortgage does not mean that one ’s other credit lines will be revoked ; and most people can expect to recover from the negative impact of foreclosure on their credit score within a two years ( and , meanwhile , two years of poor credit need not seriously impact one ’s life ) .
VI .
The Asymmetry of Homeowner and Lender Norms
One obvious response to the above discussion is that society benefits when people honor their financial obligations and behave according to social and moral norms , rather than strictly legal or market norms .
This may be true if lenders behaved according to the same social and moral norms .
In the case of lender - borrower behavior , however , there is a clear imbalance in placing personal responsibility on the borrower to honor their “ promise to pay ” in order to relieve the lender of their agreement to take back the home in lieu of payment .
Given lenders generally superior knowledge and understanding of both mortgage instruments and valuation of real estate , it seems only fair to hold them to the benefit of their bargain .
At a basic level , sound underwriting of mortgage loans requires lenders to ensure that a loan is sufficiently collateralized in the event of default .
As such , historical home prices have hewed nationally to a price - to - annual - rent ratio of roughly 15 - to - 1 .
At the peak of the market , however , price - to - rent ratios reached 38 - to - 1 in the most inflated markets , and the national average reached 23 - to - 1 .
If personal responsibility is the operative value , then lenders who ignored basic economic principles ( of which they should have been aware ) should bear at least equal responsibility to homeowners for issuing collateralized loans that were far in excess of the intrinsic value of the home .
Moreover , since lenders generally arrange the appraisal ( which home buyers must pay for ) and home buyers rely upon the lender to ensure the home is worth the purchase price , one might argue that lender should bear much more than 50 % responsibility for the bad investment of the homeowner and lender .
Indeed , lenders ’ mortgage default risk models have long shown that the loan - to - value ratio is a critical factor in default risk .
Lenders relaxed this requirement , however , as credit default models showed that few borrowers were “ ruthless , ” meaning that few borrowers default as soon as the loan value exceeds the market value of the home .
This is not to say that lenders are solely responsible for the housing run-up and bust , but that they do in fact bear a substantial portion of the blame – and thus should thus bear a substantial portion of the cost .
One might argue , in fact , that the value of personal responsibility would require lenders to own up to their share of the blame , and work with underwater homeowners by voluntarily writing off some of the negative equity .
But lenders , of course , do not operate according norms of personal responsibility , and seek instead to maximize profit ( or minimize losses ) .
Appealing to this duty , it has been suggested that , given the great cost to lenders of foreclosure , they have an economic incentive to modify loans for homeowners in danger of default .
Recent studies seeking to explain this apparently irrational behavior have shown that lenders are simply operating to maximize profit and minimize losses , just as they would be expected to do .
First , lenders know that borrowers with high credit scores are unlikely to default even at high levels of negative equity .
To modify loans for these homeowners would be to throw money away – and to encourage more homeowners to ask for modifications .
Second , a significant number of homeowners who temporarily default on their mortgages “ self - cure ” without any help from their lender – though self cure rates have dropped precipitously in the last two years .
Again , to modify the loans of individuals who would otherwise self cure would be to throw away money .
Third , homeowners with poor credit , or who end up in arrears because of “ triggering events ” such as unemployment , divorce , or other financially devastating circumstances are likely to default on the modified loan as well .
To modify loans for these individuals is to waste time and risk housing prices falling further before the lender eventually has to foreclosure and sell the property anyway .
Given these economic incentives for the lender , a seriously underwater homeowner with good credit and solid mortgage payment history who responsibly calls his lender to work out a loan modification is likely to be told by his lender that it will not discuss a loan modification until the homeowner is 30 days or more delinquent on his mortgage payment .
The lender is making a bet ( and a good one ) that the homeowner values his credit score too much to miss a payment and will just give up the idea of a loan modification .
However , if the homeowner does what the lender suggests , misses a payment , and calls back to discuss a loan modification in 30 days , the homeowner is likely to be told to call back when he is 90 days delinquent .
In the meantime , the lender will send the borrower a series of strongly - worded notices reminding him of his moral obligation to pay and threatening legal action , including foreclosure and a deficiency judgment , if the homeowner does not bring his mortgage payments current .
The lender is again making a bet ( and again a good one ) that the homeowner will be shamed or frightened into paying their mortgage .
If the homeowner calls the lender ’s bluff and calls back when he is 90 days delinquent , there is a good possibility that he will be told that his credit score is now so low that he does not qualify for a loan modification .
Most lenders will , in other words , take full advantage of the asymmetry of norms between lender and homeowner and will use the threat of damaging the borrower ’s credit score to bring the homeowner into compliance .
Additionally , many lenders will only bargain when the threat of damaging the homeowner ’s credit has lost its force and it becomes clear to the lender that foreclosure is imminent absent some accommodation .
On a fundamental level , the asymmetry of moral norms for borrowers and market norms for lenders gives lenders an unfair advantage in negotiations related to the enforcement of contractual rights and obligations .
*** END OF ARTICLE SNIP ***
There is more in the article including a discussion as to what to do about it all .
I do not agree with many of the proposed solutions and indeed the article points out flaws in most of the solutions that have been proposed .
However , I do agree with the basic idea that asymmetry is a huge problem , that the playing field needs to be leveled .
Moreover , I will add that the real moral hazard is attempting to keep people debt slaves by purposely overstating the costs of walking away while ignoring all of the benefits .
These " help " agencies are designed to do one thing and one thing only : help the lender regardless of the cost to the homeowner .
If these " help agencies " actually gave a realistic assessment of the advantages of walking away , we would see more willingness for voluntary cooperation between lenders and homeowners to negotiate a mutually beneficial arrangement .
Instead we have a one sided winner - take - all approach whereby the only way for the homeowner to win is to walk away .
The current system of offering lenders a few thousand dollars to refinance a loan making the loan " more affordable " does nothing to address the fundamental problem of too much debt that will act as a drag on the economy for a decade to come .
The article concludes ...
Regardless of the precise policy prescription , it is time to put to rest the assumption that a borrower who exercises the option to default is somehow immoral or irresponsible .
To the contrary , walking away may be the most financially responsible choice if it allows one to meet one ’s unsecured credit obligations or provide for the future economic stability of one ’s family .
Individuals should not be artificially discouraged on the basis of “ morality ” from making financially prudent decisions , particularly when the party on the other side is amorally operating according to market norms and could have acted to protect itself by following prudent underwriting practices .
The current housing bust should be viewed for what it is : a market failure – not a moral failure on the part of American homeowners .
That being the case , it is time to take morals out of the picture and search for an equitable solution to the negative equity problem .

Addendum :
Exclusive A bird dropping a piece of bread onto outdoor machinery has been blamed for a technical fault at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) this week which saw significant overheating in sections of the mighty particle - punisher 's subterranean 27 - km supercooled magnetic doughnut .
According to scientists at the project , had the LHC been operational - it is scheduled to recommence beaming later this month - the snag would have caused it to fail safe and shut down automatically .
This would put the mighty machine out of action for a few days while it was restarted , but there would be no repeat of the catastrophic damage suffered last September .
On that occasion , an electrical connection in the circuit itself failed violently , causing a massive liquid - helium leak and knock - on damage along hundreds of metres of magnets .
Reg readers alerted us yesterday to the temperature rises in the LHC's Sector 81 , which began in the early hours of Tuesday morning : most of the collider 's operational data can be viewed on the web for all to see .
Initial enquiries to CERN press staff led to assurances that the rises were the result of routine tests .
However Dr Mike Lamont , who works at the CERN control centre and describes himself as " LHC Machine Coordinator and General Dogsbody " later confirmed that there had indeed been a problem .
Lamont , briefing reporters at the control room yesterday , told the Reg that machinery on the surface - the LHC accelerator circuit itself is buried deep beneath the Franco - Swiss border outside Geneva - had suffered a fault caused by " a bit of baguette on the busbars " , thought perhaps to have been dropped by a bird .
As a result , temperatures in part of the LHC 's circuit climbed to almost 8 Kelvin - significantly higher than the normal operating temperature of 1.9 , and close to the temperature at which the LHC 's niobium - titanium magnets are likely to " quench " , or cease superconducting and become ordinary " warm " magnets - by no means up to the task imposed on them .
Dr Tadeusz Kurtyka , a CERN engineer , told the Reg that this can happen unpredictably at temperatures above 9.6 K .
An uncontrolled quench would be bad news with the LHC in operation , possibly leading to serious damage of the sort which crippled the machine last September .
At the moment there are no beams of hadrons barrelling around the huge magnetic doughnut at close to light speed , but when there are , each of the two beams has as much energy in it as an aircraft carrier underway .
If the LHC suddenly lost its ability to keep the beam circling around its vacuum pipe , all that energy would have to go somewhere - with results on the same scale as being rammed by an aircraft carrier .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  FBI officials say they have rescued 52 children in a series of raids around the country aimed at under - age prostitution .
Authorities say the youngest victim was just 10 years old .
The bureau and local police officials also arrested 60 pimps during the three - day enforcement effort in 36 cities .
The raids are the latest in a long - running Operation Cross Country aimed at child prostitution rings around the country .
Almost 1,600 agents and officers took part in the raids , which led to federal and state charges against a total of 691 suspects .
The investigations typically target places where minors are likely to be sold for sex , including truck stops , casinos , public streets , and Internet websites .

I was sorely tempted to try a solution to this paradox using dialetheism .
Be grateful that I did n’t .
Also , if anyone can tell me where this fun little paradox comes from , I ’d be grateful .
Found it , it is apparently known as Smullyan ’s Paradox .
If you follow the link you can see a lot of discussion that mirrors ours here .
In other news , I found out this morning that the paper I submitted to the FPA Conference won the Outstanding Graduate Paper Award this year , and will be published in the Florida Philosophical Review .
Totally crazy , and awesome !

Oh !
And I almost forgot , the cool background in the first panel is a modification of a desktop background image from this website here .
There are some other neat images there too that are worth checking out .
The Congress shall have power …
To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ;
The NY Times reports that House Financial Chairman Barney Frank has met in private with Ben Bernanke to plan strategies for bracing against the overwhelming popular demand to audit the private Federal Reserve , voiced– piercingly for Bernanke– in Rep.
Ron Paul ’s bill , now with some 300 co-sponsors .
Frank ’s part in meeting was to urge Bernanke to face reality –
“ Mr. Frank warned that he might have to embrace a version of Mr. Paul ’s bill , ” wrote the Times– now it was time to consider compromises .
However , responding to Bernanke ’s top concerns , Barney Frank “ vowed ” that : “ he would “ wall off ” deliberations on basic monetary policy , and delay the release of information about the Fed ’s financial operations to prevent traders from capitalizing on its moves .
” Bernanke ’s “ apocalyptic ” fear of H.R. 1207 and the accompanying rise in public interest in the Fed , as the NY Times describes it , underscores the drastic survival mechanism of an institution that has historically relied on the secrecy provided by its bland exterior .
Mr. Bernanke initially reacted to the bill in almost apocalyptic terms .
The G.A.O. audits , he told a House hearing in late June , could lead to a Congressional “ takeover ” of monetary policy that would be “ highly destructive to the stability of the financial system , the dollar and our national economic situation .
” Why this fear has lingered overhead for so long may be simply because he knows that his thin - air empire ca n’t withstand a Constitutional examination .
Bernanke worries about a “ takeover ” by Congress because he knows that it alone has the Constitutional authority to oversee the issuance of currency .
As Alex Jones ’ Fall of the Republic reveals , Ben Bernanke told Congress in no uncertain terms , that an examination of its monetary policy would amount to a ‘ takeover ’ and instilled the fear that it would trigger further economic devastation .
The Federal Reserve should not have “ independent ” autonomy to direct the financial commitments of a nation , print its money at will and risk its stability .
Of course Congress ’ constitutional power over money is enumerated in Article I , Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution :
If Bernanke is looking over its shoulder , it is because he knows the Fed ’s days are numbered , and that any light ( via even a soft audit ) will only serve to further expose the improper occupation of the nation ’s financial instruments by a private , self - interested global banking cartel .
“ The Fed faces populist anger from left - wing Democrats and right - wing Republicans about its power and secrecy …
It was alarming enough that …
“ End the Fed , ” had just landed on the best - seller lists .
” Bernanke and his masters are obviously very unsettled by such a significant public outcry , and , as the NY Times notes , the fact that Ron Paul ’s ‘ End the Fed ’ has reached the best - seller list .----- Got comments ?

What happens when you take game play elements from Tomb Raider , Max Payne , and Uncharted ?
You get WET !
Combining 70 ’s cinema - tinged presentation and Stranglehold - like slow - motion combat mechanics make this a slick looking game .
While presentation and style are pretty good , it ’s not enough to make you overlook its weakness in game play .
In Wet you follow the adventures of Rubi Malone , a leather clad , raven - haired vixen with a vendetta against a former boss .
But do n’t let the title and leading lady emblazoned on the cover fool you .
This is n’t another over sexualized game to fuel fan boy fantasies .
Wronged and angry , you ’re thrown into a world of murderers , double - crossers , drug runners , and impossible action scenarios .
While you may find that Rubi ’s basic abilities will be your mainstay throughout the game , you can choose to upgrade her combat abilities .
At any time throughout the game you can initiate a jump or slide , combine it with gunfire , and extend it into a slow - motion sequence .
There ’s no limit to the amount of bullet - time effects you can use in the game as long as you are jumping or running on walls , or sliding across the floor and firing at any number of targets .
While her weapons are n’t the best ones out there , they still get the job done .
Rubi always has two weapons ready - Either pistols , shotguns , submachine guns , or crossbows - none of which ever need reloading .
If you are close enough to an enemy you can also bust out the katana for a quick and accurate kill .
Controlling your aim is a little tricky , even if you are a master at FPS , so do n’t expect to go in and take everyone out with head shots .
Keep shooting and chaining kills together and you build up a multiplier , accumulating points and enhancing your sense of reward for fluid play .
The multiplier will help your health regenerate so the higher you get your multiplier , the faster you get your health back .
If you happen to see a whiskey bottle sitting around , you can take a swig of that to immediately regain your health .
Just remember to shoot the bottle afterwards , or it wo n’t work !
As you battle your way through single - player campaign you can unlock weapon damage , fire rates and new acrobatic moves .
However , none of these will make a significant difference in the combat ; they just add that little extra umph .
Wet is a combat - heavy game with a significant amount of jumping around environments where a big fall means instant death .
There is no way to cancel out of a mid-dive to avoid dying so you just have to suck it up and start over .
While you can grab onto different edges , they are very context - sensitive and have to be approached from just the right angle .
It would be perfect if Rubi was “ sticky ” especially when jumping from platform to platform , since being even slightly off means you are going to slide right down the side of the wall .
The arenas are clumsy plat - forming setups that will remind you of Prince of Persia , but without any real flow .
While sometimes it is fun to combine wall - running with Rubi ’s gun it usually ends up being more trouble than it ’s worth .
The out of combat sequences are n’t really enjoyable and seem to be there only for the purpose of killing time .
Throughout each stage there are monkeys you can to collect in order to unlock bonus content and other goodies like music , artwork , and bios .
A wide range of speed - run and shooting challenges are also offered outside of the story mode where you dart and dive through rings and try to shoot targets to reduce your overall time .
The enemies in Wet are definitely inferior to Rubi , providing a challenge mostly due to their numbers with only the occasional character that can equally match Rubi in combat .
You will have to fight these enemies in quick - time events , if at all .
The bosses in the game air fairly simple .
I enjoyed that fact that it uses all the game play elements but in the end , they ’re a little lackluster so do n’t go in thinking you will have anything close to an epic battle to the death .
Most enemies are dispatched by a series of four or five button presses .
Things get a little too Quentin Tarantino - ish on occasions , with all the blood splattering dramatically across Rubi ’s face and the swaths of black and red and white .
There is also a Matrix - like car chase where you have to jump across the tops of different vehicles while shooting at the enemies .
Conveniently , you always end up on the same black car , and the enemies all look the same and seem to be jammed into clown cars .
It ’s a good game , but it does n’t offer enough variety .
The only place where Wet does n’t falter is in its style and presentation .
Details like heavy film grain and scratches , along with random ‘ footage ’ that appears as if it were spliced into the reel , makes the player feel like they are watching an old film .
The game is paired up with a pretty decent soundtrack and limited voice acting .
While A2 M gets the style right and provides plenty of dark and dirty battlegrounds to splatter with blood , the visuals and animations are n’t particularly sharp and are pretty rough - edged and sloppy .
I imagine they came up with this game by jotting down different things they liked about various other games and decided to jam them all into one .
The game play is lacking , to say the least .
Blood , bullets , crude language , seedy characters and piles of dead bodies make up this overly repetitive game that leaves you unsatisfied .
I have to say though that I was surprised by this game because overall it is n’t horrible .
It ’s a fun game to play just so long as you do n’t expect to get too much out of it .
What happens after all the fear mongering that Iran is developing a nuclear weapons bunker turns out to be bunk ?
U.N. inspectors found " nothing to be worried about " in a first look at a previously secret uranium enrichment site in Iran last month , the International Atomic Energy chief said in remarks published Thursday .
Mohamed ElBaradei also told the New York Times that he was examining possible compromises to unblock a draft nuclear cooperation deal between Iran and three major powers that has foundered over Iranian objections .
The nuclear site , which Iran revealed in September three years after diplomats said Western spies first detected it , added to Western fears of covert Iranian efforts to develop atom bombs .
Iran says it is enriching uranium only for electricity .
ElBaradei was quoted in a New York Times interview as saying his inspectors ' initial findings at the fortified site beneath a desert mountain near the Shi'ite holy city of Qom were " nothing to be worried about . "
" The idea was to use it as a bunker under the mountain to protect things , " ElBaradei , alluding to Tehran 's references to the site as a fallback for its nuclear program in case its larger Natanz enrichment plant were bombed by a foe like Israel .
" It 's a hole in a mountain , " he said .
But , let 's not let you get too comfortable about Iran ... GuardianUK 's Julian Borger comes up with a new scare :
The UN 's nuclear watchdog has asked Iran to explain evidence suggesting that Iranian scientists have experimented with an advanced nuclear warhead design , the Guardian has learned .
The very existence of the technology , known as a " two - point implosion " device , is officially secret in both the US and Britain , but according to previously unpublished documentation in a dossier compiled by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Iranian scientists may have tested high - explosive components of the design .
The development was today described by nuclear experts as " breathtaking " and has added urgency to the effort to find a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis .
Ooooh ... booga booga booga !
Two things that glare out for me : one , Borger cites the IAEA unpublished report without one single quotation .
Two , Borger claims the " two point implosion " is " officially secret " in the US and UK , but how secret can it be when it has its own Wikipedia page ?
The media really does think you 're dumb and can't figure out teh Google .

Old memories may get the boot from new brain cells .
A new rodent study shows that newborn neurons destabilize established connections among existing brain cells in the hippocampus , a part of the brain involved in learning and memory .
Clearing old memories from the hippocampus makes way for new learning , researchers from Japan suggest in the November 13 Cell .
Other researchers had proposed the idea that neurogenesis , the birth of new neurons , could disrupt existing memories , but the * Cell * paper is the first to show evidence supporting the idea , says Paul Frankland , a neuroscientist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto .
Scientists have known that memories first form in the hippocampus and are later transferred to long - term storage in other parts of the brain .
For some amount of time the memory resides both in the hippocampus and elsewhere in the brain .
What ’s not been known is how , after a few months or years , the memory is gradually cleared from the hippocampus .
Researchers have also debated the role of neurogenesis in learning and memory .
The hippocampus is one of only two places in the adult brain where scientists know that new neurons form .
On the basis of previous studies , many researchers think new neurons stabilize memory circuits or are somehow otherwise necessary to form new memories .
The new study suggests the opposite : Newborn neurons weaken or disrupt connections that encode old memories in the hippocampus .
Kaoru Inokuchi , a neuroscientist at the University of Toyama in Japan , and his colleagues used radiation and some genetic tricks to block neurogenesis in rats and mice that had been trained to fear getting a mild electric shock when placed in a particular cage .
Control animals , with normal neurogenesis , eventually were able to bypass their hippocampi and retrieve the fear memory directly from long - term storage .
But animals in which neurogenesis had been blocked still depended on the hippocampus to recall the fear memory , the researchers found .
Running on an exercise wheel , which boosts neurogenesis , also sped the rate at which old memories were cleared from the hippocampus .
But that does n’t mean new neurons are n’t necessary to teach old brains new tricks , says Inokuchi .
“ Our findings do not necessarily deny the important role of neurogenesis in memory acquisition , ” Inokuchi says .
“ Hippocampal neurogenesis could have both of these roles , in erasing old memories and acquiring new memories . ”
Essentially , the new neurons may aid formation of new memories by keeping the hippocampus from filling up with old ones .
Frankland adds , “ This is about as novel as it gets in the field of neurogenesis and memory .
It pretty much represents an entirely new framework that other researchers will chip away at for years to come . ”

Led by Andal Ampatuan Sr. , the governor of Maguindanao , the Ampatuans have controlled the province as their fief since early this decade .
Because several provinces in Mindanao constitute a semiautonomous Muslim region , a provincial governor has the authority to carve up a province into smaller fiefs for his sons .
New towns , along with new administrative offices and housing , can be seen along the main road cutting through Maguindanao .
But with elections scheduled for May , the Ampatuans faced a challenge for governor by Esmael Mangudadatu , the vice mayor of Buluan , a small town in this province .
Significantly , Mr. Mangudadatu ’s clan holds the top political positions in the province just south of here , Sultan Kudarat .
Saying that he had received death threats and that the police had denied his request for an armed escort , Mr. Mangudadatu told the Philippine news media that he had sent his wife and female relatives to file his candidacy papers before the deadline at the end of the month .
He said he believed that , following traditional custom , the militias would not harm the women .
Mr. Mangudadatu also invited journalists to accompany the women on the way to Shariff Aguak , the capital of Maguindanao Province , reasoning that “ maybe they will not harm us if journalists are watching them , ” said Aquiles Zonio , a reporter for The Philippine Daily Inquirer who accompanied the entourage part of the way .
Felicisimo
Khu , the police superintendent who oversaw the search for bodies on Wednesday , said gunmen stopped the entourage along the highway near here and drove the victims toward the hilltop along a dirt road .
Another police official told national television on Monday that the force ’s members were under the control of Andal Ampatuan Jr. , who is the mayor of the town of Datu Unsay .
Mr. Mangudadatu said he received a phone call from his wife , Genalyn , just before she and the rest of the entourage were killed .
She told him they had been taken hostage by about 100 men , he told the Philippine news media .

Mr. Khu said the victims were separated , men from women ; vehicles were buried on one side of the hill and the victims on the other .
The gunmen seemed to have stayed a long time on the hilltop , as suggested by cooking pots found at the scene .
WASHINGTON , D.C. —
Designed to scan the heavens thousands to billions of light - years beyond the solar system , the Fermi Gamma - ray Space Telescope has now recorded some more down - to - Earth signals .
During its first 14 months of operation , the flying observatory has detected 17 gamma-ray flashes associated with terrestrial lightning storms .
The flashes occurred just before , during and immediately after lightning strikes , as tracked by the World Wide Lightning Location Network .
During two recent lightning storms , Fermi recorded gamma-ray emissions of a particular energy that could only have been produced by the decay of energetic positrons , the antimatter equivalent of electrons .
The observations are the first of their kind for lightning storms .
Michael Briggs of the University of Alabama in Huntsville announced the puzzling findings Nov. 5 at the 2009 Fermi Symposium .
It ’s a surprise to have found the signature of positrons during a lightning storm , Briggs said .
During lightning storms previously observed by spacecraft , energetic electrons moving toward the craft slowed down and produced gamma rays .
The unusual positron signature seen by Fermi suggests that the normal orientation for an electric field associated with a lightning storm somehow reversed , Briggs said .
Modelers are now working to figure out how the field reversal could have occurred .
But for now , he said , the answer is up in the air .
Recording gamma-ray flashes — which have the potential to harm airplanes in storms — is n’t new .
The first were found by NASA ’s Compton Gamma-ray Observatory in the early 1990s .
NASA ’s RHESSI satellite , which primarily looks at X - ray and gamma-ray emissions from the sun , has found some 800 terrestrial gamma-ray flashes , Briggs noted .

Mr Steward reached Melbourne before asking for help
An 81 - year - old Australian man became lost on an early morning drive to the shops and ended up almost 600 km ( 370 miles ) away from his starting point .
Eric Steward told police he failed to stop because he " liked to drive " .
Visiting friends in Yass , a country town south of Sydney in New South Wales state , Mr Steward left to buy a newspaper on Monday morning .
More than eight hours later , after taking a wrong turn on the highway , he asked Victoria state police for help .
" I just went out on the road to have a drive , a nice peaceful quiet drive .
" I did n't know where I was going but I knew it was somewhere , and with a bit of luck I would eventually find my wife again , " he said .
A good driver Australians think nothing of getting into a car to drive to a local shop to get a newspaper or milk .
But most manage to get back home within minutes .
With Mr Steward , it took almost nine hours .
His wife , Clare , had become increasingly worried about her spouse after reaching him on his mobile telephone .
He has slight dementia .
" He 's a good driver .
Very focused , I knew that much , " she said .
" We eventually knew where he was when I said ' Are there any signs around ? '
He said , 'uh , Westgate Bridge ' , " she said in reference to the famous Melbourne landmark .
Victoria state policeman Clayton Smith said Mr Steward had come up to him at a service station and told him he was lost .
" Although we had to laugh .
When we asked him why he had n't stopped earlier he replied , ' I just like to drive ' , " he said .
Mr Steward was unconcerned about all the attention , citing age as a liberating factor in his escapade .
" It 's a lot of fuss is n't it ? " he said .
" When you get to 80 and beyond it does n't matter much .
He 's out there waiting for us and you just got to wait your turn . "
He rejected a suggestion to get a satellite navigation system .
" Why would you want one of those ?
You can't get lost .
There is no fun in that . "

FOUR in 10 Australians believe Australia 's projected population of 35 million by 2049 will be too many people , according to an Age / Nielsen poll .
As Prime Minister Kevin Rudd talks up the idea of a ' ' big Australia ' ' , the public is more dubious about the expansion .
Australia 's population recently passed 22 million due to near - record levels of net migration and the highest birthrate since the 1970s .
.
Only 30 per cent think 35 million would be about right ; 26 per cent have no opinion , while 2 per cent say it would be too few people .
People are evenly split , on 43 per cent each , between those who say present immigration is too high or about right .
Just 9 per cent said immigration is too low .
The numbers are little changed from 2001 .
About 80 % of Australians live in coastal areas Australians may have to leave coastal areas as rising sea levels threaten homes , according to a new report .
The parliamentary committee report says urgent action is needed , as seas are expected to rise by 80 cm ( 31 inches ) .
About 80 % of Australians live in coastal areas , and the report recommends new laws banning further development in coastal regions .
Correspondents say the authorities are divided over whether to retreat from rising seas or defend the coastline .
Coastal identity
The report , entitled Managing Our Coastal Zone in a Changing Climate , urges the authorities to consider " the possibility of a government instrument that prohibits continued occupation of the land or future building development on the property due to sea hazard " .
It estimates that Aus$ 150bn ( $ 137bn ) worth of property is at risk from rising sea levels and more frequent storms in future years .
RISK TO AUSTRALIA'S COASTAL POPULATIONS Queensland : 250,000 buildings at risk New South Wales : 200,000 buildings at risk Western Australia : 94,000 buildings at risk Victoria : 80,000 buildings at risk South Australia : 60,000 buildings at risk Northern Territory : 900 buildings at risk Tasmania : 20 % of coastline at risk
There are almost 50 recommendations in the report , ranging from a national coastline plan and greater co-operation between different authorities to a revised building code to cope with storm surges and soil erosion .
It does not say the government should force people to move inland but proposes that an independent group look into whether the government could - and should - do just that .
Australia 's major cities are all in coastal areas , as well as the homes of some six million people outside the main population centres , according to the report , which was issued late on Monday after 18 months of study .
Alan Stokes , the task force 's executive director , said banning development in certain areas was necessary if the government wanted to prevent a major loss of life in the event of natural disasters such as tsunamis .
" There 's no doubt Australia will remain and continue to be a coastal community , " he said .
" But we may have to be a bit more considerate about which parts of the coast we develop further and which ones we do n't , " he added .
Last week the government reintroduced carbon trading legislation which was rejected in August and is among a package of bills aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions by up to 25 % by 2020 .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , founded by the UN , estimates that a global rise in sea level of some 80 cm is possible by 2100 .

American stockbroker sets record for cannabis consumption with 115,000th joint ( and it 's all legal )
An American stockbroker has one of the world ’s most prolific cannabis smokers – thanks to a constant supply of the drug to treat a rare bone disease .
Fort Lauderdale stockbroker Irvin Rosenfeld will tomorrow smoke his 115,000th joint - and it ’s all legal .
The 56 - year - old has been provided with cannabis by the government since 1982 , when he became a patient in the Federal Drug Administration ’s Investigational New Drug Programme .
' I would be bedridden without it ' : Irvin Rosenfeld has been supplied with cannabis by the government since 1982
Rosenfeld suffers from multiple congenital cartilaginous exostoses , which causes severe pain which can be alleviated by the drug .
He has been receiving 300 joints of the drug every 25 days for the past 27 years , NBC Miami reported .
‘ I would be bedridden without it , if I would even be alive , ’ he insisted .
‘ I should n’t have been alive and I ’m still alive , I take no other medicines , I ’m in great shape because of the cannabis .
It ’s just sad because the medicine ’s there . ’
Rosenfeld says he does not get ‘ high ’ on the drug , nor does it make him hungry .
He said : ‘ No munchies , no munchies , nothing other people get .
A lot of patients do n’t get high . ’
He added : ‘ There are people who have been raised to think it ’s the devil ’s work , they ’ll always be against it .
‘ If you truly think marijuana ’s as bad as you think it is , explain me . ’
The first marijuana coffee shop in the US has opened in Portland , Oregon .
The premises allows people prescribed marijuana by a doctor a place to buy and smoke the drug , although they have to remain out of public view .
It is technically a private club , but is open to any Oregon residents who hold official medical marijuana cards .
There are 21,000 patients registered to use marijuana in the state .
Prioritizing Debts :
Many homeowners fall behind on their mortgages because they are attempting to stay current on credit card bills , car loans , medical bills and other financial commitments .
While there are financial consequences for failing to pay other bills , the long - term consequences of defaulting on your mortgage can be significant .
If you find yourself unable to pay all your bills , you should prioritize them so that you can at least pay your mortgage every month .
This way , you can preserve equity in your home and leverage your ability to pay your monthly mortgage if you need to declare bankruptcy .
Avoid Paying Late Penalties and Foreclosure : Unfortunately , sudden disruptions like a job loss , divorce or prolonged illness affect someone ’s ability to timely make mortgage payments .
Before you fall behind , contact your bank as soon as you lose your job or anticipate increased costs due to illness or unexpected expensive home / car repairs .
Most banks will work with you in order to deal with these short - term emergencies .
They may allow you to pay a reduced monthly mortgage and might even waive any penalties or late fees .
Particularly in today ’s volatile economy , banks are aware of the fact that they may fare better in the long run if you keep your home , thus assuring them regular mortgage payments , instead of having to sell the home at a huge loss after foreclosure .
You may be required to produce proof of a prolonged illness or job loss , or even sell some of your assets , but this just might be worth it to save your home and possibly avoid a future bankruptcy filing .
Bankruptcy :
If your debt is too great and there simply is no way for you to make your current monthly mortgage payment , declaring Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy may allow you to keep your home .
There are significant differences between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 .
For instance , Chapter 7 may call for you to sell more assets in an exchange for liquidation of your debt .
With Chapter 13 , you actually make payments on your debt for a set period of time ( usually 3 - 5 years ) , while your creditors lower interest rates or forgive a portion of the debt in exchange for your promise to pay that set amount .
Additionally , in order to file under Chapter 7 , you must first meet certain income requirements .
If you have questions regarding bankruptcy , and how to avoid foreclosure , contact bankruptcy attorneys at the law office of Chang & Diamond today .
Peter Landin , who has died aged 78 of prostate cancer , was a complex character : a political radical , a gay - rights campaigner and an outstanding academic computer scientist .
With a burst of creativity in the 1950s and 60s , he laid the foundations for the software that runs the laptops , desktops PCs and the internet of today .
In the early days of computing , software written for one make of machine would not run on any other .
Computer scientists wanted to define " programming languages " that could be universally understood .
That this is normal today – the software of the internet , for example , can run on every kind of computer – is a consequence of Peter 's insight that the meaning of a computer program could be pinpointed in mathematical logic and liberated from the control of the manufacturer .
His impulses were always anarchic and subversive : his work started , literally , underground .
He was the leading light in a discussion group – run by the late , eccentric Mervyn Pragnell – unofficially housed in the basement of Birkbeck College , London , where Pragnell knew a lab technician who would unlock the door .
Pragnell prowled bookshops spotting people who were buying books on mathematical logic and would invite them to join his group .
Many leading computer scientists started their careers there .
Peter 's ideas were famously presented with humour .
The first programming languages had robotic names like Fortran and Snobol : when he first showed a programming language with a logical definition , he called it ISWIM , for " If You See What I Mean " .
That joke was a genuine technical breakthrough and the root of many subsequent developments , down to the Java and Javascript applications that now run the pages of the world wide web .
An only child born in Sheffield , Peter was the son of an accountant father who had been disabled in the first world war .
Peter went to King Edward VII school in the city .
During national service he amused himself by trying to drill a squad to imitate addition in binary arithmetic .
At Clare College , Cambridge , he completed the mathematics degree in two years , then attempted the very difficult master 's - level part three , but came away with a third - class degree .
After marriage to Hanne in 1960 , spells as a programmer in London , as a researcher in New York and as an academic at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , he returned in 1967 to Britain , to a chair at Queen Mary College in London , where he remained for the rest of his academic career , latterly as emeritus professor of theoretical computation .
He taught enthusiastically , to both students and the colleagues who worked , in effect , as his research assistants , and the influence of his ideas continued to spread , but increasingly he lost interest in the direction of computer science .
In any case , computing was never all of his life .
He was a radical in politics , a regular protester , and was arrested while on a demonstration with the Committee of 100 , the 1960s anti-war group founded by Bertrand Russell .
Peter was also an accomplished musician , and he would often end technical seminars by playing piano duets .
But , characteristically , he was interested in understanding rather than performance : each new piece was a challenge to be surmounted then surpassed .
Always bisexual , he threw himself into the politics of the Gay Liberation Front in the early 1970s .
He separated amicably from his wife in 1973 , and was closely in touch with her and his children till his death .
For the rest of his life he pursued gay politics , and his house in Rona Road , Camden , became a gay commune .
Always more of a facilitator than an activist , he saw many plots hatched at his dinner parties .
Aids : the Musical ! was conceived there , as was the reinvigoration of Gay Pride marches in the mid-80s , just in time for the battle over Clause 28 .
Towards the end of his life , Peter became convinced that computing had been a bad idea , giving support to profit - taking corporate interests and a surveillance state , and that he had wasted his energies in promoting it .
But whether he liked it or not , his ideas underpin developments to this day .
He is survived by Hanne and his children , Daniel and Louise .

I talked to a local source and the story is that they cut a triangular hole in the outer fence , walked down the road with banners , were passed by a vehicle full of Marine base security and got close to the fence surrounding the bunkers before they were stopped .
Handcuffed with zip ties , forced to lay face down and detained for 4 hours , they were lead back through the hole in the fence so they would not have to be logged onto and off of the base which would have been really embarrassing .
Navy officials say the five were cited for trespassing and released Monday afternoon .
They added at no time was the safety of Navy personnel , property , or the public threatened in any way .
Evidently there were phone calls made back to D.C. to figure out what to do with them and that is what took 4 hours .
The Trident submarine base at Bangor , just 20 miles from Seattle , is home to the largest single stockpile of nuclear warheads in the U.S. arsenal , housing more than 2000 nuclear warheads .
In November 2006 , the Natural Resources Defense Council declared that the 2,364 nuclear warheads at Bangor are approximately 24 percent of the entire U.S. arsenal .
The Bangor base houses more nuclear warheads than China , France , Israel , India , North Korea , and Pakistan combined .
I feel safer now .
Microsoft 's posted the clips from Family Guy 's killed hackathon that would 've shilled for Windows 7 , and they 're even more brain - liquefyingly stupid than I thought .
Just watch , but when your brains leak out your ears , do n't say I did n't warn you .

BBC News Magazine
The Bad Sex in Fiction Awards include some of writing 's biggest names .
So , do authors find it difficult to write about sex ?
Over the years , some of literature 's most glittering names have competed for one of its least coveted prizes .
Making out with a ' little pot of fire ' as Salman Rushdie would have it Ian McEwan , Salman Rushdie , John Updike and Philip Roth are titans among novelists , generally acclaimed for their representations of every kind of human experience - except one .
When writing about sex , says the Literary Review magazine , their standards slip .
All of these illustrious names have at some point been shortlisted for the Bad Sex in Fiction Awards , which were set up by the magazine 's editor Auberon Waugh in 1993 , to try to " draw attention to the crude , tasteless , often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel " .
This year 's offending passages do not immediately scream " guilty " on these three counts .
Among the nominees is Roth ...
It was as if she were wearing a mask on her genitals , a weird totem mask , that made her into what she was not and was not supposed to be
... Paul Theroux ...
Her hands were all over me , four hands it seemed , or more than four , and as she touched she made me weightless , lifting me off the table in a prolonged ritual of levitation
... Booker Prize winner John Banville ...
She puts her hands flat against his chest and leans into him in a simulacrum of a swoon , making a mewling sound
and musician Nick Cave ...
Bunny lies on his back on the sofa .
He is naked and his clothes sit in sad , little heaps on the living room floor
A PREVIOUS WINNER'S VIEW Food critic and novelist Giles Coren , who won in 2005
" It 's only difficult to write about sex if you 're a smutty little schoolboy .
My passage was n't very well written so I have n't got anything to defend , but really I was just the most well - known person who was prepared to show up and who had published a book with any sex in it .
The reason the award exists is because of a very defeatist , embarrassing , self - flagellatory approach to literature .
It 's an anti-literature award . "
Do even the best writers lose their touch when it comes to the most intimate of scenes ?
Booker Prize judge Lucasta Miller says sex has been at the centre of most of Western literature for centuries but too much of it nowadays reads like a " biology textbook " .
" A trap people fall into is an earnest anatomical description of sex .
The difficulty with the anatomical is that it can read like a bit of a textbook .
" To stop it doing so , they will put in flowery metaphors from the animal kingdom , but you do n't need that detail .
" When people use similes and metaphors in their anatomical depictions of the sexual organs , it 's toe - curling and embarrassing . "
You can write about sex in that way comically , she says , as JM Coetzee does very successfully in Summertime .
Instead , she says , authors should relate the emotion of sex , to stir the imagination of readers .
A WRITER'S VIEW
It 's not something I find difficult to approach but in teaching writing workshops , I know many writers do find it difficult but that 's to do with the reader , not the writer
Stella Duffy
" What do you read novels for ?
Because you are interested in the characters and their emotional state .
That 's the difference between porn and art . "
Sex is a subject best avoided altogether , says Melissa Katsoulis , a literary reviewer for the Times .
" If I was writing a novel , I would n't attempt to write it except in the most Victorian and prim way , because it 's awful .
" It 's a cliche , but the moments of genuine frisson in books are when hardly anything happens .
" When you have a dream about someone you fancy , it 's because they sat down next to you on the bus or something , not because you were at it , hammer and tongs .
" Either be suggestive or funny , but trying to do the nuts and bolts is n't going to work . "
Readers ' fault
But one author says the problem is not with the writer , but with the reader .
[ Boonyi ] pulled her phiran and shirt off over her head and stood before him naked except for the little pot of fire hanging low , below her belly , heating further what was already hot
Extract from Shalimar the Clown , by Salman Rushdie , nominated in 2005 " People will always assume that I 've had the sex I 've written about , but not the murder I 've written about or the flight across the sky in the magical realist novel I 've written , " says crime novelist Stella Duffy .
" At that point , the critic sitting on the writer 's shoulder starts to shout ' They 're going to think it 's you ! ' so a lot of writers just do n't bother . "
For the same reason , many writers become self - conscious and the writing suffers , says Ms Duffy , who advises other authors not to apply the same rules of writing to the subject of sex .
Changing the tense or the viewpoint may help .
And why are so many men nominated for the Bad Sex award , but not women ?
" In my experience men are not any worse at writing about sex , but perhaps people are just not used to hearing men in our culture talking about sexuality and sensuality . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
I never know what most sex scenes are trying to achieve in books ( and in other media , come to that ) .
It 's hard to tell if they 're going for an emotional response from the reader or just arousal .
I think the problem is that the reader does n't know either and ends up reading the scene and trying to take the wrong thing from it .
Alexander , Durham Terry Pratchett should win some sort of prize for the most understated sex scene ever .
" After a short while , the bedsprings went ' gloing ' "
Chris Boote , London , UK I suspect the reason authors do n't write well about sex is that they can't , but they think the readers want and expect it , when in fact they do n't .
Hence they resort to clumsy metaphors .
When they do write explicitly , it still comes out clumsy , and they all seem to write the same thing , as if from a standard manual .
A particularly excruciating example is Stuart Woods in his otherwise entertaining ' Stone Barrington ' novels .
Two examples of authors writing really well about sex are : ' The Case of Lucy Bending ' by Lawrence Sanders and ' Big Time ' by Marcel Montecino , both excellent stories in themselves .
Jim Robertson , East Kilbride
There are loads of great sex scenes and scenes of eroticism that occur in literature and the idea that they all occur ' when hardly anything happens ' is nonsense - Crash by JG Ballard , Glamorama by Bret Easton Ellis and Porno by Irvine Welsh all have some great full - on sex scenes , to name but a few ...
Steve Banks , Borehamwood
Thank you for thrusting the rapier of enquiry into the delicate flower of this subject .
Edward James , Southport
As a writer myself I have trouble writing sex from time to time , but mostly because I do n't want to fall into the trap of sounding like an excerpt from a dime - store smut novel .
Most of the time it 's rather laughable to me that a reader would expect that I 've had the sex I 'm writing about ; I 'm a woman , I do n't know what a guy feels , gay or straight , but I can sure make some educated guesses .
A lot of times writing sex is one part knowing how it works , one part knowing your characters and two parts actual creative skill .
I 've seen magical scenes that were " blurry watercolours " and others that were intensely detailed .
In my opinion half the fun of writing romance is seeing the vulnerability that emerges from characters in those scenes .
Just like in real life , you learn the most about someone from what they 're like in those moments and sometimes it completely changes the way you see not only the character but yourself .
Stephanie , Milwaukee , WI , USA I'm of the school of thought that if a writer can't describe a sex scene , they should do like old films and just pan the camera away , so to speak !
Sam Valdes Lopez , Sheffield
Films do n't depict sex very well either , there 's an obvious reason , to depict sex well , you depicts something that recreates sex in all it 's sticky mechanics and endings .
That 's porn .
And we do n't need porn in our films and books , because we prefer to be able to read them without having to deal the distractions that porn brings .
In the same way that you do n't swallow at wine tastings , as you 'll just get drunk .
However if people think they 're writing intensely erotically on the subject when they write such nonsense , perhaps they should just avoid it altogether and stick with the time honoured metaphor of a train going into a tunnel .
Nic , Nottingham
Not all scenes tend to be embarrassing or awkward .
I particularly find the scenes in Neil Gaiman 's work to be particularly ... effective .
There are some great sections of prose in his work Smoke & Mirrors , and especially the scene in American Gods when the main character copulates in a trance - like dream with a mysterious feline god .
I think it depends on how comfortable the author feels about the subject and how well they relate to audience .
Paul Barnes , Aberdeen , UK I hate to say it but there 's a distinct difference in how men and women write about sex and in how they read about sex too .
I reckon it's part of the old ' Men are from Mars ...' thing .
Men and Women have fundamentally different approaches to sex .
I think most blokes would probably expect sex in a book to be a bit titillating , and likely be keener on more physical descriptions .
I think most blokes do n't mind being strung a long a little to build the tension , but we demand that it happens eventually , and when it does , the intensity should equate to the build - up .
I think only women could be satisfied by reading something where nothing actually happens ...
Richard B , London
As a woman I find sex scenes in books do n't cover the emotions the character is feeling which seems strange to me as there are some very powerful emotions in sex - love , lust , passion , romance , security , vulnerability , trust , desire , jealousy etc ... we all know about the mechanics , its how you experience it that makes it unique to you .
Heather I 'm 97,000 words into a sort of vampire novel which has as its main protagonist , a female vampire .
Just like humans she enjoys sex .
Writing about it is pretty tricky : I worry about what other people will think of me when they read it and I worry about the words I should use , and how repetitive they might become .
Despite this , I plough on : the only way to do it is to use all the words at your disposal , your experience in the field and your imagination - as long as the words are appropriate and necessary .
The only word I 've drawn a a line at is the C word , but only because it 's not necessary to use it .
You have to be as honest and as straightforward as you can be .
If you feel you can't do it , then you should stop , drop a few hints as to what 's going to happen next and allow the reader 's imagination to do the work .
As for avoiding it altogether , what rubbish !
Writers should rise to the challenge , not run away from it - it 's only words , they 're not bullets .
And how very British to make it funny , anything but be honest and open , anything to avoid being embarrassed .

So according to a rather interesting column in last week ’s Detroit Free Press written by Rochelle Riley , it seems at least half of our incoming City Council members either already have their gun permits and are packing heat , or they are in the process of getting cleared to pack heat .
Damn .
OK , so maybe this was n’t the first story I wanted to read about our incoming City Council .
It ’s not that I do n’t still have high hopes for the new faces because I really do , but this is Detroit .
If this were any other city such a headline would n’t merit much more than a raising of the eyebrow , perhaps some animated discussion pro or con scattered here and there surrounding various and sundry workplace watercoolers .
But this is Detroit .
And in Detroit , which has become associated – even synonymous – with just about every form of violence and brutality ( wrongly or not ) , the image of newly elected council members packing guns is guaranteed to send the message of “ I told you so ” to all the wrong places .
Because if even the highly praised , apparently level - headed , drama - averse crew of civic leaders - to - be feels the need to keep one finger on the trigger ‘ just in case ’ then , well , damn .
And it ’s not that I ’m necessarily blaming them or calling them out as some sort of citizen ’s plea to disarm and unload , because I do n’t feel I have that right .
No , I do n’t own a gun and I doubt I ever will .
Still , I have quite a few friends who do and I do n’t begrudge them their right to bear arms because different folks respond in different self - preservationist ways to the very real threat that somebody on some day just might make a play to separate you from your life – or may attempt the same on a loved one .
In other words , these civic leaders of ours may be public figures but how they choose to defend themselves and the lives of their families is ultimately a private one regardless of the message it sends .
They owe the city their best service , but they most definitely do not owe us their lives or the lives of their families .
Maybe the best we can hope for is the swift arrival of a new Detroit where these kinds of headlines are somebody else ’s problem …

I ’ve been wanting to do this post for a long time .
It ’s something that has always bugged me .
There are certain game saves that are locked to the console itself .
Now this is n’t an issue as long as your PS3 does n’t break .
But what if you want to “ upgrade ” to the PS3 Slim ?
Or if your PS3 breaks down , and you get a different PS3 back from Sony ?
Even if you do a full back - up to a external hard drive .
It wo n’t restore the locked save data to a different PS3 .
But if you restore it to the same PS3 you did the back - up on , your fine .
For example if you upgrade your hard drive .
Most of the PS3 games are NOT locked , so this may not even be an issue for some .
I can understand locking save data .
But do n’t lock it to a specific PS3 .
Lock it to a PSN ID instead .
That way if you move to a different system you wo n’t lose all the hard work you ’ve done .
You could lock copyright - protected movies and music to a PSN ID as well .

Thanks go to Andrew for this .
I believe the game save data is now locked , but all game progress and created levels are now actually stored as game data rather than as a game save .
From in game you can export your profile , which generates a file in the save data folder , which can be copied around , and imported on another system .
This file appears to contain everything you would have expected to be in the save file ( character customization , single player progress & created levels ) .
You need to export your profile each time before you are able to save it to an external device .
Profile Locking
Red Faction Guerrila – copy locks your personal profile and settings , but not your game saves .
Mass Effect 2 Profile ( Game progress / Settings ) is locked .
Actual game save file for ME2 is not locked .
Games saves patched to remove copy protection :
Batman : Arkham Asylum ( Said to not have copy protection )
Gran Turismo 5
MotorStorm : Pacfic Rift
Resident Evil 5

A pregnant young woman , whose wedding was halted by social workers in an extraordinary row over whether she is bright enough to marry , is to have her baby boy forcefully removed from her at birth .
Kerry Robertson , 17 , who has mild learning difficulties , was this week told during a meeting with social workers they believe she is also not ëintelligent enoughí to look after her baby , due in January .
She will be allowed just a few hours with her baby , whom she has already named Ben .
But she and fiance Mark McDougall , 25 , will not be allowed to leave the hospital with Ben and he will then be placed with foster parents .
She said yesterday : " I could n't believe it when they told me I wouldnít be allowed to bring my baby home .
I feel sick all the time .
" I am so upset I donít know what to do with myself .
I know I am having a little boy and so I have already started buying baby clothes and am getting a nursery ready for him .
But now I can't take it in .
I do n't want to think about January and I canít stop crying . "
Last month Kerry , who is 26 weeks pregnant , was told her wedding was being halted just 48 hours before she was due to walk up the aisle because , according to social services , she ' did not understand the implications of getting married ' .
Her fiance Mark , an artist , added : " Seeing Kerry so upset is absolutely heartbreaking and I am very worried that all this stress she is under will affect our unborn baby 's health .
" We 're just devastated by this and at the moment we just do n't know how we are going to cope in January .
We have both already bonded with Ben and I can't even begin to think what it will be like coming home without him .
" It seems unbelievably cruel but social workers told us that after an hour or two with Ben , he will be placed into the care system .
They added neither Kerry nor myself will be allowed to remove him from the hospital .
" Social services are ruining our lives .
They say they do n't believe Kerry has the mental capacity to look after a baby but this is nonsense .
Kerry is n't even being given a chance to prove herself as a parent .
Yet , she is enjoying her pregnancy and would be a great mum . "
Mark said he would be happy to take on full responsibility for his son .
He added : " However , social workers just told me at the meeting to be quiet .
As we are not married - because social workers would not let us marry - it seems I have no rights as a dad at all .
" Kerry 's grandmother is trying to apply for custody of Ben but social services have already told us it is unlikely she will be successful .
" It seems social services have their hearts set on taking him away from all of us for good .
It looks like Ben will eventually be put up for adoption .
We feel totally helpless as there seems to be no way of stopping them . "
Kerry , from Dunfermline , Fife , has been in the care of her grandmother since she was nine months old after her parents were unable to look after her , with welfare overseen by social services at Fife Council .
In January , she met Mark , from Arbroath and when she became pregnant , they planned to marry .
But their plans were dramatically halted when in September , two days before their church wedding , two social workers arrived at the flat they had shared for four months and told them because of Kerry 's learning difficulties , their forthcoming marriage was illegal .
Under Scottish law , a registrar may refuse to marry a couple if he believes one or both the parties lack the mental capacity to understand what the institution of marriage is about .
In a highly unusual step , the registrar at Dunfermline Register Office refused to sanction the marriage after Fife Council wrote a letter of objection .
Mark said : " Everything was organised , from the church to Kerry 's wedding dress .
" Yet , despite arguing with the social workers that we loved one another and did n't want our baby to be born to unmarried parents , they would n't budge and we were forced to cancel our 40 guests . "
However , Kerry , who is still waiting to undergo an official psychological assessment , says her learning difficulties are not as severe as Fife Council make out .
" Last year I volunteered to help disabled children at my local primary school , " she says , " I have friends , a family who supports me and a fiance who loves me .
I do everything for myself . "
Meanwhile , Mark points out that whilst his fiance ' is not terribly academic ' , she can read and write .
" She is a loving caring person , who is enjoying being pregnant and would be a good mum , " he says , " I did n't even know she had learning difficulties until we'd been dating for two months and anyone who meets Kerry can see for themselves she is just a normal girl .
" For the first time in her life Kerry was truly happy .
We were both looking forward to having out baby .
But now our lives have been totally turned upside down and we are living a nightmare . "
Stephen Moore , Executive Director , Social Work Service said : " Much of the work we do is governed by legislation .
Complex decisions are made that balance risk and welfare while supporting people at times of personal or family need .
" We cannot discuss details of individual cases for reasons of confidentiality but give assurance that we will always work with people for the best outcome for all involved . "

US appellate court blocks lawsuit against extraordinary rendition and torture
By John Andrews
10 November 2009
For the second time in two years a federal appellate court has denied Canadian citizen Maher Arar the right to sue former Attorney General John Ashcroft and other US government officials for money damages based on his “ extraordinary rendition ” to Syria , where he was imprisoned without due process and tortured for almost a year .
On November 2 , a divided panel of eleven judges from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals , which reviews decisions from United States district courts in New York , Connecticut and Vermont , voted 7 - 4 that neither the Torture Victim Protection Act ( TVPA ) nor the Constitution itself provides a remedy for someone illegally seized by US authorities while traveling through the United States and sent halfway around the world specifically to be tortured into a confession .
( The ruling in Arar v. Ashcroft , including its four separate dissenting opinions , totals 184 pages and can be read here ) .
Last year a three - judge Second Circuit panel reached the same conclusion by a 2 - 1 vote , affirming the district court ’s initial dismissal of Arar ’s lawsuit in 2006 .
The recent decision came about because a majority of the Second Circuit ’s judges voted to rehear the case “ en banc . ”
This means all the judges on the bench , rather than just a panel , hear the case .
The US government ’s violations of Arar ’s human rights are clearly documented in the three - volume findings of the Canadian Government ’s Commission of Inquiry , released on September 18 , 2006 .
( See “ Bush administration denies responsibility for torture of Canadian ” ) .
Canada subsequently issued a formal apology for its role and paid Arar $ 10.5 million in compensation .
Arar emigrated from Syria to Canada at age 17 and lived with his wife and children in Ottawa , where he was employed by a Massachusetts - based software company .
On September 26 , 2002 , Arar , then age 32 , landed at New York ’s John F. Kennedy Airport .
While passing through immigration after disembarking a flight from Zurich to board a connecting flight to Montreal , a US official — acting on a supposed tip — accused him of “ being a member of a known terrorist organization , ” a charge which Arar vehemently denied at the time and which has never been supported by any evidence .
Arar ’s arrest was followed by two days of interrogation , during which he was chained and shackled , verbally abused and denied food .
Next Arar was transferred to a federal jail — the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn — where he was strip - searched and placed in solitary confinement for three more days .
His repeated requests for a telephone call and legal representation were ignored .
After five days in custody , the US Immigration and Naturalization Service filed deportation proceedings against Arar , even though he had said from the beginning that he simply wanted to leave the United States and continue on his journey home to Ottawa .
After the deportation case was filed , Arar was finally allowed to call a family member , who immediately contacted the Canadian consulate and arranged legal representation .
Arar met with his lawyer once , on October 5 .
The next day , US officials resumed interrogations behind the back of his lawyer , who was repeatedly lied to about her client ’s circumstances .
At 3:00 a.m. on October 8 , Arar was awakened , taken from the jail and put on a small jet bound for Amman , Jordan , without any hearing on his deportation .
The next day Jordanian authorities handed him over to Syria , which had refused to receive Arar directly from the US .
There , as described in the lead dissenting opinion , Arar “ was placed in a ‘ grave ’ cell measuring six feet long , seven feet high , and three feet wide … .
The cell was damp and cold , contained very little light , and was infested with rats , which would enter the cell through a small aperture in the ceiling .
Cats would urinate on Arar through the aperture , and sanitary facilities were nonexistent .
Arar was allowed to bathe himself in cold water once per week .
He was prohibited from exercising and was provided barely edible food .
Arar lost forty pounds .
“ During his first twelve days in Syrian detention , Arar was interrogated for 18 hours per day and was physically and psychologically tortured .
He was beaten on his palms , hips , and lower back with a two - inch - thick electric cable .
His captors also used their fists to beat him on his stomach , his face , and the back of his neck .
He was subjected to excruciating pain and pleaded with his captors to stop , but they would not .
He was placed in a room where he could hear the screams of other detainees being tortured and was told that he , too , would be placed in a spine - breaking ‘ chair , ’ hung upside down in a ‘ tire ’ for beatings , and subjected to electric shocks .
“ To lessen his exposure to the torture , Arar falsely confessed , among other things , to having trained with terrorists in Afghanistan , even though he had never been to Afghanistan and had never been involved in terrorist activity . ”
After holding him in custody for almost a full year with no charges , on October 5 , 2003 , Syria released Arar to Canadian officials in Damascus .
He was flown to Ottawa the following day and reunited with his family .
Writing for the seven - judge majority , Dennis Jacobs , a 1992 appointee of the first president George Bush , claimed that the TVPA did not apply because it covered only the actions of foreign governments , rejecting Arar ’s contention that the torturers were obviously acting in concert with and on behalf of the defendant US officials .
As the dissenters explained , “ the interrogations in the United States and Syria contained identical questions , including a specific question about his relationship with a particular individual wanted for terrorism .
In return , Arar alleges , the Syrian officials supplied US officials with all information extracted from Arar . ”
The argument that the TVPA would not apply under such circumstances is tantamount to a sheriff in the Jim Crow South claiming to not be responsible for the murder of a prisoner because all he did was open the jail doors for the lynch mob .
Next , Jacobs wrote that the law did not allow Arar to sue directly under the Constitution — what the law refers to as a Bivens claim — because “ the judicial review of extraordinary rendition would offend the separation of powers and inhibit this country ’s foreign policy . ”
Dissenting Judge Barrington D. Parker , Jr.—an appointee of the younger Bush — slammed this aspect of the ruling as an explicit abdication of the judiciary ’s role to check executive branch abuses by enforcing constitutional due process guarantees .
“ This view of the separation of powers , which confines the courts to the sidelines , is , in my view , deeply mistaken ; it diminishes and distorts the role of the judiciary especially during times of turmoil . ”
Another dissenter , Clinton - appointee Guido Calabresi , was unusually emphatic .
“ I believe that when the history of this distinguished court is written , today ’s majority decision will be viewed with dismay , ” he said at the beginning of his dissenting opinion .
Arar responded to the ruling with a statement issued through his attorneys at the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York City : “ After seven years of pain and hard struggle it was my hope that the court system would listen to my plea and act as an independent body from the executive branch .
Unfortunately , this recent decision and decisions taken on other similar cases , prove that the court system in the United States has become more or less a tool that the executive branch can easily manipulate through unfounded allegations and fear mongering .
If anything , this decision is a loss to all Americans and to the rule of law , ” Arar wrote .
Added Georgetown law professor , David Cole , who argued the case , “ This decision says that US officials can intentionally send a man to be tortured abroad , bar him from any access to the courts while doing so , and then avoid any legal accountability thereafter .
It effectively places executive officials above the law , even when accused of a conscious conspiracy to torture .
If the rule of law means anything , it must mean that courts can hear the claim of an innocent man subjected to torture that violates our most basic constitutional commitments . ”
Sonia Sotomayor participated in the hearing on December 9 , 2008 , but was appointed to the Supreme Court before the opinion filed , and therefore had no role in the final decision .
It seems likely that the Second Circuit delayed its ruling so that her vote in the case — whichever way it would have gone — would not be the subject of debate at her confirmation hearings .
In another case arising from the US government ’s “ extraordinary rendition ” program , the Ninth Circuit — which covers the western United States — has granted a request by the Obama administration for en banc review in Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan , Inc. , vacating last April ’s ruling by a three - judge panel that five men can sue a Boeing subsidiary for allegedly flying them to secret prisons around the world .
( See “ Appeals court rejects Obama state secrets claim in rendition case ” )
A decision in that case , where the Obama Attorney General Eric Holder has mimicked Bush administration arguments that allowing the case to proceed would disclose “ state secrets ” about CIA torture programs , is expected next year .

EastEnders is preparing to celebrate 25 years on screen
Scripts for Christmas editions of EastEnders have been stolen in a burglary at the home of one of the soap 's writers , the BBC has said .
Executive producer Diederick Santer said he is " keen " to recover the laptop which " contains the twists and turns of our exciting EastEnders Christmas " .
Actors destroyed their scripts after filming seasonal scenes to minimise the risk of leaks to the press .
This year 's specials will focus on dramatic events in the Queen Vic pub .
Jackson return
Precise details about the main storyline have been a closely - guarded secret .
The festive double bill will be screened on Christmas Day and often captures the soap 's biggest audience of the year .
In 2007 , EastEnders ' Christmas special in which the long - running affair between Max and daughter - in - law Stacey was revealed attracted 14 million viewers and was the most - watched programme of the year .
The soap has also announced the return of Billie Jackson , first played by actor Devon Anderson as a six - year - old in 1993 .
He will make a comeback to Albert Square along with mother Carol Jackson , sister Sonia - played by Natalie Cassidy - and Robbie Jackson ( Dean Gaffney ) early next year .
Carol 's eldest daughter Bianca , played by Patsy Palmer , made a return to the series earlier this year .
A Canadian teenager has been rescued unharmed , apart from minor frostbite , after drifting for almost three days on an ice floe together with two polar bear cubs and the carcass of their mother which he shot in self defence .
The 17 - year - old , who was named locally as Jupi Nakoolak , was suffering from hypothermia after the temperature fell below - 15C , but was otherwise well , conscious and speaking to his rescuers , who crawled across ice floes to reach him .
Nakoolak told them he shot the adult bear when it came too close , and then got as far away as possible on the ice from the cubs , which remained with the body .
He had been stranded since Saturday evening , when he and his 67 - year - old uncle got into trouble during a hunting expedition and the ice floe on which he was standing broke away .
Nakoolak 's only food was a small package of chocolate bars , dropped late on Sunday by a small aircraft chartered by the Canadian government , but the pilot and the crew of another plane lost sight of the teenager in the gathering darkness .
The search continued through the night , with flares being dropped to light up the frozen landscape .
But Nakoolak was not located until daylight yesterday .
The drama began when Nakoolak went hunting with his uncle Jimmy on Southampton Island in the northern part of Hudson Bay .
Their snowmobile broke down , and they set out walking towards a small settlement , Coral Harbour , about 11 miles from where they were stranded .
The pair were reported missing when they failed to return by Saturday night .
The older man was picked up on Sunday morning , still searching for his nephew .
A search by boat , snowmobile , 4X4s and air was launched .
It was only on Monday morning that a military search and rescue plane spotted him again on the ice , which had drifted about 20 miles from where the snowmobile had broken down .
Two crew members parachuted on to a larger floe , and then crawled on their bellies to reach him .
All three were then picked up by boat , and the youth was flown to join his uncle in hospital in Churchill .
Jean - Pierre Sharp , an official with the Canadian forces joint rescue co-ordination centre in Ontario , said the teenager was " in decent shape " .
" Even after spending hours alone , huddling in temperatures that dipped below - 15C , the teen appeared to be in decent shape .
He was conscious , slightly hypothermic and appeared to have some frostbite . "
Rob Hedley , the senior administrative officer at Coral Harbour , where dozens of residents had joined in the search , spoke to him when he was first taken to the local health centre .
Hedley told Canadian television : " It 's quite incredible that he 's in such good shape ….
As much as the polar bear is a bit of a dramatic aspect of it , he had his weapon with him , thank goodness .
But also it 's basically surviving three days out on the land with little food or water .
I was expecting this not to end as happily as it did . "
BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The booming gold price is making me very nervous .
About Wall Street .
Why ?
Because gold 's rocketing boom -- it 's risen from around $ 260 an ounce about a decade ago to just under $ 1,200 now -- is a vivid daily example of what a real bull market looks like .
History says that such massive bull markets -- like equities from 1982 to 1999 , or commodities in the ' 70s or real estate from the mid-'90s to 2005 -- usually start only after a big bear market ends .
Sounds like common sense , yes ?
Maybe even a banality .
But here 's the problem :
Those holding a lot of stocks right now are taking a gamble that the big bear market on Wall Street , which began in 2000 , ended earlier this year .
They 're betting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , +1.19 % , now 10,309 , wo n't tumble again toward , or even below , the intraday low of 6,440 seen on March 9 .
Are they right ?
No one yet knows for certain .
Looking back to early March , there certainly was a lot of panic and capitulation , which you usually see at a market bottom .
People talked of a new " Great Depression . "
One thing I noted at the time was that investors were shying away even from rock - solid defensive stocks with big , well - protected dividend yields .
People were n't just scared ; they were petrified .
Is that really how a massive bear market usually ends ?
The last example before our eyes was gold , whose big bear market ended a decade ago .
It looked very different .
Like shares in the 1930s and the early 1980s , gold ended its secular bear market in 1999 - 2001 with a whimper , not a bang .
People did n't panic ; they simply lost interest .
I remember calling around gold analysts in London in 2000 , when gold was near its lows .
There were n't many left ; most of them had been laid off years earlier , as investor demand had dried up .
The few who remained generally earned their keep by advising gold - mining companies on how to use the futures market to sell their output .
It was dull work in a dull market .
Key fact :
Almost none of the analysts was bullish on gold !
A number of them gave me reason upon reason why gold was going to fall even lower .
Everyone now pretends they were buying gold back then .
But of course if they had been , gold would n't have fallen as low as it did .
I actually know two investors who really were buying .
Everybody else rolled their eyes or laughed at them .
Gordon Brown , Britain 's hapless and accident - prone prime minister , was the chancellor of the exchequer , or Treasury secretary , at the time .
He chose to sell more than half of Britain 's entire gold reserves near the lows .
According to Her Majesty 's Treasury , the government sold about 395 tonnes in 17 auctions between 1999 and 2001 , raising around $ 3.5 billion .
The average sale price worked out at around $ 275 per troy ounce .
At today 's price of $ 1,178 , those same 395 tonnes would sell for $ 15 billion .
Put it another way , the move cost Her Majesty 's government , or the British taxpayer , a stunning $ 11.5 billion in lost profits .
“ Britain sold about 395 tonnes of gold in 17 auctions between 1999 and 2001 , raising around $ 3.5 billion .
At today 's price of $ 1,178 , those same 395 tonnes would sell for $ 15 billion . ”
Hindsight is 20 - 20 .
( The Treasury also made back a small amount of those losses by moving some of the money in currencies like the euro , which have risen . )
What is important here is that Brown 's move was not especially controversial at the time .
Yes , some people warned it was a bad move , but they were a small minority .
Some in the City of London criticized the way the government handled the sale .
Yet the overall direction of the move -- cutting Britain 's holdings of the " barbarous relic " of gold for more " productive " assets -- enjoyed broad support among the financial community .
Indeed , around the same time other European central banks ( notably the Swiss , Dutch and Belgian governments ) quietly sold even more gold than Britain did -- more than 2,000 tonnes in all .
( An aside : The U.S. Treasury kept its 8,134 tonnes .
These show up in the national accounts as an asset of just $ 11 billion , because for historic reasons the gold is booked at just $ 42 an ounce .
But at today 's prices , the gold is really worth $ 308 billion , and account for the bulk of the U.S. government 's entire foreign - currency reserves . )
Ten years ago , pension funds and institutional investors around the world held little gold , if any .
Merrill Lynch 's monthly survey of institutional fund managers , probably the best barometer of their collective sentiment , did n't even include a question about gold until I ( as it happens ) asked them to start about five or six years ago .
Gold was such a nonissue that neither Merrill Lynch nor the fund managers had noted the absence .
This is how , on the financial markets , a big bear market tends to die .
Not in a dramatic hail of gunfire , like Wall Street last March , but quietly , unnoticed , in the night of old age .
No , this does n't mean we necessarily have to see new lows in stocks .
Financial markets do n't function like clockwork .
It is notable that even fund legend Jeremy Grantham , a long - standing bear , thinks we probably did see the lows last March .
( My own preference , as an investor , is to buy good - quality companies when they look cheap , regardless of what I think of the market or the economy . )
But history says a generational bull market , like Wall Street from 1982 to 1999 , is usually followed by a generational bear market .
I 'd feel a lot more comfortable about stocks if everyone had lost interest completely , like they did in gold 10 years ago .
A Roman Catholic group at the centre of an inquiry into child abuse in Ireland today offered € 161 m ( £ 145 m ) in cash and land to make amends to its victims .
The Christian Brothers , which ran the Republic 's notorious Industrial Schools and orphanages , said they will hand over up to €30 m to an Irish government trust fund , and will also give € 4 m for abuse victims ' counselling services .
In their statement the Christian Brothers said they will also transfer land valued at € 127 m to joint ownership of the government and the Edmund Rice Schools Trust .
They said their decision had been taken in the light of the publication this May of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse , known as the Ryan report .
" The range of incremental measures outlined above follow the Christian Brothers ' acceptance , shame and sorrow at the findings of the Ryan report , " the statement said .
" We understand and regret that nothing we say or do can turn back the clock for those affected by abuse .
" Our fervent hope is that the initiatives now proposed will assist in the provision of support services to former residents of the institutions as well as the facilities , resources and scope to protect , cherish and educate present and future generations of children . "
The Christian Brothers ' announcement came 24 hours before a separate report into clerical child abuse in the Dublin Diocese .
The 750 - page report was cleared for publication last Thursday in Dublin 's high court , which was dealing with legal challenges from members of the clergy .
Victims ' organisations have called on the Irish government to give them copies of the Dublin Diocese report before its publication .
The long running commission of inquiry into the Dublin Archdiocese has investigated allegations against 46 priests .
The report will be censored in parts so as not to prejudice ongoing or potential criminal cases .
Ireland 's minister for education , Batt O'Keeffe , has urged other religious congregations to come forward with financial offers .
A spokesperson for the minister said they would not be commenting on the Christian Brothers ' offer until all others had been received .
The minister has received the so - called panel report , an independent assessment of the assets and liabilities of the 18 congregations involved , and that is being considered at the moment .
The spokesperson declined to say how many congregations still had to come forward with financial proposals .
Meanwhile , an Irish bishop apologised to a victim of Father Michael Molloy , who was sentenced to five years in jail on Monday .
The 44 - year - old priest pleaded guilty to two counts of defiling a boy and one of possessing child pornography .
The offences took place Molloy 's parochial house , among other places .
The Obama administrations decision to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the self - described mastermind behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks , and four alleged co-conspirators in civilian court is a laudable return to the rule of law from the Bush administrations kangaroo military commissions , which convened offshore in Guantanamo to avoid giving defendants full legal rights under domestic or international law .
But it is not enough .
Conservative commentators harshly criticized the move as either giving the heinous terrorists a break or , in the words of Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , treating the 9/11 attackers as  common criminals . 
Even liberals on the MSNBC television network couldnt seem to grasp the greatest significance of Obamas move , saying that it would restore U.S. prestige around the world .
Sen .
Cornyns comments indicate that conservatives , in their haste to conduct their own crusade against a non-Christian religion , would rather buy into the terrorists  warped conception of themselves as holy warriors than treat them for what they are : dastardly common murderers .
The liberals would rather have other countries like the United States than focus on the restoration of constitutional safeguards .
The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution says that  No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the Militia , when in actual service in time of War or public danger .
. . .
The Sixth Amendment ensures the defendant , for all criminal prosecutions , a public jury trial in the state or district in which the crime was committed , which includes getting a list of specific accusations , being confronted with hostile witnesses and compelling favorable witnesses , and having the right to a defense counsel .
The exception for the Fifth Amendment includes an alternative justice system only for U.S. military personnel during wartime , not unlawful enemy combatants .
Thus , despite earlier precedents in U.S. history , including during World War II , military tribunals for enemies are unconstitutional , especially when they violate many of the requirements of the Sixth Amendment .
Thus , the main benefit of Obamas move is partially restoring a constitutional justice system after years of Bush administration abuse .
Yet at least five other Guantanamo prisoners , and likely many more , will be denied a civilian trial .
These five are being held for an attack on the USS Cole , an American warship , in 2000 .
Ostensibly , hitting a military target means a trial in a military tribunal .
Although Obama has improved safeguards in such tribunals , the reality that some terrorists get better justice than othersevidently the more people you kill , the more justice you get smacks of prosecution forum - shopping in order to get convictions .
Administration officials even admit that the vast majority of Guantanamo prisoners will continue to be held indefinitely without any kind of trial .
Even more horrible , acknowledged innocent people will be held until a foreign country accepts them , because U.S. administrations have been politically scared to admit they terribly wronged these people and release them into the United States .
Undermining even the civilian trials is the unlikelihood that any of the 9/11 defendants would be released even if acquitted .
U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder declined to say whether this was possible .
In any normal trial , it is a given .
Holding a high - profile prisoner even after he is exonerated could subvert the perceived fairness of the U.S. justice system even further .
Autocracies hold show trials ; a republic does not .
But if these defendants are treated as any other similarly accused murderers , bringing them to justice in a civilian court is one step out of the abyss .
Paedophile to be beheaded and crucified in Saudi Arabia for string of sex attacks where he left toddler to die in desert
Tough justice :
The man lost his appeal at a court in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia
A man in Saudi Arabia is to be beheaded and crucified after he raped five children and left one of them , a three - year - old boy , to die in the desert .
An appeal court in the capital Riyadh approved the death sentence handed down in June by judges in the northwestern oasis city of Hail where the convicted 22 - year - old man carried out his crimes .
The rapist - who was not named - was arrested several weeks ago as he tried to seize another boy after offering him a ride home from school .
The seven - year - old - who escaped unharmed - helped identify the culprit .
The man ’s victims were aged between three and seven .
He was said to have lured them into his car as they left school at midday and then drove them to remote desert locations to rape them .
An investigation was launched after a 25 - year - old father reported that his three - year - old son was missing and that he suspected the kidnapper to be a male driver of a white four - wheel drive vehicle .
The infant was later found under a scorching sun in the desert where he had died of thirst .
A panel of three judges in Hail sentenced the rapist to death for “ abhorrent ” crimes which they said had terrorised the community .
Crucifixion in the conservative desert Kingdom means tying the convict ’s body to wooden beams to be displayed to the public after he is decapitated by a professional swordsman .
Saudi Arabia has executed 56 people this year under laws that allow the death penalty for rape , murder , apostasy , armed robbery and drug trafficking .
In extreme cases , the convict is executed and his body crucified in public .
SAN FRANCISCO , Nov 9 ( Reuters ) - LinkedIn and Twitter have linked up .
Starting immediately , users of LinkedIn and Twitter can cross - file to each other ’s services , by checking a box on either Twitter or LinkedIn .
LinkedIn is the largest professional social network , with 50 million members around the world who post information about themselves , such as resumes , to help find jobs or employees , and to stay in touch with each other .
Twitter allows people to broadcast short messages up to 140 characters to subscribers , who are called “ followers . ”
Linked
In also has an update box , which happens to be 140 characters .
Allen Blue , a co-founder of Twitter who is its vice president of product strategy , said Linked In members would be able to automatically post recent Tweets if they wanted .
Blue said users will have the option of sending only selected materials to Twitter .
He said that in addition to the obvious advantage of increasing the audience for either tweets or Linked In information there were two other advantages to the new system .
Twitter “ wants to take advantage of the strong identity in Linked In to make those professional tweeters more successful . ”
While anyone may sign up for a Twitter account without revealing their real identity , LinkedIn is based on the social networking idea that people put their identities on the Web .
Second , Linked
In users who cross -post will be speaking both to their followers and to the broader Twitter audience that searches for tweets by keywords , location , user and the most current , Blue said .

Both Democrats and Republicans were invited to the White House US President Barack Obama has said his review of Afghan strategy will not look at pulling out or cutting troop levels .
Mr Obama told key members of Congress that he would decide on a course of action with a sense of urgency - but that not everyone would be pleased .
But a source said he did not pledge to increase troop numbers as his top general in Afghanistan wants .
The meeting came on the eve of the eighth anniversary of the start of the US - led Afghan military operation .
It was launched to oust the Taliban from Afghanistan following the 11 September attacks on the US .
' Rigorous and deliberate ' About 30 senior congressional figures - Democrats and Republicans - had been invited to the meeting with the US leader .
ANALYSIS Mark Mardell , BBC News , Washington
President Obama is narrowing his options in Afghanistan , probably in reaction to media speculation .
He told a meeting of his most senior security advisers last week that pulling out was not an option : it was n't on the table .
Now he has used his meeting with senior politicians of both parties on the Hill to make it clear he's not going to slash troop numbers or narrow the goals to only targeting the top terrorists .
Read Mark 's thoughts in full Divisions are emerging between some Democrats concerned by the prospect of deploying more US forces to Afghanistan and some Republicans urging the Obama administration to follow the advice of top generals and increase troop levels .
President Obama told the group that his assessment would be " rigorous and deliberate " and that he would continue to work with Congress in the best interests of US and international security .
According to one White House source , he told the meeting that he would not shrink the number of troops in Afghanistan or opt for a strategy of merely targeting al - Qaeda leaders .
But he would not be drawn on sending additional troops - which his top commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , requested last week .
Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that there had been some agreement but also some " diversity of opinion " during the talks .
Former Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain urged Mr Obama to take heed of the advice given by generals on the ground .
A US official , quoted by Reuters news agency , said of the meeting : " He ... made it clear that his decision wo n't make everybody in the room or the nation happy , but underscored his commitment to work on a collaborative basis . "
Afghan strategy
The BBC's Mark Mardell , in Washington , says there appears to be a frustration that the review of strategy has some times been portrayed in black and white terms of a massive increase or reduction of troop numbers .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We seem to be locked into a situation that may turn out to be a humiliating defeat Peter Lee , Morecambe Dr Anthony Cordesman , an adviser to General McChrystal , told the BBC the decision was much more complex than was being portrayed .
" It is a very big decision and it involves a great deal more than simply troop levels .
" There 's a decision as to what strategy to pursue , how committed to stay in Afghanistan , how to deal with Nato and Isaf [ International Assistance Security Force ] allies , how to reshape the aid programme - and how to deal with the future of the Afghan government .
" So this is much more than simply a military strategy decision . " ' Serious '
By the end of 2009 there will be a total of 68,000 US troops in Afghanistan , based on current deployment plans .
US media reflects bitter debate Indecision reveals uncertainty President Obama has said the strategy in Afghanistan must be agreed before a decision can be made on troop numbers .
Gen McChrystal had described the situation in Afghanistan as " serious " and is believed to have requested up to 40,000 additional troops .
He is believed to want the focus of the strategy to fall on protecting the Afghan people and carrying the fight to the Taliban .
Future US strategy will be discussed in a series of Obama administration meetings this week .
On Wednesday President Obama is holding his third of five meetings with his National Security Council , as well as field commanders and regional ambassadors .

Keeping up with the Indians
By Paul Staniland
Saturday ’s New York Times reports that Pakistan has expanded its maritime land - attack missile program , possibly based on modifications to U.S. - provided anti-ship Harpoons .
News like this fuels concerns that the Pakistani establishment is not taking the internal security threat seriously enough , instead favoring its standard obsession with India .
In this view , the expansion of both conventional and nuclear weapons programs shows that Pakistan is not serious about its wars within , instead myopically focusing on a status quo India that poses no real threat to Pakistan .
There is certainly merit to the argument that Pakistan simply “ does n’t get it ” when it comes to fighting the Taliban .
The Pakistan Army has a deeply - ingrained organizational distrust of India and strong incentives to continue building and buying expensive new systems , rather than getting into the dirty , cruel , complex business of counterinsurgency on its northwestern frontier .
The Army has made various destabilizing and counterproductive mistakes , whether supporting radical militant groups , undermining electoral democracy , or contributing to nuclear proliferation .
The U.S. has good reasons to make sure that its agreements with Pakistan are not being violated .
U.S. military aid can be terminated if the US deems that the use of these weapons , like the possible Harpoon modification , are against American interests or being adapted for purposes other than their intended use .
But it is important to keep in mind that continued Pakistani military modernization is not irrational given Pakistan ’s dangerous security environment .
India is hugely powerful relative to its neighbors , with a massive population , a large and capable military , nuclear weapons , and a growing economy that is slowly but surely fueling its own military modernization and doctrinal evolution .
Pakistani forces are outgunned and outmanned by India , and the country would ultimately lose in a large - scale land war across the plains of Punjab and Sindh / Rajasthan .
This is a crucial reason that Pakistan has tried to improve its conventional capabilities , adopted a first - use nuclear posture , sponsored bloody terrorism and insurgency in India , and looked to the U.S. and China for military , financial , and diplomatic support .
As India further grows , its power will be even more threatening to Pakistan , whether or not India intends it to be .
This fear is not simply the result of Pakistani domestic politics , ideology , or military worldview , though those also crucially matter .
Because of its power , India is viewed with a measure of suspicion throughout the South Asian periphery — Sri Lanka has made sure to hedge its bets by cozying up to China and Pakistan ( and in the late 1980s even provided weapons to the Tamil Tigers against an Indian peacekeeping force ) , while Bangladesh and Burma in the past have both at least tacitly provided sanctuary to insurgents trying to secede from India .
Neither Americans nor Indians always understand how threatening their military strength can look to weaker countries .
This dynamic is clearly at play in the case of Pakistan — Indians feel that they are self - evidently not a threat , while Americans are often baffled that Pakistani security elites care so much about India , which to the U.S. looks like a positive force for stability and democracy .
At the end of the day , however , the world does not look the same from Rawalpindi and Islamabad as it does from Washington , and the U.S. needs to remember these differing goals , incentives , and fears as it pursues its vital interests in the region .
The Pakistan Army absolutely cannot be given a free hand to direct American money against India or to violate agreements about the use of U.S. weapons and aid .
But the U.S. should not assume that Pakistani military modernization is an unambiguous sign of its lack of commitment to internal security .
Indeed , India itself has expanded its conventional and nuclear forces with an eye on China even as it battles various separatist and Maoist insurgencies at home .
It should come as no surprise that Pakistan is similarly trying to keep up with its own larger and increasingly powerful neighbor .

KANDAHAR , Afghanistan |
The sirens blared as a Taliban rocket attack rattled troops across Kandahar Air Field for the second time last week .
Army Sgt. 1st Class Teresa R. Coble and other members of her unit at the base ’s media - support center hit the floor , lay flat on the dusty cement and protected their heads with their hands .
Later , the unit moved to cement - reinforced bunkers until the all - clear sounded .
While the Obama administration debates whether to send tens of thousands more U.S. troops to Afghanistan and Afghans prepare to vote for president for the second time in four months , some of those already braving rockets and bombs worry that their mission has lost the support of the U.S. public and that their sacrifices - and those of their fallen comrades - have been in vain .
“ What about the troops who died giving their lives for this mission ? ” Sgt. Coble asked as she waited for the rocket alert to finish .

• EXCLUSIVE : Rental industry hopes to buy influence on Hill
By next August , Sgt. Coble , 27 , from Germantown , will have served more than 30 months combined in Iraq and Afghanistan , far from her only child , five - year - old Troy Davis .
“ We would not be honoring the lives of the troops who died if we left here without finishing our mission , and many troops are concerned that the American people have forgotten why we came here to begin with , ” she said .
“ If we left Afghanistan right now , its equivalent to somebody going up to help a rape victim , engaging in a fight to help that rape victim , then giving up because they didnt want to get hurt themselves and allowing that rape to continue , ” she said .
“ Because essentially thats what the Afghan population is :
They are victims , and we need to follow through with what we promised . ”
Others interviewed by The Times were less supportive of the eight - year war and less certain that adding more U.S. forces would defeat a tenacious and growing Taliban insurgency or reduce corruption in the Afghan government .
Several asked not to be named so that they could voice their opinions candidly without retribution from their superiors .
One young soldier , who had arrived at Kandahar Air Field from a forward operating base along the Pakistan - Afghan border , said his unit had suffered a number of casualties .
“ I used to believe in what we were doing here , ” the soldier said .
“ I ’m not too sure anymore .
It ’s just we do n’t know what the endgame is .
We ’ve been getting hit hard out here .
What are we here to win ?
I have to believe that what Gen. [ Stanley M. ]
McChrystal is doing is going to work .
But who knows how long that will last before someone else decides to change the game plan again ?
I mean , do the people in Washington even remember we ’re here ? ”
Others said they had difficulty working with some members of the Afghan National Army , which they described as disorganized and in some cases untrustworthy .
Gen. McChrystal , the commander of U.S. - led forces in Afghanistan , seeks to increase the size and quality of the Afghan army as the mainstay for Afghan security in the future .
“ I do n’t trust them , ” said one U.S. soldier who said he had worked closely with Afghan military personnel during multiple tours in Afghanistan .
“ They make it impossible for us , and we have to work around it .
I understand that we ’re trying to aid the Afghans in securing their own country , but we ’re up against some of the worst corruption I ’ve ever known .
It puts our lives in danger . ”
In Kabul , Army Maj .
Pedro Espinoza said he supported Gen. McChrystal ’s plans and believed in the mission despite its difficulties .
“ I have hope in what we ’re doing here , ” Maj .
Espinoza said , as he donned armor in preparation for the short ride from International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) headquarters to Kabul airport .
“ Look , if I did n’t have hope , I would n’t be here .
I would n’t be doing what I ’m doing .
It ’s as simple as that . ”
Polish Col. Jacek Rolak , who was also in the convoy , was n’t as hopeful .
He joked with Maj. Espinoza and said he was grateful to be leaving Afghanistan .
“ I ’m not too sure things will work out the way we would like , ” Col .
Rolak said . ” I ’m not sure what ’s going to happen , or how good any strategy is in Afghanistan .
Guess we just wait and see . ”
U.S. troops here deal daily with death and injury , seeing comrades hurt and watching flag - draped coffins go through forward operating bases on their final trip home .
Many are also haunted by the faces of Afghan people the U.S. is trying to help .
In Kabul , Army Pvt. 2nd Class Logan Purtlebaugh sent e-mails to her family from the comfort of her bunk bed .
Her Myrtle Beach pink blanket , books strewn on her bed and periodic breaks to brush her long , blond hair made the 19 - year - old seem more like a university student in a dorm than a soldier in a barracks .
The young chaplain ’s assistant with the 82nd Airborne , 4th Brigade , at Camp Lindsey , not far from Kandahar Air Field , was on a nine - day break in the Afghan capital .
The policy debate back in Washington was not on the mind of this soldier from Bloomington , Ind .
Instead , she was thinking about the accidental death of an Afghan child she recently had witnessed in Kandahar .
“ It ’s the first time I ’m dealing with death , ” said Pvt. Purtlebaugh , who is on her first deployment .
“ I ’ll never forget what happened . ”
She folded down her laptop and stared into the darkness .
“ He ran out in front of the MRAP [ Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle ] , and there was no time for the driver to stop , ” she said .
“ The little boy ’s head was decapitated .
It was horrible for everybody involved .
Especially for the family of the boy . ”
The young victim “ seemed to be about the same age as my seven - year - old sister , Madison Purtlebaugh , ” she said .
“ I really miss home , but this is where I want to be .
I believe in the Afghan people .
I have hope despite everything . ”
Sgt. Coble urged Americans to think about the sacrifices U.S. troops have made in Aghanistan and the consequences of narrowing the mission before it has more time to succeed .
“ We ’re not just numbers , ” she said .
“ I ’m not going to say morale is high with everything going on at home .
We ’re here for a reason .
This is not a draft military .
When people go out on the streets in America and say , ‘ Bring our troops home , ’ it infuriates me .
Do n’t go out there talking about bringing our troops home , let us decide when to come back home .
We ’re here because we want our children , my son , to have a safer world , and we know the risks . ”

A Universe Optimized for Starships ?
When you consider that conventional chemical rockets extract a mere 10 - 8 of the energy locked up in their fuel , the attraction of antimatter becomes undeniable .
Could we build an engine that extracts 100 percent of the energy created by matter - antimatter annihilation ?
Louis Crane ( Kansas State University ) is dubious , pointing to problems of storage and the difficulty of making enough antimatter to get the job done .
Black Holes as a Propulsion Option
Working with colleague Shawn Westmoreland , Crane has been exploring a different and far more speculative option for upping the energy extraction levels .
What about using black holes for propulsion ?
Specifically , Crane and Westmoreland ask whether Hawking radiation from black holes can power a starship , calculating that a black hole of about a million tons would be just the right size , small enough to generate the needed Hawking radiation , while large enough to survive for the duration of a century - long star crossing .
Adam Crowl has written fascinatingly about this in Crowlspace .
Crane and Westmoreland ’s paper on using Hawking radiation for this purpose has been kicking around on the Net for a bit , never quite making it to the top of the queue here , but Marcus Chown gives it a good look in the latest New Scientist , so let ’s pause to examine it now .
Rather than finding a nearby black hole , the two suggest using a gamma ray laser powered by solar energy to create one .
The energy needed would be enormous , calling for solar panels 250 kilometers across in close solar orbit , a Robert Forward - esque engineering challenge .
Image :

But if you could create such solar panels and let them soak up the needed sunlight to power up your black hole production facility , you ’d wind up with something tiny that offered tremendous power .
Says Chown :
The resulting million - tonne black hole would be about the size of an atomic nucleus .
The next step would be to manoeuvre it into the focal range of a parabolic mirror attached to the back of the crew quarters of a starship .
Hawking radiation consists of all sorts of species of subatomic particles , but the most common will be gamma ray photons .
Collimated into a parallel beam by the parabolic mirror , these would be the starship ’s exhaust and would push it forward .
Darwinian Selection Among Universes
Crane and Westmoreland think a starship powered this way could accelerate to close to the speed of light in a few decades , fast enough that relativistic time dilation would occur and vast distances could be crossed by human crews .
Interestingly , a black hole starship like this should create gravitational waves that might be detectable here on Earth , assuming some nearby extraterrestrial civilization were using the technology .
If coalescing black holes and neutron stars ought to be producing low - frequency gravitational waves , a black hole starship should leave a gravitational signature at ultra-high frequencies .
Chown does a good job with this material , and I recommend you check out his New Scientist article .
He points to Lee Smolin ’s idea that at the singularity of a black hole , new universes could be created and bud off from their parent .
It stands to reason , then , that universes that are optimized for black holes are those likely to give rise to more and more such universes .
And if we could make our own black holes , then life would play a role in making infant universes proliferate .
[ Crane ] believes we are seeing Darwinian selection operating on the largest possible scale : only universes that contain life can make black holes and then go on to give birth to other universes , while the lifeless universes are an evolutionary dead end .
His latest calculations made him realise how uncanny it was that there could be a black hole at just the right size for powering a starship .
“ Why is there such a sweet spot ? ” he asks .
The only reason for an intelligent civilisation to make a black hole , he sees , is so it can travel the universe .
“ If this hypothesis is right , ” he says , “ we live in a universe that is optimised for building starships ! ”
I do n’t have time this morning to get into Chown ’s discussion of Jia Liu ( New York University ) , who has concocted a spacecraft powered by dark matter , but in any case the Jia Liu paper was in queue for next week , so we ’ll talk about it then .
Talk about living on the speculative edge — we do n’t even know what dark matter is at this point !
But as fun as these ideas are to kick around , they also let us roam through broad questions of cosmology and physics in ways that can provoke discussion and help us illuminate our current propulsion constraints .
Marcus Chown ’s article is “ Dark Power : Grand Designs for Interstellar Power , ” New Scientist 25 November , 2009 ( available online , but get it fast before it disappears behind the magazine ’s firewall ) .

While it is a routine operation — nearly 500,000 are performed in the United States every year — the myths about vasectomies fester .

While it is a routine
operation — nearly 500,000 are performed in the United States every year — the
myths about vasectomies fester .
In fact , the
outpatient procedure is a simple form of birth control for men , intended to be
permanent , in which the health care provider closes or blocks the tubes that
carry sperm .
This prevents sperm from leaving the body or causing pregnancy ; the
body instead absorbs it .
Used as birth control , vasectomies are nearly 100
percent effective .
Of course ,
vasectomies are not for everyone .
Particularly , they must be weighed against a
person or couple ’s desire to have children in the future — considering such dire
circumstances that may intervene in one ’s life , such as death or divorce .
While
vasectomies can sometimes be reversed , the procedure is intended to be
permanent ; reversals do not always work .
Doctors warn against depending upon it

Jason , a
38 - year - old man from Turlock , California who had a vasectomy and asked that his
last name not be used , said that vasectomies seem to be shrouded in mystery for
most men .
“ They do n’t
understand that it is virtually painless , ” Jason said .
“ It is extremely safe .
Also ,
most men are extremely protective and shy about male organs , outside of being
in a sexual situation .
To think that some doctor will be cutting them open and
doing stuff turns off a lot of men to the idea . ”
Julius ,
a 49 - year - old from Winston - Salem , North Carolina , noticed a similar sort of
thinking .
“ Men
always seem to cringe when vasectomies are discussed , like it would really hurt , ”
Julius said .
“ I was in so little pain that I did have intercourse the evening
of the procedure , and there was no pain involved .
I had the procedure on a
Friday , and was easily back to my desk job on Monday . ”
Still ,
the mystery about vasectomies persists — and it is most prevalent outside the
United States .
About 43 million men around the world have undergone voluntary
sterilization — compared to 180 women who have chosen sterilization , despite the
fact that vasectomies are far simpler , safer , and more affordable than tubal
litigation .
A vasectomy costs anywhere from $ 350 to $ 1,000 ; female
sterilization costs nearly six times as much .
( Medicaid covers sterilization
for both men and women . )
“ Vasectomy is
extremely rare in all but a few industrialized countries and China , ” according
to “ In Their Own Right , ” a 2003 report from the Guttmacher Institute on the
reproductive and sexual health of men .
It further reports that most men in their
forties and early fifties do not want more children .
Vasectomies are most prevalent in
North America , parts of Western Europe , and China ; it is nearly nonexistent in
much of Africa , Latin America and Eastern Europe .
And yet , cued by
a tight economic outlook around the world , many people are considering
permanent birth control .
Besides wanting to prevent against unexpected
pregnancies , men in precarious jobs often want to have the procedure while they
still have health insurance that covers it .
Doctors have
seen a sharp increase in the number of people inquiring about the procedure ,
according to U.S. News and World Report .
An article from last March cites Dr. Marc Goldstein of Cornell Institute for
Reproductive Medicine in New York City , who estimates that he has provided
about 48 percent more vasectomy consultations than he had one year ago .
CNN
reports that the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio has seen a 50 percent jump in the
number of vasectomies that it is performing since the nadir of the recession in
Fall 2008 .
There is , then ,
an opportunity to dispel the myth and mystery around vasectomies as couples and
individuals begin to ask questions they might not have asked before .
While
vasectomies are becoming more common , the procedure comes in context of a
complicated history .
Sterilization has been abusively applied to non-voluntary
individuals , particularly people of color .
While women have been the primary
targets of this abuse , men too have suffered coerced vasectomies .
In India in the
1970s , reports of compulsory sterilization at “ vasectomy camps ” began to gain
notoriety around the world .
Men were coerced with substantial monetary and
other incentives for having a vasectomy as part of India ’s attempt to lower its
national birth rate .
Government officials participated in many vasectomy camps ,
lending it a troubling authority , according to the comprehensive book The Global Family Planning Revolution .
Indeed , to “ persuade ” men to have a vasectomy , one state withdrew public
rations for families with more than three children ; another state legally
required sterilization after three children .
In still another state , married
teachers with children had to be sterilized or they would lose a month ’s pay .
The traumatic
legacy of this , paired with fears that the procedure inhibits virility , has
caused the unpopularity of vasectomies in that nation .
A Times of India report in 2004 indicates that of the 34,000 men who
come to Delhi hospitals and clinics for advice about contraception , only 2,000
of them choose vasectomies .
Alongside the
lingering suspicion of sterilization as a tool of abuse , vasectomies also emerge
in context of the relative dearth of male birth control options .
Historically ,
the burden of family planning has fallen on women .
Matt Johnson
wrote in AlterNet about how his
decision to have a vasectomy was in part influenced by a desire to take responsibility
for his contraception :
All
the other common birth control methods ( besides condoms and vasectomy ) have one
aspect in common :
They place the onus on women .
Not only does our society
expect women to deal with the logistics of birth control , but these methods
also have severe physiological drawbacks , from roller - coaster hormonal changes
to intensifying menstruation cycles to weight and skin changes .
Although these
methods have come a long way in a few decades , they still burden women and
their bodies .
Is it any coincidence that in a male - dominated society , the
medical establishment has thus far focused on birth control methods that leave
the burden solely on women ?
Having decided that I want to take an active role in birth control , a vasectomy
is fair , easy , and it confronts my privilege on this issue .
This socially conscious approach to
vasectomies also takes an environmental turn .
Thomjon Borges of Somerset ,
Massachusetts , said that he has “ No regrets whatsoever ” about having a
vasectomy .
He added that , “ the chance to contribute to slowing the population
growth was a plus . ”
We already wrote about some new features , such as new filter and the Trash - function in WordPress .
It has long been known that WordPress 2.9 will add some features for image editing – the users want these features , right in the core and not as a Plugin .
You can get a first insight into the current development version .
Since not everybody is working with it , here are some screenshots of the editor for images .
The screenshots certainly speak for themselves :
The office of Adm . Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the highest - ranking soldier in the US , tried to intimidate a reporter working on a story about security contractor Blackwater ’s operations in Pakistan , the reporter claims .
Jeremy Scahill — whose story alleging secret assassination and bombing campaigns inside Pakistan run by Xe Services , formerly Blackwater , appeared in The Nation on Monday — said he received a phone call from Adm .
Mullen ’s office the day before the story appeared , informing him that his story “ did n’t match up with reality . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking to Laura Flanders ’ GRITtv , Scahill described how he got little cooperation from the government in his investigation — until he received a phone call from Adm .
Mullen ’s office the day before the article was to be published .
“ I did n’t call them , ” Scahill said .
“ They called me .
They would n’t tell me how they got my number .
They would n’t tell me how they heard about the story .
And they told me that my story did n’t match up with reality . ”
Scahill said he interpreted the move as an attempt at intimidation .
“ How would any journalist perceive a call from the top US military chain of command , when you have n’t called them [ and ] they wo n’t tell you how they heard about the story ?
I did take it as an act of intimidation on the part of Adm. Mullen ’s office . ”
The following video was posted to the Web by GRITtv , November 25 , 2009 .
Scahill ’s comments about Adm. Mullen start around the 8:00 mark .
There was apparently nothing unusual about the $ 14,492 in charges put on my credit card in 48 hours at various discount supermarkets and gas stations in Hamilton , Ont .
My card was used five times at Price Chopper in two days -- $ 1,209.75 at the same store .
Ever try to spend that much at Price Chopper ?
They do n’t sell tobacco and the most expensive item I could find on a research visit was a pack of NicoDerm for $ 29.97 .
But when my wife tried to charge a $ 4.75 latte at a Starbucks , my credit card company figured something was askew .
I check my statement online every 48 hours -- to curtail purchases as much as to look for fraud -- so I was shocked when I got a call about the activity .
“ Wow , ” said Mike D’Sa , manager of data security and investigations with Visa Canada , when told the size of my fraud .
For consumers , the size of a fraud is n’t too big of a deal because in most cases the credit card companies reimburse the cardholder .
I received my reversal of charges in less than a week .
The real issue is the inconvenience .
You do n’t have your credit card for 48 hours , and then there are all those automatic charges to your account .
I have about 10 companies I now have to contact to give them my new card number .
Visa says credit card fraud in Canada is a $ 407 - million a year business , a number that has barely grown the last few years .
It amounts to less than .01 % of all credit purchases -- making it a minor cost for the credit card companies .
Publicly , the credit card industry says fraud is n’t a problem .
But private studies indicate otherwise .
Actimize Inc. , a New York - based software company that provides solutions for fraud , conducted a survey of 113 credit - card issuers in North America and Europe and found 60 % had suffered higher fraud losses over the past year .
Another 80 % of respondents expect a double - digit increase in losses in the current financial year , says Jasbir Anand , director of product management at Actimize .
At one point , consumers were on the hook for frauds .
Then it switched to consumers paying a small deductible .
But the sophistication of attacks reached a point where the credit card companies had to take on the liability or lose customers .
Since my wife and I both still had our cards in our possession , we were likely the victims of card “ skimming ” -- a widespread practice where information on the magnetic strip on the back of your card is copied at a terminal that has been modified .
Often the retailer has no knowledge it is going on .
But I question how much retailers are doing at the point of sale -- especially in my case .
One of the corner gas station kiosks put through a charge for $ 650 .
That was likely for cigarettes , according to a person in the fraud division of my credit card company .
If someone is asking for 10 or so cartons of smokes , should n’t it set off some alarms ?
Albuquerque , New Mexico has a City Councilor named Don Harris who is doing everything in his power to pull an Elizabeth Dole and lose an election by attacking his challenger ’s ties to atheism .
This is part of a mailer Harris sent out last week regarding opponent David Barbour :
That box at the top reads :
David Barbour , recently moved here from San Francisco .
He is a donor to Atheist organizations and speaker at Atheist events and attends radical political protests even in foreign countries .
Note the emphasis and capitalization of the word “ atheist . ”
You can see a PDF of the mailing here .
This is offensive beyond belief .
( I mean , look at that poor grammar . )
Actually , Barbour never spoke at any major atheist convention or anything even close .
What has he done ?
Harris explains :
Harris responded to our post with information indicating that Barbour was a member of a Unitarian Universalist congregation , who gave a talk on atheism and donated money to a scholarship in honor of Charles Darwin .
So , the money he gave was in support of science education , not atheism alone .
And here ’s a description of that terrible , horrible , no good , why - would - you - ever - want - to - vote - for - him ?
talk that he gave :
On July 2nd , 2003 Katherine Hepburn passed away .
The world lost a fine person , an excellent actress and a confirmed atheist .
This service explores Ms. Hepburnís life , the positive aspects of atheism and the reasons why a Unitarian congregation is better off with some atheists and humanists .
Along the way we find out about some atheist resources and what is happening locally in the atheist community .
Barbour , you monster …
The goal of all this is to paint Barbour as some revolutionary radical liberal … notice the Che Guevara - like image in the mailing .
I do n’t know either man ’s politics , but this is just very poor strategy .
It ’s not like Barbour was a major threat to begin with .
Even the local alternative newspaper supported Harris .
The local election is today .
It may be too late to mount any significant defense .
But it ’s not too late to let Harris know you disapprove of his derogatory mailing and offensive methods of campaigning .
I ’m sure he ’ll enjoy getting your emails on election day .

When you are looking for another better , faster and free defragmenting software for your Windows - 7 system and stumbled across this post , I ’m sure you will find this post very useful .
Why is defragmenting so important for your system performance
“ [… ] defragmentation is a process that reduces the amount of fragmentation in file systems . [… ]
The presence of immovable system files , especially a swap file , can impede defragmentation .
These files can be safely moved when the operating system is not in use . [ … ]
The outer tracks of a hard disk have a higher transfer rate than the inner tracks , therefore placing files on the outer tracks increases performance . [ … ] ” via Wikipedia

Revealed : 50 oil tankers loitering off British coast as they lie in wait for fuel price hikes
More than 50 oil tankers are anchored off Britain - pieces in a game in which the only winners are market speculators .
The losers are the millions of British motorists paying over the odds for their petrol and diesel .
After yesterday 's report in the Daily Mail on how several so - called ' oil shark ' tankers were moored near the Devon coast , dozens more vessels were revealed to be loitering off - shore .
Some are carrying aircraft fuel or fuel for homes .
Others are empty , waiting to be restocked before setting off around the globe .
But according to industry experts , a significant number are ' oil sharks ' - tankers that have been cynically told to wait for crude prices to be driven up before they unload their cargo .
With values soaring on the international markets , fuel made from their oil is unlikely to appear on a petrol station forecourt any day soon .
Paul Watters of the AA said : ' Tankers are off the UK coast and also off the U.S .
They are acting as storage tanks .
As always , motorists are the victims in this .
They are at the end of the food chain . '
How the Daily Mail broke the story yesterday
The Daily Mail has learnt that 54 tankers are anchored around the British Isles .
Six are off the Essex and Kent coasts , five are moored in Lyme Bay , while four are lurking next to the Isle of Wight .
But the biggest fleet - around 30 ships - lies around ten miles from Southwold , Suffolk in the only waters around the UK where ship - to - ship transfers of oil are allowed .
They come from as far afield as Malaysia , Liberia and Singapore - and include 1,000 ft vessels capable of carrying more than 300,000tons of oil .
Locals in Suffolk watched with growing anger over the summer as more and more tankers dropped anchor .
Southwold mayor Susan Doy said : ' It is wrong that tankers should be left off our coast for reasons of profiteering .
Ordinary people are left to suffer as petrol prices go up . '
Andrew Reid , of ship owners and managers Charles M Willie & Co , said the flotilla off the Devon coast , pictured in the Mail yesterday , was ' a drop in the ocean compared to the much bigger fleet full of crude oil off Suffolk ' .
He added : ' They are all just waiting there for the price of crude oil to rise , enabling huge profits to be taken .
If all this crude were to be delivered there would doubtless be a fall in the crude price and petrol prices . '
Waiting game : The Limerick Spirit off the Suffolk coast yesterday
Southwold Tory councillor Simon Tobin said : ' There have been ship - to - ship transfers of oil going on off the coast here for around 15 years .
But there began to be a huge increase in the number of these tankers around seven months ago .
' We are massively concerned .
These tankers are treating the coast like a car park while they wait for the right time to take their oil to shore .
There is nothing to stop them staying here as long as they like .
There might be a catastrophic oil spillage which could ruin our beautiful coastline . '
Small tankers bringing oil from Russia often use the spot to transfer their cargo to larger vessels .
Others drop anchor there while waiting for business because it is cheaper than tying up in a port .
The price of a barrel of oil has risen from $ 40 to $ 80 over the last year .
It is expected to soar even further over the next few months as the world eases its way out of recession and demand rises .
The supply of oil is strictly controlled by producers and owners - to ensure that prices remain as high as possible .
In the course of its journey from wells to the refineries , a barrel of oil may be bought and sold by different traders many times on the international markets .
The lay public , when presented with confusing data and competing arguments about climate change , deploy the mental shortcut of believing the people they most trust .
Trust in the communicator is therefore crucial .
Unfortunately the three main climate change communicators : politicians , journalists and environmental campaigners , are among the least trusted people in society – fighting it out for bottom place in the ranking with lawyers and car salesmen .
No one would pay any attention to them at all if they were not drawing on the aquifer of public trust in scientists .
But climate scientists have always misunderstood the dynamic of public belief and trust .
They assume that belief will be built on their data and that public trust is merited by their authority .
With the exception of a few outstanding communicators , they often make no attempt to speak to deeper values or make an emotional connection with the public – indeed they see that as contrary to their professional independence .
Climate change deniers have always understood this .
They use language that is designed to appeal to deeper values ( such as freedom , independence , progress ) .
The narrative they tell of being determined ( and even persecuted ) free - thinkers , standing against the tide of oppressive and self - interested conformity is designed to create an aura of integrity and trustworthiness .
The recent hacking of the servers of the University of East Anglia can only be understood within this landscape of competing appeals to public trust .
The denial industry ( and hordes of climate nerds ) has trawled through these emails and found sentences which , when removed from context , support their storyline that climate science is being deliberately distorted and exaggerated for a mixed bag of self - interested and politicised ends .
But you could find anything in here .
I looked and found lots of references to lunch and fun , 94 to hate , 31 to love .
Generally , though , the emails are extremely focused , technical , and , dare I say it , really dull .
As noted on realclimate.org , the emails contain " no evidence of any worldwide conspiracy , no mention of George Soros nefariously funding climate research , no grand plan to ' get rid of the MWP ' , no admission that global warming is a hoax , no evidence of the falsifying of data , and no ' marching orders ' from our socialist / communist / vegetarian overlords . "
But this is hardly the point .
This is an orchestrated smear campaign and does not require balance or context .
The speed with which the emails have been cut apart and fed into existing storylines is remarkable .
At the very least the UEA email campaign is an application of dirty political tactics to climate change campaigning .
I suspect it goes further than that .
The storyline is too clever , the timing on the brink of Copenhagen and the US climate bill too convenient .
I wait with interest to find out how these emails were obtained .
The UEA response has been frankly pathetic .
It was informed by Real Climate of the hack on 17 November but only reacted two days later when journalists caught on to the story .
It refused to confirm whether the emails were accurate or not and , for a long time , refused to comment at all .
Now , in typical scientist fashion , it seeks to argue the data rationally .
The UEA website states that " the selective publication of some stolen emails and other papers taken out of context is mischievous and cannot be considered a genuine attempt to engage with this issue in a responsible way " .
Mischievous ?
Irresponsible ?
What naughty pixies .
Then the Climate Research Unit director , Prof Phil Jones , focuses on one of quotes : " I 've just completed Mike 's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years and from 1961 for Keith 's to hide the decline . "
For the smear campaign it is only those key words " trick " and " hide " that count – the rest can be made into anything it wants .
Jones ignores this and responds with a detailed technical explanation of the passage with reference to the original graphs .
It 's like responding to someone calling you a bastard by showing them your birth certificate .
One can only imagine that the UEA 's communications team is totally out of its depth .
A less charitable conclusion is that they are defending the interests of UEA and are not concerned about ( or have not understood ) the damage to climate science .
I believe that Jones should speak to every journalist who calls , go on the offensive and defend his science .
He ought to clearly state that he is not prepared to have his hard - working and committed colleagues around the world defamed or slandered by the kinds of people who illegally hack into computers .
This is a desperate , last - ditch tactic by fanatics who have lost the rational debate .
Sadly , due in part to the lacklustre response , I am sure that these wretched emails have now entered permanently into the mythology of climate denial .
Scientists are going to have to be a lot more savvy and on the ball in future .

He posts regularly to the blog climatedenial.org .
Last August , the people who putatively run Twitter — the small crew that three years ago launched the world 's fastest - growing communications medium — announced a relatively minor change in the way the site functions .
The tweak would have a small effect on retweeting , the convention by which Twitter users repost someone else 's informative or amusing message to their own Twitter followers .
Retweets start with RT , for " retweet , " and usually cite the first author by user ID .
And , importantly , retweeters often add a word or two of commentary about the repeated content .
But there was a problem :
Twitter itself did n't invent retweeting ; it was created by Twitter users .
In a blog post explaining the changes to retweets , the company 's second - in - command , Biz Stone , called them " a great example of Twitter teaching us what it wants to be . "
The good news , he said , was that Twitter was building retweets right into the site 's architecture .
The bad news was that Project Retweet did n't make any provision for the commentary that users might like to add .
It did n't take long for Twitter users to respond : How dare Twitter mess with ... Twitter .
A self - described " social , search , and viral marketing scientist " named Dan Zarrella posted a passionate cri de coeur , writing that Twitter was about to " completely eviscerate most of the value out of retweets . "
That night , Zarrella created a Twitter hashtag — another grassroots Twitter convention , which lets users group their conversations — called # saveretweets .
A few tweeters liked the plan , but the general consensus was summed up by one user skilled in Twitter 's uncompromising brevity : " Very bad plan we hates it . "
The Retweet Incident is a distillation of how Twitter has come so far so fast — and how tricky it might be to keep the momentum going .
In an amazingly short time , the messaging service — which does little more than circulate bursts of text limited to 140 characters to a list of people who have chosen to receive them — has established itself as a staple of social networking , commerce , electioneering , celebrity culture , public relations , media , and political protest .
According to internal documents leaked earlier this year , the company expects to have 25 million active users by the end of 2009 and 100 million by the end of 2010 .
In 2013 , it hopes to become the first Internet service to sign up 1 billion users .
There 's a big difference between 1 million adherents — roughly the number of people who receive tweets from Twitter 's CEO , Evan Williams , whose recent messages reported the birth of his first child — and 1 billion , which puts you up there with Google and soccer .
Can something as elementary as Twitter become an enduring pillar of the Internet ?
Perhaps , but Williams and Stone are going about it in an unusual way .
They 're not laser - focused on how to fend off companies like Facebook and Google — which are madly integrating Twitter into their own business plans even as they take steps to neutralize or maybe buy it .
And they do n't seem to be worried about money .
The company 's revenue will be a modest $ 4 million or so this year .
Even so , Twitter reportedly turned down a $ 500 million acquisition offer from Facebook last November and seems perfectly happy to burn through its roughly $ 150 million in investor funds .
Instead , Williams and Stone spend lots of time concocting schemes to boost the happiness quotient of a workforce that 's still only in the double figures — stuff like free lunches and inspirational visits by politicians , folksingers , and a director from the TV show House .
The idea is to establish a corporate culture that will abide even when the number of employees explodes .
" I feel like we 're 1 percent into this , " Stone says .
" We do n't want to be that child actor who finds success early and grows up to be weird . "
But Twitter is already weird :
It rocketed into the mainstream without really knowing what its service was .
Its users defined it .
It was those users who made Twitter into a throbbing global sensing organism that delivers instant opinion and eyewitness reporting on everything from presidential debates to football injuries .
Though the company held a discussion earlier this year called " What Do We Want to Be When We Grow Up ? " the mission statement is still a work in progress .
" If there are three sentences I 'd use to describe Twitter , " Stone says , " one of them would be ' I do n't know . ' "
As the company pursues those billion users and a business model , however , it may need to move past a studied ignorance of what it wants to be and shape its product more aggressively .
The challenge is to do that without alienating the very community that 's fueling the company 's rocket - ship ascent .
It 's easy to write off Twitter as a happy accident , a right - place , right - time fluke .
But that misses the point .
When Twitter 's creators designed the service , they made a series of crucial and deliberate decisions — ones that seem brilliant in retrospect — that created the conditions that allow users to innovate .
The first was a commitment to simplicity .
A little history : Williams ' previous company was a podcasting venture called Odeo .
After Apple started distributing podcasts in June 2005 , Odeo was pretty much redundant , so Williams started looking for a new idea .
Jack Dorsey , one of his engineers , had one for him : status updates — specifically , brief reports that answered questions like :
Where are you ?
What are you doing ?
Dorsey suggested a system that mimicked the simplicity of SMS to let users send messages from the Web or their cell phones about what they were doing from wherever they were .
In March 2006 , a small group including Dorsey and Stone built a prototype in two weeks .
" The important thing was that we spent a lot of time getting it down to its essence , " says Noah Glass , a cofounder of Odeo who managed the so - called Twttr project .
The system would receive a message from the sender and then forward it to the right people .
Nothing else .
Simple .
The second key decision was crucial : creating asymmetry between writers and followers .
They did n't need to be " friends " or in any way on equal footing .
Anyone could read a writer 's updates , and that was powerfully liberating .
" One thing I did n't like about social networks was that awkwardness of friend requests , " Williams says .
He wanted Twitter to be more like blogging , where readers pay attention to whatever they like .
" That frees up creators , because they can do anything they want , " he says .
The implications were profound — and unexpected .
No one thought people would want to follow strangers , or that celebrities would use Twitter to apprise fans of their activities , or that businesses would use Twitter to announce discounts or launch new products .
Allowing unrestricted following eventually meant that P. Diddy could share the progress of a tantric sex session with a hundred thousand followers , and the Kennedy family could use Twitter to keep the public informed about developments in Uncle Teddy 's funeral .
It obliterated the line between confidant and audience .
The third key decision was to open up Twitter to software developers from the get - go , allowing them to build their own apps and services .
They could even build sites that replaced the Twitter homepage with a spiffier , more functional interface .
" It just seemed like geeks would hack on it , and it would be cool , " Stone says .
" We did n't know that it was going to be a whole giant thing . "
Outsiders have enhanced the value of Twitter in countless ways , like creating software dashboards that let users navigate the Twitterverse the way a Las Vegas security honcho monitors the casino floor .
Other services allow you to link tweets to pictures or video .
Twitter has also led to a boom in URL - shortening services , a former backwater of Web utilities , which became vital when people wanted to include links in their tweets without the URL taking up half the space .
" There may be some 50 people officially working at Twitter , but it 's more like 5,000 people work for Twitter , and they all deserve as much credit as we do , " Stone says .
The most transformative hack has been the ability to search through millions of tweets , even those posted just seconds earlier .
It means anyone can monitor the hottest current topic of discussion or simply get a sense of what people are saying , in real time , about a product or movie or celebrity .
A Virginia company called Summize was one of several to come up with a way to search Twitter .
The technology turned out to be so important that Twitter acquired Summize and hired nearly all of its engineers .
Twitter 's evolution spawned a new grammar , and the Twitter community created many of the conventions now integral to the service .
This includes hashtags ( marked with a # symbol ) and the @ prefix before a username .
Companies using Twitter to track financial information adopted the $ sign to identify stock names .
Heavy retweeting by tech guru Tim O'Reilly helped popularize the practice .
To Twitter fans , 140 characters was n't a limit but a jumping - off point .
It might have seemed obvious that something as brief and ephemeral as a tweet was unsuitable for a press release , policy analysis , or novel , but people have used Twitter for these things anyway , sending multitweet streams that constituted a brand - new Internet genre .
Essentially , Twitter left a ball and a stick in a field and lurked on the sidelines as its users invented baseball .
If Twitter is going to make any money , however , the company has to take its own turn at bat .
For most of the past two years , the focus has been simply to keep things running , reducing the nettlesome downtime that plagued the service and stemming the rising tide of spam .
" We 're finally emerging from this firefighting mode , " Stone says .
From here on , the company wants to put its own mark on the service , improving its homepage , producing services of its own , and refining the best ideas of its users — like retweeting .
The company has gone on a hiring spree : Recent arrivals include Douglas Bowman , a key Google designer ; Alex Macgillivray , a former top lawyer at Google , who will handle possible technology acquisitions ; and new COO Dick Costolo , cofounder of newsfeed company FeedBurner .
Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos is an investor .
And after closing a round of $ 100 million funding in September , the company will certainly hire and grow even more .
As it does , it will need to balance humility and ambition .
" We do n't want to get too clever and think we know everything , " Stone says .
" But maybe we can serve our developers better by creating the real future they want . "
Of course , those developers wo n't be too happy if Twitter winds up competing with them .
And users may not embrace Twitter 's attempts at improvement .
Every move the company makes comes under harsh scrutiny .
Consider something as innocuous as its Suggested Users List , a collection of roughly 200 Twittering celebrities , companies , and experts that the service flags as an interesting starting point for novices .
It was unveiled last February .
Outrage ensued .
Mahalo CEO Jason Calacanis ( who has never made the list ) saw it as an unearned gift to favored users and offered to buy three years of inclusion in the top 20 for half a million bucks .
Tech legend Dave Winer , who describes himself as one of the site 's biggest fans , was alarmed by the company 's ability to alienate its core users in such a way .
" We need to get that power out of their hands , " he wrote on his blog .
Stone and Williams hope to minimize such tensions .
But they also need to assert some control over their own product .
After all , there 's only so much you can do when millions of your users access your service in a way that bypasses your homepage .
And , unbelievably , Twitter does n't even make an app for cell phones or other mobile gadgets , basically ceding that development to outsiders .
" It 's nice to have the ecosystem out there innovating , " says Kevin Thau , the Twitter exec in charge of mobile .
" It has created this whole communications system where people are saying , ' What Twitter client do you use ?
Which one do you like ? ' "
It 's not that Twitter lacks ambition .
The scale of its vision was revealed last summer when a hacker stole hundreds of the company 's confidential documents and leaked them to TechCrunch .
The key bullet point , straight from a February 2009 strategy meeting : " If we had a billion users , that will be the pulse of the planet . "
Considering how far Twitter has come , that audacious boast is a plausible goal .
( Another bullet point from the leaked memo , " Are we building a new Internet ? " is a stretch . )
Twitter envisions building its international audience by making deals with carriers to sell phones with Twitter connectivity built straight into the browser or texting functions .
( This will help boost Twitter use in developing nations , where SMS still rules . )
The company also envisions delivering content from Twitter to and from every connected device in your life , like radios and game consoles .
Pulse of the planet indeed .
That 's why competing Internet giants are deeply interested in , if not outright obsessed by , Twitter .
Over the past few months , Facebook has made alterations that reek of Twitter envy , like the ability to make status reports available to all Facebook users and adopting the @ sign for usernames .
A stripped - down version of its service , Facebook Lite , seems to show that when Facebook is reduced to its essence , you get a real - time feed that looks like a close cousin of Twitter .
Google has made suspiciously Twitter - oriented adjustments as well .
One is something called PubSubHubbub , a server protocol that could instantly push new content to users , whether it 's from a blog , Facebook , instant messaging , or Twitter .
This has the potential to blunt Twitter 's uniqueness by commoditizing short bursts of information : Instead of a Twitterverse , we'd have a Statusphere distributed across dozens , even hundreds , of companies .
These plans suggest that all kinds of content could be Twitterized .
It 's like email , Winer argues .
It should n't belong to anyone .
On his blog , he suggested an open system that duplicates Twitter messages and puts them in a bucket with posts from " 140 - character networks formed by others , including Facebook , Yahoo , Google , who knows who . "
Williams and Stone , as you 'd suspect , do n't want Twitter to become a commodity .
They want to amplify Twitter so it's as vital to your social life as Facebook and as important to your search as Google .
" We want to make Twitter indispensable , so it tells people what they need to know and what they want to know and hopefully not much else , " Williams says .
If Twitter does that , he believes , the company will be wildly profitable , no matter what the skeptics say .
Last summer Williams was invited to the exclusive Allen & Company confab of bigwigs in Sun Valley , Idaho .
He was astonished to hear Barry Diller and John Malone , two pillars of the pre-Internet world , proclaiming that Twitter would never make much money .
" I did n't argue my case , " Williams says .
" But all the Internet guys there were laughing at those media guys .
Are you kidding ?
Do you understand how money flows to the Internet ?
When you know that Twitter is a vehicle for directing information and traffic to large audiences , you realize there 's obviously a huge business . "
What is that business ?
Twitter is n't talking much about it , although a recent change in its terms of service opens the door to financially exploiting Twitter 's assets .
Stone does say that the first stab at serious revenue will be providing services to businesses that use Twitter , helping them analyze discussions and providing them with " verified accounts " to let them communicate with customers .
That does n't sound like much :
Twitter will probably make more bucks with Google - like targeted ads , one of the other possibilities mentioned in the purloined documents .
Maybe the most promising revenue streams will come from packaging and analyzing the information from the billions of tweets that are collected exclusively on Twitter 's servers .
" We have a hell of a lot of data right now , " Williams says .
" And we 'll have an unfathomable amount in five years . "
Given those possibilities , the revenue goal outlined in the leaked memos — generating a dollar per user — does n't seem overly ambitious .
Williams even sees a bright side to the theft of the documents .
" Ironically , they may have dispelled the misperception that the company is frivolous or a flash in the pan , " he says .
When he envisions Twitter five years from now , he sees an independent , profitable business with thousands of employees .
" We definitely will be bigger and better , and hopefully that 's about it , " he says .
Of course , the strength of Twitter is that the company already has thousands of people defining and redefining it every day .
And Williams does n't have to supply them with a desk or free food .
Whether he can keep that workforce happy is a story that will unfold , 140 characters at a time , over the next few years .
Senior writer Steven Levy ( steven_levy@wired.com ) wrote about tech executives in Iraq in issue 17.08 .
Though looking forward to millions of new customers who would be compelled by the U.S. government to buy health insurance , the insurance industry is threatening to raise premiums across the board if more of its demands are not met .
Industry representatives put Congress and the Obama administration on notice that if health - reform legislation does n’t send even more new customers the industry ’s way or if a windfall profits tax is included , the industry would hit businesses , individuals and the government with higher premiums , effectively defeating one of the initiative ’s top goals , reining in ever - rising costs .
The industry ’s chief complaint , which was raised in connection with an already - industry - friendly bill cobbled together by Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus , is that the legislation would push 29 million more Americans into the insurance market , but that they might be the sickest and thus costliest people .
The industry wants more of the estimated 25 million still uninsured – especially healthy , young people – to be compelled to buy policies , too .
Without more healthy customers added to the mix , the industry says it will have no choice but to raise rates .
" The consequences of this would be an upward spiral ; rate shock to everyone who stays in , " Karen Ignagni , president of the industry group America 's Health Insurance Plans , told the Washington Post .
" This legislation will fail the test of affordability for individuals . "
[ Washington Post , Oct. 9 , 2009 ]
The industry ’s warning comes after its lobbyists won an important victory in the Senate Finance Committee , defeating amendments that would have added a public option , a government - run program that would compete with private insurers to hold down costs .
Private insurers also bristled at an idea floated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a windfall profits tax on extra money the industry might make from the influx of millions of new customers , many qualifying for government subsidies .
Robert E. Zirkelbach , a spokesman for America ’s Health Insurance Plans , told the New York Times that a tax on windfall profits “ would lead to higher premiums for families and businesses ” because the added expense would be passed through to customers .
[ NYT , Oct. 9 , 2009 ]
However , it was not clear why insurers would worry about a windfall profits tax if they were also concerned that new customers would be a financial burden .
Still , by the industry throwing its weight around with threats of higher premiums , it may be risking a backlash from Congress , which could still turn to the public option as the only feasible method for constraining ever - rising health insurance costs .
The industry fears the public option because it could piggyback on the existing Medicare bureaucracy and thus save substantial money , which the insurance industry spends on administrative expenses , executive pay and profits .
Those costs eat up 20 percent or more of an average dollar that businesses and individuals spend on health insurance premiums , compared to about 2 percent for Medicare .
The latest threats suggest that industry lobbyists believe they have enough senators lined up to back a Republican filibuster and block the public option , although some congressional liberals contend that some form of the public option , which is contained in four other committee - approved bills , still has a decent chance of winning final congressional approval .
But Democrats especially have reason to worry , because if they enact a reform package without the public option – and insurers then jack up rates – Democrats could be blamed for the unintended consequence of higher costs and thus pay a steep political price at the polls .

Showcasing these flashy graphics requires bigger teams and more money , which has guided the industry toward safe prospects like licensed properties and sequels .
Even when working on more original fare , the enormous teams that create today ’s video games dilute artistic intention .
There are exceptions like Will Wright , whose legacy includes The Sims , but they stand out because they are exceptions .
“ For the most part , ” Rohrer said , “ there ’s no single person trying to bring a specific vision to life . ”
Making matters worse , according to Rohrer and others , video games fall into the trap of using the wizardry and craft of those big teams to emulate movies — bad movies at that .
The narrative elements in today ’s big games tend to be retreads of film - genre clichés .
Or they ’re extensions of actual film brands , like “ The Godfather . ”
Rohrer calls this cinematic approach to video games “ asymptotic ” : in his view there ’s no point in making video games as good as movies , because we already have movies .
“ Just as early film production copied the stage , ” he said , video games have yet to escape the influence of film .
“ Eventually film figured out editing , camera movement — the tools that made movies movies .
Video games need to discover what ’s special and different about their own medium to break out of their cultural ghetto . ”
This is something that Eric Zimmerman , an independent game designer , has been thinking and writing about for years .
Zimmerman , who studied painting as an undergraduate , co-wrote “ Rules of Play , ” a well - regarded textbook on game design .
“ Maybe games are not about communication the way movies are , ” Zimmerman says .
“ They ’re about interaction — with a system or other players , with rules . ”
At the Game Developers Conference , the avant - garde assembled itself around the Independent Games Festival , a patch of convention floor where more than two dozen idiosyncratic titles were on display .
Not far away , cheers rose as gamers played blockbuster releases like Street Fighter IV , but there was still healthy traffic around whimsical , mostly two - dimensional games with titles like I Wish I Were the Moon .
Because of their lo - fi graphics , these titles might look like kids ’ games to the casual viewer .
Or they may not look much like games at all , abandoning conceits like competition and levels , winning and losing .
Osmos appeared to be an amoebic adventure in space .
Coil begins by piloting a sperm in search of an ova .
Blueberry Garden , a floor favorite that was named the best game in the festival , looked like a surreal moving storybook with a flying , beaked protagonist .
Billed by its programmer , Erik Svedang , as a game of “ curiosity and exploration , ” Blueberry Garden features little instruction and no puzzles — other than the question of what exactly to do next — but roaming among the garden ’s flora and fauna to the sounds of a Debussy - like soundtrack is captivating .
“ Dude , you just kind of float around and get those blueberry power - ups , ” one player explained to his friend .
But the directionless dream world of the garden turns out to be a seductive trap .
The garden is slowly filling with water ; only once it ’s inundated do you realize how to escape .
Blueberry Garden ’s quick denouement makes it more of a clever ruse than a great game , but the emotional arc — being lulled into a dream and then forced awake for survival — was original .
Most important to the indie admirers , the game demonstrated what one person can do to make something new and sell it for just $ 5 .
Simplicity prevails among indie games and not just because developers lack the resources for complexity .
Stripping to the fundamentals , indie game designers say , allows them to innovate .
“ Designing a game can be like a Japanese garden , ” Jenova Chen says .
“ It ’s not what you put in but how much you take away . ”
In 2005 , while at the University of Southern California ’s graduate program for interactive media , Chen and Kellee Santiago created Cloud , a daydream of a game where a boy stuck in a hospital imagines himself floating in the sky , corralling clouds into shapes of his choosing .
When Cloud went online , it was downloaded 500,000 times .
“ It crashed the school ’s server several times , ” Chen says .
Chen and Santiago formed their own boutique developer , Thatgamecompany , and signed a three - game contract with Sony .
Their company now has 10 employees .
Flower , the second title from Thatgamecompany , was released this year over the PlayStation Network .
There is some debate in the indie scene over whether a deal with Sony means that you ’ve moved on to the mainstream , but Chen says indie gamers should be happy that companies like Sony are starting to respond to the movement ’s successes .
“ Flower is like an ambassador for the rest of the indie world , ” Jason Rohrer says .
“ It shows you that what we ’re doing can appeal more broadly . ”
A robot is currently building a looping brick wall right in the middle of New York .
Over a period of three weeks , passers - by can watch the " Pike Loop " installation in the making on a traffic island .
The digitally controlled construction of the sculpture was developed at ETH - Zurich 's Professorship of Architecture and Digital Fabrication .
Brick is a dominant feature of New York 's cityscape , and Pike Street is no exception : from October 5 -- 27 , the citizens of Manhattan can follow in real time how an industrial robot uses innovative technology to transform the traditional material into a complex infinite loop -- the " Pike Loop " .
Digital and material realities
The brick loop in New York is no ordinary wall .
The two architects , Fabio Gramazio and Matthias Kohler , who both teach and research at ETH Zurich , have breathed a breath of fresh air into popular design patterns with their interdisciplinary approach : " Digital characteristics can enrich a material and thus influence its architectural expression and functionality , " say the two assistant professors of architecture and digital fabrication , whose research team designed and implemented " Pike Loop " .
Instead of the conventional straight brick wall , you can use shapes and construction principles that have been programmed into the computer and digitally transferred to the material to make a three - dimensional composition .
" We marry the digital reality of the computer with the material reality of a building , " say the two architects .
They call this approach " digital materiality " .
Robot in a box
Over 7,000 bricks are in Pike Street waiting to be stacked based on complex calculations -- not by bricklayers , but by a digitally controlled robot called R - O - B , which is kept in a freight container ready to be transported directly to a building site .
As R - O - B has a range of 4.5 meters and the installation is to be 22 meters long in total , the robot moves along the construction site on a flat - bed trailer to enable it to work continuously on the construction of the wall .
advertisement
The bricks are bonded together with quick - drying glue -- also by the industrial robot .
The fact that none of the bricks lies exactly on top of the one below creates a three - dimensional effect .
And as the wall rises from the ground here and there and crosses over itself at several points , the infinite loop gets a dynamic expression
More precise than by human hand
The installation in New York exemplifies how , by combining digital design and fabrication tools , the architects can now control the production process in every detail .
The resulting buildings therefore exhibit shapes and structures that could never be created by hand -- not without an enormous amount of effort , at least .
Consequently , the point of Gramazio and Kohler 's research is not to put the bricklayer out of a job .
Their latest installation is primarily supposed to be for the purposes of architectural research -- a test of the potential and limitations of this production technique with respect to a contemporary design culture , as they put it .
Gramazio and Kohler 's research team already used R - O - B to build a oscillating wall at last year 's Architecture Biennale in Venice .
The wall , however , was erected in front of the exhibition hall and then transported into the premises .
Thus , " Pike Loop " is the first installation of its kind to be constructed on its eventual exhibition site .
The initiator of the installation was the renowned New York gallery Storefront for Art and Architecture which is currently holding an exhibition entitled " Digital Materiality " from October 1 -- November 14 that contains selected projects from Gramazio & Kohler 's teaching and research activities at ETH Zurich 's Department of Architecture .
The finished wall is to be inaugurated in the evening of October 27 and will remain on the traffic island until the end of the year .

" Enemy Vehicles " from Yank Article on enemy vehicles tested at Aberdeen Ordnance Research Center from the January 21 , 1944 issue of Yank .
The cover is an image of German Tiger I tank from the 1.Ko. of s. Pz.Abt. 504 which was captured by Allied forces in Tunisia .
At Aberdeen 's Ordnance Research Center , inquisitive
experts finds what makes an Axis vehicle tick , and
their tests produce facts worth remembering .
By Sgt. MACK MORRISS and Sgt. RALPH STEIN , YANK Staff Correspondents
A berdeen , M d. --
The first thing you learn at the Foreign Material outfit here is never , ever , to call a Nazi tank a " Mark Six " or a " Mark Four . "
The correct designation is PzKW VI or PzKW IV .
" Mark " is a British way of saying model , whereas PzKW means what it says : Panzer Kampfwagen , or armored battlewagon .
The first thing you learn at the Foreign Material outfit here is never , ever , to call a Nazi tank a " Mark Six " or a " Mark Four . "
The correct designation is PzKW VI or PzKW IV .
" Mark " is a British way of saying model , whereas PzKW means what it says : , or armored battlewagon .
For more than a year captured enemy vehicles have been arriving here from every battle front on earth .
The first was a half - track prime mover that came in sections and required three months of trial - and - error tinkering to be completely reconstructed .
Missing parts , which were requisitioned from North Africa , never arrived ; mechanics in the Base Shop section made their own .
The worst headache for repair crews here is the difference in measurement caused by the European metric system .
Nothing manufactured in the U.S. will fit anything in a Nazi machine unless it is made to fit .
In reconstructing the captured stuff , it has sometimes been necessary to combine the salvaged parts of two or three vehicles in order to put one in running order .
The mechanics have made their own pistons or recut foreign pistons to take American piston rings ; they 've cut new gears ; they 've had to retap holes so that American screws will fit them .
Specially assigned recovery crews , ordnance men trained to know and work with enemy material , roam the battlefields of the world to collect the captured rolling stock , which is being accumulated here .
It arrives with the dust of its respective theater still on it , plus the names and addresses of GIs who scratch " Bizerte " or " Attu " or " Buna Mission " in big letters on the paint .
Generally speaking , ordnance experts here have found German stuff exceptionally well made in its vital mechanisms , whereas the less essential parts are comparatively cheap .
The motor of a Nazi personnel carrier , for example , is a well - built affair , while the body of the vehicle is little more than scrap tin .
Japanese pieces of equipment for the most part are cheap imitations of American or British counterparts .
The engineers , who judge by the mass of detail employed in all German - built machines , are convinced that the Nazi idea has been to sacrifice speed for over - all performance and maneuverability .
The German equipment , from the sleek motorcycle to the massive PzKW VI , is rugged .
T - 3 Bruce Warner welds the cracked fender of a German personnel carrier received at Aberdeen .
A mechanic at Ordnance Research Center adjusts the valves of the Maybach engine in a PzKW IV .
This is the famous Tiger ( with a picture of its namesake painted on the face plate ) , the largest and heaviest German tank .
Weighing 61 1/2 tons , it is propelled at a speed of from 15 to 18 miles an hour by a 600 - to - 650 horsepower Maybach V - 12 cylinder engine .
Maybach engines are used in many of the Nazi panzer wagonen and in submarines .
The PzKW VI has an armor thickness which ranges from 3 1/4 to 4 inches .
An additional slab of steel mounted in conjunction with its 88 - mm forms frontal armor for the turret .
Besides the long - barreled 88 , it carries two MG34 ( Model 1934 ) machine guns .
Largest tank used in combat by any nation today , the Tiger is more than 20 feet long , about 11 3 / 4 feet wide and 9 3 / 4 feet high .
It has a crew of five .
Germans love gadgets .
To operate the viewing slots used by the commander of this PzKW III , there is an intricate system of levers and handles to raise or lower the cupola a fraction of an inch .
A few grains of sand might easily jam the works .
The German medium tank ( above ) is driven by a 280 - horsepower 12 - cylinder Maybach engine .
It can do 29 mph at top speed .
Compared with the Tiger , the PzKW III is lightly armored , weighing a mere 19 tons .
This tank mounts a 5 - cm ( two - inch ) kampfwagen kanone and two 7.92 - mm MG34 machine guns , and has a crew of five .
It ranges somewhere between our own light and medium tanks , and in the early days of the war it was a mainstay of the German Wehrmacht 's famed blitzkrieg tactics .
Close - up of the PzKW III shows spare bogie wheel and , on the side of the turret above it , three smoke projectors .
Escape hatch , with door open , can be seen in the side of the hull .
The PzKW IV is slightly heavier than the III , weighing 22 tons , and is a later model .
It has the same engine as the III , but its speed is less : 22 mph maximum .
It is armed with a 75 - mm gun and two 7.92 MG34s .
Cannon shown here , like the 88 on the opposite page , is fitted with a muzzle brake which reduces recoil .
Nazis festoon their tanks with spare tracks , as seen here on the front sloping armor and on the turret .
The PzKW II is an obsolete type of tank now primarily used by the Germans for observation and reconnaissance .
Although it is comparatively low powered , having a six - cylinder 135 - horsepower engine , its maximum speed is 35 miles per hour , making it the fastest German tank in use today .
It is armed with a 20 - mm auto - cannon and one 7.92 - mm machine gun .
In the close - up at left is shown the quarter - elliptic springing of bogies which has been replaced in newer German models by a torsional - suspension system .
This PzKW II came into Aberdeen painted a bright red , with " Snafu " lettered on the side .
Germans frequently use captured material intact or convert it to suit their own purposes .
In the foreground above is a German 15 - cm howitzer mounted on a French Lorraine medium tank chassis .
To its right is a German 75 - mm gun on a Czech medium tank chassis .
JAPANESE light tank , model 1935 , pictured above and right , was built in October 1941 and was captured last summer in the Aleutians .
Like most Japanese equipment , it performs better than it looks .
It has a six - cylinder air - cooled 250 - horsepower Diesel engine which moves its eight - ton weight at 22 mph .
It is armed with a 37 - mm cannon and two 7.7 machine guns .
Note the old - style riveting of armored plates throughout .
German , Czech , Italian and some Jap vehicles have Bosch ignition systems , many of which can be operated by the key pictured at left .
Note that the key is notched .
Under the key is shown the ignition switch and the ignition light .
On the switch , which is turned by the key , are positions numbered 0 , 1 and 2 , which control the lights .
The key acts as a master switch .
If key is inserted to its first notch , lights can be operated but ignition is off .
If key is pushed in further , lights , ignition , starter all can be operated but ignition is off .
If key is pushed in further , lights , ignition , starter all can be operated .
In this position of the key , the red ignition light glows ; and when this light , which is also the starter button , is pushed the starter will operate .
The German armored half - track personnel carrier is a six - cylinder , 100 horsepower job with a maximum speed of 40 mph .
It carries two MG34 machine guns .
This vehicle has a coffin - shaped body , and carries 10 men on two longitudinal seats .
One machine gun is mounted to the right of the eleventh man , the driver , whose visibility is limited to two small glassed - in slots as shown above .
Interior of the half - track at left shows its unique inverted steering wheel .
Included among instruments on the dashboard is a tachometer , indicating engine revolutions .
This is the German eight - tom half - track personnel carrier and prime mover .
It has a passenger capacity of 12 men and is used as the standard tractor for the 88 - mm dual - purpose gun .
The spare wheel on each side of the chassis of this German command and reconnaissance car turns freely to prevent bellying on rough ground .
It has a V - 8 engine , four - wheel drive , and can do 45 mph .
There is no armament .
The Nazi BMW motorcycle has an opposed horizontal twin engine , driving the rear wheel by a shaft instead of a chain .
Unlike most European models it has a hand gear shift similar to conventional U. S. models .
A side - car version of the BMW ( Bayerische Motoren Werke ) which has a unique motorcycle feature -- a reverse gear .
Unlike American models it has a hand clutch .
This is as good as any motorcycle in the world .
This vicious - looking machine , photographed by YANK's Sgt. George Aarons during the Tunisian campaign , is a PzKW VI ( Panzer Kampfwagen ) which translates literally as armored battlewagon .
More often it was called the Tiger , but here with the sleeve knocked off its 88 - mm cannon and resting against the muzzle brake , it is definitely a tamed one .

Researchers study plutonium inside glove boxes — a Hollywood movie staple , consisting of a sealed enclosure with gloves so that someone outside the box can work on dangerous materials inside .
A major earthquake would shake the ground enough to topple the glove boxes , says the new study .
Some glove boxes are enormous and even contain furnaces to cast and mold plutonium .
If one of these were to crash , the resulting fire would be uncontrollable and would create a vaporized plutonium cloud that could drift outside of the lab , says the safety report .
Federal experts believe that a major earthquake could trigger fires at Los Alamos National Laboratory , releasing radioactive materials and endangering lives .
The rupture of a seismic fault that runs underneath the lab would shake the ground more than scientists previously thought , according to a new report ( PDF ) .
A natural disaster here would be bad news , since
the lab , just west of Santa Fe , is the main plutonium factory in the United States , believed to hold thousands of pounds of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons
In a worst - case scenario , a fire could release so much airborne plutonium that a person on the boundary of the lab would get a dose of radiation
— potentially many thousands of times greater than a chest X - ray — that could be fatal in weeks , according to individuals knowledgeable about the study
[ Los Angeles Times ] .
The amount of vaporized plutonium could potentially be as much as 100 times more than the level allowed by the Department of Energy .
Los Alamos responded to the report by saying they have taken many actions in the past year to increase fire safety
including repacking plutonium into containers that would survive the accident .
The lab also installed ventilation filters that perform at higher temperatures , improved the fire suppression system , implemented new controls for combustibles , added fire extinguishers to critical areas and developed plans to support firefighter response [ AP ] .
The warning was delivered by Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board , an auditing agency that oversees federal nuclear programs ; the board urged Energy Secretary Stephen Chu to act quickly to improve safety at Los Alamos .
The laboratory will present a formal response to the report later this week .

A boy was held over the side of a bridge in Milton Keynes by two men who threatened to drop him over the edge .
The 13 - year - old was walking between Leadenhall and Eaglestone with friends who were pouring a drink over the bridge on to the road below .
Two men stopped their car , slapped the boy in the face and pushed his head over the edge of bridge which crosses the H7 , threatening to throw him off .
The boy was pushed to the ground before the men drove off .
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday is asked to contact police .

Un dossier impressionnant !
L’AFP a publié les photos du dépôt du dossier de candidature de Free Mobile à l’ARCEP ce matin .
Le volume est impressionnant puisque ce dossier est contenu dans 4 à 5 caisses d’environ 1 mètre cube .
On reconnaitra sur les photos Cyril Poidatz , le Président du conseil d’administration d’Iliad et Maxime Lombardini , le directeur général , qui sont venus accompagner le précieux chargement .
Su www.unita.it è on line una petizione per chiedere al premier di spiegare le sue storie nei paradisi fiscali .
Tanto accanimento dell ’editore Berlusconi contro Boffo e Mauro ( che sarebbero rei di malavita sessuale ed evasione fiscale ) è la palese ammissione di chi si sente colpevole e si difende solo rilanciando analoghe accuse .
Chiediamo ai parlamentari , all ’informazione libera , alla FNSI , di fare cinque semplici domande a Berlusconi su una vicenda che non può essere protetta d privacy .
ECCO LE CINQUE DOMANDE
1 ) Onorevole Berlusconi è vero , o no , che l’avvocato Mills ha lavorato per Fininvest e per la sua famiglia per oltre dieci anni con il preciso incarico di creare e gestire società off shore sulle quali veicolare i proventi di diritti televisivi ed effettuare altre ingenti operazioni finanziarie ?
2 ) E ’ vero , o no , che la galassia delle società facenti capo a All Iberian veniva alimentata dalla Principal Finance Limited , che era una emanazione della Silvio Berlusconi finanziaria ?
3 ) E ’ vero o no che i due conti Century One e Universal One , creati da Mills presso la BSI di Lugano , erano intestati , per sua disposizione , ai suoi figli Marina e PierSilvio ?
4 ) Chi ha dato l’ordine a Salvatore Sciascia di consegnare somme di denaro al maresciallo Francesco Nanocchio della G.d.F. affinchè " non usasse la mano pesante " nelle ispezioni per l’accertamento della vera proprietà di Tele + ?
5 ) E ’ vero o no che la Fininvest ha conferito all ’avv .
Mills l’incarico di costituire in Lussemburgo una società a lui intestata chiamata Horizon , il cui scopo era quello di occultare la vera proprietà ed il controllo di Tele + che facevano capo alla Fininvest , in violazione della legge Mammì ?
Il Paese ha diritto di sapere se chi guida il Governo ha usato i paradisi fiscali per evadere le tasse .
Firma anche tu la petizione su l’Unità .
Di seguito i passaggi più " croccanti " della sentenza di condanna dell ’avv .
Mills
in calce il link dell ’intero documento assieme al verbale dell ’ interrogatorio di Mills nel quale ammette , di sua sponte , che i 600.000 $ sono il premio datogli da Berlusconi per le sue deposizioni reticenti in ordine alla vera proprietà delle società off - shore
(...)
Il fatto che Mills conoscesse perfettamente , in particolare , che Century One e Universal One erano di Marina e Pier Silvio Berlusconi , e che ogni decisione in ordine a tali società poteva esser presa solo da Silvio Berlusconi e dalle persone dal medesimo delegate risulta altrettanto incontrovertibilmente dalle prove assunte ed esposte nel capitolo 2.2 ) i beneficiari economici di Century One e Universal One e i rapporti di Paolo del Bue con la famiglia Berlusconi
(...)
Da tutti i predetti elementi emerge con chiarezza che le deposizioni di Mills nei procedimenti n. 1612/96 e 3510+3511/96 erano state quanto meno reticenti .
Nel primo , “ Guardia di Finanza ” , è stato accertato , in maniera definitiva il fatto storico di cui lì si
trattava : che cioè la Guardia di Finanza era stata corrotta e che le somme erano state pagate affinché
non venissero svolte approfondite indagini in ordine alle società del Gruppo Fininvest e non ne
emergesse la reale proprietà , e che l’azione era stata commessa al fine di eludere le disposizioni
della legge Mammì in tema di concentrazione di mezzi di diffusione di massa .
(...)
In esito a tre gradi di giudizio , non sono stati ritenuti sufficienti gli indizi del collegamento diretto fra i funzionari corrotti e Silvio Berlusconi , collegamento invece definitivamente provato rispetto ad altro dirigente di Fininvest , Salvatore Sciascia , responsabile del servizio centrale fiscale della società , condannato con sentenza irrevocabile .
Nel secondo , “ All Iberian ” , i fatti relativi all ’illecito finanziamento a Bettino Craxi da parte di Fininvest tramite All Iberian sono definitivamente provati , visto che la sentenza di primo grado , di condanna dei vertici della società e fra essi di Silvio Berlusconi , non è stata riformata nel merito , ma per intervenuta prescrizione .
All Iberian e le società offshore collegate erano state costituite su iniziativa del Gruppo Fininvest ; All Iberian era stata utilizzata quale tesoreria delle altre offshore inglesi costituite per conto del medesimo Gruppo e dallo stesso finanziate tramite Principal Finance .
La massa di prove poste alla base del giudizio era imponente , ed esse erano state offerte anche da Mills , che però , in particolare Century One e Universal One , né aveva prodotto documentazione specifica sul punto .(...) Ildi David Mills , in ciascuna delle sue deposizioni , sta nel fatto che egli aveva ricondotto solo genericamente a Fininvest , e , in tal modoin quei procedimenti .
È risultato in questo dibattimento che la condotta di Mills era dettata appunto dalla necessità di ( ...)
Dopo molte e pesanti discussioni , Mills si trovava costretto a suddividere l’intero importo ( diventato di circa 4 miliardi di lire , dopo il pagamento delle tasse e la destinazione rimasta ignota di altri 4 miliardi e settecento milioni ) con i suoi soci , che però ( dopo che già egli ne aveva disposto in piccola parte per proprie spese personali ) ne pretendevano il deposito su un conto vincolato , prudenzialmente , per poterlo rendere immediatamente disponibile in caso di rivendicazioni , eventualmente anche dell ’Autorità giudiziaria italiana .
L’accordo veniva sottoscritto il 27 novembre 1996 .(...) Contemporaneamente , fra il 1995 e il 1996 , le indagini della Procura della Repubblica di Milano portavano all ’emissione di provvedimenti restrittivi anche a carico di dirigenti Fininvest .
Mills restava in contatto con uno di loro , Giorgio Vanoni , durante la sua latitanza , e da questi riceveva indicazioni per la riuscita del progetto – da lui stesso ideato e realizzato – della registrazione delle società in Inghilterra e la contestuale attribuzione a Mills del dividendo , che non poteva rientrare in Italia nella disponibilità del suo effettivo proprietario ( sarebbe emersa fra l’altro , l’avvenuta violazione della legge Mammì ) .
Nello stesso periodo Mills contribuiva all ’occultamento dei documenti delle società offshore .
L’anno dopo , fra la fine del 1997 e l’inizio del 1998 , egli rendeva le sue reticenti ed elusive deposizioni testimoniali .
In quel momento dunque Mills era già stato gratificato di una ingentissima somma , che però non era fin dall ’origine certo potesse restare nella sua disponibilità .(...)
In sostanza : l ’importo di quasi sei miliardi di lire sarebbe potuto restare nella disponibilità di Mills a condizione che la giustizia italiana non lo bloccasse , quale illecito profitto da sequestrare .
Questa la promessa di colui che Mills ha dichiarato essere il reale , originario proprietario della somma , Silvio Berlusconi .
Soggetto che era comunque certamente l’interessato al buon esito dei procedimenti ; che era ed è al vertice del Gruppo di cui le società offshore facevano parte ; alla cui volontà era subordinata qualsiasi decisione quanto a Century One e Universal One ; in nome e per conto del quale agivano tutti i dirigenti Fininvest con cui Mills entrava in contatto e collaborava ; il cui consenso esplicito , infine , aveva consentito il passaggio del dividendo nella disponibilità di Mills .
L’esito dei procedimenti italiani dipendeva anche dalle testimonianze di Mills .
Ed esso , allora , interessava anche Mills direttamente , non solo il suo dante causa : rendendo deposizioni che , quanto meno , potessero limitare i danni che le inchieste di quegli anni stavano cagionando , egli contemporaneamente perseguiva anche il proprio fine illecito : perché , come si è scritto ed è chiaro , un eventuale sequestro da parte della A.G. avrebbe costituito a quel punto una perdita secca anche per lui .
Allo stesso tempo , era evidentemente necessario per tutti che la somma non fosse facilmente rintracciabile : le modalità di investimento dei patrimoni dei clienti da parte dell ’avvocato d’affari , quali descritte in precedenza analizzando le consulenze , costituivano sufficiente garanzia sul punto .
Era infatti difficile ipotizzare , fin dall ’origine , che sarebbe diventata necessaria – pena il disvelamento di tutta la vicenda all ’Autorità giudiziaria inglese – la suddivisione con i soci di studio ( che nel proprio interesse interpretavano la dazione quale pagamento di attività professionale ) , e la sua conseguente rintracciabilità .
L’attribuzione agli stessi delle somme di loro spettanza nel 1999 , anticipatamente rispetto alla data prevista , sortiva così l’effetto di rendere possibile la commistione della rilevante quota spettante a Mills con altri capitali ( fatto puntualmente avvenuto , come risulta , ancora una volta , dall ’analisi delle consulenze ) , fino alla sua emersione ed al suo ingresso nel patrimonio dell ’imputato nel marzo 2000 ( circostanza , anche questa , documentalmente provata ) .
Il c.d. regalo pervenuto a Mills altro non è stato che la dazione di una somma in cui si fondono una parte di quanto pattuito sotto condizione anni prima ed una parte di quanto promessogli in sostituzione della quota prelevata dai soci , e per i suoi ulteriori disagi .
È stata una compensazione e un riconoscimento dell ’ osservanza , da parte sua , dell ’accordo .
L’artificiosa , tanto opaca quanto raffinata , modalità di trasferimento della somma di 600.000 dollariai conti di Mills , la “ roundabout way ” dichiarata da Mills e scoperta dalle consulenze , di per séindicativa della illiceità della complessiva operazione , ha comportato un lungo viaggio nel tempo e negli spazi di volta in volta creati nei contenitori finanziari ( che in questo processo sono stati chiamati “ brocche ” o scatoloni , che potrebbero comunque definirsi centrifughe di lavatrici ) prima di arrivare al corrotto nel marzo 2000 , come si è già scritto al termine dell ’esame delle consulenze .
Verificata come completamente priva di riscontri , senso , ragione e fondamento la costruita “ tesi Attanasio ” , in base all ’analisi delle consulenze e alle deposizioni testimoniali ; disegnato e fondato rigorosamente sulle prove certe raccolte , documentali ancor più che orali , il retroscena ed il contesto della dazione di 600.000 dollari , risulta definitivamente chiaro che l’imputato aveva ragione .
Quanto qui accertato , come si è scritto in precedenza , trova infatti riscontro nelle dichiarazioni di David Mills , rese in forma orale e scritta , ai propri consulenti , all ’Autorità fiscale inglese , all ’ Autorità giudiziaria italiana , fra il 2 febbraio ( data di “ Dear Bob ” ) e il 18 ottobre 2004 ( ultima esternazione di Mills , tramite la propria consulente , allo SCO ) .
Ed altri , successivi riscontri della perdurante relazione economica fra Mills e Fininvest sono in atti:si tratta del fatto che , quanto meno fino alla data dell ’intervenuto accordo fiscale del settembre 2005 – a quanto qui consta , nulla essendo documentato per il periodo successivo – Fininvest , e per essa chi era legittimato a decidere , ha continuato a fornire somme di danaro ( per un ammontare complessivo di circa 100.000 sterline ) a David Mills , al dichiarato fine di pagare ogni spesa connessa con i procedimenti penali italiani in corso .
Così egli ha dichiarato , così ha scritto quale motivazione dell ’accredito , così ha riscontrato Inland Revenue , e la somma è compresa nell ’accordo fiscale raggiunto .

From his web page :
Why I think that Michael Mann , Phil Jones and Stefan Rahmstorf should be barred from the IPCC process
by Eduardo Zorita , Scientist at the Institute for Coastal Research , specialist in Paleoclimatology , Review Editor of Climate Research and IPCC co-author .
Short answer : because the scientific assessments in which they may take part are not credible anymore .
A longer answer :
My voice is not very important .
I belong to the climate - research infantry , publishing a few papers per year , reviewing a few manuscript per year and participating in a few research projects .
I do not form part of important committees , nor I pursue a public awareness of my activities .
My very minor task in the public arena was to participate as a contributing author in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC .
By writing these lines I will just probably achieve that a few of my future studies will , again , not see the light of publication .
My area of research happens to be the climate of the past millennia , where I think I am appreciated by other climate - research ‘ soldiers ’ .
And it happens that some of my mail exchange with Keith Briffa and Timothy Osborn can be found in the CRU - files made public recently on the internet .
To the question of legality or ethicalness of reading those files I will write a couple of words later .
I may confirm what has been written in other places : research in some areas of climate science has been and is full of machination , conspiracies , and collusion , as any reader can interpret from the CRU - files .
They depict a realistic , I would say even harmless , picture of what the real research in the area of the climate of the past millennium has been in the last years .
The scientific debate has been in many instances hijacked to advance other agendas .
These words do not mean that I think anthropogenic climate change is a hoax .
On the contrary , it is a question which we have to be very well aware of .
But I am also aware that in this thick atmosphere - and I am not speaking of greenhouse gases now - editors , reviewers and authors of alternative studies , analysis , interpretations , even based on the same data we have at our disposal , have been bullied and subtly blackmailed .
In this atmosphere , Ph D students are often tempted to tweak their data so as to fit the ‘ politically correct picture ’ .
Some , or many issues , about climate change are still not well known .
Policy makers should be aware of the attempts to hide these uncertainties under a unified picture .
I had the ‘ pleasure ’ to experience all this in my area of research .
I thank explicitely Keith Briffa and Tim Osborn for their work in the formulation of one Chapter of the IPCC report .
As it destills from these emails , they withstood the evident pressure of other IPCC authors , not experts in this area of research , to convey a distorted picture of our knowledge of the hockey - stick graph .
Is legal or ethical to read the CRU files ?
I am not a lawyer .
It seems that if the files had been hacked this would constitute an illegal act .
If they have been leaked it could be a whistle blower action protected by law .
I think it is not unethical to read them .
Once published , I feel myself entitled to read how some researchers tried to influence reviewers to scupper the publication of our work on the ‘ hockey stick graph ’ or to read how some IPCC authors tried to exclude this work from the IPCC Report on very dubious reasons .
Also , these mails do not contain any personal information at all .
They are an account of many dull daily activities of typical climatologists , together with a realistic account of very troubling professional behavior .

Even though Diamond , Country Value and Professional brand dog foods have been recalled for containing highly toxic aflatoxins , they have caused at least 100 dog deaths in recent weeks , say Cornell University veterinarians , who are growing increasingly alarmed .
Some kennels and consumers around the nation and possibly in more than two dozen other countries remain unaware of the tainted food , and as a result , they continue to give dogs food containing a lethal toxin .
To better screen affected dogs so they can be treated as soon as possible , Cornell veterinarians report that they now have a new test , adapted from one used in humans , to accurately assess aflatoxin poisoning in dogs ( see companion story ) .
Currently , about two - thirds of dogs that show symptoms after eating the tainted food die .
" Entire kennels have been wiped out , and because of the holiday these past few weeks , the dispersal of recall information was disrupted , " says Sharon Center , a professor of veterinary medicine who specializes in liver function and disease at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell , which is emerging as a central clearinghouse for information about the dog food poisoning .
The Cornell Vet College is continually updating its Web site ( http://www.vet.cornell.edu ) to keep the public and veterinarians informed as new information on the poisonings emerge .
Cornell 's Animal Health Diagnostic Center ( AHDC ) is analyzing blood and liver samples from sick dogs around the country , testing suspected dog food , conducting autopsies and collecting as many livers as possible from dead dogs to confirm cause of death , tracking dogs that have died and following up on the health of dogs that survive the food poisoning .
The AHDC has information for veterinarians on its Web site http://diaglab.vet.cornell.edu/news.asp.
" We suspect that dogs have been dying since November , perhaps even October , but it took the perfect storm of circumstances to get the diagnosis , " said Karyn Bischoff , the veterinary toxicologist at Cornell who first identified aflatoxin as the culprit in the recent wave of deaths .
Trying to save dogs
Over the recent holiday weeks , Center and her staff worked around - the - clock to try to save the 17 poisoned dogs admitted to Cornell 's Hospital for Animals .
" I 've been working with liver disease in dogs for 30 years , and I 've never seen such miserably ill dogs , " said Center , noting that severely affected dogs suffer from intractable vomiting and internal bleeding .
" Despite our understanding of this complex toxin , we have no direct antidote for this poisoning .
This has been an immensely sad holiday and one that will leave an indelible mark on the owners that lost their cherished family members . "
Of those 17 dogs , Center euthanized 12 when it became clear they could not survive ; five are still being treated .
Dogs that have survived had consumed a smaller amount of the food than dogs that died , Center said .
" Some dogs were stealing food from the kitchen counter .
Others just stopped eating the food and begged for treats .
Unfortunately , some owners used gravy and other mixers to entice their dogs to consume what they thought was safe , quality dog food . "
" It 's devastating to dog owners who feel responsible for poisoning their beloved dogs , " said Bischoff .
Although only about two dozen animal deaths have been officially linked to the tainted pet food , Center and Bischoff know that many more have died or become ill from the tainted food , based on their many communications with veterinarians as far south as Georgia .
" Every day , we 're hearing reports from veterinarians in the East and Southeast who have treated dogs that have died from liver damage this past month or so , " said Center .
" We 're also concerned about the long - term health of dogs that survive as well as dogs that have eaten the tainted food but show no clinical signs . "
She suspects that surviving dogs may develop chronic liver disease , perhaps liver cancer , and that many dogs that ate the tainted food appear healthy are nevertheless victims of liver damage .
Yet many dog and kennel owners remain unaware that some 19 brands of Diamond , Country Value and Professional dog foods have been recalled .
" About half of our clients bringing in sick dogs this past week say that they were not aware of the contaminated dog food problem , " said Sara Sanders , one of the veterinarians at Mendon Valley Animal Hospital near Rochester -- the sort of ground zero for the epidemic that resulted in the recall .
She first realized that several dogs she was treating for liver problems in December were all eating Diamond food , and she sent food and tissue samples to Cornell , her alma mater , for testing .
Screening ill dogs
Early signs that a dog has been poisoned by afltoxin include lethargy , loss of appetite and vomiting and , later , orange - colored urine and jaundice ( a yellowing of the eyes , gums and nonpigmented skin that reflects substantial liver injury ) .
Severely affected dogs produce a blood - tinged vomit and bloody or blackened stools .
" Since dogs can take several days to three weeks to exhibit serious signs of illness , all animals that consumed recalled lots of food should be examined by a veterinarian as early as possible , " Center said .
" Physical exams and blood tests are necessary to differentiate dogs that have been poisoned from those that have not .
Unfortunately , the latent onset of signs may require that an individual dog be evaluated several times . "
Cornell veterinarians have verified diagnostic tests enabling detection of seriously poisoned dogs .
Aflatoxin curtails the production of cholesterol and many proteins that profoundly affect blood clotting .
A minimum screening profile should assess the liver enzyme ALT to detect damage to the liver , serum cholesterol , total bilirubin concentration and the activity of the anticoagulant proteins antithrombin III ( ATIII ) and protein C .
The coagulation protein tests , which have been adapted for dogs by Cornell researchers , have high value in detecting affected dogs but require collection of a special blood sample ( citrated plasma sample ) and an assessment by Cornell 's Animal Health Diagnostic Center .
Any dog suspected of aflatoxin poisoning should also have a liver specimen sent to Cornell to definitively confirm the pathologic changes in the liver unique for aflatoxin toxicity , such as fatty degeneration of individual cells .
" Even if dogs show no signs of illness , if they have eaten the affected food , they should have blood tests submitted to detect liver injury , " Center stressed .
" Dogs that show positive results on any of the above tests should be prescribed liver protectants for two months . "
For more details , veterinarians should check the Cornell Vet College Web site .
Owners also should take cats that might have eaten contaminated dog food to a vet .
Two cats that may have eaten the tainted dog food have died , but no cause of death was determined .
