Late morning in the gaudy splendour of a mock colonial mansion on a gated Beverly Hills estate , a sturdy woman in an oversized T - shirt and sporting a strawberry blonde time - warp perm is doggedly steering a vacuum cleaner over a wall - to - wall fake leopardskin carpet .
She is marked out from the other domestic staff in these New Money surroundings only by the fact that , as she sets about her chores , she takes occasional sips from a flute of chilled Dom Perignon champagne .
This , in her somewhat unlikely " Mrs Mop " guise , is Lady Melinda Woodward - better known , perhaps , as the wife for 51 years of singer Sir Tom Jones .
( The star changed his name from Woodward before finding fame . )
Hidden behind the walls of her luxurious home , this is her daily ritual .
Though a cook and maid arrive daily , " Lady Linda , " as she prefers to be known , refuses to relinquish the task of running the vacuum cleaner over the shag pile , or polishing the acres of brass that vie for space in these showy confines .
Scroll down for more ...
She breaks off only to lunch on a tinned steak and kidney pie - bought from a Los Angeles shop that specialises in British staples such as baked beans and rich tea biscuits for Hollywood 's expat contingent .
It is served to her on a goldplated tray as she settles down in front of the TV to watch BBC America .
The 67 - year - old grandmother - of - two rarely , however , ventures as far as the swimming pool and patio , with its million - dollar views from Mulholland Drive over the San Fernando Valley .
In recent years , her palace in this celebrity enclave ( Robbie Williams lives a couple of doors away ) has become little more than a gilded prison for the wife of the Welsh - born superstar .
Stricken by agoraphobia and a terror of having to meet people , she has become her own jailer .
" She does n't like to go out , " Tom 's cousin Dorothy Woodward , who has been a recent visitor to the house , revealed this week .
" I 've seen for myself the way she is .
She will go out occasionally if Tom is there , but , of course , Tom is away such a lot .
It 's a great shame . "
Indeed , so infrequently has Linda left the house , that last week , when the couple were photographed together leaving a DVD rental store in Los Angeles , it was the first time anyone could recall seeing a picture of her in years .
She cut a distinctly drab figure .
Wearing baggy black trousers and T - shirt , and carrying a " Big Shopper " style bag , her mottled green fleece was more Matalan than Malibu .
It is an image a million miles from the type of Hollywood wife one might imagine seeing on the arm of a man who is reputed to have amassed a £ 190 million fortune .
But even this low - key appearance away from the house is being seen as something of a minor triumph by those close to the couple , who have become increasingly concerned about Linda 's state of mind .
She is said to live in irrational terror of falling victim to gun crime .
She insisted they sell their 16 - room home , once owned by Dean Martin , in exclusive - and tranquil - Bel Air , because she had become obsessed that she was going to be gunned down on her doorstep .
Reluctantly ,
Tom sold the house they had lived in since the Seventies to actor Nicolas Cage .
But even though their new home is protected by 24 - hour armed guards , Linda still will not venture out alone and refuses to learn to drive - which in itself is tantamount to pulling up the drawbridge in car - obsessed LA .
Family members say she is also cripplingly self - conscious and hates being seen in public .
She will only ever consider going out , they say , if Tom parks the car at the kerb and she can rush into a shop .
" Even then , she is in and out , " said one relative .
" She gets panicky if she is out for more than a few minutes .
" It 's got steadily worse , and she can go months without going out the door .
It 's dreadful , because Tom is away most of the time on tour and she gets very lonely .
But she is just too terrified to go out and meet people . "
The situation has become so bad that the 67 - year - old Sex Bomb singer has tried to persuade his wife , whom he married when they were both 16 , to return to Britain .
Sources say he has viewed a series of flats in London , as well as a country house in Oxfordshire , near the Henley - on - Thames home of their only son Mark Woodward , who is his father 's manager .
Family members say Tom would be happier if Linda could be near Mark and his wife Donna , who have two grown - up children , while he is on the road .
However , Linda has refused to fly since the 9/11 attacks on New York , and the star has now become resigned to the fact he may never again be able to persuade her to board a flight home to Britain .
When Tom was knighted by the Queen in 2006 , there were raised eyebrows when Linda failed to accompany her husband to Buckingham Palace .
She watched the ceremony alone on TV in the U.S. , while Tom , his son , daughter - in - law and granddaughter Emma went on to a 12 - hour celebration at London 's Berkeley Hotel .
But missing out on the sort of glamorous lifestyle her husband 's celebrity offers is - excuse the play on words - not unusual .
Since the Sixties , Linda has refused to watch her husband perform live after she became upset by his female fans ' habit of throwing their underwear on stage .
Friends say she has also come to dread going out in public because she fears she is being gossiped and sniggered about because of Tom 's formidable reputation as an unreconstructed Lothario .
Indeed , their marriage - one of the most enduring in showbiz - is notable for the apparent ease with which she has been able to turn a blind eye to his numerous infidelities .
Jones admits that at the height of his womanising , he was sleeping with up to 250 girls a year .
Such was his voracious appetite for sex that , for much of his career , he insisted on having two dressing rooms .
One was for entertaining guests ; the other - euphemistically called the " workbench " - was where he would entertain a carousel of willing groupies .
Lady Linda 's ostrich - like approach to Tom 's unfaithfulness extends , say associates , to her refusing for years to allow newspapers in the house , as well as employing a self - protective form of double - think .
" When he is away , he is Tom Jones , the singer ; but when he is at home , Linda has always thought of him as Tommy Woodward , her husband , " Tom 's cousin Dorothy told me .
" It 's the way she deals with it . "
Nonetheless , Jones admitted a year ago on a U.S. chat show that when his wife was confronted with evidence of one dalliance in a newspaper , she reacted by beating him black and blue .
Likewise , during her husband 's twoyear affair with Mary Wilson of The Supremes in the Seventies , she is said to have tracked them down to a Bournemouth love - nest and screamed at him : " You get that cow out of there now . "
But she was forced to endure him carrying on with a succession of women , including Miss World Marjorie Wallace , who took an overdose ( from which she eventually recovered ) after Linda discovered the affair and demanded the singer put a stop to it .
The only time , say family members , that their marriage has been seriously threatened was in 1989 , when a 24 - year - old U.S. model called Katherine Berkery announced she was pregnant with Jones 's child after spending a weekend with the star in a suite at New York 's Ritz Carlton Hotel .
Jones denied he was the father , and in a rare public appearance , Linda opened the bedroom window of their mansion in her nightie to tell reporters she believed her husband was innocent .
Later , however , after a DNA test proved there was a 99.7 per cent chance that he was , indeed , the father , the star quietly agreed to pay £ 2,000 - a- month maintenance for the baby , called Jonathan .
And ten years ago , he reached a £ 50,000 out - of - court settlement after Miss Berkery again went to court to seek a bigger allowance for the boy , now 19 , whom Jones has never met .
After being faced with such tangible proof of his faithlessness , Linda announced she was heading home to South Wales , and
Jones put her up in Cardiff 's Holiday Inn while work was being carried out on a ten - acre property he bought her in the Vale of Glamorgan .
But a lonely Linda , who was eight months pregnant when she married Jones , then a humble factory worker , at Pontypridd register office in March 1957 , ventured out only to queue every day for lunch at the local fish and chip shop .
Within months , she was back in Los Angeles with Tom .
After his first hit , It 's Not Unusual , propelled him to international stardom in 1965 , Linda enjoyed a lavish lifestyle of shopping for designer clothes and accompanying her husband to a never - ending round of parties .
But friends say she gradually became more and more reclusive .
She is said to have reacted with fury and hurled empty bottles at him when Jones once arrived home unannounced with a couple of friends to play snooker .
In a rare insight into their problems , the singer last year admitted he was unable to build close friendships with fellow stars because he felt unable to invite them back to his home .
" Linda 's a shy person , " he told an interviewer .
" If I said Jack Nicholson will be coming over , she 'd get in a state .
When Robbie Williams came round , she hid in the bathroom .
It has n't been easy .
" She knows she has a depression problem if she does n't watch herself .
She says it runs in her family .
Her father was a bit like that , apparently , and her grandmother .
Sometimes she can't get out or does n't want to meet people . "
Last March , when they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary , Linda refused the lavish party Tom wanted to organise and insisted they spend the evening quietly at home .
Friends say she spends much of her time alone while her husband tours .
Tom 's sister Sheila , who also lives in Los Angeles , occasionally visits , but mostly her only contact is with her cook and maid .
" But even though she has the hired help , she still insists on doing the housework and is obsessive about keeping the place pristine , ' one family friend said .
' She always drinks a glass of champagne while she 's doing it .
Sadly , it 's one of her few pleasures .
" I think she would like to come home to Britain to be near her son , but I do n't think she would be able to make the trip - by land or sea .
It would be too terrifying for her , given that she 's an agoraphobic .
" Tom has been talking about coming back for a while , because he says that , under Californian law , Linda will have to pay 50 per cent tax on his estate when he dies .
" He 's working as hard as ever and is away a lot , so he worries about her .
" Despite all the affairs , he has never loved anyone else ; and she loves him .
She still lights up when he is around .
" Tom keeps gently trying to persuade her to leave the house - and occasionally she will , but only if he goes with her . '
For the rest of the time , it seems , the lonely and troubled Lady Linda will continue to remain imprisoned in her lavish , gilded cage .
Spokesman for Baghdad security plan abducted
A spokesman for the Baghdad security plan , Tahsin al - Sheikhly , was kidnapped from his Baghdad home by armed men on Thursday , security officials told AFP .
An Interior Ministry official told the Associated Press that three of spokesman 's bodyguards were killed .
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to release the information .
The officials said Sheikhly , a Sunni who often appeared with U.S. military and embassy officials at news conferences to tout the successes of the crackdown that began in Baghdad and surrounding areas more than a year ago , was abducted from his home in Baghdad 's Al - Amin neighbourhood at around 2:30 pm ( 1130 GMT ) .
" Armed men stormed his home at a time when there were clashes in his neighbourhood , " a security official with the interior ministry said .
" They burnt his home and stole two cars and weapons before fleeing with him . "

Google 's home is in Mountain View , California
Google is pressing the US government to allow the unlicensed frequencies of TV " white space " to be used for wi-fi .
The firm has written an open letter to regulators saying the US spectrum was a " once in a lifetime opportunity " .
White space is unused blocks of frequencies in - between channels broadcast on analogue airwaves .
" The vast majority of viable spectrum in this country simply goes unused , or else is grossly underutilised , " wrote Google 's Richard Whitt in the letter .
" Unlike other natural resources , there is no benefit to allowing this spectrum to lie fallow , " he added .
Google has said the white space could be used to bring " ubiquitous wireless broadband access to all Americans " .
In the past TV broadcasters have opposed the use of white space , fearing it would cause interference with television programming .
Google believes the spectrum could create a wi-fi dividend
But in its letter , Google urged the FCC to adopt a series of overlapping technologies , including " spectrum sensing , " designed to prevent signals from interfering with each other .
Mr Whitt said there was enough unused spectrum for businesses to create a wide range of options , such as building small peer - to - peer networks or even establishing an alternative national wireless network .
Google has said that devices designed to take advantage of the white space spectrum could be on the market by the end of 2009 .
Other countries are also looking at using white space spectrum .
In the UK much of this space is being dedicated for use by services like wireless microphones for broadcast use , and for cognitive radio , a smart wireless technology that allows for the use of wi-fi .
Fellowship of the Ring - HD vs DVD
I used WinDVD 6 to capture files from the DVD , and Elecard Mpeg2 player to capture from the HD stream .
Both were captured directly to BMP files and converted to JPG at very high quality so there should be almost no artifacting introduced ( sorry , the BMP files were too large to use ) .
I used Photoshop to bicubically resample the DVD source images from 852x480 to match the 1920x1080 of the HD images .
This page features the HD image sampled down to the DVD 's resolution of 852x480 .
Surprisingly , even at DVD - resolution the HD source features more detail .
Mouseover any of the images here to see the HD downsample .
You can see the full - size comparisons by clicking on the images on this page .
The difference is pretty amazing .
I tried to capture identical frames on both sources , but I missed by a frame or two on some of these .

I spent most of this week at the big conference organised every two years by EWEA ( European Wind Energy Association ) on offshore wind , which took place in Berlin over this week .
It was a huge event , with close to 2,000 participants and a palpable energy and a sense of - finally - progress .
The conference was attended by the ministers for energy or senior political representatives from several countries ( the UK , Germany , several Nordic countries - see the link above ) and happened at the same time as an important German government meeting that decided to increase offshore tariffs to 14c / kWh , a strongly supportive measure which is likely to be the starting point of a massive wave of investment in the sector in that country .
Interestingly , despite that decision , and the excitement it generated , the UK market is still seen as likely to be bigger than the German one over the next 10 - 15 years , with all other markets being somewhat smaller .
in black : existing wind farms ; in blue : those scheduled for construction by 2009 .

Just over 900MW of offshore wind had been built by end 2006 ( compared to 74,000 MW onshore ) , as shown below , but the plan is to get to 40,000 MW of offshore wind in Europe by 2020 , with approximately half in the UK , a quarter in Germany and the rest spread across Europe , mostly in the North Sea ( which has good winds and shallow waters ) .

The industry , like others , has suffered from rapidly increasing costs in recent times , from increased commodity prices , overstretched suppliers and , it must be said , still unresolved technical difficulties with some turbine models that have been withdrawn from the market after encountering technical difficulties .
There is a lot of focus on reaching a scale sufficient to rationalise and standardise both manufacturing and offshore installation , after the early years of projects designed on a case - by - case basis .
The graph below reflects costs prior to commodity increases - but these apply equally to other sectors , so all technologies are more expensive today .
The great advantage of wind in that respect , of course , is that once it is built , the cost is fixed : you only have to repay the initial investment , a fixed amount , and not to buy fuel , whether coal , natural gas or oil , whose prices can also increase - and indeed have .
And an other overlooked advantage is that wind 's marginal cost ( the cost of production of an additional kWh ) is close to zero , so whenever wind blows , this takes out more expensive producers and reduces prices for everybody .
In fact , a Danish study has demonstrated that the resulting savings for that country are now larger than the subsidies provided to wind ...
Even if it is unreliable due to its intermittency , wind still has a real effect on both electricity prices as well as on carbon emissions , as each kWh of wind will usually displace a marginal kWh generated by a gas or oil - fired plant .

Offshore wind is still more expensive than onshore ( thus the need for additional support in the early years of this new industry ) , but it responds to the fact that Europe is quite small and densely packed , and some areas will not be able to take more wind turbines , especially the huge models now available , which tower more than a hundred meters above ground .
With winds at sea being stronger and more regular , it is the obvious place to put industrial size wind farms , and the hope is that economies of scale will eventually make it cost effective ( it is already competitive compared to gas - fired power , given natural gas prices ) - and of course , that production that can be scaled to levels that allow the sector to represent a significant fraction of total energy production .
The European goal for 2020 , 20 % of all energy from renewable sources is quite ambitious , as it means that more than 20 % of all electricity should come from wind by then .

Another obvious trend was how the industry is now dominated by the large players , in particular on the investor side - the business is essentially run by the big utilities , with a few independent developers remaining ( and those that have good prospects are usually take - over targets for the bigger players right now ) .
On the manufacturing side , the presence in the business of GE ( currently absent from offshore as they have no appropriate turbine , their 3.6MW model having shown unsufficiently reliable performance ) , French nuclear energy giant Areva ( via Multibrid , still in the early stages of integration ) , German engineering group Siemens ( the dominant player offshore ) shows that concentration is well under way , and the fate of Vestas ( still the largest wind turbine manufacturer overall , but a small company compared to the big indistrial groups ) and Repower ( focused on offshore , but whose main shareholder , Indian - based Suzlon , is itself a pure wind player and thus quite small as well ) will certainly become a hot issue in the future .
Offshore wind is heavy industry : a nacelle weights 100-300 tons , a blade is 50 meters long , a tower is 80 meter high , etc ... Managing 20 - 30 % p.a. growth rates in heavy industry is extremely hard to do - logistics , supply chains and financial commitments are complex , and a wrong bet on where demand will be ( on the high or on the low side ) can have devastating consequences .
Thus we need to ensure at least a level - playing field , with stable regulation over many years ( the opposite of what has happened in the US over the past ten years , with the PTC , the main support mechanism for the industry being renewed haphazardly and for short periods only , leading to collapsing production in some years .
The current version of the Energy Bill , as approved by the House , extends the PTC for 4 years , which is the best that has been done this decade , so it 's progress .

Offshore wind is less urgent in the US than it is in Europe , as there is still plenty of room onshore to grow ( and with a much better wind resource than in Europe ) and thus less need to pay the higher cost of offshore , but there could be some projects in areas like the Great Lakes or in the densely populated North - East .
In any case , there is no silver bullet , and wind ( and a fortiori offshore wind ) is not by any means the only solution .
But today , it is the technology with the best prospects to have a real impact on our carbon emissions , at a low economic cost , and with very real positive effects on overall employment , redevelopment of isolated areas , and security of supply .
Wind is free , clean , indigenous , and available today .

Poland 's neighbour Russia is opposed to the US shield
In return for hosting part of the shield , the US has said it will help bolster Poland 's air defences .
The US wants to install interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic .
Russia opposes the project , saying it would destabilise global security and undermine its own nuclear deterrent .
In October , Russian President Vladimir Putin compared the plans to the Cuban missile crisis of the 1960s , which saw the US and Soviet Union go to the brink of nuclear war .
Russia has threatened to point missiles at Europe if the US positions elements of the new missile shield near its borders .
' Middle of the road '
In response to this threat , Poland says it wants help to upgrade its air defences .
Speaking in Washington , Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski said he was satisfied that the security concerns Poland had raised would be dealt with .
" There is still a great deal of work for our experts ...
But yes , I am satisfied that the principles that we have argued for have been accepted , " he said .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said : " We understand that there is a desire for defence modernisation in Poland and particularly for air defence modernisation in Poland .
This is something that we support because it will make our ally , Poland , more capable . "
America wants to install 10 interceptor missiles to protect against possible attack by what it calls rogue states , such as Iran and North Korea .
But Mr Sikorski said there was still a long way to go .
" We are not at the end of the road as regards negotiations .
We are in the middle of the road , " he said .
" We have an agreement in principle . "
Any final agreement will have to be ratified by the Polish parliament .
The Czech government aims to submit a draft accord on the radar base to parliament in April .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The National Academy of Sciences on Thursday issued a spirited defense of evolution as the bedrock principle of modern biology , arguing that it , not creationism , must be taught in public school science classes .

The academy , which operates under a mandate from Congress to advise the government on science and technology matters , issued the report at a time when the theory of evolution , first offered in the 19th century , faces renewed attack by some religious conservatives .
Creationism , based on the explanation offered in the Bible , and the related idea of “ intelligent design ” are not science and , as such , should not be taught in public school science classrooms , according to the report .
“ We seem to have continuing challenges to the teaching of evolution in schools .
That ’s something that does n’t seem to go away , ” Barbara Schaal , an evolutionary biologist at Washington University in St. Louis and vice president of National Academy of Sciences , said in a telephone interview .
“ We need a citizenry that ’s trained in real science . ”
Evolution is a theory explaining change in living organisms over the eons due to genetic mutations .
For example , it holds that humans evolved from earlier forms of apes .
The report stated that the idea of evolution can be fully compatible with religious faith .
“ Science and religion are different ways of understanding the world .
Needlessly placing them in opposition reduces the potential of each to contribute to a better future , ” said the report .
But teaching creationist ideas in science classes confuses students about what constitutes science and what does not , according to the report ’s authors .
The report was released by the academy and the Institute of Medicine , which advises policymakers on medical issues .
It updates academy publications issued in 1984 and 1999 .
It was written by a committee headed by University of California - Irvine biology professor Francisco Ayala .
“ Biological evolution is one of the most important ideas of modern science .
Evolution is supported by abundant evidence from many different fields of scientific investigation .
It underlies the modern biological sciences , including the biomedical sciences , and has applications in many other scientific and engineering disciplines , ” the report stated .
The authors highlighted developments in evolutionary biology , citing its importance in understanding emerging infectious diseases .
They noted the discovery , published in 2006 , of the remains of a Tiktaalik , a creature described as an evolutionary link between fish and the first vertebrate animals that walked out of water onto land 375 million years ago .
President George W. Bush said in 2005 American students should be instructed about “ intelligent design ” alongside evolution as competing theories .
“ Part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought , ” Bush said .
Advocates of “ intelligent design ” contend that some biological structures are so complex they could not have appeared merely through natural processes .
A judge in Dover , Pennsylvania ruled in 2005 that the teaching of intelligent design violated the U.S. Constitution , which requires a separation of church and state , because it is based on religious conviction , not science .
A 2006 Gallup poll showed that almost half of Americans believe that humans did not evolve but were created by God in their present form within the last 10,000 years .
Intel chair to Bush on FISA : I will not back down to you RAW STORY
Published : Thursday February 14 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Congressman Silvestre Reyes , Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , sent a letter to President Bush regarding the ongoing battle over warrantless wiretapping .
Text of the letter follows below .
# President George W. Bush The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. , NW Washington , DC 20500 Dear Mr. President : The Preamble to our Constitution states that one of our highest duties as public officials is to " provide for the common defence . "
As an elected Member of Congress , a senior Member of the House Armed Services Committee , and Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , I work everyday to ensure that our defense and intelligence capabilities remain strong in the face of serious threats to our national security .
Because I care so deeply about protecting our country , I take strong offense to your suggestion in recent days that the country will be vulnerable to terrorist attack unless Congress immediately enacts legislation giving you broader powers to conduct warrantless surveillance of Americans ' communications and provides legal immunity for telecommunications companies that participated in the Administration 's warrantless surveillance program .
Today , the National Security Agency ( NSA ) has authority to conduct surveillance in at least three different ways , all of which provide strong capability to monitor the communications of possible terrorists .
First , NSA can use its authority under Executive Order 12333 to conduct surveillance abroad of any known or suspected terrorist .
There is no requirement for a warrant .
There is no requirement for probable cause .
Most of NSA 's collection occurs under this authority .
Second , NSA can use its authority under the Protect America Act , enacted last August , to conduct surveillance here in the U.S of any foreign target .
This authority does not " expire " on Saturday , as you have stated .
Under the PAA , orders authorizing surveillance may last for one year  until at least August 2008 .
These orders may cover every terrorist group without limitation .
If a new member of the group is identified , or if a new phone number or email address is identified , the NSA may add it to the existing orders , and surveillance can begin immediately .
We will not " go dark . "
Third , in the remote possibility that a new terrorist organization emerges that we have never previously identified , the NSA could use existing authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) to monitor those communications .
Since its establishment nearly 30 years ago , the FISA Court has approved nearly every application for a warrant from the Department of Justice .
In an emergency , NSA or the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) may begin surveillance immediately , and a FISA Court order does not have to be obtained for three days .
The former head of FISA operations for the Department of Justice has testified publicly that emergency authorization may be granted in a matter of minutes .
As you know , the 1978 FISA law , which has been modernized and updated numerous times since 9/11 , was instrumental in disrupting the terrorist plot in Germany last summer .
Those who say that FISA is outdated do not understand the strength of this important tool .
If our nation is left vulnerable in the coming months , it will not be because we do n't have enough domestic spying powers .
It will be because your Administration has not done enough to defeat terrorist organizations  including al Qaeda -- that have gained strength since 9/11 .
We do not have nearly enough linguists to translate the reams of information we currently collect .
We do not have enough intelligence officers who can penetrate the hardest targets , such as al Qaeda .
We have surged so many intelligence resources into Iraq that we have taken our eye off the ball in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
As a result , you have allowed al Qaeda to reconstitute itself on your watch .
You have also suggested that Congress must grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies .
As someone who has been briefed on our most sensitive intelligence programs , I can see no argument why the future security of our country depends on whether past actions of telecommunications companies are immunized .
The issue of telecom liability should be carefully considered based on a full review of the documents that your Administration withheld from Congress for eight months .
However , it is an insult to the intelligence of the American people to say that we will be vulnerable unless we grant immunity for actions that happened years ago .
Congress has not been sitting on its hands .
Last November , the House passed responsible legislation to authorize the NSA to conduct surveillance of foreign terrorists and to provide clarity and legal protection to our private sector partners who assist in that surveillance .
The proper course is now to conference the House bill with the Senate bill that was passed on Tuesday .
There are significant differences between these two bills and a conference , in regular order , is the appropriate mechanism to resolve the differences between these two bills .
I urge you , Mr. President , to put partisanship aside and allow Republicans in Congress to arrive at a compromise that will protect America and protect our Constitution .
I , for one , do not intend to back down  not to the terrorists and not to anyone , including a President , who wants Americans to cower in fear .
We are a strong nation .
We cannot allow ourselves to be scared into suspending the Constitution .
If we do that , we might as well call the terrorists and tell them that they have won .
Sincerely , Silvestre Reyes

But in a laboratory setting , degus can do much more than play hide - and - seek , according to a study in the online journal Plos One ( www.plosone.org).
They can learn to use tools .
Specifically , degus have been trained to reach through a fence , grab hold of a tiny rake and pull their favorite food , half a peeled sunflower seed , close enough to reach with their mouths .
After two months of practice , researchers say , the degus can move the rake as smoothly and efficiently as croupiers in any Las Vegas casino .
This is first time rodents have been trained to wield tools , said Atshushi Iriki , a neuroscientist , who led the experiments at the Laboratory for Symbolic Cognitive Development at the Riken Institute in Tokyo .
But other species may soon join them .
Corporate users of Apple Inc.'s Leopard operating system are more than five times more likely to say that they are " very satisfied " with the OS than business users of Microsoft Corp . 's Windows Vista , a research firm said last week .
In a February survey of 2,200 U.S. corporate computer users , 53 % of those using Mac OS X 10.5 reported that they were very satisfied with their operating system .
Of those using Windows XP or Windows Vista , however , 40 % of the former and only 8 % of the latter said they were very satisfied .
" Apple continues to set the standard for corporate customer satisfaction , " said Paul Carton , director of research at ChangeWave Research .
That , and the fact that corporate buying plans for Macs remain at historically high levels , indicate that users like what Apple 's doing , continued Carton .
According to ChangeWave 's survey , 7 % of the corporate respondents who said their company would purchase laptops in the next 90 days were planning on buying Apple .
" Apple held at 7 % , the same as November , " said Carton , referring to a similar survey late last year .
Most other vendors , in fact , slipped in ChangeWave 's corporate buying plans poll .
Fewer companies with purchasing plans figure on buying a Dell notebook in the next three months than reported they would in November ( down a percentage point ) .
HP ( down two points ) , Lenovo ( down two points ) and Toshiba ( down one point ) also dropped in the survey .
But while Apple shows some sales strength even as the general pace of U.S. corporate computer sales looks to slow in the next quarter , it remains a minor player in the market , reported ChangeWave .
More than half -- 53 % -- of the computers companies plan to buy in the second quarter will be equipped with Windows XP , the survey said , compared to 20 % with a version of Windows Vista and just 8 % with Mac OS X .

DHS finalizing plans for domestic spy satellite program Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday December 20 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Congress has not been updated since civil liberties concerns delayed satellite spying A plan to dramatically widen US law enforcement agencies ' access to data from powerful spy satellites is moving toward implementation , as Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff expects to finalize a charter for the program this week , according to a new report .
Chertoff insists the scheme to turn spy satellites -- that were originally designed for foreign surveillance -- on Americans is legal , although a House committee that would approve the program has not been updated on the program for three months .
" We still have n't seen the legal framework we requested or the standard operation procedures on how the NAO will actually be run , " House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie G. Thompson tells the Wall Street Journal .
Thompson was referring to the National Applications Office -- a new DHS subset that would coordinate access to spy - satellite data for non-military domestic agencies , including law enforcement .
Civil liberties concerns delayed the program after lawmakers and outside activists wondered how the program would be structured to protect Americans from unconstitutional surveillance from the powerful satellites , which can see through cloud cover , trees and even concrete buildings .
The program 's charter remains unfinalized , but Chertoff said it will use clear language to explain legal restrictions on the data 's use .
Warrants will be obtained when required before collecting satellite intelligence , and the program wo n't use technology to intercept verbal communications , according to the Journal .
" One lesson I 've learned is it 's not enough to say we know what we 're doing is going to be OK , " Chertoff told the paper in an interview .
" We 've got to really make it clear to the public that we 're doing this , but we 're not doing that . "
Fluoride ’s ability to damage the brain is one of the most active areas of fluoride research today .
Over 400 studies have found that fluoride is a neurotoxin ( a chemical that can damage the brain ) .
This research includes :
Based on this accumulating body of research , several prestigious reviews — including a report authored by the U.S. National Research Council , a meta - analysis published by a team of Harvard scientists , a review published in The Lancet , and a 2017 U.S. - funded 12 - year study that found a link between fluoride in the urine of pregnant women and lower measures of intelligence in their children — have raised red flags about the potential for low levels of fluoride to harm brain development in some members of the population .
The NRC Review ( 2006 )
In 2006 , the National Research Council ( NRC ) stated that “ it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain . ”
In addition to calling for U.S. - based research on fluoride ’s IQ effects , the NRC expressed concern about fluoride ’s possible contribution to dementia .
According to the NRC :
“ Studies of populations exposed to different concentrations of fluoride should be undertaken to evaluate neurochemical changes that may be associated with dementia .
Consideration should be given to assessing effects from chronic exposure , effects that might be delayed or occur late - in - life , and individual susceptibility . ”
Harvard Review ( 2012 )
In July of 2012 , a team of Harvard researchers published a “ meta- analysis ” of 27 studies that have investigated the relationship between fluoride and human intelligence .
( Choi 2012 ) The overwhelming majority of these studies found that fluoride exposure was associated with reduced IQ in children .
In fact , 26 of the 27 studies that met the Harvard team ’s inclusion criteria found a relationship between elevated fluoride and reduced IQ .
The Harvard team thus concluded that fluoride ’s effect on the developing brain of children should be a “ high research priority ” in countries like the U.S. where , despite mass fluoridation programs , no studies have yet been conducted to investigate the issue .
The Lancet Review ( 2014 )
In March of 2014 , the prestigious medical journal The Lancet published a review of “ developmental neurotoxicity ” which concluded that fluoride is one of only 11 chemicals that is known to damage the developing brain .
Developmental neurotoxins are capable of causing widespread brain disorders such as autism , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , learning disabilities , and other cognitive impairments .
The harm is often untreatable and permanent .
The authors of The Lancet review , which included Harvard scientist Philippe Grandjea , write :
“ Our very great concern is that children worldwide are being exposed to unrecognized toxic chemicals that are silently eroding intelligence , disrupting behaviors , truncating future achievements , and damaging societies , perhaps most seriously in developing countries . ”
In a bulletin posted on the Harvard School of Public Health website , Grandjean notes that :
“ Fluoride seems to fit in with lead , mercury , and other poisons that cause chemical brain drain .
The effect of each toxicant may seem small , but the combined damage on a population scale can be serious , especially because the brain power of the next generation is crucial to all of us . ”
A hard drive recovered from the computer of a killed Colombian guerrilla has offered more insights into the opposition of House Democrats to the U.S. - Colombia Free Trade Agreement .
A military strike three weeks ago killed Raúl Reyes , No. 2 in command of the FARC , Colombia 's most notorious terrorist group .
The Reyes hard drive reveals an ardent effort to do business directly with the FARC by Congressman James McGovern ( D. , Mass . ) , a leading opponent of the free - trade deal .
Mr. McGovern has been working with an American go - between , who has been offering the rebels help in undermining Colombia 's elected and popular government .
Mr. McGovern 's press office says the Congressman is merely working at the behest of families whose relatives are held as FARC kidnap hostages .
However , his go - between 's letters reveal more than routine intervention .
The intervenor with the FARC is James C. Jones , who the Congressman 's office says is a " development expert and a former consultant to the United Nations . "
Accounts of Mr. Jones 's exchanges with the FARC appeared in Colombia 's Semana magazine on March 15 .
This Mr. Jones should not be confused with the former Congressman and ambassador to Mexico of the same name from Oklahoma .
" Receive my warm greetings , as always , from Washington , " Mr. Jones began in a letter to the rebels last fall .
" The big news is that I spoke for several hours with the Democratic Congressman James McGovern .
In the meeting we had the opportunity to exchange some ideas that will be , I believe , of interest to the FARC - EP [ popular army ] . "
Mr. Jones added that " a fundamental problem is that the FARC does not have , strategically , a spokesman that can communicate directly with persons of influence in my country like Mr. McGovern . "
Semana reports that in the documents Mr. Jones " rules himself out as the spokesman but offers himself as a ' bridge ' of communication between the FARC and the congressman . "
Semana says when it spoke with Mr. Jones , he verified the letter and explained that " he made the offer because the guerrillas need interlocutors if they want to achieve peace and that it is a mistake to isolate them . "
If you want to learn good organization skills , look no further than some of the best leaders in the universe : the captains of spaceships .
They may be fictional , but they have skills that translate into the real world .
After all , you 'd follow Admiral Adama into battle , and trust Malcolm Reynolds to have your back .
Now you can learn the seven greatest leadership lessons we gleaned from watching shows like Futurama and Firefly .
Advertisement
1. The Prime Directive is just a suggestion .
Captain Jean - Luc Picard of the Enterprise was n't as swashbuckling as he predecessor Captain James T. Kirk , simply because he actually wrestled with breaking the Prime Directive instead of ignoring it entirely .
The Prime Directive states that humans should n't involve themselves in the affairs of less developed planets , for fear of messing up their cultures with ultra- advanced tech .
While Picard often considers the importance of the Prime Directive in his decision - making , he refuses to be bound by it .
Lesson learned ?
Rules are made to be broken .
2. Always shoot first .
Every good leader should be willing to do what he or she asks of her team .
One of the reasons for the loyalty of the ragtag crew of Serenity , the ship Malcolm Reynolds captains in Firefly , is that Mal will throw himself into battle to protect his team .
Whenever he has a crazy scheme or rescue mission in mind , he takes the first plunge .
Lesson learned ?
Show your crew that you 're willing to take a bullet for them , and they 'll do the same for you .

3 . Do n't be afraid to hook up with a cute spaceman .
We love Leela on Futurama not just because she 's the only person on her ship with any kind of sense , but because she also lets her long , purple hair down once in a while .
She 's always tangling with spacemen and getting mixed up with strange alien pets .
And that 's one good reason why her goofy crew would follow her to the ends of the galaxy — well , if she had enough beer .
Lesson learned ?
A good leader has to get laid once in a while , and she should n't be ashamed of it .
4 . When you 're about to go genocidal , get a second opinion .
Admiral William Adama from the new Battlestar Galactica is one of the best leaders we 've ever seen .
He 's gotten a group of a few thousand humans halfway across the galaxy , despite the fact that they 're being pursuit by a group of homicidal , erotically obsessed cyborgs .
He 's had to deal with incredible loss and sheer terror , and he always keeps his head .
He is also truly humane .
How does he keep it together without going all Admiral Cain on everybody 's ass ?
By sharing his power with President Roslyn as well as his circle of trusted officers and advisers .
Without their guidance , the Galactica and its fleet might have turned into a bloodthirsty military fleet , instead of what it is : a mostly - civilian group with a ( sort of ) free press and even elections .
Lesson learned ?
True leaders do not ever make decisions alone .
5 . Just because you have a crappy ship does n't mean you 're a loser .
Everyone knows that Han Solo , captain of the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars , is piloting a souped - up bucket .
And yet his seemingly - crappy ship is probably the very best thing for helping out a group of covert resistance fighters like Obi Wan and Luke .
Plus , he knows his ship so well that he can totally slam those Stormtroopers in their McFighters .
Lesson learned ?
Every crappy PC is a lean , mean Linux box waiting to be born .
Oh , and in case that did n't make sense :
It 's not the tools ; it 's what you do with them .
6. Freedom fighters make good teammates .
Say what you will about Captain Janeway on Voyager , but she made a smart decision early on to integrate her Federation team with a group of subversive Maquis who got stuck with them out in the Delta Quadrant .
Another captain might have kept the Maquis separate from the Federation types , but Janeway integrated them and gave them Federation ranks — much to her good fortune .
She got a great Chief Engineer and First Officer out of the deal .
Lesson learned ?
A little subversion goes a long way .
7 . There is always somebody out there who can bend spacetime better than you can .
In Iain M. Banks ' novel Excession , the Ship Sleeper Service ( which is an AI that captains itself , thank you very much ) discovers that its amazing , human - dwarfing brain is nothing compared to the " excession , " a phenomenon that none of the Ships can understand .
The excession exists in subspace , and looks like a giant something that could be a gateway to another dimension , perhaps , or a ship from the edges of the universe .
Meeting the excession , for the Ships , is a very humbling experience .
They realize that they are not as omnipotent as they realized , that that there are intelligences out there far more profound than their own .
Lesson learned ?
No matter how in control you are , always be ready for something for which you 're completely unprepared .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - African Americans liked Bill Clinton so much that he was once dubbed “ the first black president , ” but perceptions that his wife ’s campaigning has been racially tinged have taken a toll on Hillary Clinton ’s White House bid .
Some accuse Clinton ’s campaign of trying to cast her rival Barack Obama as a candidate of limited appeal in order to marginalize his candidacy and enhance her chances of winning the Democratic Party nomination .
Sen .
Obama would be the first black president if he won the nomination and then defeated Republican John McCain in the November 4 national election .
Obama is leading Sen. Clinton in the fight for delegates to the August convention .
Clinton would be the first woman president .
But some black Americans have grown mistrustful of her campaign because of statements by her , her husband and other surrogates .
African Americans make up 13 percent of the U.S. population .
Her suggestion of a “ dream ” ticket with Obama as her vice presidential running mate reminded some of the days when blacks , regarded as second - class citizens , were ordered to sit at the back of buses .
“ No offense , but that is typical of a white person to offer you second place and say they ’ll take first place , ” trucker Jasper Clark , 53 , said at a recent Obama rally in Jackson , Mississippi .
The mere mention of Clinton ’s name drew boos from that mostly black audience .
Obama discusses his life as the son of a white woman from Kansas and a black man from Kenya to highlight his message that the United States can move beyond racial divisions , but the issue keeps bubbling up .
TRADING BARBS
Last week , the Clinton and Obama camps traded barbs over a flap involving Clinton supporter Geraldine Ferraro , who became a trailblazer for women when she joined the unsuccessful Democratic ticket as a vice presidential candidate in 1984 .
In comments some viewed as racially divisive , Ferraro attributed Obama ’s lead so far in this year ’s Democratic race to his being black .
“ If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position , ” she said .
Ferraro later resigned from her role on Clinton ’s fundraising committee and Clinton said she repudiated and “ deeply ” regretted her supporter ’s comments .
The Clinton campaign accused the Obama campaign of drawing the race issue into the campaign by calling attention to Ferraro ’s remarks .

Some analysts said the Ferraro remarks could provoke resentment from some white Americans over “ affirmative action ” policies aimed at helping minorities overcome discrimination .
Many U.S. blacks say such resentment often causes their accomplishments to be overlooked .
“ It ’s the idea that a black person with a Harvard Law degree and a distinguished legislative career only got to where he is because of his skin color .
That ’s surreal , ” said William Jelani Cobb , a history professor at Spelman College in Atlanta .

“ It is comparable to the same tiresome argument that accomplished black professionals often hear : ‘ He or she only got that job because of affirmative action , ’ ” said Patricia Gunn , a law professor at Ohio University , who supports Obama .
SUPPORT DROPS
In polls , Clinton had been splitting black support with Obama as recently as late last year .
But many took offense when Bill Clinton compared Obama ’s victory in the South Carolina primary in January to success there by Jesse Jackson , an African American who ran for president in 1984 and 1988 , but attracted little support on the national stage .
Some said Bill Clinton ’s comments were a bid to marginalize Obama as a candidate only of black America .
Clinton said last week she was sorry for the flap .
“ You know , I was sorry if anyone was offended .
It was certainly not meant in any way to be offensive , ” she said .
Bill Clinton said “ there is a total myth ” that the Clinton campaign played the race card .
“ We had some played against us but we did n’t play any , ” he told CNN .
In South Carolina , eight in 10 black voters supported Obama .
That margin increased to more than nine in 10 in the primary last week in Mississippi .
Bill Clinton said he was n’t surprised by Obama ’s overwhelming support among blacks .
“ No , that was going to happen .
Once African Americans understood that they had a candidate that had a serious chance of winning the nomination and of winning the presidency , ” he said .
Obama supporters , who hope his message of transcending racial divisions can have broad appeal , have emphasized that his wins have come not only in states like Mississippi with large black populations , but also in mostly white states like Iowa , Wisconsin , Wyoming and Idaho .
Obama faces a controversy of his own over racially charged and inflammatory rhetoric by Rev. Jeremiah Wright , the pastor at his church in Chicago .
Comments such as Wright ’s contention that the United States believes in “ white supremacy and black inferiority ” put Obama on the defensive .
He has attended Wright ’s church for 20 years .
Obama said he rejected the “ incendiary ” comments by Wright , who resigned from his role as spiritual adviser to the Obama campaign .

How can one find the most beautiful woman in Italy ?
A Japanese expert determined the following 4 steps :1 ) Find a random woman on the street .
2 ) Ask that woman to introduce the film crew to a more beautiful friend .
3 ) Have that more beautiful friend introduce the film crew to an even more beautiful friend .
4 ) Repeat until one meets the 12th woman - she will be the most beautiful woman in Italy .
A Japanese TV show traveled to Italy and attempted this method , and the results are in the video .

Even before his latest victories , Mr. Obama , of Illinois , had whittled away at the advantages amassed last year by Mrs. Clinton .
He now enjoys a big financial advantage .
Her big lead in national polls is gone .
By most counts , Mr. Obama can now claim more delegates pledged to him .
He has won far more states than Mrs. Clinton , although she won some of the big prizes , like California and New Jersey .
For weeks , Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama had approached this race the same way : as state - by - state trench warfare , in the belief that the nomination would go to whoever got the most delegates .
But the latest results suggest that the race might be tilting back to a more normal form , where the goal is achieving a series of splashing victories and thus momentum .
That has provided Mr. Obama with the opportunity , which he plans to seize in a more full - throated way starting on Wednesday , to argue that voters across a wide cross-section of the country have embraced his candidacy , and that the time has come for the group that could hold the balance of power , those 796 unpledged superdelegates  party leaders and elected officials who have an automatic seat at the national convention  to follow suit .
“ We are in a momentum phase of the process now , ” said Tad Devine , a Democratic consultant .
Mrs. Clinton ’s advisers dispute that , noting that his victories have come in relatively small states and that she has invested most of her attention in two big contests coming up on March 4 : Ohio and Texas .
Her aides have long argued that by the end of the voting , the difference between the two candidates in delegate count would be minimal , leaving the final decision to superdelegates , who in their view would favor Mrs. Clinton .
But if party leaders begin to think this is no longer simply a mathematical race to the 2,025 - delegate line , that could have big consequences for Mrs. Clinton .
For one thing , if this is an election where a candidate wins by virtue of being seen as winning  a definition of momentum  that would mean that voters in coming states would be influenced by the outcome of earlier races .
And Mr. Obama might then be in a position to encroach on Mrs. Clinton ’s firewall of Texas and Ohio .
He is a magnificent animal , his coat a glossy amber , his fangs long and sharp .
He flicks his long tail and paces restlessly up and down beside the bars of the cage .
But this tiger , known only as 327 , is on the outside and longs to get in .
He is one of the last few surviving South China tigers , born in a Chinese zoo and sent to South Africa last year as part of a last - ditch effort to save a creature that most of the conservation world regards a lost cause .
In this reserve called Laohu Valley , 327 could have the freedom of a 100 - acre bush enclosure and learn to hunt , but he ca n’t shake a lifetime of padding up and down in a concrete cage .
The 5 - year - old is slowly being weaned from the breeding center , the reserve ’s only cage , where he feels safest .
He is making progress , slowly .
At least he is not afraid of the swaying grasses anymore .
Some would see 327 as proof that trying to save the world ’s most endangered tiger and reestablish wild populations is a hopeless cause .
But not Li Quan , a Beijing - born former fashion executive with a dream so large that many tiger conservationists ridicule her .
She and her husband , American investment banker Stuart Bray , are trying to drag the species , almost wiped out in a “ pest eradication ” campaign by the government of Mao Tse- tung , back from the brink of extinction .
Quan ’s “ rewilding ” plan goes like this : China lacks conservation expertise and habitat with adequate prey , so five of the remaining 60 to 70 Chinese zoo tigers have been brought to South Africa , which has both , to breed and to learn to hunt in bush enclosures .
The move buys time and builds numbers while the Chinese government restores the habitat for a tiger reserve in China by moving people out and bringing game in .
Conservation groups such as the World Wide Fund for Nature deride the project , saying it is foolish , unscientific and a waste of money .
The most stinging attack came in 2003 from Judy Mills , a tiger conservationist and then - spokeswoman for Conservation International .
She called the project “ a circus sideshow dressed up as eco- tourism ” and said its only outcome would be that “ a wealthy dilettante feels as if she has done something .
Conservation should be left to conservationists .
This woman would be better off giving her money to those who know what to do with it . ”
Mills , now with the Save the Tiger Fund , said via e-mail there was “ consensus in the mainstream conservation community that the very best course of action for bringing back wild tigers in China is to focus on protecting existing wild tiger populations and their habitats . ”
Quan , who initially hoped her plan would win approval in the conservation world , was disheartened and hurt by the attacks .
“ But then it turned to energy , ” she says .
“ I thought , ‘ I ’m going to stake everything I have to prove you wrong . ’ ”
The five zoo tigers brought to Laohu Valley , in South Africa ’s Free State province , included four cubs , Cathay , Hope , TigerWoods and Madonna , who arrived between 2003 and 2007 .
All learned to hunt wild South African game in the 100 - acre enclosure , but two years after arriving in 2003 , Hope died of heart failure and pneumonia , confirming in critics ’ minds their view that the plan was a bad idea .
And 327 , who arrived in September mainly for breeding , so far has n’t mated successfully .
( The name comes from his registration number in the “ Stud Book ” registry of captive tigers . )
The other tigers adapted quickly .
They all have their favorite trees and shady places .
TigerWoods has a cozy sleeping spot in bulrushes by the river , where small crimson birds flutter just above his head .
In November , a male cub was born at Laohu , the first outside China .
Quan , 45 , never planned to run the project herself .
But with the tiger conservation world mostly opposed , she has battled to raise funds and find specialists willing to help .
Now she divides her time between her home in London , South Africa , and China .
Her team consists of Peter Openshaw , 45 , a South African game ranger who left his country ’s conservation bureaucracy disillusioned because he felt it was going downhill ; Tigris Zhang , 25 , a Chinese tiger enthusiast and graduate in urban conservation who started a tiger website in high school ; and Zhang ’s wife , Jane Shen , 27 , a linguist studying tourism .
So far , Quan and Bray have spent $ 12 million of their own money , including buying 81,000 acres of South African farmland in 2002 for the project , and have raised about $ 360,000 in donations .
The silvery grass dances on the lush plains of the Karoo , sheep farming country famous for its wide spaces , blue skies and bountiful lamb .
There are few trees , just a scattering of steel windmills and rocky hills disturbing the relentless plains .
Behind the wheel of a hefty SUV , Quan touches the accelerator with her delicate lilac loafer .
She ’s wearing shorts and a sequined cardigan with a kitten design and has features as fine as bone porcelain -- a girlish demeanor that leadssome to underestimate her , overlooking her steely core .
She edges the vehicle over the bank of a river onto a rocky ledge , looking for Cathay and her mate , TigerWoods , parents of the cub .
They killed a blesbok -- a small antelope -- the night before , and Cathay is in thick scrubby trees by the river , the tigers ’ favorite haunt , finishing off the carcass .
She gazes languidly at the vehicle .
“ You can see their confidence .
Once they have learned to hunt , they can hunt anywhere , ” Quan says .
She was born in 1962 in the wake of a three - year famine in China , and grew up during the Cultural Revolution , when the country was poor and intellectuals were humiliated and sent to labor camps for “ reeducation . ”
She befriended every stray cat she could .
After graduating from Beijing University in 1984 , she was assigned a prestigious job as an anchor for CCTV but rejected it , knowing she was too outspoken to survive in such a post .
Eventually , she decided to study in America , graduating in business studies at Wharton .
She became Gucci ’s licensing manager in Milan , Italy , before marrying Bray and giving up her career .
She says she always had two passions in her life : tigers and anthropology .
She launched her foundation , Save China ’s Tigers , after a dinner - party conversation , when a friend complained she was wasting her talent .
But another talent seems to be her ability to set critics ’ teeth on edge , from the ease and speed with which she negotiated the tiger deal with the Chinese government ( critics said she was being manipulated ) to the fact that she was pictured cuddling the newborn cub ( they said she set a bad example ) .
She keeps Persian cats in her London home and says they ’ve helped her understand tiger behavior .
But she is no softy .
“ I do n’t cry very easily , ” she says .
“ I cried when Hope died .
Emotionally , I was devastated .
And I cried when the cub was born , out of happiness . ”
The cub , born on a freezing November night at the end of the Southern Hemisphere spring , had to be taken from Cathay not because she rejected him but because she did not lick him dry or warm him .
The cub has spent his first 2 1/2 months in a specialist zoo , where he squalls loudly for attention and leaps playfully on visitors .
He will return to the reserve after his final vaccination , when he is 4 months old .
A competition to name him has attracted more than 7,000 entries in China alone , a sign of growing awareness of tiger conservation .
One evening , as Quan checks on the tigers , her favorite , Madonna , walks to the fence and chuffs excitedly at her , puffing out air in a tiger greeting .
She prowls along the fence as Quan follows on her side .
The next morning after dawn , TigerWoods is lying in the grass when Cathay spots a blesbok .
She stiffens and lopes closer .
The blesbok easily skirts her , skipping away into the grass toward the hidden TigerWoods , who leaps up in ambush .
The terrified blesbok races back toward Cathay , the stronger hunter , who sprints toward it .
But the blesbok changes direction and escapes across the river .
The tigers follow it for a while before flopping down near the river .
Two days later , they do manage to kill it .
That week , in early February , the tigers killed five blesboks released in the enclosure ; Cathay ’s larger - than - usual appetite and the fact she has not displayed her monthly estrous cycle have Laohu staff convinced she is again pregnant .
Many doubted the tigers would learn the art of hunting in the flat Karoo plains , with limited cover for predators .
At first , the young tigers would charge across the open ground , allowing their prey to escape easily .
But they quickly learned to stalk and ambush the blesboks .
There were some hard lessons .
Hope was bitten by a baboon .
Madonna at one point got dehydrated .
“ There ’s no exact recipe , ” Openshaw , the game ranger , says .
“ They do n’t have the mother to teach them to pluck the feathers off a guinea fowl or break open a springbok .
They have to learn by trial and error .
The first couple of kills have to be quite easy .
Then you make the process more difficult . ”
As a child , Openshaw spent most of his time in the bush , catching snakes and spiders .
Initially skeptical about Quan ’s project , he changed his mind on learning the animals would be not be roaming wild and gobbling down South Africa ’s own endangered species .
“ Even today , when we went into the enclosure and we saw TigerWoods and Cathay , at no stage did they come up and beg for food ; it proves that they ’re on the right track , ” he says .
Quan ’s agreement with the Chinese government is to produce two pairs of unrelated tigers to return to a Chinese tiger reserve .
But China missed its 2007 deadline to restore reserves with suitable habitat and game :
Two sites have been identified in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces , but residents have not yet been moved out of the areas .
“ The birth of the cubs will create pressure on the relevant authorities to do something about it , ” Quan says .
Openshaw is not convinced the plan will succeed but says his group has to try .
“ You just have to persevere and put your head down and keep on going , ” he says .
“ At least we ’re doing something .
I ’d rather say , ‘ Well , we did n’t save the animals from extinction , but gee , we gave it our best shot . ’ ”
Gary Koehler , wildlife research scientist with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife , believes conservationists have been so hostile to the South African experiment because of a reluctance to embrace new and radical ideas .
“ I think that us in the conservation profession and even us as scientists are not real comfortable with experiments in a very new and radical way , ” he says .
“ And sometimes that ’s what it takes . ”
Quan sees
Hope , who was the weakest of the reserve ’s tigers before he died , as a symbol of the South China tiger ’s crisis : “ He ’s weak .
He ’s sickened .
He needs help .
At the end of Hope ’s life , he could not even climb over a tree that he always crossed .

A private off - the - record meeting was held on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that included House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Subcommittee on the Constitution Chairman Jerrold Nadler , Judiciary Committee Member and advocate for opening Cheney impeachment hearings Robert Wexler , and several other committee members , activists , staffers , and former staffers from the Watergate days .
I was n't there , so I 'm free to talk about what happened .
Wexler proposed opening impeachment hearings on Cheney .
Conyers committee staffer Perry Appelbaum laid out instead a schedule for non-impeachment hearings over the coming 11 months .
Conyers ' notion is to hold non-impeachment hearings on " the imperial presidency " and run out the clock .
I guess that would be sort of like a dozen police officers paying a non-arresting visit to the home of a mass murderer .
Seriously ?
An " imperial " president , and you do n't impeach him , and you do n't retire or commit suicide ?
This baffles me .
Now , there are topics that have not been touched in congressional investigations over the past 12 months , such as the Iraq war lies .
But a lot of the other topics have already been gone over , just absent the I word .
What will differentiate the new non-impeachment hearings from the past year 's worth of non-impeachment hearings ?
Of course , getting witnesses to show up and testify would be a change , but without impeachment , nothing will compel any witnesses to testify who have previously refused .
One of the big topics this group wants to go after is the firing of U.S. Attorneys , and - contrary to the position expressed today by the Democratic leadership - this group was in agreement that Congress should vote on contempt citations for Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten .
But , even understanding that nothing was going to budge on that any time soon , most of the Congress Members present still refused to back Wexler 's proposal .
The chief opponent of impeachment hearings was not Conyers .
It was Nadler .
Nadler argued strongly against any use of the I word .
He argued that Congress should focus on passing bills , even though they will be vetoed , and then pass them again next year .
Arguing for keeping open the possibility of impeachment hearings developing out of the non-impeachment hearings was Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson .
Daniel Ellsberg was also among those backing impeachment hearings .
Conyers and some subgroup plan to take their proposal for non-impeachment imperial abuse hearings to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to request her blessing .
She is , of course , most likely to share Nadler 's position .
She may have given Nadler his position , or perhaps it originated with Hillary Clinton , but it sounds most likely that Nadler has simply been speaking for himself : he honestly opposes impeachment hearings , even for emperors .
Nadler 's constituents have been among the most dedicated activists , many of them repeatedly sitting in at his office for impeachment and going to jail .
One group has just set up a website solely to allow people all over the country to Email Nadler on this issue : http://asknadler2impeach.org
Nadler chairs the most relevant subcommittee and could open Cheney impeachment hearings in that subcommittee tomorrow if he chose to do so .
The full House voted to send articles of impeachment on Cheney to the Judiciary Committee last November .
Wednesday 's meeting was handicapped , of course , because no - one says aloud what the reasons are for opposing impeachment .
That Cheney and Bush have committed impeachable offenses is universally understood .
But the arguments against impeaching them ( other priorities , bipartisanship , we do n't have the votes , etc. ) usually sound like lame cover for whatever the real reason is .
I suspect the real reason is built into Nadler 's plan of wasting a year in order to pass bills next year .
He assumes that in 2009 there will be either a better Congress or a better president ( he backs Hillary Clinton ) , or both .
Sadly , history says otherwise .
For 230 years , the party that brings impeachment wins , and the party that fails to do so when it 's called for loses .
Conyers was there when the Democrats moved to impeach Nixon and then won big .
He was there when they refused to impeach Reagan and then lost .
And most of the current committee was there when the Republicans impeached Clinton against the will of the public for a non-impeachable offense and still won both houses of Congress and the White House .
When the Democrats held back from impeachment during Iran Contra , they lost the next elections .
When the Democrats led the effort to investigate and impeach Nixon , they won big in the next election , even though Ford was running as an incumbent .
When the Republicans tried to impeach Truman , they got what they wanted out of the Supreme Court and then won the next elections .
Articles of impeachment have been filed against 10 presidents , usually by Republicans , and usually with electoral success following .
When the Republicans impeached Clinton , impeachment was actually unpopular with the public .
Even so , the Republicans lost far fewer seats than is the norm for a majority party at that point in its tenure .
Two years later , they lost seats in the Senate , which had acquitted , but maintained their strength in the House , with representatives who had led the impeachment charge winning big .
Parties that seek to impeach are not punished at the next election .
In fact , they frequently improve their position -- as evidenced by the Democrats in 1974 , Republicans in 1952 , and all the way back to the Whigs of last century .
In every election back to 1842 where House members of an opposition party to a sitting president have -- as a whole or a significant caucus within the party -- proposed impeachment of the president , that opposition party retained or improved its position in the House at the following election .
There is no instance of voters responding to a significant impeachment effort by sweeping its advocates out of office .
In fact , history points in a different direction , suggesting that voters frequently reward parties for taking the Constitution and the rule of law seriously .
And we would n't wait until the next election to reward members of Congress who put impeachment back in the Constitution .
The minute Pelosi or Conyers or Nadler opens the door to impeachment hearings , every activist organization in this country and around the world that works on behalf of peace or justice or the rule of law will flood them with flowers , donations , volunteers , and support .
And if Fox News says one word , we will shut it down .
Most of the nation is once again readying itself for losing an hour of sleep with the arrival of Daylight Saving Time .
This is a " shock " not only to those of us who value our sleep , but also ( very temporarily ) to all levels of the economy , from the individual to the world .
In their forthcoming article for the Journal of Labor Economics , " Cues for Timing and Coordination : Latitude , Letterman , and Longitude , " authors Daniel S. Hamermesh , Caitlin Knowles Myers , and Mark L. Pocock look at the brief fight between American 's natural timing cues -- the circadian rhythms determined by the sun-- and the man -made cues brought on within the last century , mainly by the creation of time zones and the television broadcast schedule .
In this relatively brief time , they find , the markers for how we structure our day have been dramatically altered .
How did these man-made cues come about " Daylight Saving Time has its roots in the Standard Time Act of 1918 ; the DST component , which was a wartime energy - saving measure , was repealed after World War I .
The current plan was signed into law by President Johnson in 1966 as the Uniform Time Act .
Last year , Daylight Saving was extended by four weeks .
Although the prime - time television schedule is a " relic of the technology of radio transmission " -- it was created when signals could not be broadcast across the country -- it remains a powerful cue .
Reflecting on his own weekday television watching schedule , Hamermesh recalled , " I lived twenty years in the Eastern Time Zone , I used to stay up until 11:45 p.m. to watch the monologue on the Tonight Show .
Living in Texas , I typically turn out the lights at 10:45 p.m. , when the monologue is done . "
For their study , the authors turned to data provided by the unprecedented Bureau of Labor Statistics ' American Time Use Survey ( ATUS ) , which enabled them to observe how Americans split their time between their three most time - consuming activities : work , sleep , and television watching .
After merging ATUS with sunrise and sunset data , the authors found that while natural daylight patterns have some effect on people 's life patterns , the demands of global business -- market openings , etc -- and regular television schedule demarcate the boundaries of most Americans ' lives .
Says Hamermesh , he and his colleagues were " amazed how little daylight matters nowadays , and how much artificial time zones matter . "
In the case of outliers , such as Arizona 's unique time pattern , residents tend to adjust their sleep and work patterns to an adjacent zone .
Hamermesh , Myers , and Pocock conclude that while the " natural cue of daylight has some effect on timing ... the entirely artificial cue of the timing of television programs has still larger effects . "
They also find that those places , like Hawaii and Arizona , that do n't " spring ahead " find themselves tied to the schedule of their neighbours , a further sign that coordination is tied to artificial cues , and not natural cues like the sun .
Your Daily Shows ... additional findings about artificial cues :
If you are in the " professional service " sector ( finance , information , business services ) , you are more likely to follow the time zone cue , while you are in other services sector ( education , health , leisure , and hospitality ) , you are probably more responsive to television cues .
The probability that you are watching TV between 11 - 11:15 p.m. decreases with age , but the probability that you are at work between 8 and 8:15 a.m. increases until retirement age .
Marital status and children do n't have an effect on TV viewing at 11 p.m. , but married individuals are less likely to be sleeping at 7 a.m. and more likely to be at work at 8 a.m .
Individuals in early television zones ( Central and Mountain ) are 6.4 percentage points less likely to be watching television between 11 and 11:15 p.m. than those in later zones , but if the sunset is pushed back by an hour the probability of watching TV at 11 pm only increases by about one percentage point .

Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article U.S. opponents of preferences based on race and gender are lobbying five more states to forbid the practice 16 months after Michigan voters said no to affirmative action in the public arena .
Foes of affirmative action , which is meant to address current and historical inequities , delivered 128,744 signatures to Colorado authorities earlier this month .
Similar organizations in Arizona , Missouri , Oklahoma and Nebraska are circulating petitions as civil rights groups and educators are mobilizing to defeat the measures .
At the forefront of the movement is Ward Connerly , America 's most prominent opponent of affirmative action , who said he has raised about 1.5 million U.S. dollars for the campaigns .
He sees the November ballot initiatives as the next step in his drive to end preferences in public education , hiring and contracting .
" Without any doubt , we have to understand that race preferences are on the way out , " said Connerly , who heads to Missouri next week to deliver speeches on behalf of that state 's constitutional amendment , now tangled in a court battle over the ballot measure 's wording .
In the states where Connerly 's self - described " civil rights initiative " appears on the ballot , voters are likely to see it alongside the name of the first black or female major - party presidential candidate , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) or Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y . )
Connerly contends that the success of Obama and Clinton shows that preferences are no longer necessary " to compensate for , quote , institutional racism and institutional sexism . "
Connerly , a prosperous and conservative black Republican , said he contributed 500 dollars to Obama 's campaign to honor him " for trying to take race out of the body politic . "
Obama opposes Connerly 's approach to affirmative action and lent his voice to a 2006 radio ad opposing the Connerly - sponsored Proposition 2 in Michigan .
( The Obama campaign would not comment on whether it is keeping the money . )
Obama is not alone .
Opponents of Connerly 's effort are using legal challenges and grass - roots organizing techniques to keep the measures off the ballot , or to defeat them .
" As we feared , Connerly 's attack on equal opportunity in Michigan has metastasized , " said Wade Henderson , president of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights .
" We know that most Americans support equal opportunity .
They know that diversity is good for business , good for the classroom and ultimately good for the country . "
Henderson dismissed Connerly 's reference to Obama as a willingness to " seize on any factoid to justify his assault on equal opportunity " and added : " I am not surprised he would lift up the performance of Barack to say that race no longer matters in American life .
That 's a gross overstatement of the lives of most Americans . "

Technology has allowed us to become more efficient at Killing Trees !
More than once I have mentioned my love for technology and innovation , for I believe many of the products we own today aid us in becoming more efficient ( with a few bugs and frustration ) .
There are even ones that aim to provide productivity but without hurting the environment on its path .
The video below is a great presentation that makes it difficult to be technologically pro and green at the same time .
It shows an extremely efficient machine cutting down trees at a fast rate and with great skill .
When I first saw it , I was amazed how one man could sit behind a machine and get so much work done so efficiently .
After a moment I realized the peril that it involved as well .
It may be faster , stronger , and more efficient than several workers , but it is killing trees at a great speed .
This means that this machine in fact increases efficiency at hurting our environment .
Is that a little disturbing ?

For most of us a bout of the hiccups is no more than a nuisance .
However , for a singer they must be doubly annoying , especially if they go on more than the usual half - hour or so .
Band member Chris Sands has been battling the hiccups for 11 months , despite trying every remedy available .
Mr Sands , 24 , started hiccupping in February and has not stopped since .
He says he has tried everything from a teaspoon of peanut butter to oxygen chambers in an attempt to end his ordeal .
Doctors are baffled by his condition , and say there is no physical reason why he keeps hiccupping .
It has left the musician from Lincoln unable to perform and sometimes stops him breathing .
" It originally started in September of last year , I got them for two weeks and went to the doctor 's who could n't tell what was causing it , " Mr Sands said .
" Then in February they came back .
I have tried everything to get rid of them - drinking water in thousands of different ways , hypnotheraphy , yoga .
" The one thing that worked for an hour was eating a teaspoon of peanut butter .
I got really excited that they had gone , but then they came back again . "
During the most intense bouts Mr Sands cannot sleep or eat because he cannot keep food down .
" Last week I had a horrible couple of days where it was really bad .
I was so tired and down because I could n't sleep .
I became so desperate that I made myself sick in an attempt to make them stop .
" I can't eat if they are bad because if I eat something I just bring it back up again . "
Mr Sands has had a brain scan , chest scan , abdomen scan and CT scan to try to find out what is causing the hiccups , but there has so far been no diagnosis .
Scroll down for more ...
He said : " Last time I went to the doctor 's they said there was no point in seeing me again as they have tested me for everything it could be .
" Instead , they are sending me to a psychologist because they think my body is just used to doing it now .
" The last thing I tried was an oxygen chamber where they put you in a big metal tank and put an oxygen mask on you .
" But I have got serious claustrophobia so as soon as they closed the big metal door of the tank I was shaking and my hands were sweating .
I had to make them get me out quickly . "
The musician , who is single and lives with his parents , says the constant hiccups have taken their toll on his family .
" They have been really supportive , but just feel helpless , " said Mr Sands .
" I can't do things like learn to drive because I just do n't trust myself driving because I 'm so tired all the time and can't help hiccupping .
" Sometimes it stops me breathing for ten seconds .
" I have learnt to talk in between hiccups , but it is really frustrating sometimes .
" I'm in a band and play the guitar and sing backing vocals , but we have n't done any gigs for a long time .
" We are going to start playing again at the start of January because we can't wait for the hiccups to stop . "
American Charles Osborne , of Anthon , Iowa , holds the record for the longest ever bout of hiccups , which lasted for 68 years from 1922 until 1990 .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Air traffic controllers were forced to use their personal cell phones to reroute hundreds of flights Tuesday after the Federal Aviation Administration 's Memphis Center lost radar and telephone service for more than two hours , snarling air traffic in the middle of the nation .
The FAA 's Memphis Center lost communication service Tuesday , affecting FedEx flights and others .
A spokesman for FedEx , which has its hub in Memphis , Tennessee , said the package delivery company had diverted 11 aircraft to other cities .
But most of its flights take off and land after 10 p.m. , so FedEx expected the impact to be minimal , the spokesman said .
Air traffic was halted at 12:35 p.m. ET when a major communication line that feeds all the telephones at the FAA 's Memphis Center failed , said FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen .
Service was restored at 3 p.m .
The malfunction , which occurred inside a telephone company 's switching office , made it impossible for air controllers at FAA 's Memphis Center to communicate normally with adjoining centers to hand off control of flights , Bergen said .
In addition , three of nine long - range radar systems were lost , causing the FAA to temporarily ground traffic within a 250 - mile radius of the center , affecting flights in seven states , Bergen said .
Adjacent centers in Atlanta , Georgia ; Indianapolis , Indiana ; Kansas City , Missouri ; and Fort Worth , Texas ; were pitching in to try to reroute planes , she said .
There was no indication the failure was deliberate , she said .
Doug Church , a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association , called the failure " a major safety problem . "
At the time of the outage , controllers " were thrust into an immensely chaotic situation in which they had to use personal cell phones to talk to other air traffic control facilities about specific flights that they could not communicate with themselves , " he said .
" Significant delays " resulted at airports in the middle of the country , including Dallas - Fort Worth , Atlanta and Charlotte , North Carolina , he said .
Memphis Center 's airspace includes 100,000 square miles of airspace , covering Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi and parts of Alabama and Kentucky .
Church predicted that flight operations in the affected area " are not going to be ' normal ' for quite some time . "
A spokesman for Northwest Airlines said the impact on the airline was " pretty minor , " with 13 flights canceled and 19 others diverted out of 740 scheduled flights for the day .
A spokeswoman for Delta Air Lines said it canceled six flights and rerouted several others as a result of the incident .
E-mail to a friend
Taking the battle to campuses and courtrooms
A year ago today , the Recording Industry Association of America launched a new campaign against on - campus file - sharing .
There was a mass mailing to college presidents , some public service announcements , and most importantly , 400 prelitigation settlement letters mailed to 13 universities .
Ars spoke to RIAA president Cary Sherman as the " campus initiative 's " first anniversary approached to get the RIAA 's perspective on how it was working out and where it might be headed .
The campaign is similar to that carried out against suspected P2P users .
Prelitigation settlement letters are sent out to universities , addressed to the user of a specific IP address .
If the school identifies the student to whom the IP address was assigned at the time and passes along the letter , he or she has the opportunity to settle with the RIAA for $ 3,000 instead of the usual $ 4,000 .
If the student does n't respond or the school fails to pass the letter along , a John Doe lawsuit is filed and the RIAA attempts to learn the identity of the person using the IP address by means of a subpoena .
Here 's how the numbers look after a year .
The RIAA has sent out 5,404 letters in 13 " waves " to over 160 colleges and universities .
Of the 5,003 settlement letters sent prior to the batch of 401 that went out last week , " more than " 2,300 of those have resulted in the targeted students settling with the RIAA .
2,465 students have been hit with lawsuits , and all of those are moving through the legal system at different rates .
At $ 3,000 per settlement , over 2,300 settlements translates into at least $ 6.9 million .
Positive trends
RIAA president Cary Sherman
The numbers sound impressive , but has the new initiative lived up to the RIAA 's expectations and led to the kind of results the group hoped to see ?
Sherman sees reasons to be encouraged , citing positive responses from many of the schools contacted by the RIAA .
" Schools are clearly responding to the problem in a helpful way , both in terms of education and student behavior , " said Sherman .
He 's also seeing positive trends in overall P2P use that give the group hope that its legal campaign is working .
" The data is consistent that there has been a flattening of P2P use even though broadband penetration has been growing , " Sherman pointed out .
" We think a lot of the reason for that is because of the active steps we have taken to enforce our rights . "
Indeed , tracking firm Big Champagne told Ars last year that music file - sharing rates have held steady since the spring of 2006 .
On a month - by - month basis , 2007 traffic was nearly flat , with variations falling within the margin of error .
But Big Champagne CEO Eric Garland had a slightly different take on the data than did Sherman .
He believes that the lack of P2P growth owes more to market saturation than legal threats .
" It 's like e-mail , " Garland said .
" For a number of years , the population using e-mail was increasing dramatically .
Once everyone who wanted e-mail had e-mail , growth flattened out . "
Sherman points to the recording industry 's experience in Canada to buttress his argument .
" You would think that digital sales in Canada would do even better than in the US because broadband penetration is higher , " he said .
" But there 's no enforcement in Canada , and when you look at the digital sales figures it shows that there 's more of a pirate market there . "
According to the RIAA 's preliminary figures , legal downloads account for only 10 percent of Canadian music sales versus 22 percent in the US .
" The fact that we have piracy a little more under control online here because of the lawsuits is a reason why we have more of a successful digital market in the US than Canada , " Sherman argued .
A PR nightmare ?
We also asked Sherman about public reaction to the campaign .
He took issue with a suggestion that the legal campaign was something akin to a PR nightmare .
" Our basic survey data is that the majority of consumers do n't have a problem with the lawsuits , " he replied .
" You would never know that from reading blogs and websites , [ but ] when you go out to the general public , our favorables / unfavorables have n't changed at all .
People are much more concerned about the content of the lyrics than our lawsuits . "
It may be the case that the public looks more favorably on the RIAA 's campaign than the blogosphere , but it's also significant that the music industry is alone among Big Content in its willingness to take on individual file - sharers in court .
In contrast , the Motion Picture Association of America has focused its attention on BitTorrent sites rather than their users , while studios and TV networks appear more inclined towards taking legal action towards big web sites , as Viacom has against YouTube .
Studios and networks are definitely wary about taking the same approach as the RIAA and ending up with a PR nightmare ; one industry executive recently told Ars that his company was concerned about " looking like the RIAA . "
There has been a wide variety of reaction to the campaign , according to Sherman .
" We just got an e-mail the other day from some small indie artist that said ' I know some people think [ the campaign ] is unpopular , but thank you because it 's making a difference . "
The effect of DMCA takedowns
In addition to sending out prelitigation settlement letters , the RIAA has also been busy sending out DMCA takedown notices to schools when it finds copyrighted material online .
That number has increased lately because of an improved ability to find material , says Sherman .
" Universities have responded in different ways [ when receiving a takedown notice ] , but they all do something , " he said .
" It has been very helpful in letting people know that they 're not really anonymous and that they 're lucky they got a notice and not a lawsuit . "
" When we looked at the top 50 schools [ in terms of DMCA notices ] from the fall semester 2006 - 07 to the fall semester 2007 - 08 , 29 of the schools have dropped off , " Sherman said .
Indeed , the RIAA 's figures show dramatic changes in the list of schools with the highest number of takedown notices .
The number one school in 2006 - 07 , the University of South Carolina , is now in the 166th position .
The 914 DMCA takedown notices sent to that school in '06-07 has plummeted to just 45 in ' 07-08 .
12 of the top 20 schools from 2006 - 07 have dropped completely out of the top 50 ; others , like the University of Massachusetts - Amherst ( which has held steady in the number two position ) , are proving to be tougher nuts to crack .
Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith says he has made it clear to the Bush Administration that Australia will go ahead with the withdrawal of its combat troops from Iraq .
Mr Smith was speaking after holding his first meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Washington .
He says the pull - out will be done in consultation with the US and with minimal disruption .
" We are sticking absolutely to the election commitment that we took to the Australian people , " he said .
But he says Australia will also consider providing more aid and infrastructure support to both Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Australia stands ready to consider what other avenues of support there may well be to support the effort in Iraq , " he said .
" This of course goes to aid matters , it goes to building Iraq 's capacity . "
Meanwhile Dr Rice says their inaugural talks have been fruitful .
" It really has been a very good first meeting and we look very much forward to meetings in the future , " she said .
Dr Rice has also accepted an invitation to visit Perth later this year .
Mr Smith is also meeting Vice - President Dick Cheney and US Defence Secretary Robert Gates , before attending Mr Bush 's State of the Union speech later today .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush telephoned Chinese President Hu Jintao on Wednesday to raise his concerns about unrest in Tibet and encourage the Chinese government to talk with the Dalai Lama , the White House said .
“ The president raised his concerns about the situation in Tibet and encouraged the Chinese government to engage in substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama ’s representatives and to allow access for journalists and diplomats , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
China alleges the exiled Buddhist leader was conspiring to wreck the Beijing Olympic Games this summer and masterminded the unrest which began earlier this month with a series of peaceful marches in Lhasa , the Tibetan capital , but soon turned deadly .
China says 19 people died in the violence , while representatives of the Tibetan government - in - exile say 140 died in clashes .
China has barred foreign journalists from Tibet and surrounding areas , making independent verification difficult .
Despite pleas from human - rights activists , Bush plans to attend the Olympics but has said he will express his concern about “ a variety of issues ” to Chinese officials .

Residents donated £ 30,000 to the cost
The tiny Hebridean island of Eigg has never had a mains supply of electricity , relying on micro-generators to power its crofthouses and small businesses .
So what 's the feeling ahead of the big switch - on ?
While most Britons turn on radios and kettles as soon as they wake , Sue Kirk has to trudge outside to crank her generator by hand .
" You might not bother with the generator for just the lights , " says Mrs Kirk , who runs a shop on the remote island of Eigg .
" You might just have candles instead , it 's a bit rustic .
You notice the lack of electricity in the winter when it 's dark . "
WHERE IS EIGG ?
Big switch - on at Eigg
For the first time , the tiny island with fewer than 100 residents will receive mains electricity on Friday .
A combined hydro-electric , wind and solar powered system will supply continuous power to the light bulbs , computers and washing machines of the island 's 71 properties via a six - mile network of cables .
" Folk here are used to doing things for themselves , " says Maggie Fyffe , the secretary of the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust , the community body that owns the 12 - square mile island .
Ten years ago , the island became a powerful symbol of independence when its inhabitants teamed up with the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Highland Council to take over the land for themselves .
The move came after years of living under private and often absentee ownership , and at last gave the islanders control of their own destiny .
BEFORE THE SWITCH ON ... homes were powered by diesel , wind or hydro - generators electricity was unreliable and restricted to certain hours some residents went without washing machines and vacuum cleaners the noise from the generators could be heard for miles Diesel was delivered by boat but services sometimes cancelled Since then they have renovated houses , created businesses , installed broadband and in the latest community triumph , given themselves power .
" I 'm really looking forward to a washing machine and a Hoover , " Mrs Fyffe says .
" Until now I 've had to wash everything by hand " .
Simple matters that do not cross the mind of those used to constant electricity are at the forefront of every Eigg resident 's mind .
... AND AFTER a new £ 1.6 m high - voltage network harnessing wind , hydro and solar power electricity will be continuous cheaper bills are expected Karen Helliwell , who runs a guesthouse , says : " It sounds ridiculous , but modern washing machines take up a lot of power , so you need a reliable generator .
" You have to turn the tumble dryer on to get the generator up to speed .
With so much power it 's almost cutting itself out before you can turn the washing machine on .
" Then you have to listen to the change in notes , when it reaches the powerful spin , before you can turn the tumble dryer off , so you do n't break the generator .
You ca n't go out and leave it , you need to be there all the time . "
20 - year campaign
It has been hard for both individuals and the island 's few businesses .
The village shop has only a small freezer and chiller and has only recently been able to power them for 24 hours a day .
You can't go out for a quiet evening walk , because every house you walk past has its generator on and all you 'll hear is ' thud thud thud '
Karen Helliwell
Guesthouse owner
The area around the pier in the south - east corner of the island , which contains several of the main businesses including the shop , a tearoom and offices , was powered by a micro - hydro scheme , but a particularly dry spell late last year left them reliant on a back - up generator .
In November that 14 kilowatt ( kW ) generator broke and since then , those businesses have shared a single 10 kW source .
After the switch - on , they can use 10 kW each .
The breakthrough comes at the end of a 20 - year campaign of phone calls and letters to persuade the electricity companies and the government to install mains power .
THE ISLAND OF EIGG
The name of the island is pronounced ' egg '
The residents bought the island in 1997 and run it under the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust
In the 1920s it was a private sporting estate The Normandy landing was rehearsed there in WW2 Its squeaky beach is nick - named the Singing Sands Population was 500 in the 19th Century and in 2005 was 87 South of Skye , the island is 9 km long and 5 km wide Residents decided they could go without power for no longer and by 2006 the £ 1.6 m cost was met , thanks to residents , the European Union , lottery cash and other bodies .
" We 're very proud , an awful lot of people have put a lot of effort in , " says Mrs Fyffe .
With a population of only 87 , teamwork was essential , but something they were already used to .
" We 've got farmers , school teachers , a doctor , people who work in the teashop - everybody here has several jobs to make the island work . "
It was important to use renewable power sources , she says , in keeping with the island 's green credentials , and there are many lessons the rest of the UK could learn about energy conservation and self - sufficiency .
But are there any reservations about losing the island 's reputation as an idyllic retreat ?
Far from it , it seems .
" It 'll be far less noisy , " says Mrs Helliwell .
" You can't go out for a quiet evening walk , because every house you walk past has its generator on and all you 'll hear is ' thud thud thud ' , you can hear a generator from three miles away going ' thud thud thud ' . "
Having a breather
And amid all the excitement and her thoughts of getting a toaster , Mrs Kirk finds a glimmer of regret .
The new system combines solar , wind and hydro power " I daresay if in years to come when we get a whiff of diesel we may be reminded of life like this , " reflects Mrs Kirk .
" It 's also a nice community event , collecting the diesel from the harbour every month . "
So with the electric dream realised , what 's next on the list of improvements ?
" We 'll all have a wee pause of breath after this , " says Mrs Fyffe , " but there 's always something we can tackle . "

The residents really did ' Go to work on an Eigg ' Well done all you Eiggians Power to the Eigg At last
Kevthebrit , Rochester MN USA
What could be done in any community with a hand out of £ 10,000 / head ( assuming they raised £ 6000 / head ) ?
Simon Milledge , East Knoyle
The Isle of Eigg was recently featured on Blue Peter , and I remember them reporting that the entire population had been slaughtered on two occations in its history !
So well done to Eigg for not only getting electricity but also not all being wiped out .
Nich Hill , Gosport UK
Good luck to them , but at a cost of £ 20,000 per inhabitant it could only have been done for a small population using lottery money .
It demonstrates the economic unfeasibility of renewables .
Michael Canton , Rural Somerset
They 'll be getting a Starbucks and Macdonalds any time now !
Peter Bradshaw , Tadcaster
Well done to the people of Eigg .
I hope that soon all of the UK will be powered like this and lead the world in environmentally friendly power .
No nuclear ( unclear ) power and minimal carbon based fuels .
Barry Metcalfe , Leighton Buzzard England
This is the way it should be everywhere .
Most of us have the capacity and resources to generate our own power whether it be as an individual or as a community .
My idea - all new houses / flats should be fitted with turbines , solar panels or other form of electricy generation .
Paula , aberdeen Congratulations to Eigg , one of the loveliest and most welcoming of all the Islands .
I 'm only an occasional visitor but always find it completely enchanting , and now its power generation is ' green ' it 's taken one further step towards an ideal .
I have long thought that Eigg is a model of how things should be - how can the writer think that Eigg is losing its ' idyllic reputation ' ?
Ben , Isle of Luing Assuming the facts contained in the article to be correct I find it disgraceful that these people have to spend 20 years raising their own money to give themselves electricity when we spend billions of pounds in Irag and Afghanistan .
This is the 21st century !
It 's time we got our priorities right !
Gwyn Jones , Cardiff
That 's what life is really all about , facing adversity and just getting on with life .
I wonder how many of our pampered people nowadays would last in situations like this ?
When you 've never had something , to finally get it must be a fantastic feeling , no matter how basic that commodity is .
Well done Eigg , I hope you get everything you wish for .
Maximus , Boxgrove UK
What a great story of self sufficiency , going back to a much simpler era when people overcame problems and could do things for themselves .
Well done Eigg for resisting the march of time for so long , ( you hardy bunch ) and good luck for the future of you all .
Neil Farrell , Liverpool ( UK ) I guess the people have got it cracked this time !
Sorry .
Lloyd Williams , Farnham Surrey Brilliant !
Well done the people of Eigg The Government and the rest of the UK should take note instead of even contemplating going down the coal fired and nuclear power route
Christopher Walmsley , Poulton - leFylde , Lancashire I think it is fabulous that the people of Eigg have resolved their own energy needs .
I strongly feel that this is the way for future communities in Britain to achieve sustainable power .
We need to bring our own energy needs down to a community level then they will be achievable in a sustainable non detrimental way , to our environment .
Sabrina Hazelwood , Bath I spent 2 weeks on Eigg as a teenager back in 1970 .
A beautiful island and lovely people .
I have followed what has happened on Eigg over the past 30 some years .
This is wonderful news to add to the achievements that the islanders have accomplished .
Congratulations and enjoy !
Neil , Leeds Well Done !
john dunning , Barnsley ( Scot Pat ) I think we all can learn something from these people .
Well done the inhabitants of Eigg !!
Lee Viner , Antrim Northern Ireland
Well dome the people of Eigg !
You are an inspiration to us all .
Charlotte Smith , Aberfeldy , Perthshire
Are there any islands left without electricity ?
I like the sound of it .
Grouchmonkey , Colchester Eigg is quite a place .
It has a fascinating history , with stories of dark and bloody deeds , and its wildlife and natural environment are spectacular .
The views from Laig Bay towards Rum , and from the top of the Sgurr are incredible .
It 's also turning out to be a bit of a leader in the development of small isolated communities .
The 1997 community buyout of the island , from an absentee landlord , has given inspiration for other similar communities to follow .
Now we have the development of an energy scheme based on the use of a variety of renewable sources .
This will , hopefully , encourage other communities to do the same .
Eigg , you are and example to us all - good on you and may the island and the community continue to thrive .
With love from John Robson & Fern Hodges
John Robson , Rugby I 'd be interested to see how much money was provided by the islanders and how much by the EU .
As the cost of this project was over £ 160,000 per person !
adam , london
This is a brilliant example of the power of renewables - perhaps if more people in the UK generally had had to suffer the inconveniences and hardships that the Eigg inhabitants have over the years they would be more receptive to renewable energy , in all it 's forms !
Trevor , Mid Wales
My family visited Eigg a few times whilst on our annual holiday in Glenuig in the 80's .
It is one of the remotest and most beautiful places .
The exitement of getting the ferry over was fantastic , but the residants talking about all the generators did bring back memories of walking down the one road on the island listening to the Thud , thud thud of the generators .
I hope the constant electricity brings a more peaceful way of life to you all .
James Clarke , Northwich
Wow what a fantastic story to read , it really makes you realise how we take electricity for granted .
I would love to visit Eigg one day it sounds a wonderfull place , and the people sound lovely also .
Linda Parham , Buckingham , Buckinghamshire .
Renewable micro-power generation has to be a sensible way forward for most of the rest of the UK .
Surely , if many of the UK 's household generated a only small part of the power they need / use through wind or solar , the demands on centrally produced ' mains ' power would be much less .
Therefore we could easily reduce our national Co2 footprint ; not need to build as many new power stations and cut our domestic energy bills .
This is not rocket science and it's just a shame that the Governement does n't put some serious funding support behind this approach to encourage and support people who can and or want to , install wind or solar generators but have found it too costly to do so thus far or faced planning red tape !
I guess however , it 's easier to tax the motorist , 4x4 drivers , air travellers etc. , than find a sustainable solution to both our Co2 issues and growing demands for power .
Paul , Tonbridge Congrats to Eigg but a few of these ( us ) posters ought to realise that this way of life is impossible on a larger scale - those of you that think it ' the way we all should manage ' have missed the point entirely - they only managed becasue they did without the so called ' essentials ' like washing machines and toasters and such like .
How many of us would ' survive ' on a grand scale in similar circumstances ?
My goodness , it 's all we can do to drag our sorry selves away from the telly at the adverts to put the kettle on !
Congrats to the islanders but I hope you do n't regret the arrival of ' normality '
Steve B , Lee - on - the - Solent , Hants I wonder what their immigraiton policies are like ...
Mary , Northampton
Eigg has been in need of this for some time , its a wonder that they have n't been helped sooner - however , helping yourself and having a continuous supply of power must be an amazing thing - they are about to boost themselves into the future from the past .
A place I hope to visit in April :)
Alan McLaughlin , Stirlingshire Scotland
This is a heartwarming story , congratulations to the people of Eigg , all respect to you for working so hard to overcome problems !
Just for everyone 's information , I work in energy , and 100 % renewable energy for the rest of the UK is currently impossible .
The amount of electricity used everyday by us is huge , and currently there is no way to provide enough just through those sources .
Green energy and nuclear is the best compromise , much as I wish it was n't .
I do n't mean to dampen anyone 's fire as it were , but that 's the truth .
Well done again to the people of Eigg , I am truly envious of your community spirit !
Dan , Cardiff
The building of wind turbines is certainly appropriate in this instance .
Re Sabrina 's comment about communities , resolving their own energy needs .
My mother 's family come from the villlage of Llanuwchllyn in North Wales , their valley had their own small hydro scheme in the 1930's so much for " progress "
Bob Hughes , Newcastle upon Tyne To Adam from London :
The cost of this is irrelevant ; what matters is that a deserving community got what it needs .
I 'd like to see how many Londoners ( or the rest of us ) would manage without power for more than ten minutes .
Keith , Sheffield , UK Well done people .
It is a lovely story in this day and age .
People pulling together .
Must visit .
Michael Curry , Newmachar Aberdeenshire Well Done to Eigg .
It 's time that countries get their priorities straight and look after its own people .
Look at South Africa ( Power cuts and ' Load Shedding ' ) and Zimbabwe - days without power .
Instead of spending money on arms and wars give power to the people - or is this an idyllic view ?
Conrad Rossouw , Oban
Those people who complain about " the economic unfeasibility of renewables " have missed the obvious flaw in their argument : that with more of us implementing such schemes , the price comes down dramatically .
Congratulations Eigg !
Jai Gomer
Jai Gomer , Wales , UK OK so based on 50 quid a month per person and 50 % profitability it could take a century to break even .
That is called public investment .
I think most people would be surprised at the amount of money tied up in telephone , water , power and sewage infrastructure .
David Alexander , Edinburgh
If for one am very unhappy with this development !
I hate the concept of bringing my beloved Eigg up to the 21st century .
I 'll now be able to see my mistress under the light of a electric lightbulb - something i'm currenty quite worried about !
James Bownd , Eigg , Scotland Readers appear to be struggling with the maths of how much this project cost !
Here is a breakdown : Project cost £ 1.6 million and the island has 87 inhabitants and 71 properties .
Therefore cost per inhabitant = £ 18,391 and cost per property = £ 22,535 .
Hope that clears things up !

What are these ?
Both women and men are afflicted by compulsive buying , which can lead to financial ruin .
The stereotypical shopaholic darting from store to store to pick up anything and everything while racking up a hefty credit - card bill is anything but stereotypical .
They come in all shapes and sizes .
New research reveals while some super - shoppers spend to boost self - esteem and band - aid other perceived internal deficits , others ' carts are driven by plain - old materialism .
Whatever the motivation , however , researchers mostly agree that buying behaviors can range from frivolous fun to serious addiction .
And , it seems , over - shopping is on the rise .
Compulsive buying can be thought of as a chronic tendency to purchase products far in excess of a person ’s needs and resources .
" There are some people who are just total rational consumers ; they buy what 's on sale , or what they need and nothing else , " said researcher James Roberts of Baylor University 's Hankamer School of Business in Texas .
" On the other end , there are compulsive shoppers who buy to their own financial ruin and to relationship problems and other kinds of debt ; and then there 's the rest of us somewhere in between . "
Part of the problem , experts say , is that compulsive shopping is often viewed favorably rather than being treated as a problem .
Like an addiction
Some researchers have likened compulsive buying to other addictive behaviors that individuals use to escape life to the point where that behavior controls the person rather than vice versa .
" When it becomes our natural response to bad feelings or bad events in our life , to go shopping as a kind of retail therapy , it can really become a problem , " Roberts told LiveScience .
The consequences of compulsive shopping are far - reaching and could outlast the trendy pair of shoes or digital device you just purchased .
These include massive credit - card debt , spoiled relationships , work problems and depression and anxiety , according to the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery .
Some excessive spenders cover up debt or purchases — similar to an alcoholic hiding bottles — which can strain once - honest relationships .
" They suffer a lot because of the emotional drain of being in debt and wondering what 's going to happen , carrying these huge credit - card balances that go up and up and up , " said Stanford University psychiatrist Lorrin Koran .
" It can cause a lot of suffering and family dysfunction , because there are arguments about , ' Why are you buying these things you do n't use ? ; why are you spending this money ? ' "
Koran recalls some of the compulsive buyers in his research declaring bankruptcy and getting divorced over their buying disorder .
One woman was within weeks of losing her house .
Although the consequences can be " quite severe , " Koran says the so - called impulse control disorder is treatable and urges those afflicted to seek psychiatric help .
Shopping stats
The results of a telephone survey by Koran and his colleagues of more than 2,500 people , detailed in a 2006 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry , showed that an average of nearly 6 percent of the U.S. population fits the compulsive - buyer build .
They found the spending problem afflicts men and women at about the same rate .
Other estimates for the prevalence of compulsive buying range from a low of 2 percent to 12 percent or more of the U.S. population , Roberts said .
The murky stats on super - shoppers can be blamed on the vague criteria for diagnosing the condition and the associated scales put forth to measure it .
" Measuring compulsive buying is not a straightforward process , yet the ability to accurately measure it is important if researchers are to clearly understand and perhaps predict this growing consumer phenomenon , " Roberts wrote in the February issue of the Journal of Economic Psychology .
To learn more , Roberts and Chris Manolis of Xavier University in Ohio surveyed 406 college students with an average age of 19 and evenly split between males and females .
Students responded to questions about compulsive buying , credit - card misuse , attitudes toward money , materialism and consumption as a way to gain status .
" We found that the people who are classified as compulsive buyers under the Faber and O'Guinn scale , the most commonly used scale , seemed to be motivated by internal drivers , things like low self - esteem , " Roberts said .
However , this scale tended to sort people into extremes — either you are a compulsive buyer or you are n't .
" I think we'd do better to have people on a continuum , " Roberts said .
The Edwards Scale , a second approach , did indicate compulsive buyers along a continuum , though the scale picked out individuals driven more so by materialism and other external motivations such as great sales pitches or advertising .
Elizabeth Edwards , a professor of marketing at Eastern Michigan University who created the Edwards scale , says she did n't measure materialism or other external motivations and thus her scale does n't " pick out " individuals driven by materialism .
Instead , Edwards pointed out , her scale measures a tendency to compulsively buy rather than the behavior itself .
Why we shop
The overwhelming urge to splurge has been likened to other addictions , though compulsive buying currently is not recognized as a distinct disorder by the American Psychiatric Association .
" [ Compulsive buyers ] have usually fairly irresistible impulses that they can't control , and it leads to some kind of harm , either financial or occupational or interpersonal or some combination , " said April Lane Benson , a psychologist in New York who treats compulsive buyers , and the founder of Stop Overshopping , LLC .
She added , " It 's like having an itch and they have got to scratch it .
And they do n't realize that just like an itch , if they do n't scratch it sooner or later the itch will go away . "
Benson describes a typical client as a woman who has been buying things such as jewelry , clothing and shoes for years , and for one reason or another decides she needs to deal with this addiction .
" They come to me maybe because they decide they have a long - term goal they 're never going to meet if they do n't deal with this addiction .
They want to buy a house , or they want to have a baby , or their husband finds out , " Benson said .
Like other addictions , shopping fills some kind of void .
In past research , marketing professor Edwards found that compulsive buyers who took part in a 12 - step program called Debtors Anonymous also had certain personality types compared with the general population .
They tended to have low self - esteem , a tendency toward fantasizing and to be vulnerable to depression and high anxiety .
" Going out and buying a whole bunch of stuff makes you feel better about yourself .
Some might argue it 's really just an attempt to bolster your self - esteem , " Edwards said in a telephone interview .
" Unfortunately , it probably doubles back on itself and causes you to have higher anxiety and lower self - esteem if it gets out of hand when you 're a compulsive buyer . "
Edwards did n't find links between compulsive buying and income or gender , suggesting that both men and women are susceptible to spend uncontrollably regardless of their funds .
Consumer society
The prevalence of excessive purchasing is on the rise , thanks to society 's focus on everything material , Roberts thinks , based on his research and a review of others ' past research .
And whereas a slurring drunk or addict at the extremes is a no - no , a gal on a spending spree is commonly seen as a reason for applause .
" The difference between compulsive buying and other addictions is that compulsive buying is condoned by society , " Benson said , adding , " President Bush did n't tell us to go out and drink and take drugs , but he did tell us to go out and shop .
Consumption fuels our economy . "
Benson helps her clients deal with the emotional and practical aspects of this disorder .
In addition to finding the root cause of the overspending , individuals are guided in making a spending plan and preparing for what Benson calls high - risk situations that might trigger a relapse .
" It 's important to understand what you 're really shopping for , what are the underlying authentic needs —
Are you shopping because you 're lonely ?
Are you shopping to celebrate ? — and finding other ways to meet those important needs , " Benson said .
This is a repost of a blog post of 2008 .
Just for the reference :-)
This class allows sub-classes to commit changes to an instance to a history , and rollback to previous states .
The final class with an extension for __setstate__ and __getstate__ can be found here : transaction.py and transaction_test.py .
Now to the story , that led to it : I had the need for a transaction class in python and browsing the python cookbook led me to a small Transaction class .
$ python Python 2.5.1 ( r251 : 54863 , Oct 30 2007 , 13 : 45 : 26 ) [ GCC 4.1.2 20070925 ( Red Hat 4.1.2 - 33 ) ] on linux2 Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information .
>>> class Transaction ( object ) : ... def __init__ ( self ) : ... self .log = [ ] ... def commit ( self ) : ... self .log .
append ( self .
__dict__ . copy ( ) ) ... def rollback ( self ) : ... try : ... self .
__dict__ .
update ( self .log. pop ( - 1 ) ) ... except IndexError : ... pass ...
Ok , lets have some fun with it .
>>> class A ( Transaction ) : ... pass ... >>> a = A ( ) >>> a.test = True >>> a. commit ( ) >>> a.test = False >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': False , ' log ': [ { ' test ': True , ' log ': [... ] }]} ' >>> a. rollback ( ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': True , ' log ' : [ ] } '
Nice .
Let 's see if we can commit and rollback several times .
>>> a = A ( ) >>> a.test = 1 >>> a. commit ( ) >>> a.test = 2 >>> a. commit ( ) >>> a.test = 3 >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': 3 , ' log ': [ { ' test ': 1 , ' log ': [...]} , { ' test ' : 2 , ' log ' : [... ] }]} ' >>> a. rollback ( ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': 2 , ' log ': [ { ' test ': 1 , ' log ' : [... ] }]} ' >>> a. rollback ( ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': 1 , ' log ' : [ ] } '
Ok .. works :)
Let 's try some lists .
>>> a = A ( ) >>> a.test = [ 0 , 1 ] >>> a. commit ( ) >>> a. test. append ( 2 ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ' : [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] , ' log ' : [ { ' test ' : [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] , ' log ' : [... ] }]} ' >>> a. rollback ( ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ' : [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] , ' log ' : [ ] } '
Doh !
Ok , someone mentioned that already in the comments . copy.deepcopy ( ) is the key .
>>> import copy >>> >>> class Transaction2 ( Transaction ) : ... def commit ( self , ** kwargs ) : ... self .log .
append ( copy . deepcopy ( self .
__dict__ ) ) ... >>> class A ( Transaction2 ) : ... pass ... >>> a = A ( ) >>> a.test = [ 0 , 1 ] >>> a. commit ( ) >>> a. test. append ( 2 ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ' : [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] , ' log ' : [ { ' test ' : [ 0 , 1 ] , ' log ' : [ ] } ] } ' >>> a. rollback ( ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ' : [ 0 , 1 ] , ' log ' : [ ] } '
Ah , works .
Very good .
Now another check :
>>> a = A ( ) >>> a.test = 1 >>> a. commit ( ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': 1 , ' log ': [ { ' test ': 1 , ' log ' : [ ] } ] } ' >>> a.other = 2 >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': 1 , ' other ' : 2 , ' log ': [ { ' test ': 1 , ' log ' : [ ] } ] } ' >>> a. rollback ( ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': 1 , ' other ' : 2 , ' log ' : [ ] } ' >>> a. other 2
Oh , a leftover ... seems like self .
__dict__ has to be cleared , before the update .
>>> class Transaction3 ( Transaction2 ) : ... def rollback ( self , ** kwargs ) : ... try : ... state = self .log . pop ( - 1 ) ... self .
__dict__ . clear ( ) ... self .
__dict__ . update ( state ) ... except IndexError : ... pass ... >>> class A ( Transaction3 ) : ... pass ... >>> a = A ( ) >>> a.test = 1 >>> a. commit ( ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': 1 , ' log ': [ { ' test ': 1 , ' log ' : [ ] } ] } ' >>> a.other = 2 >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': 1 , ' other ' : 2 , ' log ': [ { ' test ': 1 , ' log ' : [ ] } ] } ' >>> a. rollback ( ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': 1 , ' log ' : [ ] } ' >>> a. other Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " " , line 1 , in AttributeError : ' A ' object has no attribute ' other ' >>>
Ah , works .
Very good .
Ok , more tests ...
>>> b = a.ncls >>> a.ncls.test = True >>> a. commit ( ) >>> a.ncls.test = False >>> a. rollback ( ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' ncls ': ' self .
__dict__ = { ' test ' :
True , ' log ' : [ ]} ' , ' log ' : [ ] } ' >>> b ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': False , ' log ' : [ ] } '
Oh , what if we work with " b " , which stills holds the old value ?
Maybe we should commit( ) all our attributes also , traversing through them all ?
Ok , here is such a beast :
>>> class TransactionNew1 ( object ) : ... def _docommit ( self ) : ... if " log " not in self .
__dict__ : ... self .
__dict__ [ " log " ] = list ( ) ... ... self .
__dict__ [ " log " ]. append ( copy . deepcopy ( self . __dict__ ) ) ... ... def _dorollback ( self ) : ... if " log " not in self .
__dict__ : ... return ... try : ... state = self .
__dict__ [ " log " ]. pop ( - 1 ) ... self .
__dict__ . clear ( ) ... self .
__dict__ . update ( state ) ... except IndexError : ... pass ... ... def commit ( self , ** kwargs ) : ... # commit ourselves , then our childs ... self . _docommit ( ) ... if kwargs .
get ( " deep " , True ) : ... for child in self .
__dict__ . values ( ) : ... if isinstance ( child , self .
__class__ ) : ... child . commit ( ) ... ... def rollback ( self , ** kwargs ) : ... # rollback our childs , then ourselves ... if kwargs .
get ( " deep " , True ) : ... for child in self .
__dict__ . values ( ) : ... if isinstance ( child , self .
__class__ ) : ... child .
rollback ( ) ... self .
_dorollback ( ) ... ... def __repr__ ( self ) : ... return " 'self.__dict__ = %s ' " % self .
__dict__ ... >>> class A ( TransactionNew1 ) : ... pass ... >>> a = A ( ) >>> a.ncls = A ( ) >>> b = a.ncls >>> a.ncls.test = True >>> a. commit ( ) >>> a.ncls.test = False >>> a. rollback ( ) >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' ncls ': ' self .
__dict__ = { ' test ' :
True } ' , ' log ' : [ ] } ' >>> b ' self.__dict__ = {' test ': True , ' log ' : [ ] } '
Ok ... looks good , but we lost the reference .
id (b ) != id ( a.ncls ) ... ( update : this is fixed in the final version )
Working with it revealed also :
>>> a = A ( ) >>> b = a >>> for i in xrange ( 3 ) : ... b.n = A ( ) ... b.t = " test " ... b = b.n ... a. commit ( ) ... >>> a ' self.__dict__ = {' log ': [ {' n ' : ' self .
__dict__ = {} ' , ' log ' : [ ] , ' t ' : ' test '} , {' n ' : ' self .
__dict__ = { ' log ' : [ { ' log ' : [ ]} ] , 't ' : ' test ' , 'n ' : ' self.__dict__

Hmm ... seems strange ..
Ah , self.log was also copied with copy.deepcopy ( ) .
So , we have multiple useless copies .
Let 's " pop ( ) " the state from self .
dict before the deepcopy .
>>> class TransactionNew2 ( TransactionNew1 ) : ... def _docommit ( self ) : ... if " log " in self .
__dict__ : ... oldstate = self .
__dict__ . pop ( " log " ) ... else : ... oldstate = None ... state = copy .
deepcopy ( self .
__dict__ ) ... if oldstate : ... state [ " log " ] = oldstate ... self .
__dict__ [ " log " ] = state ... def _dorollback ( self ) : ... if " log " not in self .
__dict__ : ... return ... try : ... state = self .

Trackbacks Chicago May Criminalize Possession of Small Plastic Bags :
Tiny plastic bags used to sell small quantities of heroin , crack cocaine , marijuana and other drugs would be banned in Chicago , under a crackdown advanced Tuesday by a City Council committee .
Ald. Robert Fioretti ( 2nd ) persuaded the Health Committee to ban possession of " self - sealing plastic bags under two inches in either height or width , " after picking up 15 of the bags on a recent Sunday afternoon stroll through a West Side park .
Lt. Kevin Navarro , commanding officer of the Chicago Police Department 's Narcotics and Gang Unit , said the ordinance will be an " important tool " to go after grocery stores , health food stores and other businesses .
The bags are used by the thousand to sell small quantities of drugs at $ 10 or $ 20 a bag .
Navarro referred to the plastic bags as " Marketing 101 for the drug dealers . "
Many of them have symbols , allowing drug users to ask for " Superman " or " Blue Dolphin " instead of the drug itself , he said .
Prior to the final vote , Ald. Walter Burnett ( 27th ) expressed concern about arresting innocent people .
He noted that extra buttons that come with suits , shirts and blouses -- and jewelry that 's been repaired -- come in similar plastic bags .
Burnett was reassured by language that states " one reasonably should know that such items will be or are being used " to package , transfer , deliver or store a controlled substance .
Violators would be punished by a $ 1,500 fine .
Does anyone have the full text of the ordinance ?
If so , I 'd appreciate it if you could post a link in the comment thread or send it to me via e-mail .

DAR ES SALAAM ( Reuters ) - Unpopular at home and in much of the world during the last year of his presidency , George W. Bush is basking in rare adulation on his African tour .
President Bush greets wellwishers during an arrival ceremony at the State House in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , February 17 , 2008 .

Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete poured praise on Bush in Dar es Salaam on Sunday , the second day of his five - nation African tour , each compliment applauded warmly by members of the east African country ’s cabinet .
Although around 2,000 Muslim demonstrators protested against Bush on the eve of his visit , many thousands more cheering , waving people lined his road from the airport on Saturday .
Banners across the route , decorated with Bush ’s image against a backdrop of Tanzania ’s Mt. Kilimanjaro , read : “ We cherish democracy .
Karibu ( welcome ) to President and Mrs Bush . ”
Others read : “ Thank you for helping fight malaria and HIV . ”
Dancers at the airport and at Kikwete ’s state house to greet Bush on Sunday , wore skirts and shirts decorated with his face .
Back home , Bush is suffering some of the lowest approval ratings in his seven - year tenure and has been buffeted by criticism of his handling of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the ailing economy .
Not surprisingly he is enjoying the different reception in Africa .
Beaming repeatedly during a press conference with Kikwete , he made a point of referring to his welcome on the streets , which he described as “ very moving ” .
Bush opened his remarks by saying “ Vipi Mambo ! ” before turning to U.S. journalists and adding : “ For the uneducated , that ’s Swahili for ‘ Howdy Y’all ’ ” -- a typical Texas greeting .
Kikwete told Bush : “ The outpouring of warmth and affection from the people of Tanzania that you have witnessed since your arrival is a genuine reflection of what we feel towards you and towards the American people . ”

In a reference to Bush ’s domestic problems , Kikwete added : “ Different people may have different views about you and your administration and your legacy .
“ But we in Tanzania , if we are to speak for ourselves and for Africa , we know for sure that you , Mr. President , and your administration have been good friends of our country and have been good friends of Africa . ”
Although many Africans , especially Muslims , share negative perceptions of Bush ’s foreign policy with other parts of the world , there is widespread recognition of his successful humanitarian and health initiatives on the continent .
Bush has spent more money on aid to Africa than his predecessor , Bill Clinton , and is popular for his personal programs to fight AIDS and malaria and to help hospitals and schools .
Bush has stressed new - style partnerships with Africa based on trade and investment and not purely on aid handouts .
His Millennium Challenge Corp. rewards countries that continue to satisfy criteria for democratic governance , anti-corruption and free - market economic policies .
Bush signed the largest such deal , for $ 698 million , with Kikwete on Sunday .
Because of the U.S. anti-malaria program , 5 percent of patients tested positive for the disease on the offshore islands of Zanzibar in 2007 compared to 40 percent three years earlier , the Tanzanian leader said .
Bush ’s legacy in Africa would be saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of mothers and children who would otherwise have died from malaria or AIDS and enabling millions of people to get an education , he said .
“ I know you leave office in about 12 months ’ time .
Rest assured that you will be remembered for many generations to come for the good things you ’ve done for Tanzania and the good things you have done for Africa , ” Kikwete said .

Abrams praises investigation of Limbaugh 's Dem primary ' dirty tricks ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano

This month 's primaries in Ohio and Texas resurrected Hillary Clinton from the political graveyard for the umpteenth time this election season .
Conservative talker Rush Limbaugh is taking credit for Clinton 's continued presence in the race after encouraging Republican voters to switch parties before those two big states voted March 4 , and he has called on Pennsylvania GOPers to do the same before their state votes April 22 .
Limbaugh 's listeners are worried about an election fraud investigation , which could result in criminal charges for voters in at least one Ohio county .
MSNBC host Dan Abrams says the right - wing radio host 's aim is " to subvert democracy and inject dirty tricks into the Democratic nomination process . "
" I 've said it before , I think it 's un-American to encourage people to vote for a candidate they do n't want to win , in order to corrupt the process , " Abrams said .
" But in Ohio , it may also be illegal . "
He went on to discuss a probe in Cuyahoga County , which includes Cleveland , where Board of Elections officials are launching an investigation into crossover voters to determine whether any are guilty of election fraud , a felony .
Results of the investigation will be released March 31 .
It 's unlikely that Limbaugh single - handedly swung the results to Clinton in either state , as was his stated intention .
Clinton and her Democratic rival Barack Obama split Republicans in Ohio , and Obama won Texas Republicans , according to network exit polls .
In Ohio's Cuyahoga County , which includes Cleveland , the Plain Dealer reported that a " staggering " 16,000 Republicans switched parties to vote in the March 4 Democratic primary .
Some GOP voters openly acknowledged their intention to meddle with the opposing party , writing messages like " For one day only " on pledges voters are required to sign indicating they will support the party whose primary they are voting in .
As staggering as the Cuyahoga County figure seemed , exit polls suggest crossover voters may have been even more prevalent elsewhere in the state .
Nearly 325,000 voters cast a ballot for either Obama or Clinton in the Cleveland area , so Republicans accounted for about 5 percent of the Democratic turnout .
Statewide , Republicans made up about 9 percent of the Democratic primary electorate , according to the exit polls .
Obama has touted his support among independents and GOP voters -- so - called Obamacans -- and while some crossover voters told the PD they voted for Clinton to set up an easy target for John McCain in the fall , others said they thought Obama would be an easier opponent .
Plenty of Republicans also voted Democratic out of heart - felt beliefs , to be sure , as the GOP struggles in what is expected to be a rocky election year .
In Pennsylvania , Obama 's campaign was working hard to get supporters to switch their registration from independent or Republican to Democratic .
He even ran a radio ad reminding those voters that Monday was the last day they could register as Democrats to vote in the April 22 primary .
Meanwhile , Limbaugh also has said he has " operatives " registering Republicans as Democrats to vote for Clinton .
Between March 10 and 17 , the most recent timeframe available , more than 14,000 new Democrats registered to vote in Pennsylvania and 29,000 voters switched their registration to the Democratic party , the Philadelphia Inquirer reports .
Before Pennsylvania goes to the polls , the Cleveland , Ohio - area elections board will release the results of its investigation .
Some ballots containt possible evidence of voter fraud , which in Ohio is punishable by up to a year in jail and a $ 2,500 fine .
" I 'm looking for evidence , " Sandy McNair , a Democratic member of the county 's elections board tells the Plain Dealer .
" I 'm not interested in a witch hunt .
But I am interested in holding people accountable , whether they 're Democrat or Republican . "

The Afghan war , you will remember , was supposed to be the " good war " .
Unlike the catastrophe of Iraq , from which most former cheerleaders still prefer to avert their eyes , Afghanistan was thought to be different .
Senior British military figures might wince in private over their Basra humiliation , but would earnestly insist that they were fighting the good fight in Helmand " at the request of the elected Afghan government " .
Gordon Brown felt able to tell parliament only six weeks ago that " we are winning the battle in Afghanistan " .
But in the wake of a string of reports that the country is fast becoming a failed state and a humanitarian disaster , as armed attacks on western troops and Afghan forces multiply and Nato splits down the middle over sending reinforcements , that looks ever more other - worldly .
The US coordinator on Iraq , David Satterfield , even suggested last month that Iraq would turn out to be America 's " good war " , while Afghanistan was going " bad " .
After a conflict that has already lasted longer than the second world war , Paddy Ashdown , rejected at the last minute as UN proconsul in Kabul , was clearly closer to the mark than Brown when he declared : " We are losing in Afghanistan . "
Tomorrow , the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , arrives in London to discuss Nato's Afghan crisis , triggered by Canada 's threat to withdraw its 2,500 troops from Kandahar unless other states bolster the western occupation in the bloodiest areas of the south .
But there seems little prospect of anything more than token gestures , after both Germany and France rejected US demands to extend their commitments - despite taunts from the US defence secretary , Robert Gates , about their inability to fight insurgencies .
In most Nato states , public opposition to the Afghan war is strong and growing stronger .
That includes Britain , where 62 % want all 7,800 UK troops withdrawn within a year , a view unshaken by attempts to boost support with military parades and gung - ho Beau Geste - style media reporting from the frontline .
Public cynicism towards Britain 's first co-occupation of a Muslim country in the US's " war on terror " can only be deepened by the Afghan president Hamid Karzai 's public denunciation last month of the British military role in the south - which had , he said , led to the return of the Taliban .
The criticism caused outrage , but Karzai is either a sovereign ruler or he is not .
Together with his complaint that he had been strong - armed by the British into removing the governor of Helmand , with disastrous consequences , it clearly cuts the ground from beneath the claim that western troops are simply in Afghanistan to support the government .
Karzai was , after all , installed by the US after the overthrow of the Taliban regime in 2001 and subsequently confirmed in bogus US - orchestrated elections three years later .
If even someone regarded as a US - British stooge , whose writ famously barely runs outside Kabul , is reduced to protesting in public that his western protectors are doing more harm than good , that not only makes a mockery of the idea that Afghanistan is an independent state .
It also strongly suggests this is a man who recognises that the occupation forces may not be around indefinitely - and he may have to come to more serious terms with the local forces that will .
For all the insistence by Britain 's defence secretary , Des Browne , and others that this is a " commitment which could last decades " , there is no doubt that armed resistance to foreign occupation is growing and spreading .
Nato forces ' own figures show that attacks on western and Afghan troops were up by almost a third last year , to more than 9,000 " significant actions " .
And while Nato claims that 70 % of incidents took place in the southern Taliban heartlands , the independent Senlis Council thinktank recently estimated that the Taliban now has a permanent presence in 54 % of Afghanistan , arguing that " the question now appears to be not if the Taliban will return to Kabul , but when " .
Meanwhile , US - led coalition air attacks reached 3,572 last year , 20 times the level two years earlier , as more civilians are killed by Nato forces than by the Taliban and suicide bombings climbed to a record 140 .
The Kabul press last week predicted a major Taliban offensive in the spring .
The intensity of this armed campaign reflects a significant broadening of the Taliban 's base , as it has increasingly become the umbrella for a revived Pashtun nationalism on both sides of the Afghan - Pakistani border , as well as for jihadists and others committed to fighting foreign occupation .
The original aims of the US - led invasion were of course the capture of Mullah Omar , the Taliban leader , and Osama bin Laden , along with the destruction of al - Qaida .
None of those aims has been achieved .
Instead , the two leaders remain free , while al Qaida has spread from its Afghan base into Pakistan , Iraq and elsewhere , and Afghanistan has become the heroin capital of the world .
For the majority of Afghans , occupation has meant the exchange of obscurantist theocrats for brutal and corrupt warlordism , along with rampant torture and insecurity ; while even the early limited gains for women and girls in some urban areas , offset by an explosion of rape and other violence against women , are now being reversed .
The meaning of " liberation " under foreign occupation can be measured by the death sentence passed last month on a 23 - year - old student for blasphemy after he downloaded a report on women 's rights from the internet .
The war in Afghanistan , which claimed more than 6,500 lives last year , can not be won .
It has brought neither peace , development nor freedom , and has no prospect of doing so .
Instead of eradicating terror networks , it has spread and multiplied them .
The US plans to send 3,000 more troops in April to reinforce its existing 25,000 - strong contingent , and influential thinktanks in Washington are pressing for an Iraqi - style surge .
But only a vastly greater deployment could even temporarily subdue the country , and that is not remotely in prospect .
The only real chance for peace in Afghanistan is the withdrawal of foreign forces as part of a wider political settlement , including the Taliban and neighbouring countries like Iran and Pakistan .
But having put their credibility on the line , it seems the western powers are going to have to learn the lessons of the colonial era again and again .

Here 's one of the reasons which has made HATE San Francisco : About 18 years ago I was riding the 30 Stockton bus heading downtown , standing room only ( as usual ) .
I am tall , so I could see over the largely ( probably 95 % ) asian population inside the bus , who all seemed to be hacking their lungs out without covering their mouths ( nice ) .
So we stop at Sacramento Street ( just before the tunnel ) , and a whole group of people want to push on to the bus .
Everybody at the stop manages to squeeze in when there is a bit of a commotion at the front .
An old Chinese lady ( I am assuming she was Chinese ) was holding in her hand a live chicken .
She was holding it by the feet and , as a chicken in such a situation would do , this particular chicken was squawking up a storm .
The bus driver ( a large African - American gentleman ; this was back before a majority of the drivers became asian ) was standing up , pointing at the squawking chicken , telling the lady , " Hey !
You can't come on the bus with a live chicken !
" Anyone who believes the Chinese people ( or asian people ) in San Francisco cannot understand english is completely naive .
They understand .
Oh yes they do .
This old lady locks her gaze squarely with the driver , and after seeming to study him for a moment , lifts the squawking chicken and suddenly swings it with all her might > SMACK !< in to the side of the bus .
Dead ... silence .
Not a single person spoke , or moved , or even breathed .
We all heard it , and most of us saw it .
I could see the blood dripping gently from the chicken 's head .
And then , gathering up all of her pride , the old Chinese woman stepped on to the bus , directly under the gaping jaw of the bus driver , and took her place standing at the front of the bus next to the rest of the crowd ( which although space - limited gave her a wide berth ) WITH A DEAD , BLEEDING CHICKEN IN HER HAND .
The bus driver sat down and closed the door , and the entire bus -load of horrified people were soon on their way .
DO NOT MESS WITH THE OLD CHINESE WOMEN !
This is a true story .
I have told a lot of people this story over the years .
If you heard it from someone , I am the guy who saw it actually happen .
Rep. Robert Wexler on the 5th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq .
From his email :
This evening will mark 5 years since President Bush officially launched his ill - conceived preemptive invasion of Iraq .
At the beginning of this war , whether we agreed with it or not , Congress and the American people saluted the brave service of the men and women of our military .
Today , five years later , it is well past time that we truly honor this service by bringing all American troops home from Iraq .
This war has affected the lives of so many American families .
The stories we hear from our friends , family members , and co-workers are truly heartbreaking – from the tragic losses of life and devastating injuries , to those who have returned but still suffer mental trauma and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder .
Many of us personally know one of the 4,000 soldiers who have died or one of nearly 40,000 Americans who have been wounded .
Many of us have a friend or family member who has had to suffer repeated 15 - month tours – separated from family and often with little break in between assignments .
Beyond the personal losses that so many have endured , now all Americans are feeling the financial effects of the war , as the fruits of our economy ( nearly $ 500 billion to date ) are drained into this never - ending engagement .
Just imagine the investments that could have been made if this money was spent here at home , rather than fueling this massive war machine half a world away .
This tragedy extends to innocent Iraqis as well .
From children to their teachers , shopkeepers to waiters – even the low estimates of Iraqi civilian deaths are near 90,000 .
Some estimate the death toll to be in the hundreds of thousands .
Americans will sacrifice a great deal to protect our national security and to bring peace to troubled regions of the world .
But what have we gained for all of our sacrifices in Iraq ?
Today , we are more vulnerable then ever with a rebuilding Al Qaeda , a resurgent Iran , and a totally destabilized Iraq .
Even worse , President Bush and Vice - President Cheney brought us into this calamity in Iraq based on deliberate lies and misdirection .
The Bush Administration misled Congress and the American people with false claims of Iraqi nuclear weapons , Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , and Iraqi relations with Al Qaeda .
These lies were fed with great enthusiasm by those who stood to benefit financially and politically from this war .
We must renew our call for a dramatic change of course .
Last week in Congress , I introduced a resolution that condemns the Bush Administration for this unnecessary war and calls for an immediate redeployment of troops .
Please contact your Member of Congress and urge them to co-sponsor this important resolution .
It is time to confront the stark reality of our situation .

This weekend sees yet another product of the Judd Apatow Comedy - Industrial Complex released into theaters , as the Owen Wilson comedy Drillbit Taylor makes its way to a multiplex near you .
This is just the latest salvo from a producing - writing - directing machine whose last six films have made an estimated $ 754,000,000,000 at the box office and won four dozen Oscars .
But it ’s apparent that not all Judd Apatow movies are created equal :
Some are masterpieces of American comedy ; some are simply funny movies without much cultural resonance ; some are actually kind of bad .
Given that there are dozens more on the way , how can you tell them apart ?
And how do you know if they ’ll be any good ?
Let Vulture ’s Department of Addition and Subtraction investigate !
If the movie ...
For example :
Scoring result : Is directed by Judd Apatow .
Knocked Up , The 40 - Year - Old Virgin. 4 points .
Is directed by an unlikely indie - film auteur .
Greg Mottola ( Superbad ) .
3 points .
Is directed by some dude .
Jake Kasdan ( Walk Hard ) , Adam McKay ( Talladega Nights ) .
- 2 points .
Is written by Judd Apatow .
Knocked Up , The 40 - Year - Old Virgin . 4 points ( full credit ) ; 2 points ( shared credit ) .
Is written by some acolyte of Judd Apatow's , so you know he helped .
Superbad , Forgetting Sarah Marshall. 3 points .
Has a colon in its title .
Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgundy , Walk Hard : The Dewey Cox Story .
- 3 points .
Co-stars Apatow 's relatives .
Leslie Mann ( The 40 - Year - Old Virgin ) ; Apatow 's kids ( Knocked Up ) .
1 point per relative .
Co-stars former cast member of Freaks & Geeks .
Seth Rogen , Jason Segel , James Franco .
1 point per freak or geek .
Co-stars former cast member of Undeclared .
Jay Baruchel , Loudon Wainwright III . .5 points per Undeclareder .
Includes wangs .
Superbad , Forgetting Sarah Marshall .
1 point per minute of wang screen time .
Includes movie stars in major roles .
Will Ferrell ( Talladega Nights ) , Owen Wilson ( Drillbit Taylor ) .
- 1 point .
Includes a legitimate dramatic actress who has proven her chops in movies or TV .
Catherine Keener ( The 40 Year - Old Virgin ) , Katherine Heigl ( Knocked Up ) . 3 points .
Includes McLovin. Superbad. 10 points .
Broken down in this manner , the Apatow oeuvre comes into focus .
Bad movies : Talladega Nights : The Ballad of Ricky Bobby ( - 8 )
Okay movies : Walk Hard : The Dewey Cox Story ( - 1 ) , Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgundy ( 0 )
Really good movies : The 40 Year - Old Virgin ( 14 )
Great movies : Knocked Up ( 19 ) , Superbad ( 23.5 )
More important , what does this mean for future Apatovian releases ?
Drillbit Taylor is written by Apatow acolyte Seth Rogen ( 3 ) , but directed by Steven Brill , the auteur behind Little Nicky ( - 2 ) .
It stars Owen Wilson ( - 1 ) and is sadly free of Apatow ’s repertory company of comedians , though Leslie Mann does play a supporting role ( 1 ) .
As far as we know , it contains no wangs , no seasoned dramatic actress , and no McLovin .
It should score about a 1 , which is to say it will be slightly better than Anchorman .
Forgetting Sarah Marshall is also written by an Apatow acolyte , Freaks & Geeks vet Jason Segel ( 3 ) , who also stars along with Undeclared ’s Carlo Gallo ( 1.5 ) .
Sadly , it ’s directed by Nicholas Stoller ( - 2 ) .
We are promised wangs , “ several scenes , ” so let ’s say three minutes ( 3 ) .
No big stars , but Kristen Bell is at least as proven an actress as Katherine Heigl ( 3 ) .
That gives us a relatively solid movie , with a total score of 8.5 — somewhere between Anchorman and The 40 - Year - Old Virgin .
Not bad !
And what about the upcoming Pineapple Express ?
Directed by David Gordon Green ( 3 ) , written by Seth Rogen ( 3 ) , starring Rogen and James Franco ( 2 ) , devoid of movie stars and colons .
We ’re up to 8 points already , and we have n’t even counted the ten minutes of wangs that are sure to appear .
Sign us up !
Update : Vulture responds to your comments !
‘ Anchorman ’ Is Not As Funny As You Remember
Will This Judd Apatow Movie Be Any Good ?
Vulture Does the Math
Crimes of the State
[ Some editors find that two mainstream sources ( CBS News and Jerusalem Post ) are not enough documentation of the George Washington Bridge truck bomb incident .
So , here 's more . ]
A wonderful corroboration comes from the Deputy Managing Editor of the Wall Street Journal , Barney Calame , writing for the American Society of Newspaper Editors :
" A delivery truck carrying about 60,000 papers bound for Manhattan from the South Brunswick printing plant got caught in a roadblock at the George Washington Bridge .
A van suspected of carrying explosives had been stopped — and the entire inbound bridge lanes were closed , trapping the Journal delivery truck for several hours .
" -- Scattered WSJ staff use e-mail , phones , N.J. office to publish , Barney Calame , Published : May 31 , 2002
Well now , I guess that really happened , huh ?
A van was stopped .
Traffic was stopped .
Reports went out to the world about the van .
The Wall Street Journal report comes from personal knowledge of events involving the Wall Street Journal truck .
TWO -- DIFFERENT -- VANS
It should be clarified now that there were at leaststopped that day , which has led to some confusion .
One van was stopped at the " approach ramp " to the " George Washington Bridge , " with either two suspects ( CBS / Jerusalem Post ) or three suspects ( CNN ) .
van was stopped on a " service road off Route 3 near New Jersey 's Giant Stadium " in " East Rutherford " ( ABC Bergen Record ) , withsuspects .
This van was stopped " around 4 pm " ( ABC ) .
The latter van was stopped 12 miles away ( MAPQUEST ) at the George Washington Bridge , after 10 pm on 9/11 .
CNN also reported the arrests in question :
DEBORAH FEVERICK , [ correction : " Feyerick " ]
CNN CORRESPONDENT : Yes , I can .
That is the information that I am getting from two sources , that there was a van either on the New Jersey Turnpike or the Garden State Parkway , and that it was near the George Washington Bridge .
There were two or three men who were in the van that was pulled over .
It is not clear why the van was pulled over , but when it was , law enforcers found tons of explosives inside of the van .
That is , right now , all I am hearing .
But again , two to three people in custody , and we are trying to get more information on that right now .
HEMMER : Deborah , I do n't mean to put you on the spot here .
Do you know where on the Jersey Turnpike this was ?
How far from New York City ?
FEVERICK : We do not know that .
We are looking into that .
There is one report that it was on the New Jersey Turnpike .
There is another report that it was very close to the bridge , if not on the bridge .
So again , these details are emerging .
We 're trying to piece them together .
But that 's what we have so far , two to three people in custody , found with a van filled with explosives .
--CNN LIVE EVENT / SPECIAL , A Number Of Men Arrested With Explosives On Jersey Turnpike , Aired September 11 , 2001 - 23:28 ET
1 ) There was a van very near the George Washington Bridge .
2 ) It was stopped at the approach to the George Washington Bridge by police .
3 ) The traffic across the bridge was closed for several hours .
4 ) News reporters were informed of a large amount of explosives in the van .
5 ) Two or three people were in the van , and were arrested .
6 ) No mention at all of these facts ( or of " Urban Moving Systems " ) was presented at the 9/11 Commission , and it was never acknowledged by their ( phony ) report or by the Congressional Joint Inquiry Report .
We can be pretty damned certain that :
And , you know what ?
That 's enough .
Just the fact that we were told about a truck bomb on the evening of 9/11 needed to be clarified and explained by the U.S. federal government in significant detail .
The fact that they have buried this and pretended it never happened is damning in and of itself .
At this point , one may say yes , a van was stopped , but it did n't actually have explosives in it .
Okay , but why would someone assume that CNN , CBS , Jerusalem Post and others are wrong about the presence of the explosives ?
And why is that assumption good enough ?
How did all of their sources provide them with the explosives information in the first place ?
The van had to contain something that led police to conclude it was " tons " of explosives ( CNN ) , and " enough explosives ... to do great damage to the George Washington Bridge . "
( CBS )
If so , what was in the van ?
Let us see this evidence for ourselves .
More importantly : were the two or three suspects arrested at the bridge just ghosts ?
Did n't they exist ?
What are their names ?
Minutes after the arrests , the Police Commissioner of New York City , Bernard Kerik , confirmed ( on CNN ) from his own sources the arrest of " three men in a van , " and he had been told specifically that there were " no explosives in the van . "
Kerik also evaded the question of where exactly this van was located :
QUESTION : Where in New Jersey , do you know ?
KERIK : I can't say yet .
Does he mean he " ca n't say ? "
He 's not allowed to say ?
Or that he does n't know ?
This is a very odd response to a pretty straightforward question about the location where an arrest has just taken place .
How is Kerik so sure about the lack of explosives , if he can't even be sure where the van was ?
Remember , there were two vans .
That much is proven beyond any reasonable doubt .
The first van -- stopped near Giants Stadium -- did not contain explosives .
That much is true , although bomb sniffing dogs reacted to this van as if it did , as reported in the Bergen Record story ( FIVE MEN DETAINED AS SUSPECTED CONSPIRATORS , BERGEN RECORD ( New Jersey ) Wednesday , September 12 , 2001 ) .
The second van , stopped at the George Washington Bridge , is in question .
Kerik 's confirmation of " three men " correlates to the George Washington Bridge van , as opposed to the five suspects in the other van who were stopped seven hours previously near Giants Stadium , and driven away " in a procession of state police cars around 5 pm . " ( Bergen Record )
The timing of Kerik 's announcement , 11:30 pm , correlates to the later arrests .
Kerik makes no mention of multiple vans .
Here 's the quote :
BERNARD KERIK , NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER : I just got a confirmation from the Chief of Detectives , he 's reach out to the FBI .
They have confirmed that someone has been stopped in New Jersey , three men in a van .
However , there was no explosives in the van .
All right .
They 're being held for questioning .
Kerik really stresses the talking point .
No one had mentioned " explosives " at the press conference up until that moment .
The questioner did ask about " resources , " a vague term that Kerik apparently interpreted as " explosives . "
( CNN , New York City Officials Address Day's Devastation , Aired September 11 , 2001 - 23:30 ET )
I would implore local 9/11 Truthers to get the Port Authority Police Department records about these arrests at the bridge , and to interview all the involved officers they can locate .
This assumes the police records still exist and have n't been purged like other important bits of history related to " Urban Moving Systems " and the 9/11 attacks .
The Jerusalem Post article has been removed from their website .
Coincidentally , it has also been removed from the Internet Archive The Wayback Machine , exactly as the Fox " News " report was removed :

So the reader will need to head to a library that carries the Jerusalem Post if they doubt the veracity of the WhatReally Happened website , where that article is currently mirrored .
The FBI " Be On Look Out " or BOLO alert sent out to local police stations at 3:31 pm on September 11th :

A New Zealand man who claimed to have been left speaking Australian after being raped by a wombat has been sentenced to 75 hours community service .
Arthur Ross Cradock , a 48 - year - old orchard worker , admitted in the Nelson District Court yesterday to the charge of using a phone for a fictitious purpose , after calling police with the message , " I 've been raped by a wombat " .
Police prosecutor Sergeant Chris Stringer told the court that on the afternoon of February 11 Cradock called the police communications centre , threatening to " smash the filth " if they arrived at his home that night .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The White House must release its visitor logs and cannot hide behind a shield of privilege , a federal judge ruled Monday .
The Bush administration has resisted public disclosure while it fights a lawsuit over alleged political influence by conservative Christian leaders .
The Bush administration has been fighting the release of White House visitor logs .
U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth concluded the information is part of the public record and is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act as " agency records . "
" Because the Secret Service creates , uses and relies on , and stores visitor records , they are under its control , " said Lamberth .
He ordered the Secret Service to produce records within 20 days .
The White House claimed exclusive control of the documents , subject to the complete discretion of the president over their release .
Secret Service records have been an important tool for advocacy groups and members of Congress seeking information on the inner workings of the executive branch .
Congressional investigators used the records a decade ago in their investigations of the various Whitewater scandals involving President Clinton and his associates , as well as allegations of influence peddling by the Clinton campaign in the 1996 elections .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a self - described government watchdog group , sought the visit records of prominent conservatives James Dobson of Focus on the Family , Wendy Wright of Concerned Women of America and seven others including the late televangelist Jerry Falwell .
" CREW is pleased that the judge saw through the White House 's transparent attempts to hide public documents from the American people , " said Melanie Sloan , the group 's executive director .
" We look forward to sharing the documents we obtain through this lawsuit . "
The White House and Justice Department had no immediate reaction to the ruling .
Separate legal action by CREW and other groups , including Judicial Watch and the Washington Post , sought White House visitor logs that listed lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
He pleaded guilty last year to public corruption charges .
The White House and the Secret Service in 2006 signed an agreement that visitors to the White House complex were not subject to public disclosure .
That " memorandum of understanding " was disclosed during legal action over the Abramoff records .
Lamberth called that a " self - serving " agreement because it was issued after the records were created and after the CREW lawsuit .
The judge , in a separate ruling Monday , said he lacked the authority to order the Secret Service to stop destroying its visitor records once copies were turned over to White House officials .
But Lamberth noted the National Archives had to approve any destruction of the logs .
Another federal judge in Washington ordered the release of Secret Service logs of visitors to Vice President Dick Cheney 's office .
Cheney claimed those logs were subject to executive privilege .
That ruling is being appealed .
Lamberth noted the Secret Service has an important " protective mission " when compiling electronic information -- including background checks -- of those seeking to enter the White House complex .
But he said the agency 's claim of " limited use " of the data does not mean the records are not subject to judicial review .
" This does not mean the Secret Service does not read or rely on them , " wrote Lamberth .
" If that were the case , any convenience store patron who has ever bought a losing scratch ticket could claim they did not gamble simply because they held the ticket for only a few minutes . "

Video : Virtual out - of - body experience
By deliberately scrambling a person ’s visual and tactile senses , it is now possible to give them an “ out - of - body ” experience .
Two procedures – which are the first to imitate an out - of - body experience artificially – use cameras to fool people into thinking they are standing or sitting somewhere else in a room .
They provide the strongest proof yet that people only imagine floating out of their bodies during surgery or near - death experiences .
“ The brain can trick itself , and when it is trying to interpret sensory information , the image it produces does n’t have to be a real representation , ” says Henrik Ehrsson , of the Institute of Neurology , University College London , UK , who designed the first experiment .

To trick his subjects , Ehrsson had them wear a head - mounted display that showed them footage of themselves filmed from behind , while preventing them from seeing anything else .
He then used a plastic rod to prod the subject in the chest and simultaneously held a second rod in front of the camera behind them , to make it seem that the illusory “ person ” viewed from behind was being prodded in the chest too .
Subjects physically felt themselves being prodded , but also had the weird sensation that it was their alter ego in the film footage being prodded .
“ It gives you a very strong sensation you ’re sitting somewhere else , ” Ehrsson said at a press conference held in London .
Not madness
His conclusion is that our perception of self within the body is tightly bound to how our brains process information from our senses .
“ I ’m not interested in out - of - body experiences , ” says Ehrrson .
“ I ’m interested in why I , as myself , am located in my body – why we have ‘ in - body ’ experiences , if you like . ”
He says the work is important because it de-stigmatises reports of out - of - body experiences by people who are on drugs , or ill with conditions such as migraine or epilepsy .
“ They do n’t have to be mad to experience these things , ” he says .
Ehrrson ’s results are echoed by a second out - of - body experiment , conducted by Olaf Blanke and colleagues at the Federal Polytechnic of Lausanne ( EPFL ) in Switzerland .
This group also deliberately scrambled the visual and tactile experiences of subjects to create a sense of disembodiment .
In Blanke ’s set - up , people were fitted with 3D headsets and forced to watch virtual “ figures ” standing two metres ahead being stroked on the back .
They either saw live footage of themselves , of a dummy , or of an inanimate black board being stroked .
Sometimes the subjects themselves were stroked at the same time , and sometimes not .
After watching the images for a minute , the subjects were blindfolded , move directly backwards and asked to walk forward to where they had been originally standing .
Relocated self
Blanke found that those who had seen either themselves or the dummy being stroked while also being stroked , overshot their original position by 25 centimetres on average , suggesting they were drawn towards the “ person ” they had watched , thinking it was actually them .
But the trick did not work if they watched the blackboard being stroked , or if they had not simultaneously been stroked .
Blanke says the experiment demonstrates that the sight of a human - like figure combined with stroking can trick a person into subconsciously relocating their sense of self away from where it should have been .
“ The self was no longer within the body borders , ” he said at the same press conference .
But he admits that the illusion did not create a full “ out - of - body ” experience like Ehrsson’s .
Both researchers say their experiments reinforce the idea that the “ self ” is closely tied to a “ within - body ” position , which is dependent on information from the senses .
“ We look at ‘ self ’ with regard to spatial characteristics , and maybe they form the basis upon which self - consciousness has evolved , ” says Blanke .
The researchers add that the procedures could perhaps be used to create more realistic avatars in virtual reality computer games .
The same technology might also be used to enable tasks such as surgery to be carried out remotely , linking distant surgeons more realistically to remotely - operated surgical tools .

With Some Help , Dems OK Anti-Torture Measure
A controversial measure barring the CIA from using torture cleared the Senate late yesterday , despite opposition from Republican presidential front - runner Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
Senate Democrats picked up the support of moderate Republicans , some of whom face tough re-election battles this year , to pass the conference report accompanying the annual intelligence authorization bill on a 51 - 45 vote .
The White House has threatened to veto the bill because it includes a provision that would prohibit the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies from using interrogation techniques not authorized by the U.S. Army Field Manual .
Given the narrow vote , Democrats do not appear to have enough support to override a veto .
McCain ’s vote against the bill seemed to contradict his public statements opposing torture generally and the practice of waterboarding in particular .
McCain , who is trying to appeal to his party ’s conservative base , told reporters he believes his position is consistent .
“ We always supported allowing the CIA to use extra measures .
I believe that waterboarding is illegal and should be banned , ” he said .
“ My position was very clear , ” he added .
“ We have said … that we would allow the CIA to use additional techniques that were not in violation of the anti-torture convention , that were not in violation of the Geneva Conventions and were not in violation of the Detainee Treatment Act . ”
McCain said he voted for the Military Commissions Act and Detainee Treatment Act .
The CIA has come under criticism recently for destroying videotapes in 2005 showing the interrogation of suspected terrorists .
CIA Director Michael Hayden told the Senate Intelligence Committee last week that waterboarding was used on three detainees after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
The administration maintains it no longer uses waterboarding .
The intelligence authorization bill would authorize programs and spending for the intelligence community for the current fiscal year .
When reminded that President Bush has threatened to veto the bill over the torture ban provision , McCain replied : “ That ’s fine . ”
Democrats picked up the votes of two Republicans who face tough re-election battles this year : Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Gordon Smith of Oregon .
Sen. Olympia Snowe , R - Maine , also crossed party lines to vote with Democrats .
Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska voted with Republicans .
Democratic presidential hopefuls Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York did not vote .
The House passed the bill in December .
Senate Democrats immediately hailed yesterday ’s vote .
“ For the first time , the Senate and the House have essentially said that there will be a uniform standard for the interrogation of detainees all across the government , ” said Sen.
Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , who was responsible for inserting the provision into the conference report .
“ So torture is out . ”
Democrats said they were surprised Republicans did not raise a point of order against the provision , given that it was inserted during conference proceedings .
They suspected Republican leaders did not want to create difficult votes for McCain and other GOP lawmakers .
Although Senate Select Committee on Intelligence ranking member Christopher “ Kit ” Bond , R - Mo. , said Tuesday he would consider raising a point of order , he never did .
A Republican aide said the point of order was not raised because the bill is going to be vetoed .
“ It will go to the White House to be vetoed , ” Bond said .
“ We ’ll have to start all over again and I ’ll see if I can convince my colleagues that we drafted a very good bill the first time . ”
Bond said he was “ really disappointed because we have n’t had an intel authorization .
There are a number of things that the intelligence community needed .
There were things that we in the oversight committee wanted .
This was a very good bipartisan issue until one of the last votes of the conference . ”

SSH acts as a secure channel , and it makes a remote system appear local , and a local one appear at the remote side .
It can be used either for remote command execution , with or without a pty , and it can be used for multiplexing several TCP and X11 sessions .
It also can be used for tunneling insecure protocols , such as POP3 or SMTP , through secure SSH tunnels .
In addition , it can be used with some limitations to tunnel FTP securely .
SSH can do wonders in only a few lines of C code — thanks to the UNIX philosophy of stringing together powerful tools in generic ways .
Is there a program more commonly used in day - to - day Linux computing than SSH ?
I doubt it .
Not only is it rock - solid , secure and versatile , but it also is extremely simple to use and feature - rich .
Because its algorithms and protocols are both state of the art and their implementation is open for peer review , we can rest assured on the cryptographic integrity of SSH .
SSH does have weaknesses , however ; although most of them stem from social engineering , and working around broken protocols , such as X11 , pose a big challenge .
The OpenSSH Architecture
Let 's begin with the overall scheme of things .
Figure 1 . OpenSSH Architecture
As shown in Figure 1 , OpenSSH is composed of three key layers .
The bottom layer , ssh - transport , is the most critical component involved in all the crypto operations , such as key exchange , re-keying at intervals , protecting against attacks in various ways and so on .
The layer on top of that , ssh- userauth , is responsible for authenticating end users to the sshd dæmon that runs at the server end .
Remember that SSH authenticates both ways .
The client SSH program authenticates the sshd server dæmon using the ssh - transport protocol .
After authentication , key exchange is completed , and a secure connection is established .
Subsequent to that , user authentication takes place in the ssh - userauth layer .
ssh -userauth provides a lot of flexibility , because users can authenticate to the server in various ways — from a private key on a smart card to simple user name / password authentication .
Once it goes through , the ssh - connection layer establishes a secure channel , either for executing a remote command or to obtain an interactive login shell .
The ssh - connection layer is capable of multiplexing any number of simultaneous independent secure sessions over a single ssh- userauth layer with the transport stack layer below it , as shown in Figure 1 .
All of SSH 's magic — forwarding arbitrary TCP ports from local to remote and remote to local , acting as a SOCKS proxy , forwarding X11 connections , establishing VPN tunnels , executing remote commands with and without a pty — is done with the ssh- connection layer .
SSH has flow control built in to the protocol .
Each secure channel has a separate window size allocated .
Because SSH operates above a reliable TCP layer , this does not have much of a role .
At least , it is not as critical as the TCP windowing mechanism .
Most of the critical channel open / close messages and other termination messages do n't consume any window space .
Because all messages are encrypted and integrity - protected , nobody can interpret the messages .
There is a special SSH_MSG_IGNORE message type that can be used for defeating traffic analysis attacks .
These are the kinds of attacks that figure out when data is going over the wire and how much data is being transferred .
SSH , of course , comes with many other niceties for sending secure KEEPALIVE messages , redirecting stdin to / dev/null for specialized X window applications and many more .
Now , let 's take a look at a sample SSH session and typical message exchanges ( Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 . OpenSSH Protocol Flow Diagram
Here is a typical unencrypted SSH packet :
byte SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST
uint32 recipient channel string " pty- req " boolean want_reply string TERM environment variable value ( e.g. , vt100 ) uint32 terminal width , characters ( e.g. , 80 ) uint32 terminal height , rows ( e.g. , 24 ) uint32 terminal width , pixels ( e.g. , 640 ) uint32 terminal height , pixels ( e.g. , 480 ) string encoded terminal modes
Most fields are self - explanatory .
The top two fields are always present in all messages .
The payload packets ( what the user types and the responses from the server ) are all carried with the SSH_MSG_DATA message type .
Every packet has a header that describes the contents of the payload ( message type ) and the channel for which it is destined .
Some of the messages do not need a response from the other side , as the underlying layer is not only reliable but also tamper - resistant .
But , most requests from the client have a corresponding response from the server .
Now , let 's get to the gory details of the SSH key exchange protocol , because that is the most critical component that accounts for the security and popularity of SSH .
Figure 3 shows the data manipulations that are necessary to encrypt , compress and integrity - protect .
Of course , we need to protect ourselves against replay attacks as well .
For that , there is an implicit sequence number for each packet , and it starts at 0 and goes to 232 before wrapping around .
Because the sequence number is hashed , it can be sequential , and attackers never can guess what input will lead to what hash .
Figure 3 . OpenSSH Packet Processing
The key components of OpenSSH keys are :
Hash : H .
Shared secret : K .
Session ID : session_id .
SSH uses the above components to derive the following encryption vectors and keys :
Client to server initialization vector .
Server to client initialization vector .
Client to server encryption key .
Server to client encryption key .
Client to server MAC key .
Server to client MAC key .
The equations used for deriving the above vectors and keys are taken from RFC 4253 .
In the following , the || symbol stands for concatenation , K is encoded as mpint , “ A ” as byte and session_id as raw data .
Any letter , such as the “ A ” ( in quotation marks ) means the single character A , or ASCII 65 .
Initial IV client to server : HASH ( K || H || “ A ” || session_id ) .
Initial IV server to client : HASH ( K || H || “ B ” || session_id ) .
Encryption key client to server : HASH ( K || H || “ C ” || session_id ) .
Encryption key server to client : HASH ( K || H || “ D ” || session_id ) .
Integrity key client to server : HASH ( K || H || “ E ” || session_id ) .
Integrity key server to client : HASH ( K || H || “ F ” || session_id ) .
Simple , right ?
What is not simple , however , is figuring out the K and H parameters .
HASH is usually an SHA1 hash mechanism , but it can be something else as well .
The typical cipher algorithm used is AES or DES3 in CBC mode .
The MAC is a combination of MD5 or the SHA1 hash algorithm with a secret key .
There are four choices here :
hmac-sha1
hmac-md5
hmac-sha1-96
hmac-md5-96
Actually , sha1 is a little weak in today 's world , because collision attacks are possible .
The zeitgeist in hashing today is sha512 , but with proper re-keying and other smarts built in , it should not be a problem .
Remember that hashes are of a constant length , so hmac - sha1 is 20 bytes long , hmac - md5 is 16 bytes , and the other two have a fixed length of 12 bytes each .
Okay , now for some mathematical and crypto gymnastics of the kex stage .
We know how to compute the individual encryption and MAC keys provided that we derive the basic parameters using the simple equation above .
But , how do we get the parameters to begin with , in a secure , authenticated manner ?
Now , we need to look at how OpenSSH uses diffie - hellman - group14 and diffie - hellman - group1 fields to derive the DH generator and DH moduli for an anonymous key agreement .
However , this leaves us open to several man - in - the - middle and other active attacks .
To thwart this , we use a known and trusted server public key to authenticate key exchanges .
Authentication of key exchange data is nothing more than signing with a private key .
And , OpenSSH typically uses ssh - dsa or ssh-rsa keys for this purpose .
In other words , a combination of DH and RSA / DSS keys are used for authentication and to derive the secret parameters K , H and session_id .
session_id is simply the hash of the first key exchange .
A 16 - byte random cookie also is used to protect against replay and other man - in - the - middle attacks .
Here is the equation for deriving H :
H = hash ( V_C || V_S || I_C || I_S || K_S || e || f || K )
hash is usually the SHA1 hash algorithm .
V_C and V_S are the client and server identification strings .
I_C and I_S are the client and server SSH_MSG_KEXINIT messages just exchanged .
Now , we are left with computing e , f and K ; e and f are the DH parameters used for exponentiation :
e = g x modulo p
f = g y modulo p
K = ey modulo p
Here , p is a prime number from the DH generator field .
And , x and y are chosen arbitrarily by client and server .
Remember that DH works using the simple mathematical principle that abc = acb = abc .
Now , we have everything required for computing the secret keys .
The nice thing about all of these cryptographic parameters is that they are thrown away after every session .
The only reused parameter is the server RSA / DSA key , but because we add a random cookie in our calculations , it 's difficult for attackers to break SSH cryptographically .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Bad news about the banking industry may have you wondering about the safety of your hard earned cash at your own bank .
In the past year there have been four bank failures .
And the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and banking industry experts foresee many bank failures down the road .
" Regulators are bracing for 100 - 200 bank failures over the next 12 - 24 months , " says Jaret Seiberg , an analyst with the financial services firm , the Stanford Group .
Expected loan losses , the deteriorating housing market and the credit squeeze are blamed for the drop in bank profits .
The problem areas will be concentrated in the Rust Belt , in places like Ohio and Michigan and other states like California , Florida and Georgia .
The number of institutions categorized as " problem " institutions by the FDIC has also grown from 50 at the end of 2006 to 76 at the end of last year .
But to put that in perspective -- by the end of 1992 -- at the tail end of the banking crisis -- there were 1,063 banks on that " trouble " list says David Barr of the FDIC .
Financial Security Watch Gerri Willis answers your financial questions Today on CNN
12 pm ET see full schedule »
Banking experts say there is one thing that will save your money if your bank goes under .
That 's FDIC insurance .
" It 's the gold standard , " says banking consultant Bert Ely .
" The FDIC has ample resources .
It 's never been an issue , " he says .
The FDIC insures deposits in banks and thrift institutions .
The federal agency was created during the Great Depression in response to thousands of bank failures .
The FDIC maintains that not one depositor has lost a single cent of insured funds since 1934 as a result of a bank failure
Experts say you should n't panic .
" The banking industry comes into this in a very sound condition , " says Ely .
Seiberg agrees .
" This is not a repeat of the S&L debacle of the late ' 80s and early '90s .
Banks are entering this credit cycle with better capital and better earnings .
Many more of them can weather the storms ahead , " he says .
And there could be a silver lining .
Banks looking for cash may offer some of the best short - term CD rates .
" It 's a cheap way for banks to make money , " says Greg McBride of Bankrate.com .
Protecting your money
Here 's how to make sure you pick a safe bank .
First , look for the FDIC logo at your local branch .
If you do n't see it , ask the bank , or go to the FDIC 's Web site and click on " Bank Find . "
Here you 'll be able to see if the bank carries this guarantee .
This step is especially important if you 're using an Internet - only bank or a bank you 've never heard of .
You can also check out the financial health of a banking institution at www.bankrate.com.
The FDIC also maintains a list of bank rating agencies on its Web site that can assess a banks financial stability .
But in many cases , these companies charge a fee .
As loan delinquencies rise , and bank failures increase , the FDIC is shoring up its reserves .
The agency is bringing back formerly retired employees to bolster a division that deals specifically with bank failures .
Many of these agency veterans worked for the FDIC during the late 1980s and early 1990s , when thousands of financial institutions failed during the savings - and - loan crisis according to Barr ..
Know your limits
As an individual , your deposits are insured up to $ 100,000 in an FDIC - insured bank .
This includes your savings , your checking , any certificate of deposits ( CDs ) and money market accounts .
Joint accounts can be insured up to $ 200,000 .
IRAs and Keoghs -- these are retirement plans for people who are self - employed -- can be insured up to $ 250,000 .
These retirement accounts are considered separate from your individual bank accounts .
If you have money in a credit union , the same protections exist .
However , instead of the FDIC insurance , deposits are insured under the National Credit Union Administration , another government agency .
Of course , banks offer much more than your bread - and - butter savings and checking accounts .
Some offer investments such as mutual funds or stock funds , which generally promise higher rates of return than CDs , are not insured by the FDIC nor are they insured by the broker / dealer .
The general rule is deposits are FDIC - guaranteed , but not investments .
And keep in mind , annuities , life insurance policies -- even the contents of your safe - deposit box -- are not insured .
If you 're worried you do n't have enough insurance on your accounts , the FDIC Web site has a tool that will allow you to calculate your insurance coverage .
It 's called the electronic deposit insurance estimator -- or EDIE for short .
You can also call the agency at 877 - ASK - FDIC .
And rest assured if you have U.S. savings bonds or treasury bills , the principle and interest on these products are backed by the faith and credit of the federal government so there 's no risk of default as long as you do n't sell these products before they mature says McBride .
If your bank bites the dust , there 's nothing to fear according to the FDIC .
A healthier banking institution normally buys the failed bank according to Barr .
" There is little or no interruption to the consumer , " he says .
" If you go to bed one night as a customer of a bank , and you wake up as a customer of a new bank , there is nothing you have to do . "
Your checks will still clear , you can still use your ATM card .
But , there can be changes to the terms of your original deposit .
For example , if you took out a CD with an annual percentage rate of 3.5 percent , it 's entirely possible the new bank will drop that interest rate .
If that happens , you have the option to withdraw your funds without penalty .
Loans are handled differently .
If you took out a loan with a bank , for example an auto loan or a mortgage , those interest rates and terms of interest remain the same regardless of the new bank .
If no buyer can be found to take over the failed bank , customers are written a check with their deposit money within 48 hours .

For example , “ you would n’t want to use these devices to disinfect apple cider , ” he said .
“ The light would n’t penetrate . ”
The lamp that creates the ultraviolet light , which has a wavelength of 254 nanometers , is good for 10,000 treatments  about 2,500 gallons of water  said Miles Maiden , inventor of the SteriPen and the chief executive of Hydro - Photon .
The batteries will last for about 100 treatments before they need to be replaced .
Ultraviolet rays , of course , can be damaging to eyes and skin , so the product comes with safety features .
The SteriPen has electrodes or water sensors in its neck that prevent its turning on until the device is completely immersed in water , Mr. Maiden said .
After that , the ultraviolet light is securely contained : the surface of the water acts as a mirror , blocking the ultraviolet light from escaping , and UV beams cannot pass through standard container materials .
SHANNON DAVIS , associate editor of Backpacker magazine in Boulder , Colo. , liked the liquid - crystal display and the microprocessor of the new SteriPen Journey .
“ The display shows you that you ’ve left the device in there the right amount of time , ” Mr. Davis said , “ and that adds confidence . ”
He also liked the snug fit between the pen and standard plastic bottles that hold , for instance , one or two liters of water .
“ The fit is so tight that you can insert the pen in the bottle , ” he said , and then swirl the bottle vigorously without spilling a drop .
Meridian Design , of San Jose , Calif. , also makes a portable ultraviolet water purifier , the mÜV ( $ 49 at the company Web site , uvaquastar.com ) that is rechargeable , said Dan Matthews , president of the company .
The unit is in limited production , Mr. Matthews said .
“ We ’re testing them individually before they are released to full marketing , ” he said .
“ We ’re not ready to make thousands of them until we ’re comfortable we ’ve worked out the kinks . ”
Jamie DeBenedetto , a hiker and trail leader who lives in Phoenix , tried the mÜV and prefers it to the iodine tablets she usually carries in her backpack for purification of water .
It is easy to recharge , she said , “ and the water tastes a lot better than it does with iodine . ”
Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by progressive loss and deterioration of bone tissue leaving your bones susceptible to fractures .
Osteoporosis is inevitable with aging , but there are number of risk factors that influence the loss of bone in the middle and later life .
Women are at greater risk of bone loss than men because women have less dense bones than men .
The other main risk factors of osteoporosis include poor diet , lack of exercise and poor lifestyle habits .
Here are the osteoporosis prevention tips to delay or avoid osteoporosis later in life .
Osteoporosis prevention tips :
Osteoporosis exercise tips :
Regular exercise from your teen years will help in reducing your osteoporosis risk in the middle and beyond .
If you are not performing physical activity regularly , the following osteoporosis exercise tips can help you to workout regularly .
Choose workouts that include resistance and weight - bearing exercises as these exercises help in reducing osteoporosis risk .
Resistance exercises use your strength of muscle to build bone mass and these exercises include push ups , chin ups , free weights , sit ups and elastic band exercises .
Weight - bearing exercises use your bone and muscle to work against gravity and these exercises include stair climbing , bowling , dancing , walking , skating and jogging .
Each time you hit the ground with your foot , stress is applied to your bones and therefore the strength of the bones is increased , which can be measured in terms of bone mineral density .
Balance exercises can improve your stability and help in preventing falls , which cause fractures .
The balancing exercises include sitting on exercise ball , standing on one leg , and tai chi .
Flexibility exercises helps to attain flexible joints and prevent injury .
Flexible exercises include stretching exercises and yoga .
Select the exercises that are specifically targeted to strengthen your back to prevent fractures later on in life and to improve posture .
Before starting any exercise program or before increasing the intensity of exercise , talk to your doctor .
If you already have bone loss , avoid high impact exercises , as they can lead to fractures in weakened bones .
Choose gentle weight bearing exercises like dancing , walking and low - impact aerobics .
Osteoporosis diet tips :
Adequate calcium and vitamin D are required for building strong bones and teeth .
Osteoporosis is a disease where calcium is lost from bones , resulting in weak bones .
Osteoporosis diet is important for osteoporosis treatment which includes adequate calcium intake .
Everyday your body loses calcium through shed skin , hair , nails , and sweat .
This lost calcium must be replaced through diet regularly .
When your diet does not contain enough calcium to perform these activities , calcium is taken from your bones , the storage area of calcium .
People who have consumed more fruits and vegetables during childhood have high bone mineral density than those who consumed less .
Vitamin D is important for bone health .
Get vitamin D from daily sunshine or from intake of foods that contain vitamin D to prevent vitamin D deficiency .
Vitamin D helps in absorbing phosphorus and calcium , which helps in regulating normal calcification of bones .
Vitamin D is found in milk , eggs , liver and salmon .
Leafy green vegetables are good sources of calcium and they also contain necessary vitamins and minerals that help in absorption and utilization of calcium .
These leafy vegetables are kale , collard leaves , dandelion greens and turnip greens .
To increase calcium in your diet , make stock for soup from bones and calcium rich vegetables .
Stock that is made from animal bones and seafood shells is an important source of calcium .
Drink your milk , which include low - fat and skim milk .
Non -fat yogurt and reduced fat cheese are also good sources of calcium to build strong bones .
Fortified milk products contain vitamin D needed for absorption of calcium .
Eat soy products , as they not only contain calcium but also plant estrogens are present , which helps in maintaining bone density .
Soy also contains magnesium and boron , which are important for your bone health .
Isoflavones in soy foods can inhibit the breakdown of bones .
Eat enough protein , as it is associated with higher bone mineral density .
Do n’t consume protein in high quantity .
High protein can raise excretion of calcium .
Limit the intake of protein to 50 grams if you are a woman and 63 grams if you are a man .
Choose protein from fish , especially oily fish such as tuna , salmon , herring and mackerel .
Oily fish are high in D vitamin and helps in protection of bones .
Magnesium is an important supplement for osteoporosis prevention .
It is necessary for bone formation and for processing calcium in the body .
Magnesium helps in metabolizing calcium and converting vitamin D to active form .
Vitamin K has properties that protect and prevent fractures and bone loss .
Intestinal bacteria produce vitamin K and it is found in leafy vegetables .
Fiber should be part of your osteoporosis diet .
But , certain types of fiber can affect the amount of calcium the body absorbs .
Spinach , beet greens contain oxalate , which can reduce calcium absorption .
However , fiber is helpful to digestive tract , therefore , balance calcium levels with the amount and type of fiber in the diet .
Reducing the salt can protect your heart and bones .
High intake of sodium interferes with calcium retention .
Fast foods are high in sodium and have been linked with weak bones .
Change in lifestyle for osteoporosis prevention :
There are many lifestyle changes to lower your risk of osteoporosis .
In many cases , change in lifestyle helps to prevent osteoporosis and other diseases as well .
PopPhoto Flash : The Crime of Photography : Rewarded !
Pop Photo blogs about the case of amateur photographer Bogdan Mohora who was jailed in Seattle last year after he took photos of police that they did n’t want him to take during an arrest .
Although Mohora was only briefly detained he pushed the issue and worked with the ACLU to get an $ 8,000 settlement for his arrest .
The two officers involved in the incident James Pitts and David Toner , pictured above , were discilplined with written reprimands for a lack of professionalism and poor exercise of discretion .
Photography , even of the police , is not a crime .
Think about this the next time a cop tells you that you cannot take a photograph .
The police should know better than this and I ’m glad that Mohara is $ 8,000 richer after being harrased by them .
The sad thing is that the police get away with telling photographers not to shoot probably 99 % of the time .
It ’s only when photographers really push the issue and insist on their First Ammendment rights that we see this stuff in the press .
More from the Seattle Times here .
And more from the Seattle PI here .
Thanks CJ for the heads up !
On Boing Boing here .
Update .
Officer David Toner responds :
“ Hello , I just came across this web site while looking for something else and read the comments about Mahora ’s incident .
I am the officer that arrested Mahora .
I have seen a lot of negative comments concerning this arrest and wanted to give you my perspective .
First of all I would like to say that not one single person has contacted me about my side of this arrest .
Not the press , not the ACLU , and not one single individual .
All of the results of this have been based on Mahora ’s less that honest and rather self serving retelling of the arrest .
First off , Mahaora has every right to photograph police officers while doing their everday work .
Some exceptions apply but not in this case .
There were outside circumstances that caused this arrest to become more dangerous to both the officers and the two men being contacted .
The fact that Mahora was taking pictures of the event was not in and of itself an issue .
I get photographed doing my job more often than you ’d think and have no problem with it .
The problem arose when Mahora got too close to us to take his pictures .
I had asked him to move back and he did .
Eventually he got close in again and was again instructed to step back a short distance .
Again he complied .
The third time became a serious officer safety situation when my partner was handcuffing a compliant suspect and I was seated in my car several feet away .
I looked back to make sure my partner was under control with his suspect and there was Mahaora standing right next to me blocking my exit out if needed , taking a close up of my face .
At this time I saw that my partner was fine and then placed Mahora under arrest for hindering .
Many other parts of Mahora ’s story were inaccurate and sometimes out and out lies but they do not address this particular topic so I wo n’t go into them .
Suffice is to say that this was not an issue about trying to suppress anyones constitutional rights but one of keeping two police officers safe while trying to do their job .
As for the $ 8000 , Mahora was given the money as a settlement out of court as there was no court case about this .
He won nothing but was simply paid off to “ go away ” .
This is common practice for governments to do since handling a case in court will cost many times that amount .
And yes , it makes me mad as well since that was yours and my tax money paying off a guy who was in the wrong .
That ’s politics for ya .
I know that this will not mean anything to some of you who are quick to blame us dirty stinking cops for everything you can but I know that most of you know that we are all in this together and some might have wanted to hear the other side .

Under the old rules , whenever the oversight board learned of intelligence activity that it believed might be " unlawful or contrary to executive order , " it had a duty to notify both the president and the attorney general .
But Bush 's order deleted the board 's authority to refer matters to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation , and the new order said the board should notify the president only if other officials are not already " adequately " addressing the problem .
But Bush downsized the board 's mandate to be an aggressive watchdog against such problems in an executive order issued on Feb. 29 , the eve of the anniversary of the day Ford 's order took effect .
The White House said the timing of the new order was " purely coincidental . "
The board 's investigations and reports have been mostly kept secret .
But the Clinton administration provided a rare window into the panel 's capabilities in 1996 by publishing a board report faulting the CIA for not adequately informing Congress about putting known torturers and killers in Guatemala on its payroll .
" I believe [ the changes ] will eliminate abuses and questionable activities on the part of the foreign intelligence agencies while at the same time permitting them to get on with their vital work of gathering and assessing information , " Ford told Congress .
To blunt proposals for new laws imposing greater congressional oversight of intelligence matters , Ford enacted his own reforms with an executive order that went into effect on March 1 , 1976 .
Among them , he created the Intelligence Oversight Board to serve as a watchdog over spying agencies .
Ford created the board following a 1975 - 76 investigation by Congress into domestic spying , assassination operations , and other abuses by intelligence agencies .
The probe prompted fierce battles between Congress and the Ford administration , whose top officials included Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , and the current president 's father , George H. W. Bush .
" It 's quite clear that the Bush administration officials who were around in the 1970s are settling old scores now , " said Tim Sparapani , senior legislative counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union .
" Here they are even preventing oversight within the executive branch .
They have closed the books on the post - Watergate era . "
The White House did not say why it was necessary to change the rules governing the board when it issued Bush 's order late last month .
But critics say Bush 's order is consistent with a pattern of steps by the administration that have systematically scaled back Watergate - era intelligence reforms .
WASHINGTON - Almost 32 years to the day after President Ford created an independent Intelligence Oversight Board made up of private citizens with top - level clearances to ferret out illegal spying activities , President Bush issued an executive order that stripped the board of much of its authority .
Bush 's order also terminated the board 's authority to oversee each intelligence agency 's general counsel and inspector general , and it erased a requirement that each inspector general file a report with the board every three months .
Now only the agency directors will decide whether to report any potential lawbreaking to the panel , and they have no schedule for checking in .
Suzanne Spaulding , a former deputy counsel at the CIA who has worked as a congressional staff member on intelligence committees for members of both parties , said the order " really diminishes the language that calls on the Intelligence Oversight Board to conduct independent inquiries , " leaving the panel as potentially little more than " paper pushers . "
And Elizabeth Rindskopf Parker , a former general counsel at both the CIA and the National Security Agency who is now the dean of the University of the Pacific law school , said it was unwise for the Bush administration to undermine the Intelligence Oversight Board at the same time that the administration has been pushing for fewer restrictions on its intelligence powers .
" An organization like this gives some level of comfort that there is an independent review capability , " Parker said .
" Changes like this appear to water down an organization that contributes to the public 's confidence . "
But Tony Fratto , a White House spokesman , denied that the order reduced the authority and independence of the panel .
Fratto pointed to a federal statute that makes it a general duty of all government officials to report lawbreaking to the Justice Department .
Because of this , he said , there is still a " widely understood background presumption " that the board can contact the attorney general even though Bush deleted the authority to make criminal referrals from its list of core responsibilities .
Fratto also said the changes merely updated the board 's responsibilities after Congress in 2004 created a director of national intelligence to run the intelligence community .
The order says the director is the person responsible for making any criminal referrals to the Justice Department .
Still , critics contend that the director of national intelligence cannot play the same watchdog role as the oversight board because he is part of the intelligence world , not independent from it , and so there may be occasions in which he has signed off on an activity whose legality might be questioned by outsiders .
Some analysts said the order is just the latest example of actions the administration has taken since the 2001 terrorist attacks that have scaled back intelligence reforms enacted in the 1970s .
In his 1976 executive order , for example , Ford also banned foreign intelligence agencies , such as the National Security Agency , from collecting information about Americans .
The Bush administration bypassed that rule by having domestic agencies collect information about Americans and then hand the data to the NSA , The Wall Street Journal reported this week .
Ford 's order also banned assassination .
But Bush authorized the CIA to draw up a list of Al Qaeda suspects who could be summarily killed .
The administration decided that such targeted killings were an exception to the rule because it was wartime .
In 1978 , Congress enacted a law requiring warrants for all wiretaps on domestic soil .
But now spies are free to monitor Americans ' international calls and e-mails without court supervision if the wiretaps are aimed at targets overseas .
In 1980 , Congress enacted a law requiring that the full House and Senate intelligence committees be briefed about most spying activities .
The Bush administration asserted that it could withhold significant amounts of information from the committees , briefing congressional leaders instead .
Finally , executive orders were once widely understood to be binding unless a president revoked them , an act that would notify Congress that the rules had changed .
But the administration has decided that Bush is free to secretly authorize spies to ignore executive orders - including one that restricts surveillance on US citizens traveling overseas - without rescinding them .
Some critics of the post - Watergate era have contended that its investigations and reforms went too far .
For example , Cheney , who was Ford 's chief of staff , said in December 2005 that " a lot of the things around Watergate and Vietnam . . . served to erode the authority , I think , the president needs to be effective , especially in a national security area . "
But Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr. , the former chief counsel to the Senate committee that undertook the 1975 - 76 investigation into intelligence abuses , said that by rolling back the post - Watergate reforms , the Bush administration had made intelligence abuses more likely to occur .
" What the Bush administration has systematically done is to try to limit both internal oversight - things like the Intelligence Oversight Board - and effective external oversight by the Congress , " Schwarz said , adding , " It 's profoundly disappointing if you understand American history , and it 's profoundly harmful to the United States .

Most people probably view pigs at best as a source of sustenance or , at worst , as filthy , gluttonous animals .
But it seems our porcine pals may also prove invaluable in the fight against type 1 diabetes .
Researchers are experimenting with new ways of harvesting insulin - producing islet cells from pigs and transplanting them into diabetes sufferers in the hope of one day reducing the need for daily insulin shots and even replacing them with twice - yearly islet - cell treatments .
In type 1 diabetes the immune system attacks and destroys insulin - producing islet cells in the pancreas .
San Diego , Calif. , –based biotech firm MicroIslet Inc. , is developing an islet therapy in which insulin - producing porcine islets are implanted in a person 's peritoneum ( the thin membrane lining the abdominal cavity ) from an external catheter bag via a tube inserted into the stomach .
" Human - to - human islet transplants can work but there 's not a commercial opportunity there because of limited access to pancreases [ someone has to die ] , " says Keith Hoffman , a MicroIslet board member .
This scarcity means " millions of people " do not have access to islet transplants that could bring their diabetes under control , he adds .
In MicroIslet 's cell encapsulation method ( developed at Duke University ) , the porcine islet cells are isolated from the human immune system using an alginate shell ( a thickening agent derived from seaweed ) so they can produce insulin when needed without being destroyed by human antibodies .
Nutrients such as insulin , glucose and oxygen are able to diffuse freely through the alginate .
MicroIslet is not the only company searching for a diabetes treatment via encapsulated xenotransplantation ( cross- species transplant ) .
Australian biotech firm Living Cell Technologies , Ltd. , is testing its DiabeCell neonatal porcine islets encapsulated in an alginate gel that can likewise be transplanted for the treatment of insulin - dependent diabetes .
The first DiabeCell patient was implanted last June , and the company this year plans to complete a clinical trial in Russia .
MicroIslet seeks to take this budding procedure further by improving the durability of microencapsulated islets so they resist rapid deterioration over time ( although allowing the islets to remain fully responsive ) , thereby lengthening the time between implantations .
MicroIslet cautions that , while it believes xenotransplantation can be a therapeutic solution for millions of diabetics worldwide , it will not likely replace insulin injections for all diabetes sufferers .
The transplant procedure may not be suitable for some diabetics and others may still have to take insulin injections ( although not as frequently ) .
In 2005 , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that about 7 percent of the American population ( 20.8 million people ) had diabetes ( types 1 and 2 ) — and 6.2 million of them were unaware of it .
About 21 percent of the U.S. diabetes patients are 60 years of age or older .
The World Health Organization estimates that more than 171 million people have diabetes worldwide .
MicroIslet has tested their procedure on normal rodents and those with defective immune systems and is currently studying potential toxicity side effects .
" Initial rodent studies were designed to look at the efficacy and duration of the implants , " says Amaresh Basu , MicroIslet 's vice president of research and development .
Primate porcine - islet xenotransplantation trials are also underway .
While the prospect of porcine islet transplants holds much promise and " is one of the best options for ( type 1 diabetes ) treatment , " the biggest obstacle will come from the human immune system 's willingness to accept the new cells , says Ewan McNay , an assistant professor of internal medicine specializing in endocrinology at Yale University 's School of Medicine in New Haven , Conn .
" This is the case with any transplant surgery , " adds McNay , who studies the effects of transplantation more generally .
" Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease to begin with , so it 's likely those stem cells will face the same problems that the original pancreas had . "
MicroIslet is hoping to begin human xenotransplantation trials by the end of the year .
Candidates for the procedure will be diabetes patients who have received kidney transplants .
" These are people who are encountering the same problems that attacked their original kidney , " Hoffman says .
Pig insulin is a good candidate for xenotransplantation to humans because it differs from human insulin by only a single amino acid .
Although the Food and Drug Administration has approved porcine organ xenotransplants , it is still unclear how long these new islets can remain functional in a human body , Hoffman says .
" If they lasted six months to a year , '' he says , " you could have treatment at those intervals . "
Daniel Henninger notes that there is a worldwide “ throw the bums out ” trend .
In Japan , the UK , and here in the U.S. , it is n’t a good time to be an incumbent .
As for the U.S. , he observes :
In the U.S. , political handicappers are predicting heavy Democratic losses in the House next November .
This just four years after ending GOP control of Congress in the 2006 elections and two years after sweeping into office Barack Obama and his Democratic partners .
Congress ’s approval rating remains stuck around 30 % .
This number may be more important as an indicator of public sentiment toward the nation ’s leadership than presidential approval .
Some search for an ideological trend toward the left or right in these votes , but the only evident trend is to strike out at whichever blob is currently in power .
Even as Americans turned over their country to liberal Democrats , opinion polls showed that the British people were turning toward the Conservatives for relief from listless Labour .
His take is that this is a revolt against indebtedness , caused by the orgy of spending and the silent creep of entitlements and accompanied by a squeeze in payroll taxes .
Ordinary voters are left with the sense that no one is really responsible for the whole mess .
So , he explains , “ national electorates are attempting accountability by voting whole parties out of power . ”
The irony is great , of course .
The “ hope and change ” Obama has joined the status quo of debt - mongers while a worldwide grassroots movement , populist and suspicious of the big - government solutions that Obama and his European fan club tout , may sweep this crowd out before they ’ve unpacked .
It turns out that “ change ” meant something else to the electorate , at least in the U.S. , than what it did to Obama .
He set out to change the relationship between the private and public sectors , between citizens and their government .
The public just wants government to be accountable and cease gobbling up a greater and greater share of the nation ’s wealth .
If Obama does n’t understand and address the sort of change American voters want , he and his party will also be swept out in the tide of public anger .
Getting a peek at that anger this summer must have been a sobering sight — if he could spot it all the way from Martha ’s Vineyard .
And if he missed the sneak preview , the 2010 elections will be harder to ignore .
FEW things will ruin an Easter break more effectively than discovering your luggage has n't taken the same trip .
Sadly , figures from the Association of European Airlines suggest that airlines are losing more luggage than before .
Last year 16.6 bags were delayed for every 1,000 passengers across 25 European airlines , up from 15.7 in 2006 .
( This excludes no -frills carriers such as EasyJet , and some bigger carriers , which do not report their statistics . )
Perhaps avoid TAP Air Portugal , which mislaid nearly 28 bags for every 1,000 passengers .
British Airways is the most careless of the big operators , mainly because many of its trips involve connecting flights .
The canny traveller could instead opt for Turkish Airlines or Air Malta .

Romney dopped out saying he hated to lose , and that he loves America .

Romney ends bid , eyeing 2012
The presidential race Mitt Romney planned for years crashed to a halt Thursday , stopped in its tracks by the surprisingly durable John McCain campaign and by Romney 's failure to quell concerns about his shifts on key issues , his political persona and his Mormon religion .
Making the dramatic announcement at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference at a Washington hotel , Romney clearly hoped to preserve the goodwill of his party for another possible bid in 2012 .
He intends to run again in four years , according to a senior member of his inner circle .

" He should be president .
2012 , " the confidant e-mailed after talking to Romney .
Asked if Romney will run again , another close adviser said , " He ’ll consider it .
He 's keeping his options open . "
Romney framed his departure as one of duty to party and country .
“ If I fight on in my campaign , all the way to the convention , I would forestall the launch of a national campaign and make it more likely that Sen. Clinton or Obama would win , ” he said .
" And in this time of war , I simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror . ”
Disbelieving young supporters yelled " No ! " and " Fight on ! " and booed when Romney got to the end of his speech and explained his decision .
Romney suspended his campaign rather than officially end it in order to continue to represent the interests of his delegates , said spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom .
" We want to make sure that the governor 's principles are reflected in the platform and at the convention .
We have a number of pledged delegates and we do n't want to completely abandon them .
But we 're not laboring under unrealistic expectations that governor Romney might magically become the Republican nominee . "
McCain would respond to Romney 's decision with a " gracious recognition " in his own CPAC speech later in the day , an aide said .
Fehrnstrom said the surprise announcement began to take shape at a senior staff meeting Wednesday morning , when Romney had made no final decision but said he wanted to " do what was best for the party . "
Romney then went home to write his CPAC speech , talked to his family and the CPAC address " became a farewell speech , " Fehrnstrom said .
Top staff found out when drafts of the speech were circulated Wednesday night .
The entire staff was informed by campaign manager Beth Myers just before Romney took the stage .
A close Romney adviser said family and longtime aides and advisers wanted him to fight on .
They all pressed the 1976 scenario where Ronald Reagan dogged President Gerald Ford to the GOP convention .
But Romney himself brought up the issue that was central to his Thursday speech :
The nation is at war .
Josh Romney , one of the former governor ’s five sons , said his dad sounded upbeat and strong when he called family members Wednesday night to tell them of the decision .
“ He felt that he still had a shot at winning the nomination , ” Josh Romney said .
“ But for the good of the party and the nation , he did n’t want to have a long , drawn - out battle . ”
In taking the action , Romney was essentially conceding to McCain , a nemesis who clashed bitterly with him repeatedly at debates and had looked for much of last year like an also - ran who would not be much of an obstacle .
Instead , McCain ’s rag - tag campaign caught fire in New Hampshire — literally Romney ’s backyard , since he owns a summer place there — and quickly built momentum despite longtime hostility from the conservative establishment .
“ This is not an easy decision for me .
I hate to lose , ” Romney said .
“ My family , my friends and our supporters — many of you right here in this room — have given a great deal to get me where I have a shot at becoming president .
If this were only about me , I would go on .
But I entered this race because I love America , and because I love America , I feel I must now stand aside , for our party and for our country . ”
GOP operatives said Romney was acknowledging a bitter reality .
" Numerically it was n’t there , " said Jason Roe , a former Romney aide and veteran Republican strategist .
" We ’re are a point now where the Democrats are going to be tearing each other apart for seven weeks , so Republicans actually have an opportunity to unite behind one candidate . "
Romney 's announcement followed his disappointing showing in the Super Tuesday contests , where he had tried to convince voters that he was the true conservative in the race and that McCain did not share their values .
The son of a Michigan governor , Romney had developed his own public profile as head of the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City , which he helped rescue after they got off to a scandal - marred start .
In the CPAC remarks , he vowed to continue his public profile , saying : “ Look forward to joining with you many more times in the future . "
“ I will continue to stand for conservative principles ; I will fight alongside you for all the things we believe in , ” he said .
“ And one of those things is that we cannot allow the next president of the United States to retreat in the face of evil extremism . ”
The most buttoned - down of this year ’s candidates succumbed to the chaos of one of the nation ’s least predictable presidential elections as well as to an enduring perception in GOP circles that he had undergone a convenient conservative conversion after governing in Massachusetts as a moderate .
Romney methodically raised more than $ 53 million and put in $ 36 million more of his own as he attempted to build a state - of - the - art operation that would put himself in a position to succeed President Bush at a time when the party had no heir apparent .
But Romney quickly learned that politics is not as rational as the financial deals that made him wealthy as founder of Bain Capital .
Romney had three chief challenges : his Mormon faith , what critics saw as flip - flops on key issues and his failure to connect .
All crystallized in a bad Iowa loss that presaged his ultimate failure .
Romney 's campaign never got a lift in national polls and struggled consistently in the early - voting states where he was banking on gaining momentum .
His leadership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints was a constant distraction and somewhat of a hindrance in the South , where many evangelicals regard members of his church with suspicion and even hostility .
But “ the Mormon thing , ” as Romney aides called it , was just one factor among a host of reasons that Romney never caught fire .
He came off as robotic , brushing off advice from aides to show more of his emotion in speeches .
Ironically , his presidential looks and bearing turned into a drawback because he looked so perfect that the touchy voters of Iowa and New Hampshire never warmed up to him .
Instead , the more casual , human styles of McCain and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee electrified voters in New Hampshire and Iowa , respectively , leaving Romney literally out in the cold as he campaigned doggedly but to limited effect .
Christian conservative activists in Iowa rejected Romney and chose one of their own because Huckabee had everything Romney did not : a shared faith , a consistent record on social issues and personality and background his audience could relate to .
In New Hampshire , Romney tried to pivot back to a " change " and Washington outsider message that he had begun in the fall .
But he had only an extended weekend after Iowa to make the transition and McCain had been waiting in New Hampshire for months , building support .
Romney found his voice in Michigan , where he scored a decisive win , but it still was not enough .
Florida became the showdown , the first closed primary where all the top combatants would clash .
And Romney lost decisively , by nearly 100,000 votes .
From day one , his advisers knew his biggest vulnerability would be the charge that he was a flip - flopper — that he was at heart a moderate Republican , as he had run in Massachusetts and had shifted to hard - right stances in recent years out of political expediency .
As Romney geared up to court the conservative electorate that determines Republican presidential nominations , he took a more restrictive position on abortion , and changed his mind about the use of stem cells in research , conforming his views to those of the party ’s more conservative elements .
On the stump , he became strident in his opposition to illegal immigration and said he would “ double ” the detention facility for suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The changes in position haunted Romney and gave McCain , in particular , a stick with which to club him .
For the entire first half of last year , McCain aides doggedly and successfuly drove a message , with the help of YouTube and old news clippings , that Romney had changed his stance on most every consequential issue .
The rap stuck .
The flip - flops especially hurt Romney later in the campaign , when McCain surged ahead .
Because of his own impure past , Romney was unable to get off any clean shots at McCain , who had bucked the party line himself at times .
" He had to spend $ 45 million just to get known nationally , " said a close Romney adviser .
" A lot of people wanted him to take harder shots at McCain , and he was n't willing to do it .
...
The reality is that the conservatives rallied around him too late . "
While Romney 's decision makes McCain the de facto nominee , the Arizona senator still has work cut out for him , as Romney backers were n't streaming to jump on board .
South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint , an early Romney supporter and his top backer in the Palmetto State , said : " I ’m terribly disappointed , but I think it was very classy and selfless to realize the way Republicans are headed . "
Would he endorse McCain ? " I ’ll wait and make that decision later . "
Could he support McCain ?
" If he ’s the nominee I defintely will . "
American Conservative Union president David Keene , another Romney backer said Romney 's decision " was very difficult — to look at the delegate totals and think you could turn it around . "
McCain ?
" That 's premature .
I think John McCain has an opportunity now becuse he has the time to begin putting together the conservative support he ’s going to need . "

Poor O'Reilly , he was n't able to do what his big ego wanted to and he got all upset .
Here 's some of BillO 's meltdown with an Obama staffer in NH .
It 's probably after most of the ruckus that occurred between the two was over .
I do n't know who the man in the glasses is , but he obviously did n't like O'Reilly 's antics either .
Q : Sir , sir , you do not want to do that .
O'Reilly : You sonofabitch .
Yea , that 's really low class pal .
That 's really low class .
Everybody in the world can see it .
Hey Senator , a word please ?
Senator , a word please ?
Senator , we came all the way to see you .
Talk about being just a bit " unhinged . "
In developing the HAppS example that I have been posting here , I came upon a problem that gave me new insight to Haskell .
I do n't think it was a particularly deep insight , but it is significant to me as someone new to the language , and new to type inference .
Consider a user authentication function that retrieves a map from the reader monad , looks up a username , and compares the password retrieved with a passed in parameter .
I first implemented this function something like this :
This post has been a long time coming .
It ’s a combination of my distrust for JavaScript CSS selector performance analysis and my disdain for the CSS 3 Selector specification .
To start , I want to give a little bit of history regarding jQuery ’s selector engine .
When I first started working on its implementation it was mid-2005 .
It was mostly done as a personal challenge to myself – implementing a specification for kicks .
You can see some of my early thoughts in a post that I wrote on Selectors in JavaScript .
I completed my implementation on the same day as the first , other , JavaScript CSS selector engine : cssQuery .
I then held of and merged it with some of my other efforts , which eventually resulted in jQuery .
When I first implemented the engine , I went for full CSS 3 compliance ( mashing in XPath - capable queries , as well ) .
Fast - forward 7 months and jQuery is starting to get a capable community .
In preparation for jQuery 1.0 I decide to analyze the features of the engine to see what people are actually using .
I ran a poll ( which , unfortunately , has been lost ) in which I asked the users which selectors they used .
As it turned out there were a great number that no - one had any use for , whatsoever ( and , in fact , this remains true to this day ) .
At this point I removed them from the engine , breaking compliance with the CSS 3 Selector spec .
Here ’s some of the selectors that were removed :
E:root – Rarely used in HTML .
You already know what the root node is – it ’s named ‘ html ’ .
E:empty –
This might be useful if it could include empty whitespace text nodes , but it does n’t .
This will only match elements like < img / > and < hr / > , for whatever use that is .
E:lang ( fr ) –
This could be achieved in so many other ways – but in the end , how many multi - language - on - the - same - page sites are there ?
E:nth - of - type(n ) – I ’m not sure what the motivation was for creating all the - of - type methods , I ’m sure it sounded great on paper , but in the world of HTML it ’s not very useful .
E:nth - last - child(n ) – Another “ great on paper ” method .
Do n’t think I ’ve ever seen it used .
E:nth - last - of - type(n )
E:first - of - type
E:last - of- type
E:only - of - type
E:only - child –
When does this occur ?
and why would you need to select it ?
E ~ F – Only selects adjacent elements , in one direction .
Why a ~ ?
Why only one direction ?
E + F – Only the next element – rarely useful .
E[ foo~ = ” bar ” ] – Only matches values in a space - separated list .
This is only useful for classes ( which is taken care of with .class ) and the ref attribute .
Why not just use *=?
E[hreflang|= ” en ” ] –
Another selector that is really only useful for a single attribute – and not a popular one , at that .
What ’s fascinating is that no one has ever , ever , requested that these features be added back in .
They have virtually zero real - world use and applicability .
In fact , with the exception of “ E + F ” all of these selectors were added , exclusively , in the CSS 3 specification .
I ’m not completely sure what the thought process was in selecting them , but it ’s pretty obvious that it was n’t grounded in application , but in theory ( which is n’t really the spec- writers fault , considering that there were very few CSS 2 - compatible implementations at the time ) .
Only later , after performance test suites started to arrive , did people start to care about the existence of – and the performance of – these selectors ( and hence why selectors like + , ~ , and [ foo~=bar ] now exist in jQuery ) .
To compensate for the shoddy offering of current CSS selectors , JavaScript libraries have had to write whole supersets of selector functionality to compensate for missing features .
For example , jQuery includes both new selectors ( such as “ : hidden ” and “ : has ( ) ” ) and new selector methods ( like “ .parent ( ) ” and “ . prev ( ) ” ) – all of which provide the user which phenomenally more functionality and clarity than the what is in CSS 3 .
Now , I ’m sure I ’ll probably get lots of feedback saying “ but ‘ E + F ’ can be useful , look at this example ” or “ of course ~= is useful , you can use it on rel attributes ” – that ’s not the point .
The fact is that they are woefully un-used .
To the point that they are a burden upon the implementors of the specification .
What ’s the point of implementing the above features – or more importantly : optimizing the above features for speed – if no one is using them .
Which leads me to my next bone to pick :
Performance is n’t Compliance
Everyone and their brother seems to use the SlickSpeed selector speed test suite .
That ’s fine , as far as implementation goes it ’s a pretty good take on the matter .
It runs quickly , spits out pretty results – users love it .
However , it ’s doing two things – and that ’s one thing too many :
It ’s testing for both performance AND compliance of the selector engines .
For example , if a user were to run the tests and see poor performance for , oh say , : nth - child ( 2n+1 ) , they would be shocked , nay , appalled at the overall performance of that selector engine .
But here ’s the rub :
That ’s from a selector that is virtually un-used .
( : nth - child is occasionally useful , in and of itself , but the An+B syntax is virtually worthless ) .
But this is a point on which SlickSpeed does not care – since it ’s also testing for compliance , in addition to performance , all tests are treated equally and “ without bias . ”
However , that ’s precisely what is n’t needed : Selectors require bias .
I ’ve often argued that the speed of an ID selector is far more important than the speed of an attribute selector ( for example ) because of how commonly it ’s used .
However , up until this point I ’ve never had data to back up this claim .
I have resolved that .
I present to you the most commonly used CSS selectors used by jQuery from 59 of the most popular jQuery - using sites ( which was borrowed from the featured sites list ) .
( Fun fact :
The use of $ ( DOMElement ) was more popular than all other selectors combined . )
Here ’s a small selection of the selectors found :
Selector % Used # of Uses #id 51.290 % 1431 .class 13.082 % 365 tag 6.416 % 179 tag.class 3.978 % 111 #id tag 2.151 % 60 tag#id 1.935 % 54 #id : visible 1.577 % 44 #id .class 1.434 % 40 .class .class 1.183 % 33 * 0.968 % 27 #id tag.class 0.932 % 26 #id : hidden 0.789 % 22 tag[ name=value ] 0.645 % 18 .class tag 0.573 % 16 [ name=value ] 0.538 % 15 tag tag 0.502 % 14 #id #id 0.430 % 12 #id tag tag 0.358 % 10
View the rest of the selectors with a full explanation …
I spidered the JavaScript of all the sites , parsed through them , and found the appropriate selectors to compile the list .
Here ’s some things that I learned from the data :
There does n’t seem to be a correlation between performance and selector use .
For example , “ .class ” is far more popular than “ tag.class ” even though the second one is much more performant .
What ’s especially important about this is that the degree of performance hit is n’t that much of an issue .
For example , the difference between 4ms and 30ms is virtually imperceptible .
Instead there is an overwhelming trend towards simpler selectors .
Obviously , user education could help , but it ’s unclear as to how much that will change things in the end .
A couple of jQuery ’s custom selectors are immensely popular : : visible , : hidden , and : selected .
However it is unclear as to how useful they would be outside of a JavaScript - based CSS selector engine ( there ’s no real point in styling a hidden element ) .
A bunch of jQuery ’s convenience selectors : : checkbox , : radio , :input , etc. would be quite useful , within a CSS selector spec – and it ’s good to see them in wide use here .
There ’s a bunch of unexpected queries that are used : “ * ” , “ .class .class ” , “ [ name=value ] ” , and “ #id #id ” .
These types of queries are grossly under - represented in current performance test suites .
… there ’s one thing that needs to be taken from all of this data , though : Speed test suites need to test reality rather than specification .
I ’m perfectly ok with having two completely separate suites , one focusing on speed and one focusing on compliance , however mixing them does no one any favors :
Users get a confused perception and suite authors ( and browser vendors ! ) waste time dealing with optimizing things that do n’t matter .
My proposal : A standardized performance suite ( based on SlickSpeed , is fine ) but populating the tests with comparable selectors to the ones shown above and weighted based upon their relevance .
Thus , the speed of the #id selector should , actually , consume 51.29 % of the total final score .
This means that being 3 x faster at this test would actually be 102x more important than becoming 3 x faster at “ tag tag ” .
This is absolutely not represented in any , current , test suites and needs to be rectified .
Of course , I ’ll be happy to seed my selector list with results from other popular sites of other selector libraries .
I ’ll be fine constructing this suite , as well – I just want to make sure that there ’s enough interest .
I think this proposal has a lot of merit and should be strongly considered – the result will be a selector performance suite which will benefit everyone .
In case a US ally has been invaded and occupied by the other nation under false premises , and the invaders were unwanted by the local population , do not they have the right to resist that occupation ?
Unquestionably , the solution is Yes ; this kind of person would be hailed as a freedom fighter .

Started in 2005 , Startup costs : $ 6,000
When July hit Miami in 1998 , everyone seemed to be enjoying the dog days of summer -- except the dogs .
As owners took giant swigs from their 32 - ounce water bottles , their dogs ran to and fro , wearily retrieving makeshift toys in the afternoon heat .
It was on one sunny afternoon in July that Carlotta Lennox rolled by a park on a pair of rollerblades , noticed that the dogs looked tired and hungry , and realized how she could give the day back to the dogs .
Seven years later , the first Hey Buddy pet vending machine was established in Bark Park Central , an off - leash dog park in Dallas .
Lennox , 36 , stocked the machine with dog treats , tennis balls , dog shirts , dog glasses -- basically everything a dog might need for a walk in the park .
And with its shingled roof and slated facade , the doghouse - inspired vending machine was hard to miss -- which meant pets and their owners were n't the only ones begging Lennox for more .

Mr. Wahid did not say how much the plant between Karbala and Najaf would cost , but at standard international prices a plant of the scale he described would be worth roughly $ 200 million to $ 300 million .

Baghdad and the rest of Iraq still suffer from shortages of electricity .
Credit ... Michael Kamber for The New York Times
The outlines of all three agreements were confirmed by Thamir Ghadban , an expert on energy who is also director of the committee of advisers to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki .
But Mr. Ghadban said that the granting of the huge projects to rivals of the United States was not an indication that American companies were being excluded from consideration now that Iraqi oil revenues , which provide the basis for the Iraqi government ’s budget , are largely paying for the reconstruction of the grid .
“ There is no preference to the Iranians , ” Mr. Ghadban said , citing the most obvious potential point of sensitivity for the United States .
“ There is no opposition or stance from the Iraqi government to bar American or Western companies .
It is the other way around , ” Mr. Ghadban said , indicating that he urged American contractors to bid for work in Iraq .
Of the two new projects Iraq has agreed to finance , Mr. Wahid said , the largest is a $ 940 million power plant in Wasit to be built by a Chinese company , which he said was named Shanghai Heavy Industry .
That project would pump some 1,300 megawatts of electricity into the Iraqi grid .
For comparison , all of the plants currently connected to Iraq ’s grid produce a total of roughly 5,000 megawatts .
He said that Iraq had already spent $ 12 million leveling the ground in preparation for the Chinese plant .
The Sadr City project , which will include a small refinery , will cost $ 150 million and be built by an Iranian company , Sunir , Mr. Wahid said .
That plant is expected to produce about 160 megawatts of electricity .
The Iraqi Electricity Ministry , which Mr. Wahid heads , is one of the few in the central government that has received praise for successfully spending much of the money allocated to it in the Iraqi budget for reconstruction projects .
Because of security problems , a shortage of officials who are skilled at writing and executing contracts , and endemic corruption , many of the ministries have either left their rebuilding money unspent or poured it into projects that have had a marginal impact on the quality of life for Iraqi citizens .
WASHINGTON ( Medill News Service ) -- Denise and Marvin Shaw did everything right .
They both had good jobs , a nice home in Virginia and excellent health insurance through Denise 's Fortune 500 employer .
In the middle of a national health - care crisis , the Shaw's were secure and unafraid .
But in just over a year , and through no fault of their own , everything changed .
Their story illustrates the pervasiveness of the health - care problem in America -- even for those who have access to health insurance , the slightest wrong move not only threatens peace of mind , but a family 's economic security .
It all began in 2006 when Denise , a 37 - year - old Web developer from Chantilly , Va. , was laid off from her job .
She and Marvin fell back on the insurance program designed to tide people over in such situations , Cobra .
Cobra , an acronym for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act , the federal law authorizing the program , requires insurers to provide temporary coverage to individuals who have left group insurance plans , often after losing their jobs .
Cobra always costs more for the same coverage .
In their case , Denise was stunned to learn that their costs would go from $ 350 to $ 780 per month .
" My husband and I knew that we were getting , as my doctor likes to call it , the Cadillac plan , " Shaw said .
" So we said , let 's just stay with it for 18 months and then we 'll get our own plan . "
At the time , the couple could have received coverage from Marvin 's small company 's plan , Shaw said , but it was " a bare - bones HMO , " and they would have paid the same monthly fee .
Following her layoff , Shaw decided to work for herself instead of going to another large company .
She did not think getting reasonably priced insurance would be a big problem .
But by the time the Cobra coverage expired in September , she had spent months desperately searching for a replacement .
The Shaws decided to apply to Aetna because that 's what they had when she worked for the Fortune 500 company .
" They had all our medical records -- it should be easy , no problem , " Denise said .
No coverage to be found
But no problem soon became no insurance as Aetna , and then company after company , refused to cover Shaw because she had two preexisting conditions : allergy - induced asthma and a benign pituitary tumor .
Treatment for both conditions had been covered , without exception , under her previous plan .
As a last resort , the couple tried to get insured through Marvin 's HMO plan .
But they were told they could n't enroll until February , then five months away .
They were stuck , uninsured and uninsurable .
Shaw felt punished simply for receiving necessary health care .
Had she not gotten treatment for her asthma , for instance , future insurance companies would n't have labeled it a " preexisting condition . "
She would have been considered lower - risk and her premiums likely would have been lower .
Relatively speaking , Shaw is healthy .
She has never been hospitalized for her asthma , a condition shared by 22.2 million Americans , according to the American Lung Association .
The tumor on her pituitary glad disappeared with medication , which Shaw continues to take daily to prevent its return .
" That 's what really bugs me , " she said .
" This is n't like lung cancer .
It never even occurred to me that ( the tumor ) could be an issue because it was benign . "
Once Shaw's Cobra coverage expired , there was one hope :
Under federal law , for 63 days after a person 's health insurance benefits expire , any insurance company they apply to must agree to offer coverage .
The price , however , is left up to the individual health insurance providers .
The companies that eventually offered the Shaws coverage did so at devastatingly high rates .
Aetna , for example , gave them two options : a $ 2,400 per month premium with a $ 1,000 deductible , or a $ 2,500 deductible for $ 1,800 a month .
" I said , unless you 're going to turn around and send that money to BBT Mortgage , no , sorry , " she said .
After those 63 days , Shaw would have become uninsurable .
Because of her status as a provider " risk , " unless she got another full - time job with a company that provided group benefits , she was unfit to be insured .
A costly solution
After a scary six - week period during which they were uninsured , the Shaws eventually did find coverage .
Mega Life and Health Insurance Co. , a provider Shaw found through a networking group , offered them coverage for just under $ 800 a month -- with a $ 10,000 deductible .
The original deductible on their Aetna plan was $ 500 a month .
Over 18 months , then , the Shaws ' health insurance costs increased by more than $ 5,000 per year , over $ 100,000 over 20 years .
And if a medical emergency arises ?
" I 'm still trying to figure that out , " Shaw said .
" Basically , we 'll have to depend on the hospital taking a payment plan , at this point .
I do n't know how we 'll do it . "
Their struggles with health insurance changed their lives forever .
After the new year , Shaw said , she 'll consider taking on a second job , in case she ever needs to foot a $ 10,000 health care bill .
" It 's funny , " Shaw said .
" I think if I knew then what I know now , would I do things differently ( and forego treatment ) ?
I do n't really know the answer . "
" That 's pretty much how I feel : stuck .
I never want to be in the same boat again . "
The Sharper Image , the 31 - year - old purveyor of futuristic adult gadgetry like $ 5,000 massage chairs and $ 300 robotic vacuum cleaners , has filed for bankruptcy protection after years of slipping sales , stiffening competition and image problems over its Ionic Breeze air purifiers .
The retailer will still operate at least some of its 184 stores as it tries to pay off debts to a long list of creditors , like U.P.S. ( owed $ 6 million ) and Garmin , the maker of G.P.S. navigation systems ( owed $ 2 million ) .
Sharper Image , which began in 1977 as a catalog retailer selling jogging watches , quickly became a staple of the American mall , attracting crowds of curious customers who wanted to test  and occasionally buy  the exotic products in its stores .
Another catalog retailer , the housewares and trinkets seller Lillian Vernon , also filed for bankruptcy Wednesday , citing a decade of slumping business .
Catalog orders now account for less than 10 percent of the Sharper Image ’s sales , but taken together the two company ’s travails highlight the challenges of mail - order shopping in an era of big - box and online retailing .
From depths of Earth , a fault ’s secrets

A map of California shows the location of SAFOD .
L.A. Cicero Mark Zoback discusses samples from deep beneath the San Andreas Fault at a campus press event .
For the first time , geologists have extracted intact rock samples from 2 miles beneath the surface of the San Andreas Fault , the infamous rupture that runs 800 miles along the length of California .
Never before have scientists had available for study rock samples from deep inside one of the actively moving tectonic plate - bounding faults responsible for the world 's most damaging earthquakes .
Now , with this newly recovered material , scientists hope to answer long - standing questions about the fault 's composition and properties .
" This is a new beginning in earthquake science , " said Mark Zoback , the Benjamin M. Page Professor in Earth Sciences , during a press conference held on campus Oct. 4 to announce the retrieval of the samples .
Zoback is one of three co-principal investigators of the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ( SAFOD ) project , which is establishing the world 's first underground earthquake observatory .
William Ellsworth and Steve Hickman , geophysicists with the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) in Menlo Park , are the other co-principal investigators .
Altogether , the geologists retrieved 135 feet of 4 - inch diameter rock cores weighing roughly 1 ton .
They were brought to the surface through a research borehole drilled more than 2.5 miles into the Earth .
The last of the cores was brought to the surface in the predawn hours of Sept.
7 .
Several of the rock cores were on display at the press conference .
" It looks like something from a taffy pull , " Hickman said , referring to one core that had broken open to reveal its sheared , mangled interior created by pressures within the fault .
Scientists seeking to understand how the great faults bounding Earth 's vast tectonic plates evolve and generate earthquakes have always had to infer the processes through indirect means .
Until now , they could only work with samples of ancient faults exposed at the Earth 's surface after millions of years of erosion and uplift , together with computer simulations and laboratory experiments approximating what they think might be happening at the depths at which earthquakes occur .
" Now we can hold the San Andreas Fault in our hands , " Zoback said .
" We know what it 's made of .
We can study how it works . "
SAFOD , which first broke ground in 2004 , is a major research component of EarthScope , a National Science Foundation - funded program being carried out in collaboration with the USGS and NASA to investigate the forces that shape the North American continent and the physical processes controlling earthquakes and volcanic eruptions .
" This is tremendously exciting .
Obtaining cores from the actively slipping San Andreas Fault is truly unprecedented and will allow truly transformative research and discoveries , " said Kaye Shedlock , EarthScope program director at the National Science Foundation .
In the next phase of the experiment , the science team will install an array of seismic instruments in the 2.5 - mile - long borehole that runs from the Pacific plate on the west side of the fault into the North American plate on the east .
By placing sensors next to a zone that has been the source of many small temblors , scientists will be able to observe the earthquake generation process with unprecedented acuity .
They hope to keep the observatory operating for the next 10 to 20 years .
Studying the San Andreas Fault is important because , as Zoback noted , " The really big earthquakes occur on plate boundaries like the San Andreas Fault . "
The SAFOD site , located about 23 miles northeast of Paso Robles near the tiny town of Parkfield , sits on a particularly active section of the fault that moves regularly .
But it does not produce large earthquakes .
Instead , it moves in modest increments by a process called creep , in which the two sides of the fault slide slowly past each other , accompanied by occasional small quakes , most of which are not even felt at the surface .
One of the big questions the researchers seek to answer is how , when most of the fault moves in violent , episodic upheavals , can there be a section where the same massive tectonic plates seem , by comparison , to gently tiptoe past each other with the delicate tread of little cat feet ?
" There have been many theories about why the San Andreas Fault slides along so easily , none of which could be tested directly until now , " Hickman said .
Some posit the presence of especially slippery clays , called smectites .
Others suggest there may be high water pressure along the fault plane lubricating the surface .
Still others note the presence of a mineral called serpentine exposed in several places along the surface trace of the fault , which — if it existed at depth — could both weaken the fault and cause it to creep .
Zoback said the correlation between the occurrence of serpentine , a metamorphosed remnant of old oceanic crust , and the slippery nature of the fault motion in the area has been the subject of speculation for more than 40 years .
However , it has never been demonstrated that serpentine actually occurs along the active San Andreas at depth , and the mechanism by which serpentine might limber up the fault was unknown .
Then , in 2005 , when the SAFOD drill pierced the zone of active faulting using rotary drilling ( which grinds up the rock into tiny fragments ) , mineralogist Diane Moore of the USGS detected talc in the rock cuttings brought up to the surface .
This finding was published in the Aug. 16 , 2007 , issue of Nature .
" Talc is one of the slipperiest , weakest minerals ever studied , " Hickman said .
Might the same mineral that helps keep a baby 's bottom smooth also be smoothing the way for the huge tectonic plates ?
Chemically , it 's possible , for when serpentine is subjected to high temperatures in the presence of water containing silica , it forms talc .
Serpentine might also control how faults behave in other ways .
" Serpentine can dissolve in ground water as fault particles grind past each other and then crystallize in nearby open pore spaces , allowing the fault to creep even under very little pressure , " Hickman said .
The SAFOD borehole cored into two active traces of the fault this summer , both contained within a broad fault " zone " about 700 feet wide .
The deeper of the two active fault zones , designated 10830 for its distance in feet from the surface as measured along the curving borehole , yielded an 8 - foot - long section of very fine - grained powder called fault gouge .
Such gouge is common in fault zones and is produced by the grinding of rock against rock .
" What is remarkable about this gouge is that it contains abundant fragments of serpentine that appear to have been swept up into the gouge from the adjacent solid rock , " Hickman said .
" The serpentine is floating around in the fault gouge like raisins in raisin pudding . "
The only way to know what role serpentine , talc or other exotic minerals play in controlling the behavior of the San Andreas Fault is to study the SAFOD core samples in the laboratory .
" To an earthquake scientist , these cores are like the Apollo moon rocks , " Hickman said .
" Scientists from around the world are anxious to get their hands on them in the hope that they can help solve the mystery of how this major , active plate boundary works . "
Will these new samples allow scientists to predict earthquakes ?
The short answer is no .
But research on these samples could provide clues to answer the question of whether earthquakes are predictable .
The observatory will allow scientists to begin to address whether there are precursory phenomena occurring within the fault zone .
The other fault zone , called 10480 , contains 3 feet of fault gouge .
It also produces small earthquakes at a location about 300 feet below the borehole .
" Remarkably , we observe the same earthquake rupturing at the same spot on the fault year after year , " Ellsworth said .
This repeating earthquake , always about a magnitude 2 , will be the focus of the observatory to be installed inside the fault in 2008 .
Sensitive seismometers and tiltmeters to be installed in the SAFOD borehole directly above the spot that ruptures will observe for the first time the birthing process of an earthquake from the zone where the earthquake energy accumulates .
Preliminary observations made in 2006 already have revealed the tiniest earthquakes ever observed — so small they have negative magnitudes .
In early December , a " sample party " will be held at the USGS office in Menlo Park , where the cores will be on display and scientists will offer their proposals to do research projects in a bid to be allowed to analyze part of the core .
Zoback said most of the initial testing will be nondestructive in order to preserve the samples for as long as possible .
" But then , some of the material will be made available for testing that simulates earthquakes and fault slip in the lab , " he said .
When not being examined , the core samples will be refrigerated and kept moist to prevent the cores and the fluid in them from being disturbed .
In addition to funding from the National Science Foundation , USGS and Stanford University , the SAFOD project also has been supported financially by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Snow fell on Baghdad on Friday for the first time in memory , and delighted residents declared it an omen of peace .
“ It is the first time we ’ve seen snow in Baghdad , ” said 60 - year - old Hassan Zahar .
“ We ’ve seen sleet before , but never snow .
I looked at the faces of all the people , they were astonished , ” he said .
“ A few minutes ago , I was covered with snowflakes .
In my hair , on my shoulders .
I invite all the people to enjoy peace , because the snow means peace , ” he said .
Traffic policeman Murtadha Fadhil , huddling under a balcony to keep dry , declared the snow “ a new sign of the new Iraq . ”
“ It ’s a sign of hope .
We hope Iraqis will purify their hearts and politicians will work for the prosperity of all Iraqis . ”
The streets of the capital were largely empty as big , thick , wet flakes fell on Friday morning , a weekend day in Iraq .
The temperature hovered around freezing and the snow mostly melted into grey puddles when it hit the ground .
But it was still lovely , said Mohanned Rahim , a baker : “ This snow will bring pleasure to the people of Iraq .
It ’s beautiful ! ”

Nine - times Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova has retaken Czech citizenship , which she lost when she defected from the former Czechoslovakia as an 18 - year - old .
Although she intends to retain her US citizenship , last year she told a Czech newspaper that she was now as ashamed of George Bush 's America as she once was of the communist regime of her homeland .
" The thing is , we elected Bush , " she said .
" That is worse !
Against that , nobody chose a communist government in Czechoslovakia . "
Strong words , but can one really compare the Czechoslovakia of 1975 with the United States of today ?
Czechoslovakia , 1975 : Despite widespread discontent with the oppressive Husak regime , a 1974 study finds active support for the government in 15 % of the population , identified as pensioners , party bureaucrats , careerists , " parasites " , extremist ideologues and persons involved in the Stalinist repression who fear that liberalisation might force them to account for their crimes .
US , 2008 : George Bush 's approval ratings generally hover around 30 % , although one recent poll put it as low as 19 % .
Czechoslovakia , 1975 : Free healthcare available to all citizens .
US , 2008 : 47 million Americans ( 16 % of the population ) have no health insurance .
Another 16 million are " underinsured " .
Czechoslovakia , 1975 : Despite an increased standard of living and the widespread availability of material goods , consumerism is failing to placate a population fed up with draconian political controls .
US , 2008 : Despite a rise in the cost of living , consumerism continues to placate a population largely oblivious to the curtailment of its freedoms .
Czechoslovakia , 1975 : Growth of " net material product " is at an annual average of 5.7 % , exceeding the target rate of 5.1 % set out in the fifth Five - Year Plan .
Full employment .
US , 2008 : Energy Information Administration this week predicted negative growth in the two forthcoming financial quarters , the official definition of recession .
101,000 private - sector jobs were lost in February alone .
Czechoslovakia , 1975 : The granting of visas to foreigners is " arbitrary " , with denials justified under the " defence of national security " , according to dissidents .
US , 2008 : The American government uses the Patriot Act to bar entry to foreign visitors on the basis of ideology , according to the American Civil Liberties Union .
Czechoslovakia , 1975 : Torture , though not officially sanctioned , has become a covert tool of state policy .
US , 2008 : Torture officially sanctioned .
A British research team led by the world 's leading heart surgeon has grown part of a human heart from stem cells for the first time .
If animal trials scheduled for later this year prove successful , replacement tissue could be used in transplants for the hundreds of thousands of people suffering from heart disease within three years .
Sir Magdi Yacoub , a professor of cardiac surgery at Imperial College London , has worked on ways to tackle the shortage of donated hearts for transplant for more than a decade .
His team at the heart science centre at Harefield hospital have grown tissue that works in the same way as the valves in human hearts , a significant step towards the goal of growing whole replacement hearts from stem cells .
According to the World Health Organisation , 15 million people died of cardiovascular disease in 2005 ; by 2010 , it is estimated that 600,000 people around the world will need replacement heart valves .
" You can see the common pathway of death and suffering is heart failure , " said Prof Yacoub .
" Reversing heart failure could have a major impact . "
Growing replacement tissue from stem cells is one of the principal goals of biology .
If a damaged part of the body can be replaced by tissue that is genetically matched to the patient , there is no chance of rejection .
So far , scientists have grown tendons , cartilages and bladders , but none of these has the complexity of organs , which are three - dimensional structures of dozens of different types of cells .
To crack the problem , Prof Yacoub assembled a team of physicists , biologists , engineers , pharmacologists , cellular scientists and clinicians .
Their task - to characterise how every bit of the heart works - has so far taken 10 years .
The progress of his team and that of colleagues around the world will be published in August in a special edition of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society .
Prof Yacoub said his team 's latest work had brought the goal of growing a whole , beating human heart closer .
" It is an ambitious project but not impossible .
If you want me to guess I 'd say 10 years .
But experience has shown that the progress that is happening nowadays makes it possible to achieve milestones in a shorter time .
I would n't be surprised if it was some day sooner than we think . "
Currently , many people suffering from heart valve disease have artificial replacement valves .
Though they save lives , the artificial valves are far from perfect .
They perform none of the more sophisticated functions of living tissue , children need their valves replaced as they grow , and patients need a lifetime of drugs to prevent complications after surgery .
" The way a living valve functions , it anticipates haemodynamic events and responds and changes its shape and size .
It 's completely different from an artificial valve which will just open and shut .
The heart muscle itself will appreciate something which will make it free to contract properly , " said Prof Yacoub .
Adrian Chester , one of the lead scientists at the Harefield centre , has focused on characterising the valves in the heart .
" You have mediators in blood or released locally in the valve that can make parts of the valve contract and relax .
That work has then extended into looking at the incidence of nerves in the valve - these can cause the types of contractions and relaxations in a very specific way . "
By using chemical and physical nudges , the scientists first coaxed stem cells extracted from bone marrow to grow into heart valve cells .
By placing these cells into scaffolds made of collagen , Dr Chester and his colleague Patricia Taylor then grew small 3 cm - wide discs of heart valve tissue .
Later this year , that tissue will be implanted into animals - probably sheep or pigs - and monitored to see how well it works as part of a circulatory system .
If that trial works well , Prof Yacoub is optimistic that the replacement heart tissue , which can be grown into the shape of a human heart valve using specially - designed collagen scaffolds , could be used in patients within three to five years .
Growing a suitably - sized piece of tissue from a patient 's own stem cells would take around a month but he said that most people would not need such individualised treatment .
A store of ready - grown tissue made from a wide variety of stem cells could provide good matches for the majority of the population .
Prof Yacoub 's inspiration has come not only from other scientists but also from an unexpected source - the celebrated British artist , Antony Gormley , who has donated a sculpture to the heart science centre .
" We need a lot of experts from different fields but we also need a lot of imagination and a lot of understanding of how form interacts with function , " said Prof Yacoub .
" Art gives a lot of inspiration and beauty .
And beauty is part of science . "
Mr Gormley , who has also contributed to the upcoming special issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society with an article on the relationship between form and function in sculpture , said he admired the universalism with which Prof Yacoub approached his work .
" He manages to do the Robin Hood job in a very important way for the benefit of all humanity .
I found in him a fellow traveller in terms of trying to do things at the fringes of the possible with the highest levels of input in terms of technology and intelligence .
Everybody breathes air , everybody pumps blood . "
Yesterday , March 13 , 2008 , the US Department of the Treasury released the new $ 5 bills into circulation .
The new $ 5 bills were included among currency shipments from Federal Reserve to banks , which will distribute the money to customers and businesses .
People will start seeing these new bills as soon as this weekend .
Changes to the new $ 5 bill
Changes to the front :
There are several striking visual changes to the new $ 5 bill .
There is a splash of light purple next to Lincoln ’s portrait that fades to gray as it spreads toward the bill ’s edges .
To the right of Lincoln ’s portrait ( as you view the bill ) , there is an imprinting of The Great Seal of the United States .
Surrounding Lincoln ’s portrait and The Great Seal of the United States is a band of purple stars .
Changes to the back :
The most obvious changes to the back side of the $ 5 bill include a large purple “ 5 ” in the bottom right corner of the bill , small yellow “ 5 ” numerals on the back , and a multitude of changes to the micro-printing and other security features .
Security features of the new $ 5 bill
The descriptions of the security features are taken from the US Government press release for the new $ 5 bill .
Watermark :
There are now two watermarks on the redesigned $ 5 bill .
A large number “ 5 ” watermark is located to the right of the portrait , replacing the previous watermark portrait of President Lincoln found on older design $ 5 bills .
Its location is highlighted by a blank window incorporated into the background design .
A second watermark — a column of three smaller “ 5 ” s — has been added to the new $ 5 bill design and is positioned to the left of the portrait .
Security thread :
The embedded security thread , which is located to the left of the portrait on older - design $ 5 bills , has moved to the right of the portrait on the redesigned $ 5 bill .
The letters “ USA ” followed by the number “ 5 ” in an alternating pattern are visible along the thread from both sides of the bill .
The embedded security thread glows blue when held under ultraviolet light .

How We Manage Our Money on a Daily Basis
The First Patient By Dr. Sanjay Gupta
Chief Medical Correspondent
All week long , we will be talking about the health of the president .
This weekend , we will present " The First Patient " a special about this topic .
I am curious to know how important you think it is for the health of the patient to be divulged .
It has always seemed amazing to me that we are n't given more information about the physical and mental health of our candidates .
It is arguably one of the toughest and most important jobs in the world .
No question , the information we get today is better than in elections past .
John F. Kennedy denied he had Addison 's disease throughout his campaign , even though he was officially diagnosed and treated for it .
Franklin D. Roosevelt was essentially a dying man when he ran for his fourth term , even though most voters did n't realize it at the time .
Roosevelt 's doctors did n't even tell him he was suffering from congestive heart failure .
In 1992 , you may remember that Paul Tsongas was the first cancer survivor to run for office .
What was not known at the time was that Tsongas had a recurrence a year before the campaign .
His cancer was back again before he would 've been inaugurated .
So , what do we deserve to know and when should we know it ?
Tsongas for his part actually asked then - president Bill Clinton to create a commission that would require all candidates to release all of their medical records .
That never happened .
Last month , Sen . John McCain 's campaign released a summary of his records .
His staff has promised to release his full medical records should he receive the Republican nomination .
That 's important because the 71 year old McCain was diagnosed more than once with malignant skin cancer and would be the oldest president in our history .
As governor of Arkansas , Mike Huckabee weighed more than 280 pounds when he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes five years ago .
Through diet and exercise , the 52 - year - old Huckabee is now 110 pounds lighter and symptom free .
Sen. Hillary Clinton is 60 .
So far , she has n't reported any health problems .
Sen . Barack Obama , 46 , was a smoker , a habit that cuts an average of 11 years off life expectancy .
Obama has told us he has quit smoking and he can often be seen chewing Nicorette gum .
Does the health of the candidate matter to you and would you vote differently based on that information ?
Programming Note : Watch " The First Patient " Saturday and Sunday at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET ** update : due to coverage of the shootings at Northern Illinois University , " The First Patient " was pre-empted and has not yet been rescheduled .
We 'll keep you posted .**

We receive many comments on this blog each day ; not all are posted .
Our hope is that much will be learned from the sharing of useful information and personal experiences based on the medical and health topics of the blog .

But regardless of whether Nine is successful or not in an urgent appeal to overturn the order tomorrow , the program is likely to be available to anyone with an internet connection soon after it airs in other states at 8.30 pm tomorrow .
Alex Malik , a PhD researcher at the University of Technology , Sydney , who specialises in copyright infringement in the digital age , said the ban would be ineffectual due to the existence of fast broadband connections and the internet as a free and unregulated distribution tool .
He expected it would take less than 20 minutes for someone outside Victoria to upload the program to illegal file sharing sites after recording it using a computer or a personal video recorder connected to their TV set .
" Of course , what the ban and the court case has achieved is to increase interest in this TV show , " said Mr Malik , a former legal counsel for the Australian Recording Industry Association and a former senior legal officer at the Australian Communications and Media Authority .
" Victorian viewers will be searching the internet minutes after Underbelly ends and will be looking for this show that they were not supposed to see .
And as a result of the usage of BitTorrent and other peer - to - peer technology it is likely that they will find what they are looking for . "
In a similar case in 1995 , the Supreme Court banned the ABC from airing the docudrama Blue Murder in NSW for six years after it was shown throughout the rest of Australia .
The controversial show , which covered NSW police corruption and the Sydney underworld of the 1970s and ' 80s , was banned due to ongoing charges against the Sydney gangster Neddy Smith , who was portrayed in the show .
Smith was charged and later acquitted of the murder of Sydney prostitute and whistleblower Sallie - Anne Huckstep .
Blue Murder was a ratings hit for the ABC when it finally aired on NSW free - to - air TV in 2001 .
Pirated versions had already made it into the state before then but the distribution was cumbersome without today 's widespread broadband connections and easy to access file sharing sites .
A global study of TV show piracy , released by the British technology consultancy Envisional in 2005 , ranked Australia as the second largest downloader of TV programs after Britain .
Mr Malik said that while it was probably illegal for viewers to upload Underbelly to the internet , it was unlikely Nine would undertake any enforcement activity to stop them .
" They may be too busy enjoying the viral marketing buzz associated with internet TV show access , " he said .
Nine 's director of corporate communications , Arabella Gibson , said the network would not transmit or publish the series in Victoria but " we can only abide by the order which has been made in relation to Nine " .
Overview : A wheelchair - bound boy struggles through a world of corporate logos with the help of his newfound friend , a whistling booger from outer space .
Together , they enjoy zany antics that are fun for the whole retarded family and help the alien 's boil - covered family become official US citizens .
GO TEAM USA !!!
Directed By : Stewart Raffill ( 1988 ) The Case For :
The only reason I can think of to watch this movie would be to gape in awe and horror at the sheer amount of product placement that takes place .
Every scene brings another large company 's product to the forefront and tries lamely to mix it into a nonsensical , vomit - inducing plot .
Another thing that keeps you tuned in is wondering in what fantastical manner they will try to rip off ET ( and fail horribly ) next .
The Case Against : Despite the desperate plea by more than a few multinational corporations for you to love this movie , your reaction will be more one of hatred and disgust for the sentient , snot - like creatures that are supposed to tug at your heartstrings .
They tug at something , alright , but it 's more like that tug you get when you have to take a really big dump but there 's no toilet paper to be found so you end up with your pants down behind the local elementary school just as recess is getting out .
The movie 's main character in a dramatic pose from the opening fight sequence .
So dashing !
You know that book , the one where that holy guy creates a big space rock in the middle of nowhere ?
It 's sort of a tall tale , but it explains a lot .
After he does the thing with the rock and the creation , he does a whole bunch of other things , like make some stuff to put on the rock : tapirs , those mushrooms that squirt out clouds of poisonous , lung - exploding spores when you step on them , a vole or two to spice things up , some annoying mountains in the middle of flat stuff ; all of these things he secretes out of his Stuff - Gland and sticks them on this crazy rock he 's making called " Earth . "
Anyway , this guy works on decorating his rock for like six straight days or something , but as the story goes , on the seventh day he gets lazy and sleeps in , maybe goes down to the Sizzler for the all - you - can - eat sundae bar instead of working on his creepy old space rock some more .
He comes back from the Sizzler feeling nauseated and disturbingly obese , so he downs a few shots of Jack Daniels and hits the hay early .
Here 's where the story gets oddly terrifying in an odd , terrifying way .
While he is sleeping , the rock plunges into disarray and chaos .
Then , something terrible and unforeseen happens that changes the course of events for eons to come .
The McDonald 's corporation , along with elite friends such as Valvoline , Skittles , Sears , and Coca - Cola , decide to create a movie .
A movie worse than any movie ever seen or imagined before .
A movie so bad that the only words that can be used to describe it are not words at all , but more like a series of grunts and yelps , such as , " Aaaauuugghiighhh .
Grruuuuhhp .
Bbbuuuhhhhoohhhh .
Eeep ! "
Even then , the sheer visceral horror that this movie elicits is hard to communicate , but an attempt will have to be made , just as an attempt was made on the life of my poor , dear grandfather one night last fall as he made his solitary way home from the local Elk's Club after a high - stakes game of spin - the - bottle .
I miss you , Gramps .
In the year of our rock - creator 1988 , the movie " MAC & Me " was unfortunately and irrevocably made .
It was made in a large part to ride the greasy , cocaine - stained coattails of the widely - enjoyed and commercially successful movie , " E.T. " Unlike " E.T , " " MAC & Me " has absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever .
From the cheesy acronym Mysterious Alien Creature ( MAC ) , to the dialogue that sounds as though the actors were hauled off into darkened closets and given a sound smacking in the face with ye olde 2 x 4 before the movie was shot , to the movie 's alien stars who look as though they are entirely comprised of chewed gum and boils , to the blatant and shameless advertising via dance routine for countless consumer products , this movie blows .
It blows hard .
As hard as something that blows extremely , unbelievably hard .
Like a very large vacuum cleaner .
Oh wait , that sucks ...
Ok , like a 2 - dollar crack whore in a back alley on the streets of Jakarta , Indonesia .
Wait , that would also suck , perhaps not even as hard as the vacuum .
Well , you get my meaning .
It 's bad .
The movie begins when a NASA probe accidentally kidnaps a freakish family of leprosy - ridden aliens who were happily SUCKING A LIQUID , BROWNISH NOURISHMENT OUT OF THE GROUND WITH THEIR CREEPY LIPLESS MOUTHS on a nearby planet .
The aliens are brought back to Earth against their will only to escape from NASA and end up hiding out in the desert of southern California .
The youngest alien , a freakish grease - creature with enormous , watery fisheyes , jumps onto the van of a family en route to ( shockingly )
Los Angeles and is whisked away into the suburban life of Eric , the angelic crippled kid .
Also on board the love van are his annoying teenage brother and his ditzy , rodent - like mom .
The family arrives back at home and Eric is immediately alerted ( via his supersensitive cripple - powers ) to the presence of the alien weirdo .
He gives it the sickeningly saccharine nickname of " MAC " which has nothing , absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with the " Big Mac " sandwich from McDonald's .
Nothing .
Not at all .
He also decides to keep it as his personal sex slave because even at 10 years old he has the common sense to know that he is a disgusting cripple and that no one will ever want to have sex with him , ever .
Also , the creature 's mouth is stuck in a permanent whistle - shape , which as it turns out is perfect for things like ... whistling .
The movie 's heroione in her long - awaited screen debut .
Sure was worth the wait , alright .
RAWR !
And thus begins the journey of friendship and self - discovery that Eric the lonely crippled kid begins with a disgusting sack of alien garbage at his side .
Of course , the only people who can see it are the cripple and his crimp - haired girlie - friend who lives across the street and somehow does n't care that all of the other kids are going to laugh at her and call her degrading names like " Pancho " and " Steve " because she talks to the depressing crippled kid .
On one occasion the kid and his friend are playing in the backyard when Eric suddenly loses control of his wheelchair .
The next two minutes are spent with her screaming shrilly over and over again , " EEERRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIC !!!!!!!
EEEEEEEERRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIC !!!!!! " as his wheelchair rolls down a hill , across a field and OH MY GOD OFF OF A CLIFF INTO A RIVER 50 FEET BELOW !
This scene has the most obvious use of a stunt dummy since " True Lies " in which they had to put an actual woman 's breasts in the scene that was supposed to contain the boobs of the hideous man-beast fish - monster Jamie Lee Curtis .
The dummy - cripple plummets to its seeming doom , ricocheting off of the rock face and doubling in half as it hits the water .
Meanwhile , as you may not already know , Eric 's legs do not work , so he is in serious danger of endrownifying as he demonstrates by flailing convincingly for several minutes before he gives up on life and sinks happily beneath the murk .
Luckily , Eric 's creepfest Mongoloid alien friend is on hand to dive beneath the water and bring him to the surface , much to the surprise and dismay of the little girl who actually wanted him to die so that she would n't have to hang out with the weirdo retard any more .
By Stephen Leahy Nov 2 ’06 ( IPS ) – Every single commercial fishery in the world will be wiped before 2050 and the oceans may never recover if over - fishing continues at its current rate , a four - year scientific investigation has found .
“ By the time my nine - year - old son is my age , there would be no wild seafood left , ” said Emmett Duffy , a scientist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences in the United States .
In this grim , not - to - far - off future , not only will there be no fish to eat , humans will also lose the vital services oceans provide , including processing wastes , cleaning beaches , controlling flooding and absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
The world ’s oceans are already in a precarious state , hammered by extensive coastal pollution , climate change , over - fishing and the enormously wasteful practice of deep - sea trawling , in which heavily weighted nets dragged along the sea floor scoop up everything in their 100 - metre - wide paths , including vast amounts of unwanted sea creatures , the so - called bycatch .
The only way to reverse this slide into an abysmal future is to stop fishing out one species after another to ensure there is an abundance of biodiversity in the seas , researchers have found .

The biggest problem with calling sex " doing it " is that it ' just so vague .
When you take the English language ' chief present - tense verb for basically any type of action and combine it with a pronoun that can represent anything that does n't have a gender , you end up with one nebulous euphemism .
You could call kayaking " doing it . "
Or eating a sandwich .
Or pissing on your best friend ' face .
Virtually anything could be " doing it . "
It essentially boils down to this : " Doing it " is the sex euphemism for cowards .
When you want to say something that could possibly be construed as something other than sex , but which you can giggle after saying because you know what it means , that ' when you say " doing it . "
Extra points taken off for being the title of that godawful LL Cool J song our friend ' ex-girlfriend used to think went " doin ' it and doin ' it and doin ' it , WOW ! "
Which , honestly , does make it better .
We do , however , like one bit of vaguery when it comes to our sexual euphemisms .
If any term for sex can also be used as a euphemism for dancing , it ' okay in our book .
That ' the beauty of " gettin ' busy . "
In addition , the term goes beyond describing sex as simply a primal , physical act .
It requires concentration , skill and attention .
One must hone in their abilities and get busy with the work ahead of them .
Sex is not merely an act of pleasure ; it is an act of pleasuring .
Because of this , we , one and all , must truly " get busy .
" Honestly , this is just fun to say .
Say it out loud .
Come on .
" Coitus . " " Coooooitus . " " Co-i-tus . "
Honestly , we 're not sure there ' any Latin-y , scientific - sounding word that is a more perfect descriptor for sex .
There ' just something about it that ' seductive but also kind of dirty .
If there ' any problem with it , it may be that for whatever reason it sounds like a word that might describe a snake : " It ' coitus and ready to strike ! " but , considering the fact that the male genitals are so often compared to just such a creature , I guess it ' appropriate .
Anyway , coitus .
Hurray coitus !
This is a terrific euphemism , mainly because it reminds us of two awesome movies .
One , obviously , is , which , well , is where it came from .
It ranks right up there with " ultra violence " and " I 'm selling magaziiines ! " as quotes that we will repeat from that movie until we 're dead .
But the term also always reminds us of , only because we immediately make the connection with In - n - Out Burger , which leads us to remember that scene where they 're eating In - n - Out Burgers in the Dude ' car after Walter smashes up that kid ' car .
So really , our appreciation of the phrase has essentially nothing to do with sex .
One of the big stories at DefCon last year was a security researcher 's demonstration of wirelessly sniffing users ' session cookies while they accessed their e-mail accounts or conducted e-commerce transactions via wireless networks .
The attack allowed a hacker access to the victim 's Gmail or Hotmail account without needing to decipher the user 's password .
Now the security researcher who presented that info has found that even using SSL HTTPS to access your Gmail account – which was touted at the time as a surefire way to protect Gmail users against such an attack – is vulnerable to this hack .
Robert Graham of Errata Security says he 's been able to grab session cookies even when users access their account in a presumably secure manner .
He describes the vulnerability on his blog :
In theory , using the HTTPS version of Gmail should protect you by going to https://mail.google.com/mail, but this does n't work as you think .
The JavaScript code uses an XMLHttpRequest object to make HTTP requests in the background .
These are also SSL encrypted by default - but they become unencrypted if SSL fails .
When you open your laptop and connect to a WiFi hotspot , it usually presents you with a login page , or a page that forces you to accept their terms and conditions .
During this time , SSL will be blocked .
Gmail will therefore backoff and attempt non-SSL connections .
These also fail - but not before disclosing the cookie information that allow hackers to sidejack your account .
UPDATE : Reader Nicholas
Weaver has pointed out a link to further discussion of this issue that might interest other readers .
He 's also written up a nice clear description explaining the issue on his own blog .

Patches for journalling support
To : tech - kern %NetBSD.org@localhost
: Subject : Patches for journalling support
: From : Simon Burge < simonb%wasabisystems.com@localhost >
: Date : Sun , 2 Mar 2008 23:05:23 + 1100
Hi folks , Wasabi Systems
Inc is pleased to make our journalling code available to the NetBSD community .
This code is known as WAPBL - Write Ahead Physical Block Logging , and has been used to provide meta - data journalling in production environments for over 4 years .
WAPBL journals meta - data only - not file data , and has been used on filesystems ranging from from 16MB to multiple terabytes in size .
WAPBL was originally written by Darrin B. Jewell while at Wasabi .
Many thanks to Antti Kantee , Andy Doran and Greg Oster for their work in adapting our journalling code to NetBSD - current ( our contribution was based on the netbsd - 4 branch ) and testing .
WAPBL is enabled in the kernel with : options WAPBL Currently WAPBL uses space after the filesystem ( but before the partition 's end ) for its journal .
The suggested method is to use : newfs -s - 64 m < other options > / dev / < foo > to leave 64MB of space for the journal .
Obviously this will destroy any existing data in the filesystem on / dev / < foo > and you should , of course , back up any data on this filesystem first .
The journal size itself is still the subject of some research .
Solaris uses " 10 % of filesystem size to a maximum of 64MB " , and at Wasabi we 've always used a 64MB journal on larger filesystems .
As well as the kernel , the following binaries need to be updated : /sbin/fsck /sbin/fsck_ffs /sbin/mount /sbin/mount_ffs
The easiest way to do this is to just rebuild using build.sh and reinstall either base .
tgz or the above binaries .
There are three known issues : - " mount -u -o log " does n't work yet , so you can't have logging enabled on the root filesystem .
" mount -u -o log " is disabled in this patch ( see around line 222 of sys / kern/ vfs_syscalls .c ) .
-
Under some very heavy workloads there seems to be some sort of bottleneck .
20 parallel extracts of a src.tar.gz ( a tar of the NetBSD source tree ) on a quad - core machine has triggered this problem , but we can't reproduce it on a dual - core machine .
Using " options WAPBL_DEBUG_SERIALIZE
" seems to be a workaround .
-
The log itself must currently be at the end of the partition ( see the newfs command above ) .
We have plans to implement a log that lives in the filesystem itself and is allocated at mount time .
The patches are available at : http://www.NetBSD.org/~simonb/wapbl-current-20080302.diff
Note that even though the basis of these patches have been in production use for a few years , these patches should still be considered experimental as they are against NetBSD - current and not the same source code base we use at Wasabi .
Pending serious problems , I 'd like to integrate these changes in two or three weeks time , depending on feedback .

They are studying deers living in suburban areas in Pennsylvania .
Siberian then hacked up a way to use the resulting E - mail to create a spreadsheet which is then converted into a file you can use to track the deer in Google Earth .
The system is totally automated using free services .
His post goes into detail on how this was all accomplished .
Siberian is using some tools by Valery Hronusov – who has developed and posted dozens of cool geo hacks for Google Earth ( see his global rainfall example ) .
Valery came up with the idea to let the deer blog his coordinates as well .
Thanks to Valery for the tip on this cool deer hack !
Note : you can also view the deer ’s map in Google Maps
Any bets on how long it will be before someone hunts down the poor deer ?

Scott Aaronson and CS theory colleagues complain conceptual insights are slighted relative to technical results :
The trends that worry us are … Assignment of little weight to " conceptual " considerations , while assigning the dominant weight to technical considerations .
… by " conceptual " we mean the aspects that can be communicated succinctly , with a minimum amount of technical notation , and yet their content reshapes our view / understanding .
Conceptual contributions can be thought of as contents of the work that are most likely to be a part of a scientific hallway discussion . …
Once understood , conceptual aspects tend to be viewed as obvious , which actually means that they have become fully incorporated in the worldview of the expert . … our community should be warned of dismissing such contributions by saying " yes , but that ’s obvious " ; when somebody says such a thing , one should ask " was it obvious to you before reading this article ? "
Scott elaborates :
People will often say , " sure , but as soon as you ’ve asked the question / defined the model that way , the answer is obvious . "
They recognize , but do n’t sufficiently appreciate , the fact that before the paper in question no one had asked the question or defined the model that way .
Here are a few of the 76 comments .
Travis :
Unfortunately this problem is present in many fields – not just computer science .
Piotr :
Conceptual , notably new model papers , are high risk ( and potentially high gain ) at the time of evaluation .
…
Technical papers , notably those solving open problems , are low - risk , and their gain can be easily assessed at eval time . …
In a situation involving shrinking resources , a natural ( if not a rational ) approach is to focus on low - risk entities
Greg Kuperberg :
You can sometimes gain security through obscurity by writing long papers that make your results look hard .
Maleq Khan :
We got some nice results using a very simple approach … we could not get these results [ published ] .
The most annoying part was the reviewers ’ comments , like " this is very simple " .
Throughout the long journey ( i.e. , several submissions ) of our paper , only one reviewer found our simple approach as " an asset " .
…
Couple of years earlier … a paper , which achieved much worse bound using a complicated ( and inefficient ) algorithm and complex proof , got published .
Most agreed this was a problem , but a few dissented .
Gil Kalai :
The best papers with conceptual breakthroughs were usually also very good in terms of the formalism and other technical aspects .
Yes , the pattern observed is clearly a " bias " relative to the goal of promoting intellectual progress .
But my working model of academia is that it functions mainly to allow folks to affiliate with people certified as impressive – intellectual progress is only a side effect .
So reviewers try to to seem clearly impressive to less well - informed observers .
Approving hard solid technical work a reviewer clearly signals his technical abilities , but approving unclear - to - observers conceptual contributions risks both seeming an ignorant lightweight , and seeming a deep thinker .
In general , " certification " tends to be a risk - averse process – it much prefers a high confidence that quality is above a certain minimum , relative to equal chances of very high quality and very low quality .
I do think there are possible academic institutions that could better reward intellectual progress , but I ’m skeptical that people actually want to adopt them , if they make it harder to certify people as impressive .

60,000 + Iraq , Afghanistan Vets Diagnosed With PTSD
VA Official : More Than 60,000 Iraq , Afghanistan Vets Diagnosed With PTSD
By Jason Leopold
Jonathan Schulze was awarded two Purple Hearts in 2005 after a lengthy tour of duty in Iraq .
But the Marine veteran could n't escape the war inside his head .
Drugs and alcohol temporarily numbed his pain .
Yet the guilt he carried around with him having been one of a handful of soldiers in his unit to survive combat was impossible to run away from .
Schulze was suicidal .
On January 11 , 2007 , he sought treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder .
His parents drove him to the VA hospital in St. Cloud , Minnesota .
Schulze told the VA staff that he " felt suicidal , " his mother , Marianne Schulze , recalled .
The hospital did n't admit him .
Instead , he was told to call back the following day .
He did .
He was given a number : 26 .
The VA staff told him he'd have to wait at least two weeks to be admitted .
Apparently , there were other veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who were also suffering from PTSD .
It 's unknown whether they met the same fate .
On January 16 , 2007 , Schulze placed a framed photograph of his one - year - old daughter beside him .
He wrapped an electrical cord around his neck and hung himself in the basement of a friend 's house in New Prague , Minnesota .
He was 25 years old .
This week , Schulze 's story is being retold in a federal courthouse in San Francisco as evidence of the widespread , systemic failures by the Veterans Administration to treat tens of thousands of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans who suffer PTSD .
Attorneys for two veterans advocacy organizations are hoping to convince a judge that a lawsuit filed against the Department for Veterans Affairs last year and several government officials associated with the VA should receive class - action status .
In their lawsuit , Veterans for Common Sense and Veterans United for Truth , which represent about 12,000 veterans combined , claim Iraq and Afghanistan war vets are dying while waiting for the VA to treat PTSD and work through a backlog of at least half - a- million disability claims .
The groups want Conti to issue a preliminary injunction to force the VA to immediately treat veterans who show signs of PTSD and are at risk of suicide .
PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that can develop in a person who witnesses , or is confronted with , a traumatic event .
PTSD is said to be the most prevalent mental disorder arising from combat .
According to the lawsuit , “ more than any previous war , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are likely to produce a high percentage of troops suffering from PTSD , ” due to the widespread use of improvised explosive devises , multiple rotations , the ambiguity of fighting combatants dressed as civilians , and the use of National Guard members and Reservists .
In their complaint , the plaintiffs ' attorneys allege that numerous VA practices stemming from a 1998 law violate the constitutional and statutory rights of veterans suffering from PTSD by denying veterans mandated medical care .
" Because of those failures , hundreds of thousands of men and women who have suffered grievous injuries fighting in the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are being abandoned , " states the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for Northern California .
" Unless systemic and drastic measures are instituted immediately , the costs to these veterans , their families , and our nation will be incalculable , including broken families , a new generation of unemployed and homeless veterans , increases in drug abuse and alcoholism , and crushing burdens on the health care delivery system and other social services in our communities . "
VA attorneys had argued in court papers filed last month that Iraq and Afghanistan veterans were not " entitled " to the five - years of free healthcare upon their return from combat as mandated by Congress in the " Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act . "
Rather , the VA argued , medical treatment for the war veterans was discretionary based on the level of funding available in the VA 's budget .
On Tuesday , the second day of testimony before U.S. District Court Judge Samuel Conti , Dr. Gerald Cross , the undersecretary for health at the Veterans Health Administration , made a startling admission during cross-examination by the plaintiffs ' attorneys that would appear to contradict the agency 's position .
Cross admitted that veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan were not only entitled to free healthcare , " there is no co-pay , " he said .
Perhaps most startling , however , was testimony by Cross stating that of the 300,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars treated at VA hospitals , more than half were diagnosed with a serious mental condition , 68,000 of which were cases of PTSD .
His testimony marks the first time a Bush administration official has provided detailed information about the psychological impact of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars on combat veterans .
Cross testified that five years after the invasion of Iraq , the VA has still not completed a study on the link between suicides and PTSD among combat veterans .
However , he said such a study is currently in the works and may be published soon .
Paul Sullivan , the executive director of Veterans for Common Sense , Paul Sullivan , said more than 5,000 veterans commit suicide per year .
Dr. Arthur Blank , a renowned expert on PTSD who has worked closely with the VA , testified that about 30 percent of Iraqi war veterans are likely suffering from PTSD due to multiple deployments and the VA is not doing enough to care for them .
" I think it 's because of multiple deployments , which means one is exposed to trauma over and over again , " Blank testified .
Last week , Daniel Cooper , the VA 's undersecretary for benefits , who is named as a defendant in the lawsuit , abruptly resigned .
Sullivan 's group had called for Cooper 's resignation two weeks ago in light of the huge backlog of benefits claims that have yet to be processed by Cooper 's department .
Last August , the Pentagon 's Inspector General revealed that Cooper used his government position to promote the work of a fundamentalist Christian organization , a violation of the laws governing the separation of church and state .
Cooper , and several high - ranking military officials , appeared in a promotional video for Christian Embassy , an evangelical organization that evangelizes members of the military and politicians in Washington , DC via daily Bible studies and outreach events .
The group holds prayer breakfasts on Wednesdays in the Pentagons executive dining room , according to the organization 's web site .
Mikey Weinstein , the founder and president of The Military Religious Freedom Foundation , whose organization called for a federal investigation after government officials were discovered to have participated in the Christian Embassy promotional video , said Cooper is a " disgrace . "
" The D in Dan stands for disgrace , " Weinstein said in an interview .
" He 's a disgrace to the United States Naval Academy , the United States Navy , the US armed forces , the Veterans Administration , and the United States of America .
Why ?
Because we have him on videotape making it very clear to the world that the most important part of his job was to push the fundamentalist agenda of the Christian right over his specified duties at the Veterans Administration .
Dan Cooper has used the United States Constitution as his personal roll of toilet paper .
I wish him as much good fortune as he has provided to our honorable and noble veterans ; none . "

JPMorgan Chase was in talks on Sunday night for a deal that would quintuple its offer for Bear Stearns , the beleaguered investment bank , in an effort to pacify angry Bear shareholders , according to people involved in the negotiations .
The sweetened offer is intended to win over stockholders who vowed to fight the original fire - sale deal , struck only a week ago at the behest of the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department .
Under the terms being discussed , JPMorgan would pay $ 10 a share in stock for Bear , up from its initial offer of $ 2 a share  a figure that represented a mere one - fifteenth of Bear ’s going market price .
The Fed , which must approve any new deal , was balking at the new offer price on Sunday night after several days of frantic , secret negotiations , these people said .
As a result , it was still possible the renegotiated deal might be postponed or collapse entirely , said these people , who were granted anonymity because of their confidentiality agreements .
The Psychopathology Of Male Psyche
By Wanda M. Woodward
21 March , 2008
Countercurrents.org
I confess at the onset of my letter my bias toward an egalitarian world , one in which there is a more transcendent collective consciousness ; a world in which social and economic justice rest gently among the two genders , and amongst the many diverse cultures , ethnicities , and religions .
Who would argue that we fall far short of this ideal in contemporary society ?
What concerns me is that economists , sociologists , public policy experts , and ecologists seem to have overlooked one of the most pressing issues of our time : the mutual exclusivity between capitalism and overpopulation .
All things evolve .
That is an immutable law and only fools ignore it .
Capitalism replaced mercantilism as a natural evolution .
Socialized democracy will replace capitalism .
It is the inevitable evolution of economic systems .
Marx was correct when he said that the seeds of destruction were built into capitalism because he knew that greed or limited resources would eventually cause its demise .
Socialism failed in the Soviet Union for the simple , but tragic fact that its male leaders were fascists who were only interested in feathering their own beds while ignoring the good for the all .
They were narcissists , sociopaths , and psychopaths and , thus , fell somewhere on the spectrum of masculine pathology .
Capitalism will fail for those same reasons and because our planet cannot tolerate unfettered consumerism .
Capitalism is predicated upon the theory of “ unlimited growth . ”
Unlimited growth is based on unbridled consumerism .
Unbridled consumerism is based upon a theory of unlimited natural and mineral resources .
And so here we find the end of capitalism .
We live in a world in which there are currently 6.6 billion people .
Most of the world lives in poverty .
With 6.6 billion people , we have decimated large swathes of forest , fished out 90 % of the large fish in our oceans , poisoned massive amounts of soil from toxins in landfills and from agricultural run-off , polluted our oceans with waste and toxins which has resulted in the killing of significant marine life , heated and acidified the oceans from the rise in carbon dioxide emitted from overuse of fossil fuels and forest decimation , and placed at risk significant amounts of potable water such that 2/3 of the people on this planet will not have access to potable water by 2030 .
Global warming — the nexus between overpopulation , capitalism , excess consumption , and wanton pollution and destruction of the environment ---- has accelerated the speed at alarming rates at which the ice caps in the polar regions are melting .
Scientists predict that , at the current rate of global warming , by 2100 , up to 50 % of animal species and 30 % of plant species will become extinct .
Again , this is with 6.6 billion people .
It is projected that there will be 8 billion people living on this tiny planet by 2050 .
Add to this very dismal picture the fact that robots are inevitably going to replace tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions , of jobs in the next century , the outlook for humankind and the environment goes from dark to the abyss .
Scientists tell us that there have been five extinctions on this planet ; however , they were all thought to be caused by factors other than by human imprints .
The next extinction to which we are headed will almost certainly be anthropogenic whether by global warming or nuclear annihilation .
Let us state what no economist , ecologist , sociologist , or public policy expert has yet to acknowledge : Capitalism and overpopulation are mutually exclusive .
In fact , overpopulation is mutually exclusive with oligarchies , plutarchies , and monarchies because , in these systems , the few who have everything in excess can pay for water , food , privacy , safety , and security while the remaining masses are at risk for abject poverty , disease , hunger , and death .
As more billions are added to the global population , this disparity grows and , more importantly , it becomes more obvious to more people .
The masses of people on this tiny planet will , at some point , connect the dots and realize that either hundreds of millions of people must die or capitalism must die .
When that realization dawns is unknown , but it will occur .
The few privileged males in those worldly positions of power who quite literally rule this planet , I suspect , have known this for decades .
That would be one reason why all the media outlets have been purchased by multinational corporations or extremely wealthy individuals in an attempt to hide the truth from the masses of people and to keep people in a perpetual state of senseless consumerism .
Keeping people uninformed would ostensibly prevent mass revolutions , uprisings , and civil wars which would overthrow the current power structures should people become informed of the stark and sobering reality of both the deception by the powerful elite and the uncomfortable choices that now face humankind .
Had the male leaders informed people decades ago and made alternative business decisions to avert what must have been statistically probable should the world continue down the path we have tread , our choices would have likely been less painful .
Pigs - at - the - trough male corporate and political leadership , through avaricious decision - making , have guaranteed that the entire human race will face this dilemma .
A choice between hundreds of millions of people dying or capitalism dying ?
We need not enter into a discussion about which option Napolean , Asaka , Pavelic , Stalin , Hitler , Mao , Pol Pot , Amin , Montt , Mengistu , Taylor , Bagosora , Milosevic , Mladic , Karadzic and their ilk preferred .
Narcissists , sociopaths , and psychopaths gravitate toward the most powerful positions in the world because a diagnostic criteria that must be met with these three clinical populations is their obsession with control and power over others .
The psychopath , the morbid pathological state in the spectrum of masculine pathology , actually seeks to destroy " other " and does so without conscience .
Ninety nine percent ( 99 % ) of psychopaths are males .
Approximately 90 % of sociopaths are males .
It has been shown that , of the clinical population that seeks treatment , 75 % of those diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder are males ( Vaknin , 1999 ) .
Psychopaths and sociopaths have no conscience to preclude them from the use of outright murder and war in order to achieve their egomaniacal and pathological objectives of total and absolute control .
These are the types of male leaders who have risen to power since time began .
We still have abundant numbers of them in contemporary societal leadership , albeit with varying degrees of masculine pathology on a spectrum from mild to severe .
What is more important is to postulate which choice the several thousand privileged and powerful males who , quite literally , rule our world in contemporary society would choose since these men are governing and ruling , and will decide our fate unless enough people rise up against them .
In America ’s capitalist society , those who are extremely wealthy and rely on capitalism to maintain their massive fortunes will derive the most benefit if millions of people die .
They stand to lose the most if capitalism dies .
This is not to say that every person who is wealthy prefers mass human death to the death of what has become a de facto toxic economic system .
But it is consonant with the history of the behavior and leadership of the male gender , and more specifically males in positions of political and economic power , that he would likely prefer --- with little or no confrontation to his conscience --- that hundreds of millions of people die while he lives .
Males have a long history of preferring to solve problems not through collaboration and mutual cooperation , but through aggression and war which , of course , have outcomes of pain , suffering , and death .
Naomi Klein ’s ( 2007 ) theory of disaster capitalism in which wars are intentionally fought for profit accomplishes a tri-fold objective of killing millions of people , keeping capitalism alive , and maximizing profits of corporations .
Disaster capitalism , however , fails to protect natural and mineral resources .
It even fails to protect human beings .
The god of capitalism is money .
As a result , this strategy will not prevent humankind from facing the sobering reality of extinction of animal and plant species and , ultimately , of course , the potential extinction of all life species on the planet including the human species .
More importantly to the powerful elite ( which is mostly male ) , disaster capitalism achieves the overarching myopic goal of maintaining the male supremacist power structure .
Ebeneezer Scrooge ’s uncharitable comment in A Christmas Carol about being rid of the “ excess population ” closely depicts the sentiments of males who have the most power in our global political , corporate , economic , and legal systems .
In corporations , according to Catalyst , a research organization which studies gender dynamics in corporations , males occupy approximately 97 % of CEO positions in the United States .
Without adequate factual data of the global percentage of male CEOs , an educated guess of 99 % would likely be realistic .
As for heads of world governments , we could likely estimate 95 % and that would be realistic .
As we know , the CEO is the position which decides the strategy , mission , and values of the corporation and the heads of governments are responsible for the allocation of the funds in the public treasure chest .
Thus , it is safe to say that 98 % of the economic world is governed by males .
Who holds the money , holds the power to govern and rule the world .
Corporate power and state power are euphemisms for “ male power . ”
Capitalism is a masculine system because its objective is to foster infinite competition so that there are hierarchies with a few privileged at the top who have nine - tenths of the economic pie while the masses of people have the remaining one - tenth of the pie .
With corporations now taking governments as willing mistresses all over the world , male power has magnified geometrically .
Globalization is unmistakably a male movement of economics on a worldwide scale .
In frank terms , it is a global reach of unprecedented greed by males at the top of the food chain to engage in virtually unfettered domination , exploitation , and economic control over people , and vast pillaging and plundering of the environment in order to enrich themselves and to maintain their secure repository of global wealth .
While there are favorable outcomes in which everyone could benefit from a globalization process that would be controlled by state power that implements and enforces reasonable standards , regulations , limitations , and exclusions regarding the exploitation of labor and natural resources , no such limitations have been developed by the governments .
Certainly , the senior executives of the corporations have failed to exercise self - restraint on the corporate side , but it would not be expected for them to do so given their legal allegiance to shareholders .
However , it is economic blasphemy to the dignity , welfare , and sovereignty of people that governments — the very institution whose mandate is to protect the common good --- have forsaken the citizenry by abdicating its expected role of allegiance to the economic welfare of the public and its oversight over the public treasure .
It is not so much that globalization , in and of itself , is detrimental to the progress and well being of humankind .
Rather it is the unfettered greed of corporations and nation states in rejecting limitations and exclusions as pertains to the fair , reasonable , and humane use of natural resources and labor that makes the global economy a world theatre of masculine psychosocial pathology .
If women were in charge of globalization , there would be fairness and humane treatments of labor and land .
The nature of women is to care for the good of the all .
The globalization process that has been occurring over the past twenty plus years with males in charge has been anything but good for middle class and the poor .
As mentioned previously , the media ( which is owned by male power ) has collaborated with corporate male power to ensure that the masses remain ignorant of the overwhelming disparities between the few wealthy elite and the rest of the world population .
The masculine consciousness that has aggressively rejected virtually any and all restraints upon their wanton desire to secure as much money and resources to enrich its benefactors has , without conscience , forsaken humanity and the natural environment .
Globalization is being defined in a myriad of different ways as different people view the construct through a different prism .
Rodrik ( as cited in Anderson , in press ) defines it primarily in economic terms as the “ international integration of markets for goods , services and capital ” ( p. 1 ) , whereas Friedman ( as cited in Anderson , in press ) perceives it through a hologram of shifting lens , “ the integration of capital , technology and information across national borders , in a way that is creating a single global market and , to some degree , a global village ” ( p. 2 ) .
Still others such as the sociologist Malcolm Waters ( cited in Anderson , in press ) perceives it as a “ social process in which the constraints of geography on social and cultural arrangements receded and in which people become increasingly aware that they are receding ” ( p. 3 ) .
As a mental health professional who sees the world through the lens of the human psyche , I am particularly fond of sociologist ’s Roland Robertson ’s ( as cited in Anderson , in press ) definition as “ the compression of the world and the intensification of consciousness of the world as a whole ” ( p. 5 ) .
Anderson ( in press ) appropriately highlights the common and “ widespread confusion about what globalization is ” as people debate each other because they have such “ profound different images of what ’s happening ” ( p. 1 ) .
Barnet and Cavanagh ( 1994 ) , highlighting the multi-faceted and complex nature of globalization , compare it to the verbalizations of the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland saying “ it means precisely whatever the user says it means ” ( p. 14 ) .
Ursula Franklin ( 1996 ) , in her 1995 Lois and John Dove Memorial Lecture in Toronto , refers to the “ global commercial hegemony , ” of the “ struggle against the arrogance and ignorance of power , against impending destruction , occupation , and conquest ” ( p. 13 ) .
On the most basic level , she speaks of globalization as “ a war against people ” ( p. 13 ) and “ from a historical perspective , we are in the middle of a market - driven war on the common good ” ( p. 15 ) .
Whatever the definition , it has become glaringly obvious that multinational corporations , and the senior executives who manage them , are — by far --- the clear winners ( Barnet & Cavanagh , 1994 ; Henderson , 1991 ; Korten , 2001 ; Rifkin , 2004 ) holding a barrel full of carrots with egregiously excessive compensation packages that are in the multi-millions ( sometimes hundreds of millions including stocks options ) , 20 - 30 % average annual corporate boardroom wage increases ( Toynbee , 2007 ) , hidden “ soft ” benefits such as use of the corporate jets for personal matters and residential renovations costing tens of thousands of dollars , and tax breaks and loopholes for the wealthy .
Governments have passed laws that have relaxed corporate standards , increased corporate tax breaks , and deregulated the economy to the extent that political leaders are losing much of their power as corporations assume the role of worldwide dictatorships .
With an ungoverned and unresponsive global system , the 21st century senior corporate executives have become vultures feeding off a rotting capitalist economy , raping and pillaging the environment , and enslaving the majority of people on the planet in economic servitude .
What used to commonly be called “ conventional wisdom ” as pertains to economic truths is no longer applicable .
Economic theories , once accepted as gospel , have broken down to become outdated relativisms .
The modern corporation is a descendent of the merchants of the 15th and 16th centuries in England and Holland ( Korten , 2001 ) .
Wealthy English landowners and merchants during the 17th and 18th century passed laws to protect their private property and to ensure their monopoly of wealth .
The birth of America was a revolt against the tyranny of the British monarchy and the wealthy merchants who were used by the king to maintain control over the colonial economies .
Initially when corporations were formed in America , they were under governmental control .
They also were headed by men who , for the most part , had a moral conscience about the common good .
In the 19th century , legal struggles took place between corporations and civilians regarding the right of people to revoke or amend corporate charters .
It was fairly common for states to amend , revoke , or fail to renew corporate charters until the mid 1800s as the louder voice of the people who argued that corporations were formed to serve a public good .
The premise was that corporations were public , not private , legal entities .
It was after the Civil War that corporate rights shifted .
Gradually , corporations were able to gain control over state legislatures so that laws were rewritten giving them limited liability and greater power .
In 1886 , the Supreme Court ruled in Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad that a private corporation is a natural person under law .
It marked the beginning of corporate enjoyment of the full legal rights of a person while also being exempted from many responsibilities and limiting liabilities that American citizens had to shoulder .
This was the legal birth of the pathological corporation we know today and Joel Bakan 's ( 2005 ) book , The Corporation : The Pathological Pursuit of Power and Profit , provides an excellent comparison between diagnostic features of psychopathology and corporate systems , the latter referred to by Noam Chomsky as “ unaccountable tyrannies . ”
The corporation uses the legal definition , however , only when it is convenient to do so .
When a corporation reaps benefits by referring to itself as a “ legal person , ” it defines itself as a person .
When the corporation wants to externalize blame and escape responsibility ( one clinically diagnostic intrapsychic feature of narcissism , sociopathy , and psychopathy ) for an unethical or unlawful act , it reverts to the self - description of not being a human .
This sleight of identity is a way to split itself into two separate identities so as to manipulate and gain advantages , a diagnostic tactic common in psychopathy .
As Korten ( 2001 ) , author of When Corporations Rule the World , says :
… the history of corporate - government relations … has been one of continuing pressure by corporate interests to expand corporate rights and to limit corporate obligations … corporations have emerged as the dominant governance institutions on the planet , with the largest among them reaching into virtually every country of the world and exceeding most governments in size and power .
Increasingly , it is the corporate interest rather than the human interest that defines the policy agendas of states and international bodies ( pp. 60 - 61 ) .
Ninety eight percent of CEOs in corporations around the world are male , thus , the entire world is powered by masculine ways of doing business , trading goods and services , determining economic systems , establishing at the macrolevel the methodologies of economic rewards , and , of course , who gets the most gold at the end of the rainbow .
Seager ( 1993 ) refers to the masculinist corporate structure this way : “ Attributes for success in the corporate world --- a privileging of emotional neutrality , of rationality , of personal distancing , loyalty to impersonal authority , team playing , scientific rationality , and militarized paradigms --- reflect chracteristics that define ‘ manliness ’ in our culture ” ( p. 102 ) .
Even when a female is in a position of power , the sociocultural norms and the masculine ideologies in every fabric of society overwhelm her and force her to , more or less , adopt masculine ways of rule , leadership , strategies , and objectives .
Failure to incorporate that into her style subjects her to serious scrutiny if not ridicule .
The covert and insidious ways in which the entire socio-cultural tapestry is dominated by masculine ways and methods , while largely unseen , confront her relentlessly .
Those who say that there is no more need for women to seek power and equality are either those who are above , not below , the glass ceiling , or those hypnotized by masculine ideologies who simply cannot perceive the pathological construct of masculine domination and power .
We need to state the obvious : males rule , so males win and he who wins , gets to rule and he who rules makes up the rules .
It ’s a gender Ponzi scam that has been played for thousands of years .
What is needed is for the legal system to bring consistency between the legal definition of corporations and their actions .
In other words , if a corporation is to be defined as a human , then they should be held to the same responsibilities that all humans have to the environment .
A person is fined if they throw trash onto the highway .
A person is jailed for trespassing if they go onto another ’s land .
An individual is arrested if they destroy public property .
The same should be true of corporations .
There should be laws in place which restrict corporations from plundering and pillaging the natural environment .
Most of the world ’s population would prefer that capitalism die its natural death .
It is the only thing that will save the planet and end corporate fascism .
Of course , then we would need to be wary of masculine pathology surfacing in a fascist government .
I suspect that the handful of males who are in the most powerful positions in the world , who have a stranglehold on power , and who rule this planet know that more people are coming to understand the choice between either the death of millions of people or the death of capitalism .
And as a result of knowing this truth , more people will revolt against the powers of corruption , deception , exploitation , domination , and destruction so that we can forge a new stage in the evolution of economic systems and , thus , a new stage in the evolution of human consciousness .
This will be a consciousness which seeks to share power between genders , races , ethnicities , religions , and nations .
It is a more mature consciousness which wants to empower others and collaborate toward a common good for the all instead of maintaining excess and privilege for a few versus exploitation and poverty for the rest of the world .
This mature consciousness exists in both males and females although there are not an appreciable number of them in leadership positions across the globe .
There are , at root , two major forces operating in the world today : those who wish to solve our global problems in an effort to ameliorate suffering and move closer toward social and economic justice for all versus those who are disinclusive and want to garner more social and economic benefits for their group while others have appreciably less .
Those in the first group are both males and females willing and eager , by and large , to share power .
They also tend to be more willing to share across ethnic , racial , and religious divides .
The second group is led virtually exclusively by males .
This second group led by males who believe they are superior is perpetually in conflict because it is powered by masculine ideologies of division , separation , competition , and hierarchies believed to be the “ natural and immutable order . ”
The females in this group have , for the most part , adopted and acquiesced to this patriarchal power system .
In addition , this group fails to understand and internalize the need for collaboration and mutual interdependent exchanges as a way to solve problems and as a way of living .
There are millions of factions in the second group because they can not be whole .
They can not be whole because they believe in division , separation , competition , and hierarchies .
Conflicts are rampant in this group because males believe in their inherent superiority over females , one race believes in the superiority of it over others , one religion believes in its superiority over other religions , and all of this leads to the belief in an inevitable class schism whereby those who are “ superior ” deserve to be rich while those who are “ inferior ” deserve to be poor .
Capitalism is an economic system that mirrors the psyche of those in the highest positions of power .
In other words , capitalism is an economic system of hierarchies in which one group is superior over another .
It is a system created by males who believe in masculine power and racial superiority .
As within , so is without .
The pathologically masculine psyche---- with its obsession to control , have power over , dominate , exploit , and destroy others ---- is the only psyche which could wholeheartedly continue to advocate unfettered consumerism and unbridled capitalism while the human species and the entire ecological system are seriously threatened with extinction .
Masculine pathology is the malignant consciousness which will detonate a nuclear bomb , allow capitalism to continue until all life on the planet is extinct , or ensure that millions of people die in wars so as to “ get rid of excess population . ”
It is the scourge of our time and since time immemorial .
Will males mature psychologically in sufficient numbers to avoid total annihilation ?
That is the question of our time .

' No One Could Have Predicted This , ' Conny McCormack Tells LA Times in Her Best Condoleese , About Her Ballot Design That Disenfranchsed 40 % of Voters in At Least Two Previous Elections ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/18/2008 , 1:35 pm PT
L.A. County 's former Registrar Recorder , Conny McCormack , who quit just prior to February 's Super Tuesday Primary Election , turned into Condi Rice today .
She 's quoted in an Los Angeles Times ' front page story confirming , as we pointed out over the weekend , that Election Officials did nothing about the " Double Bubble " ballot problem --- which may well disenfranchise a conservatively estimated 50,000 county voters --- despite massive disenfranchisement with the same design over last six years , since McCormack first implemented it .
In her best Condoleese , McCormack is quoted by the paper today saying , " This is an unfortunate , unanticipated result ... No one could have predicted this . "
Sound familiar ?
She is shortly contradicted , in the same article , by a spokesperson from her own former office , before she continues on to blame voters and poll workers for the problem that she created --- as now confirmed by both the LA Times and California 's Secretary of State Debra Bowen --- before then proceeding to do absolutely nothing about it ...
Ballot Design by Conny
The Times , confirms today that it was " McCormack [ who ] picked this ballot style [ in ] 2002 " .
Though they seem to have modified their headline for today 's story from the time the print edition went out last night , until the time the story was posted on the web .
The more accurate headline on the print edition : " Flaw on ballot went unheeded for 6 years " .
The more Conny - friendly headline , as posted on the web today : " L.A. County ballot design went unnoticed for six years "
As we noted over the weekend , the LA Times had reported earlier reported that Non-Partisan ballots cast in open Democratic Primaries in previous years had gone quietly uncounted at an alarming rate .
An editorial of theirs late last week pointed out that 44 % of such " crossover " ballots went uncounted in the March 2004 Primary , while 42 % of such ballots went uncounted in June of 2006 .
On KQED , Northern California 's National Public Radio affiliate last Friday , Sec. of State Bowen also confirmed the ballot design was McCormack 's , and that she was " shocked " to hear that it had been in place for the last three elections .
" The ballot design was created by the previous Registrar of voters , " Bowen said on KQED 's Forum program ( audio archive here . )
" So the current Registrar , the acting Registrar in LA County , inherited this problem and he 's relatively new .
I do n't know if he was aware that voters were being systematically excluded .
I was shocked to hear it , frankly . "
Where McCormack now says " no one could have predicted this , " --- much like planes flying into buildings , or levees giving way in New Orleans --- the fact is if she could n't have predicted this , then she was criminally negligent in her job as Registrar .
If , on the other hand , she knew about the problem and did nothing , then she is equally criminally negligent .
At least if disenfranchising voters was actually the felony crime in this country that it ought to be .
Officials from McCormack 's former office even go on to contradict her somewhat in the same article today .
They admit that the problem was spotted " months earlier " , even though McCormack had vacated her post , officially , on the last day of December [ emphasis added ] :
Paul Drugan , [ acting Registrar Dean ]
Logan 's executive assistant , said election officials had foreseen the problem months earlier and had been educating voters about the requirement .
He dismissed the concerns of anxious voters who were worried that their ballots would not count .
Conny Blames Everyone But Herself
At the same time , there is plenty of blame to go around .
Both Drugan and McCormack 's temporary replacement , acting Registrar Logan , had been busy over the last week or two since the election , inexcusably blaming poll workers and voters for the problem , and giving themselves a pass for the ridiculous ballot design and awful , often contradictory , instructions they had given to poll workers on how to deal with " Decline to State " ( sometimes called " Non-Partisan " ) voters at the polls .
Late comments from Drugan and Logan , however , seem to indicate that they 're finally coming around to taking the responsibility for the problem that they should have from the beginning .
When the problem first publicly emerged , thanks to the watchdog efforts of California 's Courage Campaign , the pair should have simply thrown the dearly departed McCormack under the bus .
It was , after all , her years - old ballot design , and Logan had only recently come to the office after leaving his post as Election Director in King County , WA ( where he oversaw the disastrous mess of their 2004 razor - thin Gubernatorial Election . )
According to the Times today ...
[ Logan ] acknowledged that many of the county 's 28,000 poll workers , who are paid $ 80 to $ 120 , were not adequately taught about the bubble during their 90 - minute training sessions and did not know enough to inform voters properly .
" We can look back now and say it should have been emphasized more , " he acknowledged .
That alone is an improvement over previous suggestions included by Logan in his report [ PDF ] given last week to the LA County Board of Supervisors , wherein he included a litany of education efforts he purports his office made , by way of suggesting that the issue should have been clear to poll workers .
Previously , he had been even more direct in trying to place blame with poll workers and voters , instead of with his own office and McCormack , where it belonged .
As The BRAD BLOG reported just after the extent of the debacle began to emergence ...
" It would almost be counterintuitive for someone to miss , " acting Registrar Logan told AP with , presumably , a straight face the day before the primary .
" We have put this information in voter education materials , and we 've provided real clear instructions . "
That same BRAD BLOG report detailed the massive confusion among both poll workers and voters about the second bubble required to be filled out on Non-Partisan ballots by voters wishing to vote in either the Democratic or American Independent Party primaries .
Without filling in that bubble , LA County 's electronic scanners would have no way to known which primary the Presidential votes on the ballot should be counted for , since the same set of numbered bubble was used to record votes in both the Dem and AI primary races .
Despite Logan 's assertions to the public at the time , the instructions to poll workers , about which ballots to give Non-Partisan voters , and what to tell them about the second , so - called " Double Bubble " , were anything but " real clear " , as we reported at the time .
Logan 's executive assistant Drugan had also made similar comments to the media earlier , downplaying the issue , and suggesting it was the voters ' problem , and not their office's .
" Are some voters confused ?
Yes , they are .
Is it widespread or systemic ?
I do n't think that it is , " Drugan was quoted selling to the LA Daily News .
Today , McCormack , who apparently has yet to get the memo that the problem was neither the fault of voters or poll workers , had the temerity to tell the LA Times :
" Election officials will tell you they despise these elections , " said former L.A. County Registrar Conny McCormack , who retired in January , a month before the vote .
" Voters do n't understand them , and poll workers do n't understand them . "
It 's never her fault , of course .
No Stranger to Controversy
This would hardly be the first time McCormack has come under fire .
Just prior to quitting last year , she made headlines when expressing her concerns , to the LA County Board of Supervisors , about the loss of profits that voting machine company 's make see in the wake of California 's Sec. of State Debra Bowen 's decertification of a number of electronic voting systems found to be incredibly vulnerable to both error and malicious tampering .
McCormack had previously been featured , with photograph and quote , on a Diebold Election Systems sales brochure , singing the company 's praises .
As to the 50,000 or more ballots cast in the Democratic Primary that have yet to be counted , we very specifically detailed late last week how virtually every one of them can be counted , and counted 100 % accurately as per the voter 's intent , and as per California law .
If Logan actually wishes to do so , in any case .
We 've been in touch with the office of California Sec. of State Debra Bowen , and her office is now taking steps to assure that Logan counts as many votes as possible .
She sent a 3 - page letter to Logan [ PDF ] on Friday , requesting that he begin to take a number of the steps we detailed in our article about how LA County 's Non-Partisan ballots must now be counted to ensure that get counted , and get counted accurately .
We 'll have more specifics on Bowen 's efforts shortly .
[ UPDATE : That new report is now posted here ... ]
For now , a bit of what should be fairly obvious good news .
Bowen also mentioned , in her interview with KQED , that this ballot scheme will never again be used in California , where there is another another primary , for state candidates , scheduled for June .
" It 's fair to say , we will not see that ballot design again , anywhere in California , in any future election , " Bowen said about the controversy which has become California 's and Conny McCormack 's very own equivalent of Florida 's infamous " Butterfly Ballot " .

So I never met the person who made the card , and the mystery behind the business card remains intact .
How many uncreative ( boring ) business cards have you seen in your life ?
This business card illustrates that a little bit of creativity can go a long way towards sticking in someone ’s mind .
What is it about April Fools '
Day jokes that we love so much ?
Perhaps it 's that , in the midst of the crushing influx of information that many of us cope with daily , a well - constructed prank provides a welcome break .
For a moment , we smile , even when the joke is a tried - and - true chestnut .
Google has a strong tradition of sublime hilarity each April 1 .
Last year , the company announced two faux products designed to elicit a chuckle from unsuspecting ( and suspecting ) readers : Gmail Paper ( 6GB of messages , rendered as hard copy ) and Google TiSP , a plumbing - based Internet Service Provider dedicated to harnessing the underutilized potential of the nation 's " dark porcelain . "
( See PC World Senior Writer Tom Spring 's complete slideshow for a retrospective of Google 's April Fool 's and other fun inventions over the years . )
In recent times , many other sites have pulled our collective leg with April Fools pages marked by realistic graphics and ridiculous but deadpan copy .
Here are ten of our favorites .
Just click the linked header for each entry to see the prank ( or its fallout ) come to life .
Last year , Facebook users noticed some unusual entries scattered among News Feed updates , including the announcement of a new LivePoke feature , in which invited users to dispatch a real live person to physically poke their Facebook friends ( offer limited to first 100 members of a network ) .
Another entry reported that Harry ( Potter , not PC World 's editor in chief McCracken ) and Voldemort ( more of a MySpace kind of guy anyway ) had returned to their former relationship status as mortal enemies .
Good work , guys , and better luck next year on moving up our list .
In late March 2007 , Dan Baines posted a Web page describing ( and illustrating with detailed photos ) the discovery of what appeared to be the remains of a " real " fairy .
Baines claimed that the mummified fairy corpse was recovered along an old Roman road in Derbyshire , England , by a dog - walker who preferred to remain anonymous .
The bones of its diminutive , human - like skeleton were hollow , like a bird's , making it " particularly light , " an anatomical peculiarity whose contribution to airworthiness was enhanced by the body 's extremely leaflike - - uh , lifelike - - wings .

What to do with your ‘ third week of March ’
When Pope John Paul died , Rogers Cadenhead quickly registered www.BenedictXVI.com thinking this might be the name chosen by the new pope .
When Cardinal Ratzinger was elected Pope he did choose the name Pope Benedict XVI , causing many to question what the Vatican would do to get the rights to that domain name .
Cadenhead did n't ask the Vatican for money .
Instead , in a humorous manner on his blog he suggested a few things he would trade for :
1 . Three days , two nights at the Vatican hotel .
2 . One of those hats ( referring to the bishop 's hat ) .
3. Complete absolution , no questions asked , for the third week of March 1987 .
Wonder what Rogers did the third week of March in 1987 ?
Me too .
Most of us have at least a week we'd like total forgiveness for .

right above a dirty bookstore
off Euclid avenue
and I stopped taking dope
and I quit drinking whiskey
and my old man plays the trombone
and works out at the track .
and he says that he loves me
even though its not his baby
and he says that he 'll raise him up
like he would his own son
and he gave me a ring
that was worn by his mother
and he takes me out dancin
every saturday nite .
and hey Charley I think about you
everytime I pass a fillin ' station
on account of all the grease
you used to wear in your hair
and I still have that record
of little anthony & the imperials
but someone stole my record player
how do you like that ?
hey Charley I almost went crazy
after mario got busted
so I went back to omaha to
live with my folks
but everyone I used to know
was either dead or in prison
so I came back in minneapolis
this time I think I 'm gonna stay .
hey Charley I think I 'm happy
for the first time since my accident
and I wish I had all the money
that we used to spend on dope
I 'd buy me a used car lot
and I would n't sell any of em
I 'd just drive a different car
every day dependin on how
I feel .
hey Charley
for chrissakes
do you want to know
the truth of it ?
I do n't have a husband
he do n't play the trombone
and I need to borrow money
to pay this lawyer
and Charley , hey
I 'll be eligible for parole
come valentine day

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Attorney General Michael Mukasey on Friday rejected lawmakers ' demands for information as the Justice Department investigates the destruction of tapes showing CIA interrogations of two al Qaeda suspects .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey , left , speaks with President Bush at the White House Wednesday .
In letters to the House and Senate Judiciary committees , Mukasey also said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to conduct the investigation , as some lawmakers had requested .
Mukasey said he would not turn over the material key congressional leaders are seeking because doing so might be seen as bowing to " political influence . "
" At my confirmation hearing , I testified that I would act independently , resist political pressure and ensure that politics plays no role in cases brought by the Department of Justice , " Mukasey said .
" Consistent with that testimony , the facts will be followed wherever they lead in this inquiry and the relevant law applied . "
He sent a third similar letter to Assistant Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin , D - Illinois , who was the first to issue demands for information from the Justice Department .
" With regard to the suggestion that I appoint a special counsel , I am aware of no facts at present to suggest that department attorneys cannot conduct this inquiry in an impartial manner .
If I become aware of information that leads me to a different conclusion , I will act on it , " Mukasey said .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , said he was disappointed by the decision and indicated a confrontation with the new attorney general will come early next year .
" I will ask Attorney General Mukasey -- in public and on the record -- more about the department 's knowledge of and role in the existence and destruction of these videotapes at the committee 's next oversight hearing , which I intend to call early next year , " Leahy said in a written statement .
He also indicated that access to the CIA tape inquiry will be an issue when Mukasey 's nominated deputy comes before the panel for a confirmation hearing next week .
" The committee will also look forward to hearing from deputy attorney general nominee Mark Filip about this matter at his confirmation hearing on December 19 , " Leahy said .
Meanwhile , CIA Inspector General John Helgerson and assistant Attorney General Kenneth Wainstein urged the House Select Committee on Intelligence to abandon its investigation of the tape destruction .
That inquiry would interfere with the inspector general and Justice Department 's own investigation , they said in a letter to committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes , D - Texas , and ranking Republican member Peter Hoekstra , R- Michigan .
" We can not estimate how long this process will take or where it will lead , but pledge to advise you as soon as we conclude that our efforts are no longer at risk or that these requests can be fulfilled without jeopardizing our inquiry , " the letter reads .
The tapes -- showing then - newly approved " alternative " interrogation techniques -- were recorded in 2002 , CIA Director Michael Hayden said earlier this month in a letter to CIA employees .
Osama bin Laden lieutenant Abu Zubayda was one of two al Qaeda suspects videotaped , according to a government official with knowledge of the tapes .
The CIA made the decision to destroy them in 2005 " only after it was determined they were no longer of intelligence value and not relevant to any internal , legislative , or judicial inquiries , " Hayden said .
White House officials have said the president did not learn about the destruction of the tapes until last week .
The preliminary inquiry is to determine " whether further investigation is warranted , " the Justice Department 's assistant attorney general for national security , Kenneth L. Wainstein , said Saturday in a letter to the CIA 's top lawyer , John Rizzo .

The console sales numbers for February are here , and sales have yet to slow down appreciably from the phenomenal year we had in 2007 .
But Microsoft has cause for concern about Sony 's performance .
The Xbox 360 maker told us to expect this a slow month due to supply constraints , but many observers wo n't concern themselves with the whys of a second consecutive disappointing month .
Instead , the story will be that Sony has smoked Microsoft two months running .
Sony now has some strong momentum that it can ride into the launch of industry juggernauts like Metal Gear Solid 4 — which Sony will exploit with a new system bundle to draw in first - time PS3 buyers — and Gran Turismo 5 : Prologue .
Add in the fact that Sony is now sitting on the de-facto high - definition standard in Blu-ray and the PlayStation 3 is by far the most future proof — and affordable — Blu-ray player , it has a distinct advantage for consumers who want more than just games out of their consoles .
According to another study by the NPD Group , gamers are a very media - hungry bunch , and the PlayStation 3 simply gives them more choices in that area than the Xbox 360 .
" Consumers are recognizing the tremendous value of PS3 and we believe that Blu-ray becoming the high - def format of choice was the tipping point for many consumers , " SCEA president Jack Tretton said in a comment about the February numbers .
Sony wants to focus on the strength of the entire PlayStation brand , noting that it generated the most US retail dollars in the industry for the second consecutive month with $ 511 million in sales — 52 percent and 6 percent higher than Microsoft and Nintendo , respectively .
This month 's PlayStation 2 sales prove that Sony has three viable systems filling living rooms with hardware .
Sony
The PlayStation 3 came in at number four position with 280,800 units sold , beating sales of the Xbox 360 by a hefty margin .
The PS3 version of Devil May Cry 4 was a strong seller at number four on the software charts with 233,500 units moved .
Not as good as the 360 version , but with the system 's smaller installed base , it 's an impressive achievement .
Capcom did a great job of making sure both versions of the title were strong , and it paid off .
Developers take note : the PS3 can move third - party games , and this is proof .
Other good news for Sony is the sales of the PlayStation 2 .
The system has historically done very well at retail , but in February Sony sold 351,800 units of the hardware ; that puts the PlayStation 2 in third place for hardware sales , behind only the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo DS .
The PlayStation 2 is also a strong system for the Guitar Hero series , as Guitar Hero 3 charted at number nine in the software charts with 183,800 units sold .
Those are very impressive numbers for the nearly eight - year - old system .
The PSP continues to do well with sales of 243,100 units in February .
Sony 's portable continues to be a destination for some great games , as proven by Patapon , Wipeout Pulse , and now God of War : Chains of Olympus .
Expect as good , if not better , sales for next month .
Nintendo
Another banner month for Nintendo as the company 's two systems take the number one and two slots with ease .
The Nintendo Wii sold 432,000 units , while the Nintendo DS sold 597,600 units .
Nintendo has yet to provide a month in retail that 's anything close to a disappointment .
Nintendo also sells software in great numbers .
Wii Play comes in at number three on the software ( although with a free Wiimote , it 's also technically hardware ) side with 289,700 units sold .
Guitar Hero 3 for the Wii came in fifth place with 222,900 units sold , leading rhythm game fans to again ask where their version of Rock Band is .
Mario and Sonic : Olympic Games on the DS came in sixth place with 205,600 units sold .
Microsoft
Microsoft had a slow month , but then again we were warned this was going to happen .
At a Game Developers Conference press breakfast , John Schappert , the corporate VP of the Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft , told us that supply constraints would continue into February , and we should expect more systems on store shelves in March .
Still , Microsoft managed to sell 254,600 units of hardware , beating only the PlayStation Portable in sales .
With its relatively large installed base , the system is still a monster in terms of shifting games .
The top two slots on the software sales charts belong to 360 games , with Call of Duty 4 taking number one with 296,200 units sold and Devil May Cry 4 at number two with 295,200 units sold .
Lost Odyssey came in at number seven with 203,600 units sold , right above Turok at number seven with 197,700 units .
Rock Band on the 360 took tenth place by moving 161,800 units of the $ 170 game .
" As one would expect moving into this portion of the console lifecycle , the focus is once again upon software sales .
Software sales are up 47 percent for the month of February and 43 percent for the year on a comparable weeks sales basis , " NPD analyst Anita Frazier pointed out .
" With several marquee titles still to come in the front half of the year , the industry is poised to achieve another year of record - breaking sales despite difficult economic conditons . "
If Sony can ride this wave of momentum in larger sales , especially with games like Metal Gear Solid 4 and Gran Turismo 5 : Prologue on the horizon , they could see even better results next month .
Microsoft may be short on ammunition to combat this new threat from Sony , and is starting to react to Sony 's dominance in the European market with price cuts .
Microsoft is far from being on the ropes , but Sony has every indication of being on a roll , and Microsoft needs to come up with a plan to fend off the growing threat .

Ulrich Floresca : Cleaning Up in the Face of ‘ What Is ’ with Zer0 Debris
An interesting Constitutional question from Northern Virginia :
When Fairfax County police were trying to catch a man last month who had molested 11 women , they examined the Virginia sex offender registry and found a possible suspect .
They looked at his background , which included a series of similar assaults , and his residence , which was not far from where the attacks were occurring .
Then , to try to catch him in the act , police slipped a small Global Positioning System device inside the bumper of the van driven by the suspect and began tracking him — without a search warrant and without consulting a prosecutor .
The tactic , officers say , was an almost instant success .
The GPS device placed the van driven by David L. Foltz Jr. , 40 , in the vicinity of a sexual assault Feb .
5 . And when officers began surveilling Foltz the next day , a Fairfax detective saw him drag a woman into a dark area in Falls Church and attack her .
The officer rescued the woman and arrested Foltz .
Foltz ’s attorney , Chris Leibig , said yesterday in Falls Church General District Court that placing the tracking device on the vehicle was a violation of Foltz ’s protection against unreasonable search and seizure .
Arlington County General District Court Judge Richard J. McCue disagreed , denying Leibig ’s motion to suppress police testimony about events that occurred after the device was placed on Foltz ’s van .
In the preliminary hearing that followed , a 46 - year - old Falls Church woman testified that she was grabbed from behind and pulled into a dark area .
Detective Matthew Charron said he saw the attack and knocked Foltz off the woman .
McCue certified Foltz ’s charges of abduction with intent to defile and sexual battery for the Arlington grand jury , which meets next week .
Foltz has not been charged in any of the 11 other similar assaults that have occurred in Fairfax and Alexandria , but police said no similar attacks have happened since he was arrested
The operative part of the Constitution is , quite obviously , the 4th Amendment :
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .
So , the question really is whether placing a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) tracking device on a vehicle parked on a public street and tracking that vehicle on public streets is either an “ unreasonable ” search and seizure or if it is even a search or seizure requiring a warrant at all .
There is one Supreme Court case that comes close to being applicable to the facts of this case .
In United States v. Knotts ( 1983 ) , the Supreme Court was asked to rule on the following case :
Having reason to believe that one Armstrong was purchasing chloroform to be used in the manufacture of illicit drugs , Minnesota law enforcement officers arranged with the seller to place a beeper ( a radio transmitter ) inside a chloroform container that was sold to Armstrong .
Officers then followed the car in which the chloroform was placed , maintaining contact by using both visual surveillance and a monitor which received the beeper signals , and ultimately tracing the chloroform , by beeper monitoring alone , to respondent ’s secluded cabin in Wisconsin .
Following three days of intermittent visual surveillance of the cabin , officers secured a search warrant and discovered the chloroform container , and a drug laboratory in the cabin , including chemicals and formulas for producing amphetamine .
After his motion to suppress evidence based on the warrantless monitoring of the beeper was denied , respondent was convicted in Federal District Court for conspiring to manufacture controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. 846 .
The Court of Appeals reversed , holding that the monitoring of the beeper was prohibited by the Fourth Amendment .
The Supreme reversed the holding below and upheld the conviction :
Monitoring the beeper signals did not invade any legitimate expectation of privacy on respondent ’s part , and thus there was neither a “ search ” nor a “ seizure ” within the contemplation of the Fourth Amendment .
The beeper surveillance amounted principally to following an automobile on public streets and highways .
A person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements .
While respondent had the traditional expectation of privacy within a dwelling place insofar as his cabin was concerned , such expectation of privacy would not have extended to the visual observation from public places of the automobile arriving on his premises after leaving a public highway , or to movements of objects such as the chloroform container outside the cabin .
The fact that the officers relied not only on visual surveillance , but also on the use of the beeper , does not alter the situation .
Nothing in the Fourth Amendment prohibited the police from augmenting their sensory faculties with such enhancement as science and technology afforded them in this case .
In that case , though , the Supreme Court did not rule on the issue of whether the act of placing the tracking device on an automobile without a warrant and probable cause would violate the 4th Amendment and the courts that have ruled on the issue seem to be all over the place :
A Wisconsin district court held , earlier this year , that officers must have reasonable suspicion to believe that a crime is being / has been committed and that the installation of the tracking device will yield evidence of that crime .
U.S. v. Garcia , 2006 WL 298704 ( W.D. Wisconsin 2006 ) .
This court found that reasonable suspicion was enough because “ the intrusion caused by the application of the device is minimal .
The real intrusion . . . is the 24/7 governmental monitoring that follows . ” (…)
A couple of years ago , a New York court went further .
In People v. Lacey , 787 N.Y.S.2d 680 ( N.Y. Co. Court 2004 ) , the court held that police must get a warrant , based on probable cause , to install a tracking device ” “ Although . . . persons have diminished expectations of privacy in automobiles on public roads and can be visually tracked by the police , it is clear that the mere act of parking a vehicle on a public street does not give law enforcement the unfettered right to tamper with the vehicle by surreptitiously attaching a tracking device without either the owner ’s consent or without a warrant issued by a Court .
. . .
Attachment of the GPS requires a physical intrusion into an individual ’s personal effects . . . .
Accordingly , the Court finds that in the absence of exigent circumstances , not here present , the police should have obtained a warrant prior to attaching the GPS to the Mitsubishi . ”
About a month ago , a New Jersey court held that the 4th Amendment requires police to get a warrant before attaching a GPS tracking device .
State v. Scott , 2006 WL 2640221 ( N.J. Super. A.D. 2006 ) . (…)
Other courts have disagreed , basically on the premise that the installation of a GPS tracking device in no way interferes with the vehicle owner ’s possession and use of the vehicle .
As the Ninth Circuit said in U.S. v. McIver , 186 F.3d 1119 ( 1999 ) , “ McIver did not present any evidence that the placement of the . . . tracking devices deprived him of dominion and control of his Toyota 4 Runner , nor did he demonstrate that the presence of these objects caused any damage to the electronic components of the vehicle .
Under these circumstances , we hold that no seizure occurred because the officers did not meaningfully interfere with McIver ’s possessory interest in the Toyota 4 Runner . ”
The case at hand is a hard one to make a general rule from .
There ’s no question that Foltz is guilty of at least one attempted sexual assault because the cops caught him in the act thanks to the GPS tracking device .
He may well have committed the eleven other assaults that the police were investigating when they focused on him .
But if the police violated his Constitutional rights in the process , none of that matters .
Vest that lets video gamers ' feel ' gunshots blamed for violence

A vest that enables video gamers to feel the impact when their characters are shot in - game is raising fears that young people are being desensitized to violence .
The 3rdSpace gaming vest , invented by a Seattle surgeon , includes eight air pistons over vital spots and may be the most sophisticated offering yet in a series of such devices that have been intended to enhance the sensory experience of gaming .
Gamers ' reactions have ranged from mildly interested to highly enthusiastic , but anti-gun campaigners in Britain , where the device has recently become available , are alarmed .
One activist told Channel 4
News that people keep asking her " Why are our kids out in the street killing each other on a weekly basis ? " and warned that it 's because " We feed them a diet of violence . "
However , the vest 's inventor insists that by enabling players to feel the sensation of being shot , it is actually re-sensitizing them to the reality of violence .
This video is from Channel 4 News at Noon , broadcast March 17 , 2008 .

The research could be a boon in hot countries where fridges and air - conditioning systems are vital , say the group of young scientists working at the Innovationszentrum Wiesenbusch Gladbeck ( IWG ) , in cooperation with the University of Applied Science in nearby Gelsenkirchen .
" If you 've ever had to go behind your refrigerator , you may have noticed that cold makes heat , " said Rainer Braun , a professor at IWG .
" That is , the apparatus which keeps your food cold is often too hot to touch .
Why , then , ca n't heat make cold ? "
" Anybody can produce heat by producing coolness , " Braun said .
" But we at IWG are the only ones producing coolness from heat . "
Hot news
Hot countries may be particularly interested in the new cooling technology
It is a question of particular importance in hot countries , where food goes bad quickly and interiors need air - conditioning .
The problem is , though , that cooling is very energy - intensive , and can put stress on electrical generation systems .
So why not look to the biggest source of energy available : the sun ?
The principle of solar cooling , the so - called ammoniac - water absorption technique , has been known since 1810 .
In Gladbeck , this idea has been extrapolated to the idea of using warmth from other processes such as the heat of baking ovens .
Cutting - edge facilities
The German scientists have developed a prototype which very soon could be cooling a cold storage plant in Morocco this way .
Another pilot facility in Gladbeck uses the warmth of a gas turbine to air - condition a lecture hall .
Currently , the IWG is actively recruiting technology companies to rent space in their buildings in northwest Germany which include some six universities and schools of applied science as well as several international airports .
" At the risk of committing an awful pun , it 's a cool place to do some hot research , " Braun said .
Study Shows Gatorade , Red Bull , Coke , Fruit Juice All Erode Teeth ; Gatorade Erodes Fastest

March 9 , 2006 -- Gatorade erodes teeth faster than Coke , a new study shows .
That does n't mean that Gatorade and other sports drinks are necessarily harder on your teeth than are Coke and other soft drinks .
But it may be a surprise that they are n't any better , either , says researcher Leslie A. Ehlen , a student at the University of Iowa School of Dentistry .
" I do n't think everybody realizes how erosive these things are , especially Gatorade and Red Bull , " Ehlen tells WebMD .
" People need to be aware that all sorts of beverages can be causing dental erosion . "
Ehlen presented the study at this week 's annual meeting of the American Association for Dental Research in Orlando , Fla .
More and more dentists now think sugary drinks are the major culprit in tooth decay , says Brian Burt , PhD , professor emeritus of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health .
" There is pretty good evidence now that this is not just sports drinks , but soft drinks and juices in general , " Burt tells WebMD .
" They have become the main source of sugars in the diet .
It comes down to the more sugar in the drink , the more risk of [ cavities ] to the person drinking it . "
1 Day of Soft Drinks , Lots of Erosion
The University of Iowa researchers covered extracted teeth with nail polish .
They left bare two patches on each tooth , one on the enamel and one on the root .
Then they dunked the teeth in test tubes filled with regular Coke , Diet Coke , Gatorade , Red Bull , or 100 % apple juice .
Every five hours , the researchers refreshed the beverages .
After 25 hours , they examined the teeth with a microscope .
All of the beverages eroded the bare spots on the teeth .
But different beverages had significantly different effects .
On the enamel , Gatorade was significantly more corrosive than Red Bull and Coke .
Red Bull and Coke , in turn , were significantly more corrosive than Diet Coke and apple juice .
On the roots of the teeth , Gatorade was more corrosive than Red Bull .
Coke , apple juice , and Diet Coke followed in that order .
The difference in the effect is n't simply due to their sugar content .
Gatorade is 6 % carbohydrates , mostly sugars .
Coke is about 10 % sugar .
Both are acidic beverages .
University of Michigan pediatric dental researcher Michael Ignelzi , DDS , PhD , has recently reviewed new research on the effects of beverages on children 's teeth .
But he says there 's no evidence showing that sports drinks are any worse than other soft drinks .
" I know of no data that sports drinks are more harmful than other drinks , " Ignelzi tells WebMD .
Sports Drinks and Cavities
Because of their acidity and sugar content , researchers have studied the role of sports drinks in the development of cavities .
Most of the studies , however , exonerate the sports drinks .
Craig Horswill , PhD , senior research fellow at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute , in 2005 reported a study of saliva flow in endurance athletes who drank Gatorade , diluted orange juice , a homemade sports drink , or water .
The study showed that if the sports drinks had any effect , it was to decrease dehydration and increase saliva flow , which reduces cavity formation .
More to the point , a 2002 Ohio State University study of 304 athletes found no link between sports - drink use and dental erosion .
The study was sponsored by Quaker Oats , which makes Gatorade .
" Dental erosion among users of sports drinks in the Ohio State study was the same as it was in nonusers , " Horswill tells WebMD .
" And they averaged 10 years of sports drink use . "
Ignelzi says that what matters most is n't which beverage people drink .
It 's how and when they drink it .
" A lot of things can cause [ cavities ] , including sugared drinks .
It is the way they are taken that is most important , " he says .
" The frequency of exposure is key .
If you sip a Pepsi all day , that is very harmful .
But if you are taking any sweet or carb -- cheese puffs , bread , raisins -- if you take it during meals , it is a good thing .
Because the saliva stimulated by your chewing buffers the acid .
But if you are constantly snacking on sweets or sipping a sweet beverage , your teeth are exposed to acid all day long . "

QUESTION
See Answer
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Shocked Bear Stearns BSC.N employees trudged into work Monday morning desperately seeking clarity on their futures .
Bear Stearns ' headquarters is seen in New York March 14 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
The fact that the first person they met on entering their headquarters in midtown Manhattan was a salesman hawking cheaper apartments did little to lift their mood -- an ironic twist , perhaps , given that it was risky speculation in the housing market that got the bank into trouble in the first place .
“ I ’ve been at Bear for 11 years and I want to vomit , ” said a Bear Stearns employee , who described himself as a partner , as he entered the striking seven - year - old octagonal building two blocks from Grand Central Terminal .
To add insult to injury , someone had taped a $ 2 bill to the revolving glass doors at the 46th and Vanderbilt Avenue entrance -- some gallows humor on the bargain - basement $ 2 - a share price JPMorgan Chase JPM.N paid for Bear Stearns .
“ Where is the $ 2 bill ? ” joked one employee , “ I might need that tomorrow ! ”
At the Madison Avenue entrance , Ray Schmitz , a Realtor with Coldwell Banker , was betting that with the value of their stock options in tatters , Bear ’s employees might soon be looking to trade their luxury homes for something a little easier on the budget .
“ You have to go where the business is , ” Schmitz said as he handed out business cards .
“ A lot of these people are going to lose their jobs , and most of their wealth will have been in share options .
They ’re soon going to be looking for a cheaper place to live . ”
FEAR
But generally , the mood was somber as employees arrived at work .
The fear of job losses among bankers , traders and other staff comes as Wall Street grapples with a deepening credit crisis and the threat of recession in the United States grips financial institutions .
“ It ’s an awful day , everyone is really upset , ” one employee said .
Street vendor Hassan El Ashkar , who sells coffee and bagels outside the bank ’s Manhattan headquarters , had his morning rush at 6 a.m. , much earlier than usual .
“ Of course I am worried , ” he said .
“ These are my customers .
My customers came earlier than usual today , to see what ’s going on .
They ’re all worried about their jobs . ”
Bear Stearns , roughly 30 percent - owned by its staff and proud of its above - average level of inside ownership , employs 14,000 people .
JPMorgan is paying just $ 2 a share for the 85 - year - old Bear , valuing the fifth - biggest U.S. investment bank at $ 236 million -- just 1/15th of its market value on Friday and way below its record share price of more than $ 172 last year .
< ID :nN16640873 > < ID :nN16500718 >
The bailout punctuates an eight - month slide in Bear Stearns ’ fortunes as investors lost confidence in the smallest of the major securities houses and one known as an aggressive trader in credit and mortgage markets .
“ It ’s going to be grim today .
I do n’t know if I ’ll have a job at the end of today , ” said a Bear research assistant .
“ The price is crazy .
Someone who ’d won the lottery could have paid that price . ”
There was also anger and frustration at how the situation was handled .
“ I ’m sad and I ’m angry at my own senior management , ” said one employee .
NO PARACHUTES
To add insult to injury , Bear Stearns does not offer payouts , known as ‘ golden parachutes , ’ for executives in the event of it being taken over .
A Tokyo financial industry recruiter , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue , said he knew firsthand of Bear Stearns employees looking to jump ship .
“ We ’re already seeing people looking at moves from within that organization , ” he said .
Although the takeover means JPMorgan adds Bear ’s prime brokerage and asset management business to its franchise , it is likely to sell other parts of the business and many jobs could disappear .
In Asia , there was some relief that the bank had been rescued .
“ It ’s not a bankruptcy , that ’s the good news , but JPMorgan is going to come out today and tell us what they think of us , ” the Singapore Bear Stearns employee said .
“ It ’s better to be out here in Asia than to be in New York . ”
In London , where Bear employs 1,500 staff in the financial district of Canary Wharf , some employees were less willing to speak , only confirming that they worked for the bank .
One Bear Stearns employee , when asked for a reaction snapped : “ You must be joking .
What are you , a vulture ?
Get a life . ”
" What do you all think ? " she asked Spence .
" This is what you 've been waiting for , for a long time . "
" You know , Roy , they 'll say a lot of things about our marriage . "
" Yeah . "
" What should we do about that ? "
Spence told Clinton to tell the truth , according to First In His Class : A Biography Of Bill Clinton ( 1995 ) , by David Maraniss .
Tell the truth ?
How on earth could they tell the truth about Bill Clinton 's sexual predations and win the White House ?
Instead , she chose implausible denials .
Even after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke in the White House itself , she attributed it to a " vast right - wing conspiracy " .
Why is this relevant ?
Because it indicates the scale of the political baggage she would bring to a presidential campaign as the Democratic nominee .
Because it is an insight into the scale of the devil 's bargain she entered into in her quest for power .
Because she has tolerated the intolerable while presenting herself as a feminist .
And because she has been engaged in a cover - up for 20 years .
The following is a list of women who have appeared in credible biographies or news reports .
All , with one exception , have made on - the - record comments : Eileen Wellstone : as a 19 - year - old student she lodged a complaint of sexual assault against Bill Clinton , in 1969 while he was at Oxford .
She reconfirmed the incident to reporters in 1999 .
Elizabeth Ward Gracen : a former Miss America , she admitted she had sex with Clinton in 1982 , when he was governor of Arkansas .
Sally Miller Perdue : a former Miss Arkansas , she had an affair with Clinton in 1983 .
Mary Jo Jenkins : the new biography by the Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein , A Woman In Charge , says Bill Clinton had a long affair with Jenkins .
Sharlene Wilson : told a grand jury she saw Clinton taking cocaine and has also said she saw him having sex at the Coachman 's Inn in Arkansas when he was governor .
Dolly Kyle Browning : wrote a memoir about her 14 - year relationship with Clinton .
Gennifer Flowers : said she had a 12 - year affair with Clinton .
Carolyn Moffet : after meeting Clinton in 1979 , said he exposed himself to her in a hotel room and asked for oral sex .
Paula Jones : said that after she met Clinton on May 8 , 1991 , he exposed his erect penis and asked for oral sex .
Sandra Allen James : said Clinton pinned her against the wall and put his hand up her dress in 1991 .
Christy Zercher : a flight attendant , said Clinton fondled her breasts on a flight during the 1991 presidential campaign .
Juanita Broaddrick : broke down on national television when describing an alleged sexual assault by Clinton in 1978 .
Wrote an open letter accusing Hillary of cover-ups .
Kathleen Willey : told CBS 's 60 Minutes she was groped by President Clinton in the White House on November 29 , 1993 .
Monica Lewinsky : had sexual trysts in the White House , about which President Clinton lied .
The list is not exhaustive .
Now that Senator Clinton 's campaign is in trouble , feminist dogmatists are arguing that it is because she is a woman .
But it is her increasingly shrill campaign , her lapses in judgment and , above all , her inability to match the charisma of her Democratic opponent that have led to 11 consecutive defeats in the primaries .
All this plus a fatigue with the Clintons ' 30 years of seeking power .
Her campaign has stayed afloat only thanks to the fractious relationship between blacks and Hispanics , who remain the only group still steadfast to her cause , by an overwhelming margin , in the run-up to this week 's crucial Texas primary .
The irony now is that the Clintons are fighting a fierce rearguard action to prevent the first black American from becoming president .
If Barack Obama loses the nomination because of the Clintons , the African - American vote will implode in November , and take the Democrats down with it .
Senator Clinton 's biggest problem is that she is sanctimonious .
This is personified by the biography on her website , HillaryClinton.com , which describes her legal career as if she were Mother Teresa : " Hillary chose not to pursue offers from major law firms .
Instead she followed her heart and a man named Bill Clinton to Arkansas ...
Hillary ran a legal aid clinic for the poor when she first got to Arkansas and handled cases of foster care and child abuse .
Years later , she organised a group called Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families ...
Hillary continued to advocate for children , leading a taskforce to improve education in Arkansas through higher standards for schools and serving on the board of the Arkansas Children 's Hospital , helping them expand and improve their services ...
She also continued her legal career as a partner in a law firm . "
I highlight the last sentence because it is so carefully misleading .
The biography devotes 95 per cent of her legal career to her public advocacy work even though she spent just 10 months in public advocacy and 15 years as a corporate lawyer .
She worked for the Rose Law Firm , the top commercial firm in Arkansas , from 1976 to 1991 .
She earned more than her husband .
She also served on the board of Wal - Mart , one of the most anti-union corporations in America .
That 's why Obama has begun to lace his speeches with barbs about Wal - Mart .
Hillary Clinton 's problem is not her gender but her character .
Cotillard won her Oscar for playing legendary French singer Edith Piaf
" I think we 're lied to about a lot of things , " she said during a French TV interview broadcast in 2006 , which has resurfaced on the internet .
Cotillard , 32 , won her Oscar for La Vie en Rose , for playing singer Edith Piaf .
Her lawyer , Vincent Toledano , told news agency AFP she had " never intended to contest nor question the attacks " .
He added she " regrets the way old remarks have been taken out of context " .
Transcript
In the interview , given to French TV network Paris Premiere , Cotillard appears to suggest the attacks on the World Trade Center were staged to avoid the expense of refurbishing them .
" We see other towers of the same kind being hit by planes , are they burned ? " she asks .
" There was a tower , I believe it was in Spain , which burned for 24 hours .
" It never collapsed .
None of these towers collapsed .
And there [ in New York ] , in a few minutes , the whole thing collapsed . "
Moon landing questioned
The Twin Towers , she claims , were a " money sucker " that would have cost much more to modernise than to destroy .
The actress goes on to cast doubt on the Moon landing of 1969 .
" Did a man really walk on the moon ? " she asks .
" I saw plenty of documentaries on it and I really wondered .
In any case I do n't believe all they tell me . "
A transcript of Cotillard 's interview has been posted on France 's Marianne2 website .
The actress , who has won numberous awards for her performance as Piaf , is due to begin filming gangster movie Public Enemies with actor Johnny Depp shortly .

For some time now , I have been searching the web to find info about barcodes .
Suddenly , I found a new challenge to accept .
Ever since I have dug up my old Cuecat I have been somewhat interested in barcodes .
However , decrypting barcodes by hand never crossed my mind until I wanted to log into a teacher 's computer account at my high school .
On many days , I have computer work to do in study hall , yet , I do n't want to use the computers provided by the school .
My study hall teacher , being extremely nice , lets me use the private computer in her office .
To get into the office , she gives me her keys to use , which also reluctantly includes her school ID .
Everyone in my school is issued one of these IDs , and everyone is given a specific ID # .
On student IDs , there is a barcode containing your ID number , and your ID # printed beneath that .
However , on teachers '
IDs , there is only a barcode .
The obvious choice would be to bring the Cuecat to school and hook it up to her computer .
In an attempt to do this , I discovered that I needed to shutdown the computer first , or the keyboard would not respond .
Then a surprise ; she has a BIOS password enabled !
Even though I could just take the internal battery out , if someone walked in when I was taking apart the computer , I would have basically no future ever using her computer again .
Another choice would be to take a picture of her ID , run it through a couple of sharpening / despeckling filters in Photoshop , and readjust the image proportions to make a perfectly square barcode that is printable .
Then I might be able to print the new image and scan it with my Cuecat .
A problem with this is that someone is bound to notice the camera flash going off ( cameras are banned in my school . )
My final option that I discussed over and over in my head would to be to recreate the barcode by coping it with a good 'ol pad of graph paper and a Sharpie .
I learned that the barcode code used in all IDs of my school are in Code 39 , which would be somewhat easily recreated .
Code 39 is easy to recreate because it only uses two types of lines : wide and narrow .
Also , each code has a beginning sequence ( thin black , wide white , thin black ) , and an ending sequence ( thin black , wide white , thin black , thin white , wide black , thin white , wide black , thin white , thin black . )
To start the coping process , you need the following :
Sheet of graph paper
Writing utensil ( pen is easier to see )
Bar / ASCII translating tool ( look at Wikipedia article for a table , format 2 )
To start , look at the barcode you want to decode .
On the graph paper , take record of the barcode using whatever means you feel comfortable with .
I use binary , as it is very easy to read .
After you transfer your barcode into binary , you can then figure out which letter corresponds to each combination of bars .
A wide black line is B , a thin black line is b , a wide white line is W , and a thin white line is w .
Make combinations of letters until you have your barcode .
Then all there is to do is find the corresponding letters / numbers and you have successfully decrypted a Code 39 barcode !
** BTW : I got a Saturday morning detention for " peeking " at my attendance records .
Please , do not use this information to gain access to anything you are not supposed to have access to .
THIS IS MY DISCLAIMER .
Taiwan is developing a bomb designed to wipe out China 's electrical system , according to the United Daily News .
The newspaper claims that Taiwan – still dubbed a " renegade Province " by China – is working on a graphite bomb similar to one the U.S. reportedly used against Serbia in 1999 .
According to wire articles about the original report :
* Should war break out , the so - called " blackout bombs " would be carried by Hsiungfeng 2E cruise missiles to paralyze the power systems of China 's southeastern coastal cities , the United Daily News said . *
* The bombs work by sprinkling a cloud of chemically treated carbon fibers over power supplies , causing them to short - circuit , but without killing people . *
* If approved by parliament , the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology - Taiwan 's top arms research unit - would begin research and development of the weaponry at a cost of up to NT$ 500 million ( US $ 15.34 million ) , beginning next year , according to the report . *
* Taiwan 's defense ministry declined to comment on the claims . *
I was watching a BBC broadcast about the protests marking the fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq and came to the conclusion that the American public either has ADD or someone , maybe Dick Cheney , is spiking the public drinking water supply with LSD .
I found myself becoming infuriated with the fact that the American people actually think the " war is going pretty well right now . "
Those were the reporter 's exact words .
I made it a point to write them down because I could n't believe what I was hearing .
The propaganda about the " surge " working is apparently being bought lock , stock and barrel .
I 'm trying to understand how this administration could possibly have earned this level of trust , particularly since everything about this war is based on outright lies .
The lies are a matter of public record .
A complete summary of the 935 lies manufactured by the Bush administration to justify the Iraq war , which of our public officials told them and when they were told can be seen at www.publicintegrity.org .
Let there be absolutely no mistake here .
What was done is both illegal and impeachable .
George Bush looked the American people and Congress in the eye and lied and his minions , even Colin Powell , followed suit .
They lied about weapons of mass destruction .
They lied about finding a bio -weapons lab .
They lied about Iraq trying to purchase yellowcake uranium from Niger .
They lied about Saddam Hussein being involved in the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks .
They continue to lie about this war .
So , please , tell me again why Americans should believe one word out of our commander - in - chief 's mouth about the surge working .
However , beyond the " illegal " aspect , I am ashamed that the American people could buy into a war that is so immoral on so many fronts .
Americans talk about Iraq like it 's nothing more than a mass of land .
It is n't .
It 's a country made up of people just as is America .
Until we invaded their country , Iraqis got up every day , went to work and took care of their families .
While we sat glued to our television sets and reveled in the " shock and awe " of America 's military might , innocent men , women and children were dying for absolutely no good reason at all .
More than a million Iraqis have died in this war , and at least two million have been displaced .
Of course , Americans can assuage themselves by buying into the lie that the " surge " has resulted in decreased violence .
While it 's true that there were fewer deaths in January ( 20 deaths a day due to political violence ) , there were increases in February ( 29 deaths a day ) and March ( 39 deaths a day ) .
While Dick Cheney was spinning his rosy view of the war during his unannounced visit to Iraq earlier this week , one of the deadliest days ever was unfolding in Karbala , where a suicide bombing killed 50 people and injured dozens more .
The so - called " surge " is going in the opposite direction of what the administration wants you to believe .
Of course , it 's easy for Americans to look casually at war .
We 've never had a war on our own soil .
We 've not been displaced .
We 've not had a first - hand look at the violence of war and the innocent lives lost for the missteps our leaders take .
We do n't worry about going to the market to buy food and perhaps dying in a roadside bombing .
Yes , we look at images on a television , but we really only see what the perpetrators want us to see and we can turn it off any time we want .
American culture glorifies and romanticizes war .
It rarely focuses on its destructive effects .
And while our president referred to the 9 - 11 terrorists attacks as being " at war , " what happened in New York City on September 11 , 2001 pales in comparison to what has been going on in Iraq for the past five years .
Lest I 'm accused of being a terrorist sympathizer or an unpatriotic citizen , I have not forgotten that we are approaching 4,000 American deaths in Iraq for a war that has had absolutely nothing to do with protecting our nation from attack .
This senseless war is not about fighting for freedom or protecting the American way of life .
It is not about avenging the terror attacks of 9 - 11 .
While some Americans seem to find comfort in the belief that we are fighting the good fight , the facts are that Iraq was not involved in the terrorists attacks and that America was never threatened or in imminent danger from Iraq .
Even one American soldier 's death in Iraq would be too high a price to pay for this unjustifiable war .
President Bush has played the " God - is - on - our - side " card time and time again when justifying the invasion of Iraq , painting himself as God 's own freedom warrior .
Whether you 're Christian , Jewish , Buddhist , or Protestant , the notion that any " god " would approve of the death and destruction and the not - so - holy - acts of torture and abuse going on in Iraq is repugnant .
It is the most immoral position of all for our born - again president to take .
And Americans who stand side - by - side with President Bush on the issue of Iraq should take another hard look and reconsider .
It is time for Americans to look beyond their own comfort zone , make the Iraq war an election issue again , and demand an end to it .

プログラミング言 語 「 Python」のバージョンアップ版「 Python 2.6 」 と「 Python 3.0」の開発作業が同時並行で進められており、いずれも2008年に登場する見込みだ。Pythonの知的財産権の管理と普及推進を行うPython Software Foundationの幹部が11月21日に明らかにした。
同団体のディレクター、デビッド・グッドガー（David Goodger）氏によると、先行してリリースされるPython 2.6は 、Python 3.0への移行支援を目的とするバージョンであるという。Python 3.0は基本機能が強化されるが、Python 2.xと互換性がない部分がある。なお、「 Python 3000 」という開発コード名でも呼ばれている。
Goodger氏によれば 、PythonはWeb開発などの用途で普及しており、メモリ管理や変数宣言のような作業を開発者の代わりに行うなどの長所を持っている。「プログラマーにとって、Pythonはほかの言語よりもずっとなじみやすい」（同氏）
また 、Pythonには 、Python Software Foundationがメンテナンスしているコア・ディストリビューションのほかに、サードパーティが開発するバージョンがある。例えば、
Microsoftの.NET Frameworkに対応した 「 IronPython 」 や 、Java実装 の 「 Jython」などがある。
Python 2.6では、プログラム をPython 3.0に対応させる作業を容易にするツールが提供される。これにより、ユーザーはPython 3.0と既存プログラムに非互換な点があるかどうかを判断できる。
Python 3.0では 、Unicodeのサポートにより国際化機能が強化されるほか、print文を関数にすることによりプログラムで「print」という語が使えるようになるなどの変更が加えられる。また、各種OS間での互換性の向上を図る新しいI/Oライブラリも用意される。
「 Python が1991年に最初にリリースされてからの間、オリジナルの設計には部分的に問題があると多くの人が考えるようになった。われわれは今回のアップグレードを機に、そうした問題点を修正するつもりだ」（Goodger氏）
Python 2.6はベータ版が2008年の2月ごろリリースされ、正式版が3月か4月にリリースされる予定。Python 3.0は現在アルファ版の段階にある。3月14から16日にシカゴで開催されるPython開発者向けのコンファレンス「PyCon」の会期中にベータ版がリリースされ、正式版は8月にリリースされる見込みだ。
Goodger氏によれば 、Pythonのコア・プラットフォームの担当チームは、Python 2.xの開発を継続するかもしれないが、Python 3.0で提供される最適化機能の一部は、2.xの後続版には搭載されない見通しだという。
PyConでは 、Pythonのリード開発者グイード・バン・ロッサム（Guido van Rossum）氏が 、Python 3.0に関するプレゼンテーションを行う。同氏は今年6月に自身のブログで、Python 3.0のねらいを次のように説明している。「 Python 3000は、将来に向けて下位互換性を放棄し、Pythonを最高の言語とすることを優先目標とする初のバージョンだ」

In a legal effort to help a US senator , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) is arguing that people who have sex in public toilets have an expectation of privacy .
Republican Senator Larry Craig is asking the Minnesota Court of Appeals to let him withdraw his guilty plea to disorderly conduct related to a bathroom sex sting at the Minneapolis airport last year .
Craig was arrested by an undercover police officer who said Craig tapped his feet and swiped his hand under a stall divider in a way that signalled he wanted sex .
Craig has denied that , saying his actions were misconstrued .
US forces mistakenly killed at least a dozen road construction workers in air strikes in eastern Afghanistan , Afghan officials said today .
As many as 14 engineers and labourers were killed in the incident on Monday in Nuristan province , which officials blamed on faulty intelligence , possibly fed out by the Taliban .
The workers , who had been contracted by the US military to build a road in the mountainous province , were sleeping in their tents when they were killed , according to Sayed Noorullah Jalili , director of the road construction company Amerifa .
" All of our poor workers have been killed , " Jalili said .
" I do n't think the Americans were targeting our people .
I 'm sure it's the enemy of the Afghans who gave the Americans this wrong information . "
The company has asked the US military to investigate the information that led to the air strike , Jalili said .
The Nuristan governor , Tamim Nuristani , said US troops had been tipped off that a feared local Taliban commander was in the area but they hit the wrong target .
The US - led coalition said it was investigating the incident .
The International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) confirmed it had conducted air strikes against Taliban fighters in the area , but did not say when .
" ISAF was engaged in Nurgaram and Du Ab districts , and in those places we used air strikes against [ Taliban ] , " said the ISAF spokesman , Brigadier General Carlos Branco .
" The situation is not clear at all at this stage .
We are carrying out the investigation and trying to get a clear picture . "
The incident is likely to fuel Afghan resentment at the presence of international forces .
Earlier this year , foreign troops came under scathing criticism for conducting air strikes based on poor intelligence that caused a number of civilian casualties .
Afghanistan has seen a steady rise in violence over the past two years since the Taliban renewed its attempt to overthrow the pro-western Afghan government and eject more than 50,000 foreign troops .
The military has n't officially named the operation , to shoot a rogue satellite out of orbit – or , at least , they have n't told us civilians the name , yet .
So we figured we'd give 'em a hand , by coming up with some names of our own .
Vote up or down on the titles below – or come up with your own .
You 'll be doing your country a tremendous service ...
Submit a name
Suggest as many as you want .
But try to have a sense of humor about this , okay ?
And , of course , we reserve the right to yank any names out of the voting , for any reasons .
Now get busy !

Up to 100K Los Angeles voters likely wo n't have ballots counted Nick Juliano

As many as 100,000 independent voters in Los Angeles did not -- and most likely will not -- have their ballots counted in last week 's Democratic presidential primary because of an unnecessarily complex system , inadequately trained poll workers and little effort by elections officials to notify voters of the proper procedures , according to news reports and voting - rights activists .
In a system that seemed tailor made to fail , more than half of the Decline to State voters who cast ballots last week in Los Angeles County have been effectively disenfranchised .
Unlike every other county in California , LA County requires unaffiliated voters to fill in an extra bubble on their ballot clarifying whether they plan to vote in the Democratic or American Independent Party primaries .
( California 's Republican party bars independent voters from casting ballots in its primary . )
Counting the ballots would not change the outcome in LA County , where Hillary Clinton beat Barack Obama by more than 160,000 votes , but that is not the point , say outraged voters who are seething now that they 've learned their exercise in democracy was fruitless .
" I was disenfranchised , and I am furious , " wrote independent Steve Katinsky in an e-mail to the Los Angeles Times .
" This nonpartisan registered voting disaster makes Florida look like pikers in election screw - ups .
To find out my vote did not count was a sudden and unexpected shock and is completely unacceptable . "
Voting rights group the Courage Campaign has started a petition urging LA County registrar Dean Logan to initiate a hand - count of ballots .
But elections officials say that may be impossible because the same optical - scan ballot was used for Democratic and American Independent primaries .
As the Times explained : In the American Independent contest , there were three candidates running , while the Democratic Party had eight .
The bubbles for the first three candidates in each party were in the same position on the ballot , making it impossible to tell after the fact if a voter was voting Democratic or American Independent -- unless that person also filled in the bubble indicating party preference .
In addition to being the only county to require the extra party - identifying step , Los Angeles County is the only one not to print candidates names directly on the ballot , making a re-count virtually impossible .
" Logically we know that most of these ballots were Democratic , because the number of American Independent Party voters is very small , " Secretary of State Debra Bowen told the Times .
" But in a democracy we do n't guess what the voter 's intent was . "
Although he insisted his office " takes the issue of voter enfranchisement very seriously , " Logan seemed to blame the problems on the voters in a statement responding to the complaints .
It is important to note that while hundreds of thousands of voters across the state encountered new voting systems this election , voters in Los Angeles County were fortunate to be able to cast their ballots using InkaVote Plus , which has been in place for several elections .
The manner in which cross over voting was presented in Los Angeles County was no different than that of the last three statewide primary elections ( 2002 , 2004 and 2006 ) .
The voter instructions provided in the sample ballot booklets , which were mailed to all voters in the County , highlighted the steps to be taken by nonpartisan voters when voting a cross over ballot .
Likewise , poll worker training materials and the actual vote recorder page instructions were consistent with past practice .
Additionally , this office engaged in extensive voter outreach and education focused on cross over voting .
That the system was used before also should n't provide Logan much comfort or cover .
The Sacramento Bee observed in an editorial that only 40 percent of independent voters ' ballots were counted in those elections .
" It is outrageous that the county knew of this massive disenfranchisement and did not make changes , " the paper said .
" This calls for an investigation . "
The instructions mailed to voters made passing reference to the need to fill in the extra bubble at the bottom of the pagelong document , but poll workers say they were not told of the special instructions before last Tuesday 's election , which featured vastly higher turnout than any of the previous elections Logan mentioned because of the intensely contested presidential race .
" No mention was ever given about the requirement to fill in the dot for either party before choosing a particular candidate , " Michael Nola , an LA county poll worker who attended two pre-election training sessions told the Times .
By mid-afternoon on election day , officials finally got around to informing him and other poll workers of the election requirement , but by then he and countless other independent voters already had cast their ballots , he said .
" Both my wife and I lost our votes by this needless oversight . "
“ There is no crisis to be dealt with or managed when you are first lady ”

From the Associated Press on March 8 , 2008 :
“ Her experience speaks for itself , ” says former U.N. ambassador Richard Holbrooke , who is advising Clinton ’s campaign .
She was n’t the one making the final decisions on U.S. policy , he says , but “ no one in the world got a better idea of the countervailing pressures .
The most important decision a president can make is to send Americans into harm ’s way .
She knows what that entails . ”
A contrary view comes from Susan Rice , a former assistant secretary of state from the Clinton years and an Obama campaign adviser .
She said Clinton ’s involvement with foreign policy as first lady was “ laudable and important , but it is hardly the same thing as the kind of crisis management ” that is required of a president .
“ There is no crisis to be dealt with or managed when you are first lady , ” Rice said .
hm .
Hillary Clinton ’s adviser says that the most important decision “ a president can make ” is about sending the military into harm ’s way .
So she gets a big ‘ fail ’ for voting to start the Iraq war , right ?
Holbrooke also describes Clinton as having had foreign policy experience unlike anyone else in “ the world . ”
With all of this awareness of “ countervailing pressures , ” it might seem plausible that she really should have known better than to vote to send our troops into Iraq .
Although , on the other hand , maybe she did n’t have the broad experience she ’s claiming now , which would explain her lack of opposition to the war at a time when it could have done some significant good .
If she had gone after the idea of war in Iraq like her campaign has gone after Obama , maybe we would n’t be fighting a war in Iraq at all .
Maybe her ability to throw a wrench into an otherwise smooth political process could have bought enough time for the mistake of an invasion to become painfully clear before we preemptively invaded the country .

Moths remember life as caterpillar
During the dramatic transformation from caterpillar to moth , memories and minds remain at least somewhat intact , according to a new study .
The study , published in the journal PloS ONE , found that moths and perhaps butterflies often recall what they learn as ground - dwelling insects , revealing how resilient memory may be .
" Caterpillars are built for crawling and chewing plant material , while moths and butterflies are built for flying and drinking nectar , " says Dr Douglas Blackiston from Georgetown University , who led the recent study .
" As such , the adult butterfly must rearrange its digestive system and develop distinct muscles for flight and walking on its long legs . "
The morphing caterpillar 's brain also grows in size and complexity to reflect the insect 's drastic lifestyle transition .
Whether its memories endure during those changes was a mystery , until now .
Inside the mind of an insect
To test more specifically what goes on in the insect 's mind during metamorphosis , Blackiston and his colleagues borrowed tobacco hornworm caterpillar larvae from the insect laboratory at North Carolina State University .
The researchers conditioned the caterpillars to avoid the chemical ethyl acetate , which smells like pear juice .
Since caterpillars do n't naturally avoid ethyl acetate , the researchers gave some of the insects a mild electrical shock whenever they encountered it .
The insects quickly learned to avoid the telltale odour .
After the caterpillars morphed into moths , the scientists exposed them to the chemical again .
Just as babies do not appear to remember anything until reaching a certain stage of brain development , the moths only recalled what they learned if the experience occurred after they were three weeks old .
Insects that had been conditioned before that age did not avoid the chemical , while those conditioned after that point appeared to retain the memory .
" We now know that the [ insect 's ] brain is extensively rewired , although not built from scratch by any means , " says Blackiston .
He says that many memory - storing neurones may remain intact during the transformation and make new connections as the insect ages .
Pest control
In the future , the findings could improve pest control techniques , since the research may help explain why insects often lay eggs on plants they apparently remember eating when they were larvae .
The research could also help to determine how brains cope with large - scale changes , and how memory survives even after a nervous system is largely rewired , Blackiston says .
Fred Gagnon is the curator of butterflies at the Magic Wings butterfly conservatory in South Deerfield , Massachusetts , and doubts caterpillars could form many memories beyond odour - based ones .
He says this is because they have very poor vision and " just eat all of the time without moving much " .
But the conditioning aspect of the study does n't surprise him as butterflies , like dogs and cats , can be socialised and trained .
" If you raise them in captivity , they are much less afraid of human contact than those taken from the wild , " Gagnon says .
" You can even train them to land on your finger . "
On Monday , ranch officials prevented Pinnacle workers from entering the property , telling them they would be in a “ breach of the peace ” if they tried to do so .
The conflict is the latest skirmish in a long war between ranchers and energy companies over a natural gas known as coal - bed methane .
Technology created in the 1990s allowed producers to cheaply tap natural gas that occurs near the surface in underground coal deposits .
That prompted a boom in the West , especially in Colorado , New Mexico and Wyoming .
The technology has also generated controversy in cattle country because of something called split estate .
The Stock Raising Homestead
Act of 1916 gave land to ranchers , but reserved the mineral rights underneath for the federal government , which leased it to energy companies .
There are about 60 million acres of split - estate land in the West .
The Mars ranch has about 10,300 acres of federal mineral leases .
While energy companies often reach an agreement over the use of a rancher ’s land , they have the upper hand legally and the landowner cannot deny access .
The judge required Pinnacle to post a $ 10,000 bond for possible damages on the ranch .
The methane occurs in aquifers , and to get the gas , producers pump out huge volumes of water , strip out the gas and then dispose of the water .
Mr. Mars , who according to Forbes magazine is worth about $ 14 billion and whose company , Mars Inc. , produces Snickers and M&M ’s , among other candies , has said he opposes the development because of the volume of water that would be pumped out .
LONDON , Feb 10 - ( Reuters ) -
The extent of Europe ’s infection from the U.S. subprime mortgage virus is becoming clearer , even as the European Central Bank faces down calls for it to follow U.S. and UK counterparts by cutting interest rates .
Early estimates of fourth - quarter national output from the big euro zone economies are due later this week .
The picture is probably one of growth in the 15 - nation currency area marginally outstripping the U.S. economy in the final quarter of last year .
But there are growing signs the credit crisis and looming U.S. recession have hit Europe deeper than policymakers seem willing to acknowledge .
Hopes that the euro zone can remain partly insulated from a U.S. housing bust and recession are receding .
Cisco Systems CSCO.O , the largest maker of the routers and switches that direct traffic on data networks , warned last week of a rapid slowdown in both U.S. and European orders .
Significantly , the Cisco numbers suggested conditions were deteriorating faster in Europe than the United States .
In the quarter through January order growth in Europe more than halved to 8 percent .
U.S. order growth slipped only one percentage point to 12 percent .
“ It ’s the most cautious I ’ve seen CEOs in the U.S. and Europe in many years , ” Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said .
That tallied with last week ’s shock service sector surveys .
Any suggestion that Europe was weathering a U.S. - focused downturn seemed wide of the mark .
While attention largely centered on a plunge in confidence among U.S. service firms in January , German , Spanish and Italian service sectors also recorded their first contraction in years .
Financial markets are waking up also to the idea that it may be dangerous to use the relatively robust ECB economic forecasts as anything other than an interest rate pointer .
“ The market is becoming aware that the crisis in the United States will indeed have an adverse impact on growth in Europe , ” said Heino Ruland , strategist at FrankfurtFinanz in Germany .
Pan-European stock markets have had one of their worst January performances on record and entered bear market territory in the course of that month .
The FTSEurofirst .
FTEU3 lost another four percent this week .
“ We now see a deterioration in the euro area , ” said Luca Paolini , strategist at Credit Suisse .
“ If anything the risks are higher in the euro area than in the U.S. -- where expectations are already very low .
And you still do n’t have a policy response from the ECB . ”
ECB President Jean - Claude Trichet acknowledged the darkening economic horizon after the bank left interest rates unchanged again at 4 percent on Thursday even as the Bank of England cut its key rates again by a quarter of a percentage point .
“ If I take all the data , they confirm risks lie to the downside , ” Trichet told a news conference
Yet few expect an ECB rate cut for at least another month as the central bank focuses on above - target inflation rates instead .
The combination of rising concern and a lack of action is worrying for many .
The U.S. Federal Reserve has slashed its key interest rates by 2 - 1/ 4 percentage points in five months .
The reaction reminds many economists of ECB arguments in 2001 that the U.S. dot.com bubble burst would have less of an impact on euro zone households than those in the United States .
Back then , the ECB first cut rates some four months after the Fed started easing and cumulatively in 2001 the U.S. central bank ’s rate cuts were three times those of the ECB .
“ It ’s one of the reasons the euro zone economy is always lagging .
The ECB is looking at inflation -- which is in itself a lagging economic indicator in -- and the Fed looks more towards underlying growth , ” said Paolini at Credit Suisse .
FLASH FORECASTS
Any undershoot of fourth - quarter gross domestic product data next week would merely reinforce the point and heap further pressure on the ECB to look beyond near - term inflation rates .
Estimates for Germany , France , Spain and the overall euro zone are due for release on Thursday .
Median forecasts for the single currency area are for growth to more than halve to 0.3 percent from 0.8 percent in the third quarter of the year .
That ’s still about twice the rate recorded in the United States in the final three months of 2007 but the difference is little more than a margin of error given how prone GDP data is to big revisions .
If , as many suspect , subsequent revisions show the U.S. may even have contracted during the final quarter then it may well be in the middle of recession already .
Two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction is how most economists define one .
Further soundings on sentiment will be evident before Thursday and these are not likely to be pretty either .
On Tuesday , the German ZEW index of investor confidence in February is due for release and , as it disproportionately reflects the mood in the financial world , it is widely expected to fall sharply .
“ As the risks to economic growth build , Europe ’s central banks will likely be even more inclined to lean against the coming downturn , ” Deutsche Bank economists said in a note to clients on Friday .
“ We now expect the ECB to cut rates 100 bp by the end of this year , starting in Q2 . ”
NORTH BRADDOCK , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) --
Two years ago , Phill Novak weighed 387 pounds .
After losing 192 pounds , Phill Novak , 41 , says he feels there 's nothing he can't do .

He was n't happy with his weight and neither were his doctors .
In addition to taking medication for high blood pressure and cholesterol -- his physician warned him that he was on track to become a diabetic .
Reality hit in January 2006 at a Pittsburgh Steelers game .
Novak had gone to smoke a cigarette .
" We were walking back up to our seats , and I started getting winded , " says Novak .
" I did n't feel right , I started sweating .
I did n't think I would make it back up .
My heart [ was ] beating a million times a minute ; I thought I was having a heart attack . "
Novak stood against a cold wall for 20 minutes to catch his breath .
Fortunately , he was n't having a heart attack but he was so frightened that thoughts of his family began to race through his mind .
" A lot of things went through my head , about saying goodbye to my kids , " says Novak choking back his tears .
" I told my friend , ' This is it , I 'm not going to live like this no more . ' "
Novak , who was approaching his 40th birthday , made it through the football game .
As he ate two double - cheeseburgers and a milkshake , he began to think about the limitations of obesity and how it was keeping him from living a full life .
Novak said the extra weight kept him from riding bikes with his kids .
He dreaded doing anything physical like mowing the grass , shoveling snow or just moving -- period .
Novak says even sleeping became difficult .
" When I was big , I could only sleep one way ... so I could support my belly , " says Novak .
" My back always hurt ... I could barely sleep and I remember always being tired . "
The next day , Novak devised his own game plan and started his weight - loss journey .
He began simply by walking -- one mile a day and eating a low - carbohydrate diet of 15 - 30 grams a day .
" I walked off my first 100 pounds , " he says .
" Walked it off , an hour a day .
I lost 100 pounds in seven months . "
Novak continued to lose weight and as he built up his endurance he started jogging .
Even though he had never belonged to a gym , he wanted to incorporate strength training .
But the first time he went to the gym , he was intimidated by the loud music and weight lifters .
He says he quickly " scampered " out and tried a few other places until he finally found a club where he felt comfortable .
Watch more on how Phill Novak got motivated to lose weight . »
Two years later , Novak has lost a total of 192 pounds .
Today , he runs 30 to 40 miles a week , works out two to three hours a day , does yoga in the morning and squeezes in a push - up whenever he gets a chance at work .
Now maintaining his weight at 195 pounds , Novak says he 's made a lifestyle change and rarely takes a day off from exercise .
Still , he does n't take all of the credit for his weight loss .
Novak says he could n't have done it without the support of his family -- which he thanks for allowing him to be selfish .
" I am so proud of myself ... for the first time in my life , " beams Novak .
" Besides my kids , [ this is ] the first time I 'm proud of myself . "
Novak says losing weight has boosted his confidence and made him realize that he can do anything he sets his mind to .
He says people also treat him differently and no longer stare at him .
In fact , he enjoys the fact that people , who have n't seen him in a while , recognize only his Pittsburgh accent .
When he looks back at pictures of himself at nearly 400 pounds , he says it 's hard to believe he treated his body that way .
Would he ever go back to being heavy ?
" No way !
Ain't going back there ... wo n't do it , ca n't do it , " says Novak .
" I 've never been happier in my life ! "

War protesters converged in San Francisco Wednesday for the five - year anniversary of the war in Iraq and , from early morning to late evening , rallied , marched , shouted , sang , danced and committed acts of civil disobedience to demonstrate their opposition .
Roughly 150 people were arrested , many of them in front of the office of U.S. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein .
Many of those arrested were participating in an afternoon " die-in " - collapsing en masse to evoke deaths in Iraq - though a few actively scuffled with police .
Demonstrators gathered in the evening at Civic Center Plaza to hear speeches and take an evening march to the Mission District .
They carried signs with slogans such as " impeach " and chanted mantras like " money for health care , not warfare . "
In the morning , a crowd of about 500 people snaked its way through the Financial District , periodically prompting police to shut down intersections and city blocks and Muni officials to reroute buses .
Yet , despite the often creative costumes and messages , the protests were a far cry from the large and dramatic protests that marked the buildup to the war as well as the conflict 's early months .
Tens of thousands came to San Francisco in those days , making it an epicenter of the anti-war movement .
Roughly 2,150 protesters were arrested during the first three days of the war , Mar. 19 - 21 , 2003 .
The city 's hotels were crammed , and mobs tried to shut down the Bay Bridge .
Wednesday 's biggest demonstration in the city occurred in the evening .
Answer coalition organizer Richard Becker estimated the crowd of participants at 7,000 .
Some yearned to renew the hope of those early days , emboldened in part by an upcoming presidential election that does not include the candidacy of George W. Bush .
" There 's been a lot of despair , a lot of feelings that the protest movement could n't do anything and a lot of complacency , " said Venee Call - Ferrer , who protested on the first - year war anniversary but had n't done so again since Wednesday evening .
Veils of mourning
The 42 - year - old Berkeley woman and three of her friends dressed in black , wearing veils of mourning .
They wore red ribbons around their wrists to symbolize blood on their hands as U.S. citizens .
" This year , there 's a feeling that things are going to change , " she said .
It was n't just San Francisco .
Sparse attendance marked anti-war demonstrations nationwide , from Washington , D.C. , to Syracuse , N.Y. to Hartford , Conn .
With song , signs , chants , costumes and even physical scuffles , the many expressions of protest in San Francisco seemed to reflect the eclectic and varied feelings among those opposed to the war .
The most dramatic acts were committed in front of the Feinstein 's office at Market and Montgomery streets .
About two dozen demonstrators staged a " die-in " at about 12:15 p.m. , but were quickly surrounded by 80 police officers in riot gear .
As protesters were arrested , more demonstrators from the scores who were watching from the sidewalk rushed to fill their places .
Among those taken away were 20 people , calling themselves Act Against Torture , who were wearing orange jumpsuits with black hoods over their heads .
They were costumed as prisoners at the controversial U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay , where " enemy combatants " of the " war on terror " have been held .
President Bush declared in 2003 that prisoners suspected to be terrorists did n't merit the protections of the Geneva Conventions .
After more than two hours of protests - and about 100 arrests - authorities finally cleared the intersection and reopened Market Street to traffic at 2:30 p.m .
Among the arrested were three demonstrators who wrestled with police .
One officer was knocked to the street .
Left - wing activist Daniel Ells - berg told the crowd , " The symbolism of people lying in death appears to symbolize the life and death seriousness as we enter the sixth year of this crime against the American people . "
He soon sat down in the street and was arrested .
Biggest protest
The largest protest of the day came after work hours in front of San Francisco 's City Hall .
" This is America , " said State Sen. Carole Migden , D - San Francisco .
" We are not proud .
So we say to the world , to the people who are watching , we are Americans , we are against it , and we are sorry . "
The protesters stood elbow - to - elbow on Civic Center Plaza , occupying roughly half the space between the plaza 's two main rows of trees .
Businessmen in suits and fathers with children on their shoulders were among those gathered , as well as Marxists and 9/11 conspiracy theorists , who had booths set up nearby .
The protesters included three men wearing only purple peace signs painted on their chest
An officer told the men " Put a towel or jacket around yourselves .
People do n't want to see that . "
But they simply moved .
" Protesting like this is no better than some other way , " said San Francisco resident Rusty Mills .
" But it 's our way . "
A large portion of the crowd appeared to be in their teens , many in leather studded belts and Mohawks .
Luis Martinez , 17 , held a sign that read " no se puede la paz con la guerra " - " you ca n't get peace through war . "
" I 'm against the war because of all the killing , " he said , " and the military is made of young people like me . "
At least 27 people were arrested at a die - in at Market and Third streets around 10:30 a.m .
As officers encircled the group , they briefly pushed other protesters onto the sidewalk and confiscated at least one bicycle and a sign .
Across the bay in Berkeley , about 100 demonstrators gathered at the Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park at noon to hear peace activist Cindy Sheehan speak .
About 80 people marched afterward to the Marine Corps recruiting station on Shattuck Square , where demonstrators had gathered earlier .
Elsewhere in San Francisco , more than a dozen people were arrested in nonviolent actions at the Federal Reserve Bank on Market and the Chevron building at California and Battery streets .
The main group of protesters carried signs , shouted slogans and blasted music as they roamed the Financial District .
Some threw play money in the air and waved pink flags .
One large sign carried by four people read : " Was it worth it ? "

The race to replace President Vladimir Putin officially opens Saturday .
But actual campaigning is difficult to find .
Mr. Putin's handpicked successor , Dmitri Medvedev , who is basking in opinion polls that show him winning almost three - quarters of the votes on March 2 , has declined to campaign or even publicly debate his opponents .
Several outside candidates who might have challenged the Kremlin 's script were ejected from the ballot in the pre-campaign stage , leaving only the usual , predictable also - rans of post - Soviet Russian politics , Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov and oddball ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky .
A third contender , Andrei Bogdanov of the tiny Democratic Party , is a virtual unknown who has never criticized the Kremlin .
" These elections are really just an afterthought in a political system where the main issue of who will succeed Putin has already been decided , " says Viktor Kremeniuk , deputy director of the official Institute of USA - Canada Studies in Moscow .
" What 's left is just a performance to convince the world that there 's a functioning democracy in Russia .
And if the show is going badly , it 's due to bad management . "
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe warned this week that it may not be able to send its delegation of 70 observers to the polls if Moscow does n't relieve some of the tough new restrictions on their activities .
Those include a requirement that the team come just three days prior to the voting , and that it not be allowed to monitor Russian media coverage of the campaign to judge its fairness .
" These conditions do n't allow us to carry out a meaningful observation and therefore fulfill our mandate , " the OSCE said in a statement .
And in an odd twist , Putin ordered the FSB security service to intensify security precautions before the elections .
" You must step up efforts to receive timely information about any attempts to interfere in our domestic affairs , " he told officials of the KGB successor agency Wednesday .
Some experts warn that the Kremlin 's overmanagement of the election could backfire , by destroying any semblance of credibility in the process .
Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , who brought the first wave of democratization to the USSR two decades ago , spoke out this week against the reduction of elections to a one - horse race .
" Something wrong is going on with our elections , and our electoral system needs a major adjustment , " Mr. Gorbachev told the independent Interfax agency .
" Certainly , the election will take place in Russia and people should vote , but its outcome is totally predictable , " he complained .
Mr. Medvedev 's office announced this week that the candidate would be " too busy " carrying out his official duties as deputy prime minister in charge of social projects to campaign or take part in televised debates with his rivals .
He has been travelling around Russia , often in company with Mr. Putin , holding public meetings that are lavishly covered as " news " by state - run TV networks .
And while Medvedev may not be campaigning , he has set up an election Website where people can read his speeches and view photos of himself and his family ( www.medvedev2008.ru/english.htm).
Vyacheslav Volodin , a top leader of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party , told Russian media that Medvedev 's way of campaigning was just to do his regular job .
" The most important thing for us is real deeds , meeting people and solving actual problems , not wrangling in a TV studio , " he said .
But even some experts who are normally sympathetic to the Kremlin view wonder why , if Medvedev is genuinely popular , he wo n't appear in an unscripted venue with his rivals .
" In Russia , where democracy is new , it would be good to start some new traditions in which the electorate is given a clear picture of what the candidates stand for , " says Peter Lavelle , political commentator for the English - language Russia Today TV network , which is funded by the Russian government .
" It 's a disappointment " that Medvedev wo n't engage in debate , he says .
Former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov , who was officially stricken from the ballot this week for allegedly falsifying 14 per cent of his 2 million nomination signatures , has called on other opposition candidates " not to take part in this farce . "
Communist leader Mr. Zyuganov , whom polls show with about 12 percent support , threatened last week to do just that , but later decided to remain in the race .
Yet , in a meeting with supporters Wednesday , Zyuganov , who has taken part in every post - Soviet election , sounded wistful for the days when elections carried some suspense .
" Every day I see how the election campaign in America is going , how Hillary Clinton and [ Barack ]
Obama are competing , but I do n't see anything on our own television screens about any real discussion of the problems , " he said .
" We need a normal dialogue " .
Then James Locascio , a doctoral student in marine science at the University of South Florida , rescued the city from financial folly .
After reading the newspaper article , Mr. Locascio called a Council member just hours before a vote to appropriate the money .
He explained that at 100 to 500 hertz , black drum mating calls travel at a low enough frequency and long enough wavelength to carry through sea walls , into the ground and through the construction of waterfront homes like the throbbing beat in a passing car .

“ Black drum have taken a liking to the canal system in Cape Coral , ” Mr. Locascio said .
“ Their nightly booming is like a water drip torture that lasts for months . ” ( Listen to the mating calls of the black drum and other fish sounds . )
At first residents would n’t buy it .
“ The most vocal and persistent complainers said that there was no way a fish could produce a sound that could be heard inside a house , ” he recalled .
Mr. Locascio and David Mann , a marine biologist at the University of South Florida who is a bioacoustics expert , recruited these naysayers into a study by asking them to score noise levels and times in notebooks .
“ We took their data and plotted them with the fish sounds we had recorded with hydrophones under the water , ” Mr. Locascio said .
“ Concordance was perfect . ”
A similar situation unfolded two decades ago in Sausalito , Calif. , when houseboaters were inundated with toadfish calls .
The Marin Independent Journal said in an editorial , “ We do n’t believe for an instant that the drone keeping Sausalito houseboaters awake at night is caused by a bunch of romantic toadfish humming their version of the Indian Love Song . ”

WARNING : This is not a recommendation to buy , sell or hold any financial instrument .
This may upset my libertarian and my commodity trader friends , at first , but I hope they hear me out .
Although I ’m 3/4 libertarian myself and a trader , leveraged speculation on commodities should n’t be allowed .
Speculate on things like indexes , stocks , bonds and currencies until you ’re blue in the face .
None of those things are real anyway .
But leveraged speculation on tangible goods actually makes a mockery of the market system by distorting prices .
If I buy a wheat contract , I should have to take delivery of the physical wheat on the specified date .
If I sell a wheat contract , I should have to deliver the physical wheat on the specified date .
I should not be allowed to buy or sell those leveraged contracts without having to take delivery , or deliver , physical goods .
I should n’t be allowed to close my position without an exchange of goods .
The same should hold true for gold , coffee , palladium or any other commodity .
It is absolute madness that commodities are bought and sold using leveraged vehicles in markets that allow participation by speculators ; individuals and organizations who have no interest or connection to the underlying physical commodity .
Guys , I know !
I can hear you groaning .
Several of you trade the gold futures .
I made money on DBA , which is made up of futures contracts on wheat , corn , soybeans and sugar .
I , just now , recommended gold mini futures contracts to a reader who ’s using his BullionVault account for active trading — I mean , why not use the leverage that a futures account provides to trade and save money on commissions ?
No sane person wants to wind up in a gun battle , but when you find yourself in the middle of one , you do what has to be done .
As trader Dagobaz wrote , “ If you any good at all at timing overbought / oversold conditions , you will be in the very rare position of being able to make money faster than even Bernanke can devalue it . ”
She ’s right .
But think about what leveraged trading in real goods does !
Leverage is undead money .
It ’s zombie money .
It can be conjured up and sent out to do the bidding of its master .
What happens when infinite zombie money , in the form of leverage , enters markets where finite resources are traded ?
Volatility increases and prices distort to the point where the underlying value of a thing gets lost in all the noise .
This is n’t a free market ; it ’s a black magic trick , involving supercomputers , psychological operations and lots and lots of leverage .
Why is it allowed ?
The Black Box people do n’t make the big money in stable markets that are constrained by reality .
They want to get in and out ; fast .
The more volatility , the more potential there is to pull money out of the chaos .
What institutions need is a way to be upwind when they start a fire .
LEVERAGE ALLOWS INSTITUTIONS TO CREATE VOLATILITY FOR EXTREMELY SHORT TERM GAINS .
Participants who are trying to use the futures market in a legitimate manner , to secure supplies of goods , or to sell goods , at agreed upon prices in the future , are getting wiped out because the price action has little to do with the underlying supply and demand of the commodities !
After the Fed introduced a massive rate cut this week , gold gapped down 6 % .
There is a lot of head scratching in the gold bug community right now .
I do n’t see why .
Cryptogon readers have been warned that gold is just another blinking number that updates in real time ; traded with leverage .
Do n’t hold a scorpion in your hand and then blame it for stinging you .
That ’s just the nature of the beast .
( On gold , I do believe the truth will emerge at some point .
That ’s why I ’m not selling my physical gold . )
I rarely write , “ This is how it should be , ” posts because there ’s absolutely no point .
Pigs ( Pork Bellies ? ) will fly before anyone takes my suggestion seriously .
However , if you want to understand booms and busts in ANY market , you ’ll find speculators who have nothing to do with the underlying assets , using leverage to create volatility for short term gains .
Welcome to fiat currency Hell .
Now …
I need to go check out the collapsing grain futures to see if DBA is a buy again , or not .

The largest price swing in the history of Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures Wednesday baffled market analysts and sparked frustration among long - time traders who have used the market as a tool to hedge risk .
The CBOT March wheat contract traded in a range of nearly $ 2.70 in a single day , from a low of $ 10.65 - 1/4 up to $ 13.34 - 1/2 , a record spot price for wheat on the 160 - year - old market .
The contract ended up nearly 7 percent , settling 80 - 1/2 cents higher at $ 12.80 per bushel .
Until two weeks ago , the normal daily trading limit for CBOT wheat was 30 cents a bushel , either up or down .
“ This is why a lot traders wo n’t trade this market anymore .
This kind of volatility , and lack of connection to what ’s happening fundamentally in the market , have a lot of traders saying there are other things to trade that have less risk , ” said analyst Shawn McCambridge at Prudential Financial ( nyse : PRU – news – people ) .
“ You ca n’t afford to participate in these markets if you ’re a small or medium - sized guy , as far as an elevator or producer .
You could be doing everything 100 percent correctly , and the market trades like this , you could get annihilated , ” McCambridge said .
Most of the CBOT wheat trade is conducted electronically , with volume in the traditional open - outcry pit comprising only 6 percent of the total Tuesday .
Tuesday is the most recent day for which the CBOT has official data on electronic and pit totals .
Bullish supply - demand fundamentals have played a lead role in the surge in CBOT wheat prices , which climbed 77 percent in 2007 and are up 44 percent so far in 2008 .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture says U.S. wheat stocks will drop to a 60 - year low by the end of the marketing year on May 31 .
Global wheat stocks are projected at a 30 - year low .
Soft red winter wheat , the par grade in Chicago , is in tight supply .
Spring wheat , par grade on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange , is even more scarce , and MGE wheat prices well above $ 20 a bushel this week have helped frazzle long - time traders .
At the CBOT , expanded daily trading limits and sharply higher margin charges to trade wheat have added to the volatility .
Yet CBOT floor traders said the market ’s latest violent gyrations reflect the increasing influence of hedge funds which have been pouring money into CBOT grains .
The price action Wednesday , they said , had more to do with fund maneuvers than with bullish fundamental factors .
“ There is an enormous amount of bitterness down here , ” one CBOT wheat floor trader said .
Soaring commodities have enticed Wall Street investors seeking a hedge against inflation .
The U.S. Producer Price Index , an inflation gauge , Tuesday showed its biggest rise in more than 26 years , climbing 1 percent in January and 7.4 percent on a year - on - year basis .
Veteran traders note the large share of the market held by commodity index funds , which typically buy and hold long positions .
The long positions held by index funds represented 36.4 percent of open interest in CBOT wheat as of Feb. 19 .
Increases in margins , the performance bonds required to trade wheat , have been driving smaller players out .
“ When I first started , we had 1/4 - cent moves and an 8 - cent range , and everybody was happy .
Now we have $ 1 swings , and everyone is mad at each other , ” a longtime CBOT trader said .
Another trader sounded more sanguine : “ Big orders executed in a rapid fashion , coupled with spreaders there to help absorb some of the volatility , creates extreme swings . ”
A spreader is someone who simultaneously buys and sells two different futures contracts , seeking to profit on a change in the difference in price .
He added of Wall Street investors : “ Multi- trillion - dollar markets moving money into these type of markets … exacerbates the problem . ”
CBOT March wheat was down 49 - 1/2 cents at $ 12.30 - 1/2 per bushel in Asian trading hours .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey refused on Friday to pursue contempt citations issued by the House of Representatives against a current and a former White House aide for not cooperating in a probe of the firing of U.S. attorneys .
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey listens during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington December 11 , 2007 .

Saying no crime was committed , Mukasey rejected a request by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to refer the citations to a federal grand jury investigation of current White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers .
“ The Department has determined that the non-compliance by Mr. Bolten and Ms. Miers with the Judiciary Committee subpoenas did not constitute a crime , and therefore the Department will not bring the congressional contempt citations before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute Mr. Bolten or Ms. Miers , ” Mukasey said in a letter to Pelosi .
The Democratic - led House of Representatives voted 223-32 earlier this month , with most of President George W. Bush ’s fellow Republicans abstaining , to pursue legal action against Bolten and Miers for failing to provide documents and appear at a hearing .
In doing so , the House also authorized its Judiciary Committee to go to court to file suit to enforce the subpoenas .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said if the Democrats choose to move forward , a federal judge would likely turn down the case .
“ In the event the court decided to entertain the case on the merits , we are confident the judge would rule that the president ’s assertion of executive privilege is legally sound and correct , ” added Fratto .
The case centers on the Justice Department ’s firing under then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales of nine of the 93 U.S. attorneys .
Critics charged the federal prosecutors were fired for political reasons , allegations denied by the White House .
Mukasey said in the letter to Pelosi that Bush , citing executive privilege , had directed his two aides not to comply , and the Justice Department had determined that Bush ’s order was legal and therefore it would not take any further action .

As space shuttles zip into orbit and telescopes peer out at other worlds , Earth itself remains a mystery in many basic ways .
In an attempt to remedy that , a panel of geologists and planetary scientists announced this week the top 10 questions about our planet that linger today , which have strangely baffled humanity and researchers for hundreds of years and longer .
" We have to look to the past and ask deeper fundamental questions about the origins of the Earth and life , the structure and dynamics of planets , and the connections between life and climate , for example , " said panel chairman Donald DePaolo , a University of California at Berkeley geochemist .
The panel canvassed geologists and deliberated at length to arrive at the focus on these questions :
1 : How did Earth and other planets form ?
Scientists are perplexed by how and why the planets formed into such distinct bodies , with only our rocky orb supporting life ( as far as we know ) .
2 : What happened during Earth 's " Dark Age , " or the first 500 million years after it formed ?
Understanding Earth 's early development would explain how the atmosphere and oceans developed .
One difficulty : Few rocks from then are preserved , meaning little concrete evidence .
3 : How did life begin ?
In addition to rocks and minerals here , scientists are also probing Mars , where the sedimentary record of early planetary history predates the oldest Earth rocks .
4 : How does Earth 's interior work , and how does it affect the surface ?
Scientists want to figure out more about the past and future of the constant convective motion of Earth 's mantle and core , which triggers volcanism , mountain building and seafloor formation .
5 : Why does Earth have plate tectonics and continents ?
Scientists wonder why Earth has plates , constantly on the move , and how closely tectonics are related to the abundance of water , continents , oceans and life .
6 : How are Earth processes controlled by material properties ?
The big movers and shakers on Earth , including plate tectonics , arise from the atomic structure and other properties of Earth materials , so scientists want to know more about these properties .
7 : What causes climate to change – and how much can it change ?
Deeper study of the history of Earth 's climate could help scientists predict the magnitude and consequences of today 's climate change .
8 : How has life shaped Earth – and how has Earth shaped life ?
The interactions between geology and biology are key to understanding life 's role in injecting oxygen into the atmosphere , mass extinctions and the course of evolution .
9 : Can earthquakes , volcanic eruptions and their consequences be predicted ?
Scientists still do n't know how fault ruptures start and stop , and how magma moves beneath Earth 's surface .
10 : How do fluid flow and transport affect the human environment ?
Scientists are unclear about how fluids move underground .
More knowledge about this will help with management of natural resources and the environment .
The report was requested by the U.S. Department of Energy , National Science Foundation , U.S. Geological Survey , and NASA .
Amongst all the media teeth - gnashing over the question of whether McCain did special favors for his blondie lobbyist , Â his wifeâ€™s sweetheart deal for massive narcotics theft in the 1990s has been forgotten .
If a poor black woman from Anacostia had committed the crimes that Cindy McCain committed , the black woman might have been sent to prison for the duration of her life .
John McCain has never shown any courage on the drug war .
Â
As long as people like his wife donâ€™t need to fear jail time for crimes , there is no reason to reform the law toÂ cease the persecution of other Americans .
Â
Here ’s an excerpt on the case from an article I did for Playboy in 1997 .
( Full text of the piece , which detailsÂ how many congressmen ’s kinÂ escaped hard time for drug offenses , Â is here ) .
The members of the senate , the upper house of parliament , defeated a motion of confidence in the 20 - month - old administration by 161 votes to 156 with one abstention .
President Giorgio Napolitano will now have to decide what to do next .
He is thought to favour an interim government that would last perhaps only a few months and steer through a reform of the electoral law .
A member of Mr Berlusconi's inner circle told the Guardian : " Whatever happens , it 's just a matter of time " .
He said the media mogul expected to be back in the prime minister 's office by autumn at the latest .
The result was declared at the end of a tumultuous debate in which one senator was spat on and had to be carried from the chamber on a stretcher .
Another hobbled forward to cast his vote on crutches .
He had been driven down from near Milan in an ambulance for the crucial ballot .
The Prodi government plunged into crisis on Monday when it was deserted by a tiny party whose leader , the former justice minister , left the cabinet on learning he was a suspect in a corruption probe .
Other small groups and some individuals peeled off subsequently .
The odds against the government 's survival had been stacking up relentlessly since before Christmas .
The former EU Commission president 's term of office has seen modest economic growth .
But for many Italians its benefits have been offset by heavy taxation imposed to get the public finances within limits set by membership of the euro .
An announcement last month by the EU 's statistical office that Spaniards were now earning more in real terms than Italians had a crushing effect on national morale .
Days later , garbage began piling up on the streets of Naples - an all - too - tangible sign of political mismanagement and the still - pervasive influence on Italian society of organised crime .
The continuing rubbish emergency was the latest of several to which Mr Prodi 's government has reacted sluggishly .
According to the latest poll , carried out for the state - owned RAI broadcasting corporation , Mr Berlusconi and his right - wing allies enjoy a giant , 15 point lead .
The country now faces a period of paralysis as either a new coalition is formed or fresh elections held .
In a final effort to attract support , Mr Prodi told the senate delay was " a luxury Italy cannot permit itself . "
There was uproar during the debate that followed when Stefano Cusumano , a Sicilian lawmaker belonging to the party that prompted the crisis , announced he was remaining loyal to Mr Prodi after all .
Proceedings were suspended after opposition lawmakers screamed " lump of shit " , " cuckold " and " squalid pooftah " .
He was spat at , fainted and was carried out .
The incident came amid a barrage of claims by Mr Berlusconi 's followers that the government was " buying " votes with dubious favours .
The catapult has not been used since 1974
Former stuntman Joe Weston - Webb , 70 , said his offices in Kegworth , Notts , have been attacked by arsonists and he was fighting back with the weaponry .
Mr Weston Webb said : " There 's no way anyone will get caught ... so I thought I would set up my own defence . "
A police spokesman said they would give " practical security advice " but warned against using " unreasonable force " .
Warning sign
Mr Weston - Webb , who supplies flooring to hit BBC show Strictly Come Dancing , said he will also use a cannon , which once shot his wife Mary across the River Avon in a circus show , to fire a railway sleeper at intruders .
The law allows homeowners to protect themselves and their property with reasonable force if they are under threat from an intruder
Nottinghamshire Police
" I have put up a sign warning anyone who enters the property that they could get hit with a railway sleeper or chicken poo .
" I have got all this old kit and I am going to put it to some use and stop it rather than letting it rot in a field . "
Mr Weston - Webb said the arsonists had caused £ 2,000 of damage to his offices .
He said the 30ft ( 9 m ) catapult would be dragged into location with a tractor and loaded with chicken manure .
The former stuntman is installing 32 CCTV cameras
Mr Weston - Webb said the device will not injure anyone because " a bag of chicken poo is n't going to do much " .
The businessman , who runs Grumpy Joe 's Flooring Sales , is also installing 32 CCTV cameras .
Insp Jeff Haywood from Nottinghamshire Police , said : " A crime prevention officer will be making contact with the complainant to offer some practical security advice .
" The officer will give tips around conventional security techniques , such as alarms , lighting and locks , and also around the use of reasonable force .
" The law allows homeowners to protect themselves and their property with reasonable force if they are under threat from an intruder .
" However , the reasonable force must be proportionate to the threat .
The setting up of booby traps is outside the scope of the law and is something Nottinghamshire Police would advise against . "
This is a guest post by Thomas Smale from FE International , a website brokerage with an emphasis on SaaS apps .
At FE International we speak to website owners on a daily basis who are looking to sell their businesses .
Unfortunately , many of these businesses are not sellable for a number of very avoidable reasons .
Planning your exit in advance ( even if you have no intention of selling now ) is always the sensible thing to do and will put you in good stead , saving you headaches when you do decide it ’s time to move on .
SaaS products have always proven to be very popular with buyers over the years .
Last year we sold 78 web - based businesses , so reflecting on these we ’ve pooled together our collective experience to show you what really improves the saleability and the value of a SaaS business in the eyes of a new potential buyer .
A combination of these factors could be the difference between selling for 1x EBITDA ( if done badly ) and 3 x ( if you follow these rules ) .
Choose your payment processor carefully
This is one of the most common issues we come across and can affect value significantly .
With SaaS businesses the majority of revenue will be through monthly , quarterly or annual billing recurring payment plans .
There are often hundreds if not thousands of subscribers paying through the year , usually processed by one payment platform .
A common problem sellers run in to is that when it comes to sell , the monthly subscribers cannot be transferred to a new owner – which is where the majority of business value lies and is an essential element of the sale .
For instance , subscriptions in a Paypal account cannot be transferred and this requires a buyer either taking over the seller ’s account ( always a last resort and can be complex if the sale is international ) .
This can lead to complex transfer arrangements between buyer and seller which can be a deterrent for investors from the outset and is also an ongoing headache for both parties post sale as it will often involve contingency based financing agreements .
To avoid this , opt for a transfer - friendly payment processor which will make the business universally appealing to buyers and save considerable effort post - transaction .
Check with your merchant account or payment processor before signing up as they all have different policies depending on your location or history with them .
Future - proofing your software
Many SaaS business owners have developed their product themselves , usually to solve a problem they encountered personally or profit from a gap in the market they spotted .
As the architect their technical knowledge of the source code is unrivalled , but it can present a problem when it comes to selling .
How can a new owner upgrade or expand the software offering without the seller ?
This is a common issue and the best mitigation strategy is to source an affordable , reliable , independent third party to work on the product for 3 - 6 months before the sale .
Ensure they document everything they do in detail .
This will assure the new owner that product developments can be carried out without the seller ’s technical knowledge .
It also opens up the potential buyer universe to non -software specialists , which is a considerable pool of demand for a business seller to tap in to .
Build and utilise the mailing list
Focus on building your email subscriber list and make the most of it ( ideally through a scalable auto - responder sequence ) .
Buyers are increasingly focused on email membership for SaaS businesses which they see as a first - step marketing strategy after a change of ownership .
For example , investors without much experience in the niche will likely initially focus on marketing to existing customers ( always easier to sell to an existing client ) , so a responsive subscriber base is a strong business sale point .
On the practical side , make sure you use a good provider ( Mailchimp , Aweber etc. ) and not a more complicated self - hosted solution that could put off buyers .
Depersonalise the service ( mitigate key man risk )
This is a general point for many online businesses ( particularly owner - run models ) but is very relevant for SaaS sites .
Make sure any personal branding you use for marketing or for the product itself is phased out prior to sale .
Whilst a personal touch can help with humanising the marketing approach and selling services , it makes the transfer of ownership and ongoing operation more of a risk to new buyers who ca n’t continue the same approach and will likely affect sales price or mean you have to stay on for longer post - sale .
Guarantees to the new owner that they can market with your name are n’t worth near as much as a neutral product offering to begin with .
Another solution would be to use a pseudonym to brand the product around and that way , the “ owner ” and his / her reputation would be far easier to transfer to a new owner .
Get on top of your data
Again this is a general point but in our years of brokerage experience , there is a direct correlation between the quality / quantity of information a seller has and the execution of a sale .
In short , buyers like information and transparency .
In SaaS , this is particularly acute given the number of subscribers involved and ongoing obligations to be transferred .
For example , in SaaS businesses , there are a number of key metrics that buyers expect to see , such as life - time value , churn , product breakdown split ( assuming you have packages ) , conversion data and much more .
There is no such thing as too much data when it comes to selling , and a good broker will help present these in a relevant manner .
Cultivate a quality affiliate network
Building out a solid affiliate network is commonly a sustainable way to build the profile of the product but more importantly it diversifies the marketing effort and revenue profile of the service .
For investors , this is a big positive as it reduces the perceived overnight ‘ acquired ’ responsibility for direct sales and creates a ‘ passive ’ income stream for the service .
As a general rule of thumb , any passive income stream in an online business will attractive a premium valuation .
However , do , of course ensure you partner with quality affiliates that will only enhance your profile and reputation of the service and try not to be reliant on any one affiliate .
A general rule of thumb to achieve a top valuation would be to not have any one traffic source ( or affiliate ) driving more than 25 % of sales .
Do n’t discount without reason
A common strategy for sellers trying to maximise value before a sale is to bump revenue by pushing heavy discounts ( or annual packages ) in the months prior to listing .
The unfortunate truth is that business valuations are almost always calculated off of normalised business performance so any last minute spikes in revenue will be significantly discounted by past performance and could even look dishonest .
Discounting the product in the run up to a sale may in fact have the adverse effect of weakening its value proposition in the market and thus perceived value to buyers .
Do a few things and do them well
Once the platform has been established , it ’s usually the case that a SaaS business only has a finite amount of high ROI additions .
Pursuing all of these opportunities exhaustively in the aim of an extra dollar is not always the best strategy .
Focus on a few expansion strategies and do them well .
Trying to do everything might not improve profits ( and thus the sale price ) and more importantly might limit a new owner in terms of what they can ‘ launch ’ when taking over .
A buyer likes to know that they can grow something , so leaving some future growth potential will benefit the sale price now .
Europe ’s media and left - wing intelligentsia see Barack Obama as the most appealing candidate for the U.S. presidency .
He exemplifies what the French leftist magazine Le Nouvel Observateur calls “ the America we like . ”
Most Europeans deny that they ’re anti-American ; they argue instead that there are two Americas — the good and the bad .
Michael Moore is a good American , honored with the Cannes film festival ’s highest prize in 2006 for his anti-Bush fantasy documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 .
Other good Americans include Robert Redford , Mia Farrow , Noam Chomsky , Barbra Streisand , and Philip Roth .
Charlton Heston and Billy Graham are bad — as bad as McDonald ’s — and so , of course , are President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Let us understand why , from the European perspective , Obama is good .
First , he belongs to a minority .
Europeans love minorities — when they live in the U.S.
We tend not to like our own minorities , whom we willingly discriminate against on the basis of skin color or religion .
Black Americans , however , are popular in Western Europe , since they play good music and revolt against the white establishment .
For European leftists , whites in the U.S. are inclined to be Christian , racist , and imperialist .
Whites started the war in Iraq .
A white U.S. soldier is an imperialist ; a black soldier is a victim , fighting in the army only because he is poor .
Not only is Obama black ; he is also a pacifist , or nearly so , certainly when compared with the other presidential candidates .
A pacifist U.S. leader becomes more than likable ; he becomes “ one of us . ”
Opposed to the war in Iraq and uninterested in confronting Iran , Obama is almost an honorary European , more civilized than the white , imperialist , trigger - happy Republicans .
Obama has also been linked with Black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan and former national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski , which suggests that he is not an unconditional ally of Israel .
Israel is less popular than the Palestinians among the European intelligentsia , so Obama scores again .
Obama also favors universal health insurance , another Europe - like move in the right direction to free the bad Americans from their capitalist shackles .
On capital punishment , a contentious issue between Europeans and Americans , Obama again strikes the right chord : he is a death - penalty abolitionist .
His stance on this issue alone would make him a darling in Europe .
But there ’s more : Obama ’s Christian faith seems murky .
In Europe , we love secularism ; at least Obama seems reserved about his faith .
The few European pundits who have closely examined Obama ’s platform know that he advocates what sounds like protectionism .
Economists and the business community in Europe have anxiety about a protectionist agenda , since Europe depends on free trade with the U.S. But European journalists and pundits tend to be anticapitalist and antiglobalist , so for them , Obama stands on the right side .
The good American is expected neither to trade nor to fight terrorism .
If more Americans were good , in fact , there would be no terrorists , as the Left in both Europe and the U.S. often contends .
Jean - David Levitte , former French ambassador to the U.S. and now foreign affairs advisor to President Nicolas Sarkozy , used to say that the only way for Europeans to influence American policy would be to have their own representative in the U.S. Senate .
In fact , many Europeans believe that Europe should have a say in American elections , since the president is de facto leader of the Western world .
And if they did have a vote , they would choose Barack Obama in a landslide .

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) just released its fourth and final report , and the message is clear .
Global warming is real , it ’s a threat to human civilization , and we must act now if we have any hope of stopping it .
Considering that buildings account for almost half of all annual greenhouse - gas emissions , it seems logical to begin this work against global warming at home .
In fact , the Mayors of Chicago , Seattle , Miami , and Albuquerque recently proposed Resolution No. 50 [ PDF ] , which sets a goal for carbon neutral buildings by 2030 .
While this resolution applies mostly to new urban buildings , you can expect to greet a burgeoning market that demands homes that use little to no fossil fuels over the next two decades .
You can increase your home ’s marketability and safety by making changes now .
To save money , focus on remodeling one room at a time , and look for federal or state ( even local ) incentives and tax credits that may be available for certain features of your green remodeling project .
These tax deductions could help shorten the payback period .
Energy - efficient homes do save money – financial benefits of green design are between $ 50 and $ 70 per square foot according to Resolution No. 50 .
And , they may prove more beneficial to your health as you reduce toxic materials and maximize fresh air and natural light .
The following tips and tricks can help you with your green home remodeling projects .
The list is broken down by various topics ranging from “ Before you begin ” to wall options and ventilation .
Throughout the list , you ’ll encounter what are known as Volatile Organic Compounds , or VOCs .
These are organic compounds that evaporates readily to the atmosphere and that are usually harmful .
You want to avoid VOCs at all costs in your green remodeling .

Before You Begin
Here are a few tips to think about before you begin to tear up that carpeting or before you add solar panels …
Buy local : Green remodeling supports buying from local businesses and using goods and services that are non-polluting and respectful of environmental resources .
But , sometimes it ’s impossible to find a certain green resource locally .
In this case , you can reduce or offset your carbon footprint with other projects like planting trees or by purchasing carbon credits .
Do your research before you spend a dime : Comparison shop , look for professionals with green design experience , and discuss your findings with other like - minded homeowners .
Research will help you to find the right help and resources and it will also keep you from creating costly mistakes if you plan to do the work yourself .
Use resources like the Oikos library and other online collections to begin your education .
Think Universal Design :
In addition to an environmentally safe home , you might consider what is known as Universal Design .
This type of design , whether it ’s used in a home layout or in your choice of faucet handles , strives to be a broad - spectrum solution that helps everyone , not just people with disabilities .
Universal Design is a solution for many design solutions that appeal to a broader range of users .
Identify your problems :
Beyond your goals , you might take time to identify the hazards that already exist in your home and begin by eliminating those problems first .
Old paints and certain plumbing types may contain lead , and you might find asbestos in the strangest places ( like in your vinyl floor ) .
The new green home will be devoid of lead - based paints ( see wall options below ) and PVC ( polyvinyl chloride ) in any shape or form .
If you ’re unfamiliar with PVC problems , read the fact sheet [ PD ] provided by Washington Toxics Coalition .
Learn about the local salvage yards and recycling places :
In addition to lessening your burden on landfills , reusing salvaged materials minimizes the demand for mining , tree harvesting , water , energy , and other natural resources , as well as toxic materials used to process , manufacture and transport new materials .
This option works two ways – you can find many bargains at salvage yards and recycling places , and you can also offer your goods for salvage or recycling .
Depending upon where you live and your resources , you may receive a small amount of cash , in - store credit , or the material may be considered a “ donation , ” meaning you can get rid of it for free ( and some stores can offer a tax credit for those materials ) .
Do n’t reuse toxic materials :
The only problem with using salvaged materials is the possibility that you might reuse of toxic materials … do n’t use them ever again , even if they ’re the best bargain .
Additionally , you might need to find special local recycling for items you discover in your home ( such as asbestos or lead paint ) .
Keep lists of materials you need and sizes :
Before you go salvage yard hopping , make sure that you have complete lists of things you ’d like to purchase .
Additionally , you will need the sizes of those ‘ things , ’ such as kitchen cabinets or decorative moldings .
Keep this list with you at all times , as you never know when you ’ll meet someone who has that slate you want for your roof .
Free up that imagination :
You do n’t need to buy out the magazine stand for creative home decorating or remodeling ideas .
You can search online for “ junkyard ” decorating ideas or “ recycled interior designs . ”
For instance , you can use old bookshelves for steps , or you can use a birdcage for a new planter .
Use those DIY sites to learn how to visit a junkyard , as well as to learn how to find great ‘ stuff ’ once you arrive there .
Try to avoid hazards during the remodel : Before you begin a remodel , you might look for recycling solutions for things like kitchen cabinets , old floor materials , sinks , and other items .
Be sure to let anyone you hire know that you intend to recycle those items so they do n’t destroy them .
Keep hazardous remodeling to a minimum :
No matter if you use a contractor or not , be sure to outline on the front end how you intend to contain dust and fumes and how you intend to clean up the remodeling mess .
A wise remodeling project can protect your health , the health of those who work with you , and your neighbors .
Watch those building codes :
Work that violates building codes may also violate your insurance terms , which means you would be vulnerable to loss .
The goal of your remodel is to comply with safety , health , and energy - efficient issues , and these goals also are part of any building code .
Check with your county department of development before you lift a hammer to learn about your local codes and check to see if you need building permits as well .
Include the neighborhood : Future neighborhoods will provide easy walking to local shops , bike trails , and other pedestrian - friendly amenities .
You can increase the value of your home – nay , the entire neighborhood – by encouraging city officials to begin with these projects now .
Pedestrian - friendly neighborhoods are safer and healthier than auto - friendly suburbs .
Hiring Help
A remodel from a toxic home to a green environment will at times rival a new house purchase in price .
Since you ’re about to embark on a costly project , it makes sense to hire professionals when and if you need them .
Learn patience and expect the worst :
This may seem like a negative attitude , but it pays to lower your expectations – especially if you plan a job in a hurry .
No matter if you use salvaged or new materials , a home remodel is a taxing proposition .
Take it easy on yourself , expect problems ( because if you do n’t , then the problems will seem worse ) , and learn how to be gracious and helpful to your employed personnel .
The adage , “ You can attract more bees with honey , ” has several implications , and they all apply to home remodeling .
Sometimes problems may open the door to new solutions , so keep an open mind and try to use as many local resources as possible to remedy any given situation gone sour .
Plan for a year :
With all that said above , it might surprise you to learn that planning a remodel can take up to a year .
If you plan to tackle just one room or one wall at a time , it still helps to plan your overall objectives first .
No matter if you ca n’t meet those goals for years – the professionals you hire will appreciate your long - term foresight .
Think of professionals as your ‘ team ' :
Your architect , interior designer , and contractor will require special skills and experience , and hopefully they ’ll display enthusiasm about a green project .
Depending upon your goals , they may help you reach a more satisfying solution at a lower ( or higher ) cost .
This is why it ’s important for you to learn about the green remodeling process in advance , so you do n’t get mired in a situation that ’s nonreversible .
Take advantage of consultations :
Even if the professional you have in mind demands payment for a consultation , it might be worth the charge to lay out your ideas and to learn what that professional thinks about your goals .
That professional might also know more about building codes and local environments than you , so you could stand to learn much from a consultation .
Help your help :
If you ’ve conducted research on remodeling plans and materials , do n’t hide your expertise or resources .
If your contractor loses a roofing shipment , you might be able to point him to another resource pronto , saving time and money .
Hire local :
Not only will you save money , but you ’ll also be able to tap local reviews about your choice .
Most professionals maintain
Web sites , so you can look at their portfolios online before you make a call .
Ask around about local resources – friends , family , and coworkers can share their experiences with you so that your choice will save you time and money .
Hire appropriately : A construction crew cannot help you with your landscaping , and an interior designer most likely wo n’t know how to install your solar panels .
Check out the city of Seattle ’s brochure [ PDF ] on how to hire professionals for your green remodeling project .
Although this area is well ahead most of the country on establishing green building practices , you might use their leads to find local professionals in your city or town .
Consider your health :
In some cases , you may need to hire a professional to remove toxic materials .
The cost of doing business with a professional in this situation may save your health in the long run .
One advantage to this situation is that if you have lead paint on your walls or asbestos , then your neighbors probably do as well .
Ask them if they ’ve ever had to tackle those problems and ask about the professionals they used to take care of those problems .
Be considerate to your neighbors :
If you plan a huge project that will take time and that will be noisy , be sure to talk to your neighbors about your goals .
Keep them in the loop about any elements in your project that may impact them directly .
Will your new project cut off their views ?
Will they lose privacy thanks to workers who are swarming over your yard ?
We know of one person spent several thousand dollars for an eight - foot fence after his neighbor neglected to remove the garbage that remained from his remodeling project .
Needless to say , those two neighbors are n’t on speaking terms anymore .
Bathroom
A bathroom remodel is second only to the kitchen in expense .
Before you invest a sizable amount , be sure to do your research and plan well before you dive in .
Replace the toilet :
If your model was installed before 1992 , you ’ll save water by replacing it with a new efficient toilet .
Older toilets can use as much as five gallons per flush ( GPF ) , while newer models are required to use 1.6 GPF or less .
Dual - flush models save even more by giving the user the option between a full or half - flush .
Study the water heater :
The simplest way to reduce energy use in a bathroom ( and to minimize the risk of a scalding burn ) is to keep your water heater set at 120 degrees Fahrenheit .
And , the easiest way to reduce costs even further is to place a shower or bath close to that water heater to minimize the distance hot water needs to travel ( see more about hot water heaters below under energy ) .
Install a heat recovery system : A waste - water heat recovery system captures the leftover heat that would otherwise escape down the shower drain and works well with all types of water heaters .
That water is then transferred to the cold water entering the water heater .
By preheating cold water , drain - water heat recovery systems help increase water heating capacity .
This increased capacity really helps if you have an undersized water heater , and cost recovery usually is better if the installation is in new home construction by a professional .
Use hot water circulation :
Hot water re-circulating systems use a pump to circulate cold water sitting in the hot water pipe back to the water heater .
This action eliminates the need to run a tap until the water heats .
One unit installed at the point of use farthest from the hot water heater will serve an entire home .
This is an easy system to install , so you might want to do this yourself .
Get a hard - working faucet :
Think durability for your bathroom faucet , since it probably is the most used faucet in the house .
A lifetime warranty and ceramic disc valves ( longwearing and easy to replace when damaged or worn ) are key for replacements .
If you want to sell your house , look for faucets that comply with the American Disabilities Act ( ADA approved ) , as these faucets will work across a wide variety of users .
Use a water - conserving aerator :
If you ca n’t or do n’t want to replace your faucet , see if the current faucet can be outfitted with an aerator .
This device will screw onto the end of the faucet to reduce flow , and it ’s easy enough for a DIY project
Do n’t lose sleep over the tub :
A tub is a tub is a tub ; however , if that tub needs some ‘ oomph , ’ it would be better and less expensive if you refinish it rather than replace it .
Despite the less expensive option , tub refinishing uses toxic materials .
Therefore , persons with chemical sensitivities should conduct thorough research about this option before going this route .
Salvage yards can be useful :
If your heart is set on replacing that tub ( or a sink ) , visit the local salvage yard to find something that will match your home ’s decor at a reduced price .
If you opt for a totally new tub , consider cast iron or heavy steel tubs with a porcelain finish .
These can last 50 years or more , although they do n’t hold heat like acrylic tubs ( which scratch easier ) .
Other options are available as well , so do your homework before you buy .
Use latex caulk when possible : Latex caulk is the least toxic of all caulks ( both in manufacture and in use ) , and cleans up with soap and water .
However , it tends to be less durable in bathrooms and in kitchens .
If you plan to use something other than latex , ask a retailer for the Materials Safety Data Sheets ( MSDS ) for the brands you are considering .
If the retailer cannot provide an MSDS , you might be able to find the information online .
Save the sink :
As you ’ll learn below in the kitchen remodel , sometimes it ’s best to recycle the sink and refinish it .
If you plan to replace it anyway , learn more about how much counter space you might need .
The National Kitchen and Bath Association ( NKBA ) recommends at least 30 inches of counter space between two bowls , measured from centerline to centerline ; otherwise you ’ll bump elbows with your significant other .
Kitchen
A kitchen remodel can be as complicated as a bathroom remodel and twice as expensive .
But , if you do things right the first time , you ’ll save money in the long run .
And , there are ways to reduce both the cost and complexity of a kitchen renovation as you increase that room ’s environmental efficiency .
Plan for disability and aging :
If you do n’t plan to sell your home , how will you fit into this home in ten to thirty years from now ?
Universal Design reexamines basic assumptions about designing areas like kitchens and baths , and the result is a more flexible , adaptable design that ’s useful to a wider range of ages , sizes , or physical abilities .
The National Kitchen and Bath Association maintains a list of kitchen and bath guidelines with access standards that are easy to follow .
Reduce utility bills :
If your refrigerator and dishwasher are more than 10 years old , you can most likely reduce your utility bills by replacing these appliances with newer high - efficiency models .
Start shopping at the Energy Star® website and look for the Energy Star label at a local retailer .
About that freezer – location , location , location !
In general , models with the freezer on the top use up to 25 % less energy than comparable side - by - side refrigerator / freezer models .
Remove the refrigerant before you recycle the fridge :
If you want to recycle your old refrigerator , select a service that will remove the refrigerant before recycling .
If you leave the refrigerant , you ’re releasing ozone - depleting CFCs into the atmosphere to join the estimated foiur million pounds of other CFCs released this way every year .
You may be charged a small fee , depending upon the services in your area .
Do you really need a new stove ?
Ovens and ranges are not included in the Energy Star program .
Given the inefficiency of these appliances ( it ’s estimated only six percent of the energy used to power an oven is actually absorbed by the food ) it makes sense to choose wisely and decide on the appliance based upon your cooking needs .
Part of the energy efficiency in this case is dependent upon how you cook .
Get the most out of your gas stove :
To get the most out of your gas stove , select one with an electric ignition so the pilot light is n’t always on .
An electronic ignition uses fourty percent less energy than a standard pilot light .
Also , make sure the burners on your stove are burning with blue cone - shaped flame .
A yellow flames means air inlets or burners need repair .
Finally , check the seal on your oven door regularly for gaps or tears that let heat escape .
Countertop magic : A countertop that ’s durable and easy to clean is a wise investment .
But , before you decide that your counter needs to be replaced , you might consider a less expensive repair or renewal .
Tile countertops can be re-grouted and wood countertops can be refinished .
Even a laminate surface can be re-glued if it ’s come loose .
If you want to replace the countertop , remind yourself that fabrication and installation costs can equal up to 80 % of the total price .
So , if you can do the work yourself , you ’ll save tons of money .
Recycled backsplash :
Since the backsplash does n’t need to stand up to the abuse that your countertop experiences , you can get creative about your choice of materials that will make the wall behind the counter easy to clean and protect it from moisture damage .
Think chalkboard slate , surplus or salvaged tempered glass , or a mosaic of salvaged tile or stone – anything that can withstand grease , scrubbing , and water .
Recycled sink :
If you ’re replacing a sink , think about using enameled cast iron .
Cast iron not only is durable , it ’s recyclable .
The downfall is that the enamel may chip and the cast iron could rust .
The other choice could be stainless steel , which also is recyclable .
Additionally , both types of sinks are commonly found at building salvage and industrial surplus yards , which could cut your cost tremendously .
Think twice before replacing cabinets :
If your current cabinets are from the 1950s or earlier there ’s a good chance they ’re built better than most on the market today .
If you ’re truly tired of them , consider a refacing at a fraction of the monetary and environmental cost .
You can find eco - friend veneers that do n’t require glue for this job .
Finally , the least expensive alteration would be painting and / or staining the cabinets , but be aware that this option may also require some hazardous materials , depending upon your choices .
Downsize : A dishwasher and refrigerator run most efficiently when full .
If you find that the only thing you keep in your fridge is that proverbial Chinese take - out box and if you rarely use your dishwasher , you might consider downsizing on both items .
Keep the faucet :
Unless that faucet is so damaged that you ca n’t use it anymore , consider reusing it .
Kitchen faucets must meet minimum standards for water efficiency and use no more than 21.2 gallons per minute ( GPM ) .
You can find the GPM marked on the aerator ( nozzle ) in most cases .
Kitchen aerators should use no more than 2.0 GPM .
You can replace an aerator , and if you want a new look , replace the handles .
If you really need a new faucet , look for lifetime warranties that include the finish , replacement parts , or a full replacement .
Check for ceramic disc valves , as they last longer and are less prone to drips .
Energy
An energy - efficient home is more cost - effective , and it ’s also more comfortable .
Learn about financial options : Lenders are beginning to recognize the value of ongoing savings to the homeowner through green remodeling .
Mortgage Options for Resource Efficiency ( MORE™ ) is a new program that lets you add up to $ 4,000 to your mortgage for home improvements that save energy or water , and HUD also has resources to help with remodeling .
Learn about these programs and more at the Energy Efficient Rehab Advisor .
Install a programmable thermostat :
This tool will help to minimize unnecessary heating and cooling when not at home .
Service your heating and cooling : Both heating and cooling systems should be serviced prior to peak seasons .
Think propane : Propane water heaters can cost one - third less to operate than electric water heaters , and they recover hot water twice as fast as electric water heaters .
You can increase your water heater ’s efficiency by draining it every six months to remove lime deposits and sediment .
On the other hand … :
When buying a hot water heater or furnace , avoid naturally - vented models to avoid air leakage .
Instead choose models with power venting or a combustion path that ’s sealed off from the indoor air .
Of course , electric water heaters eliminate the problem entirely , but you might find a propane model with power venting .
Take your time , do your research , and purchase the heater that ’s best for the home ’s needs .
Go photovoltaic : Cost remains the main deterrent to installing a photovoltaic ( PV ) system .
Check local incentives from your city or county , and do n’t forget to ask your utility company about their ideas .
Additionally , you might ask your banker about rolling the cost of a solar system into your mortgage with a home improvement loan .
One further way to cut costs is to choose a system that doubles as roofing material .
If you ’re ready for a roof replacement , you may see your cost returned more quickly with this option .
Current products are varied , so do your homework well before you talk with your banker .
Install a solar hot water system :
These systems provide hot water for all domestic needs .
The usual configuration includes panels containing fluid - filled tubes that capture the sun ’s energy and uses it to preheat your water heater ’s input .
Solar hot water systems have a much faster payback than solar electric systems and work even on cloudy days .
Get passive about your green activities : Passive cooling requires correct placement of windows , proper shading of windows by trees or constructed shade ( see landscaping below ) , light - colored roofs and walls that reflect heat , nighttime ventilation , and thermal mass to prevent overheating in hot , sunny weather .
Large west - facing glass areas usually present a risk of unwanted summer afternoon heat gains .
If the house is designed properly , you can avoid many cooling costs .
In some areas of the country , you might avoid air - conditioning altogether .
Learn about thermal mass : Thermal mass inside a building moderates temperature swings by storing heat when the sun is shining and releasing heat back into the building when it begins to cool off .
Materials commonly used for mass include water , concrete , masonry , and earth .
Mass and glazing ( also a component ) may vary depending upon where you live .
Spend time observing your location :
You may have lived in that house for ten years , but you may not know how the sun travels across your yard during different seasons .
Time spent observing sun , wind , rain , and ground water processes on your property pays off when you begin to plan for passive or active solar energy .
You ’ll learn where to place windows , perhaps where to plant that tree .
And , you ’ll learn more about the materials you need to reach your goals successfully .
Go underground : Earth - sheltered homes reduce heat loss and thermal swings .
You already may have a basement , so you can take advantage of this feature by expanding use of the lower floor and limiting use to the upper areas of your home .
Plan for the future :
Even if you cannot afford solar or passive energy now , plan for the inclusion of this green option in the future .
Leave room for solar / mechanical equipment , for extra pipe and conduit runs , and for materials that might be needed to expand structural support .
Downsize : Smaller homes mean fewer emissions , less expensive heating and cooling costs , and a cozier environment ( with no room for overt consumerism ! ) .
Instead of remodeling all those bedrooms , you might consider removing them totally .
Then , concentrate on that large yard and its fantastic possibilities for curb appeal .
Flooring
Eliminate or cover up that toxic old vinyl floor and mix it up throughout the house when it comes to floors .
Some of the least expensive and most environmentally ideal options include salvaged wood and concrete .
Carpet would be ideal for bedrooms , and recycled rubber might be the ticket for that kitchen .
Learn more about your options below , and remember that you ’ll always save money if you choose an environmentally friendly do - it - yourself option :
Bamboo :
If you ever get the chance to visit a bamboo stand , you ’ll be amazed – you can actually hear bamboo grow !
This plant is a fast - growing , rapidly renewable member of the grass family that is cut into strips and assembled into planks for flooring .
But , while this type of floor often is touted as more durable than hardwood , some users would beg to differ with that opinion .
Plus , if you read the Treehugger article in that previous link , you may discover that the demand for bamboo has placed it in a precarious position ecologically .
Plus , most bamboo is imported from Asia , so you ’re working against the environment through transportation issues .
If you do decide to use this flooring , it does n’t need to be stained or painted , but it must be sealed .
You also need to watch for low VOC content and try to avoid bamboo planks that have a wood core , especially if you ’re going to use this flooring in an area that might get damp ( kitchen , bathroom , etc. ) .
Bamboo will expand at different rates than wood , and this composite might fall apart under these demands .
Shop around and use that Treehugger article as a guide .
Carpets and rugs :
The carpet and rug industry now uses a labeling system to identify materials with fewer VOCs in carpet fiber or in installation adhesives .
Such carpeting improves indoor air quality , a major consideration of green building .
The Green Label Plus program , directed by the Carpet and Rug Institute , certifies environmentally friendly carpeting products ( Cushions , currently tested under the Green Label program , will soon undergo more rigorous testing standards under the Green Label Plus program as well ) .
Learn more about these carpets and how to limit health hazards from a fact sheet [ PDF ] produced by Washington Toxics Coalition .
Certified sustainable wood : Sustainable forest management makes it possible to harvest wood without any serious impact on the environment , because trees are a renewable resource that can be replaced time and time again , according to the National Wood Flooring Association ( NWFA ) .
But , you might consider using reclaimed or salvaged wood for floors .
This wood comes from either re-sawn salvaged lumber , logs reclaimed from river bottoms , or urban salvage – trees that are removed from properties because they ’re storm damaged or a safety hazard .
Both certified and salvaged wood have the advantage of being locally available in most cases .
Finish wood with water - or plant - based products like linseed oil or beeswax , or order it factory finished for convenience .
Concrete :
For homes with a concrete slab foundation , consider a finish layer of concrete using various types of decorative concrete techniques .
Concrete is durable , although it can produce cracks and stains over time .
Concrete also is hard on the feet , even when layered with carpet .
But , a concrete floor is an ideal candidate for radiant in - floor heating .
Finally , a concrete floor , if used wisely , can contribute to a home ’s energy efficiency as part of a passive solar system .
It absorbs heat during the day and releases it as temperatures drop at night .
Take a look around the Internet to see the possibilities , as you can color concrete with natural nontoxic pigments that will last the life of the floor , or treat the concrete with other design applications .
Cork :
The bark from the cork tree is removed every nine years to create bottle corks , and the scrap from this process is used for other products , including floors .
You can order these materials unfinished or pre-finished , and natural finishes are available from manufacturers .
Cork has great resilience , which makes it very comfortable for standing for long periods such as in the kitchen .
Since cork is imported from Europe , you face the environmental downside of not buying local .
Additionally , you need to keep your eye peeled for products sealed with low - toxic , low - VOC , or plant - based wax sealer .
Cork is long - lasting , but heavy furniture can dent the floor .
Additionally , cork will fade in direct sunlight , it may yellow with age , and cork reacts to changes in relative humidity and heat .
Wet mopping , for instance , may cause the seams to swell .
Laminates : Laminates usually consist of a thin layer of color or pattern over a tongue - in - groove base of wood or wood fiber that ’s glued together , but not to the subfloor .
This creates a single piece of flooring that floats above the subfloor with edges covered by molding ( which is why this type of floor also is called “ floating floor ” ) .
While durability and environmental benefits are uncertain , you can find laminates with recycled content , and some versions are made with bamboo and cork layers .
Some floating floors snap together , rather than use glue , and a floating floor is an ideal do - it - yourself project .
Natural linoleum : Natural linoleum is made primarily from linseed oil , pine resin , sawdust , cork dust , limestone and jute .
It is an all - natural alternative to resilient flooring , including sheet vinyl and vinyl composition tile , which are made from polyvinyl chloride .
Available in tiles and sheets , natural linoleum is naturally anti-static and antibacterial .
It also has ‘ give , ’ making it more comfortable for a standing surface .
The environmental drawback is that this material currently is transported from Europe , which results in transport issues and high cost ( about twice as much as vinyl , but it lasts twice as long ) .
Linoleum tiles are a good do - it - yourself project , but professional installation is recommended for linoleum sheet .
Recycled rubber : Recycled rubber flooring gives you the option of rolls or tiles that can be cut , shaped and customized to any length needed for easy installation .
Usually made from rubber reclaimed from salvage and landfills , this flooring is ideal for standing for long periods as it ’s even more resilient than cork – in fact , recycled rubber floors are now being used in fitness centers and as sidewalks .
The industry has become creative , so you can find various textures , thickness , and colors to choose from , both for indoor and outdoor flooring projects .
Recycled rubber resists buckling and cracking , and is said to last three times longer than concrete in outdoor projects .
Hopefully , a new factory will open near you , as the rubber is heavy , and the main cost is in the shipping .
Salvaged stone : Like concrete , stone is extremely durable , and just as hard on the feet .
So , you might want to avoid using this material in rooms where you stand for a long period of time ( like the kitchen ) .
But , on the plus side , stone floors also are candidates for in - floor heating .
If you use salvaged stone – especially if you find that stone on your own – you can save more than half the cost of new stone .
If you plan to seal the stone , use low - toxic water - based sealers .
Tile :
Walls present a great reason to use tile , especially glass tile that contains recycled materials .
Learn about tile flooring in the wall options section below .
Vinyl : Vinyl flooring has been a popular flooring choice for decades , especially in kitchens and bathrooms .
However , vinyl sheet flooring manufactured before the mid-1980s may contain high levels of asbestos in its backing material .
Additionally , vinyl tiles – especially the 9 ″ x 9 ″ tiles – from this era also may contain asbestos .
The asbestos in the tiles is usually much less likely to be released into the air than from the sheet vinyl backing .
In either case , if your home contains this type of flooring you might want to replace it .
But , you also might be required to use professionals [ PDF ] for this removal job , depending upon your local laws .
Sometimes it might be safer to lay a new floor over the vinyl rather than remove it .
Roofing
Here are some tips about whether you should or should n’t replace that roof .
Plus , we ’ve included information about your many roofing options , and the end result of a very environmentally friendly roof – rainwater collection !
You do want to save on that water bill and have a great looking yard , right ?
Use quality the first time :
You can choose high - quality recycled materials or your roof and escape the landfill altogether with this option .
Plus , since rainwater carries toxins from roofing tiles to groundwater , you help to protect water quality when you choose nontoxic materials .
So go with quality the first time around to avoid another roofing expense too soon down the road .
Do you need a new roof ?
If you inspect your roof annually for deterioration or damage , you ’ll stay on top of any repairs that need to be made .
Inspections can be coordinated with gutter cleaning .
Use binoculars when possible , as some roof surfaces damage easily with foot traffic , especially asphalt shingle in hot or cold weather .
Look for curling shingles , broken tiles , asphalt shingles that lose their granular layer , and excessive moss ( the latter sign may mean your roof needs cleaning , rather than replacing ) .
Check the attic : Sometimes a leak or other problem will originate in the attic rather than outside on the roof .
Often , the culprit is failed or improperly installed flashing
in especially vulnerable areas .
Research the contractor :
You can buy the best roof in the world with the longest known warranty and still have a lousy installation .
Do n’t always go with the lowest bid , as those low bids often smell of desperation .
Instead , get bids , ask around about the professional , check the local Better Business Bureau , and talk with the contractor to find out if he / she has used recycled materials before .
A well - done job on the front end will save you many years of repairs and grief .
Not all recyclable materials are equal : Inquire about the roofing products ’ suitability for rainwater harvest , because not all have been tested for water - quality impact .
Different products vary in recycled content as well , but you can discover the specifics from the manufacturer or the retailer .
No matter what you do , use high - quality stainless steel fasteners .
Stainless steel products are water - friendly and often have warranties for up to 75 years .
In fact , you might consider a stainless steel roof , but you need to watch for scratches , as that scratch will produce rust .
Avoid asphalt : Asphalt is , after all , a crude oil product .
And , asphalt tiles that contain built - in moss inhibitors may contain zinc , copper and other toxins that harm aquatic life , and may render water unusable for landscape or other rainwater harvest applications .
Aluminum :
You can find 100 % recycled content aluminum shingles along with baked - on resin finishes that meet National Sanitation Foundation ( NSF ) standards for rainwater harvest .
Look for anodized finishes .
Clay :
Also known as terracotta , you often can find used tiles as the tiles tend to outlast the buildings that they shelter .
Like concrete , however , you may need to install reinforcing structures because clay weighs in at 600- 900 lbs. per square .
This roof often is considered the best choice from a water quality perspective .
Concrete : Concrete roofs last a long time , and this is a good thing because the manufacture of concrete tile requires a large amount of energy to produce .
Plus , you may need extra structural support , as the weight of concrete may strain your existing supports .
Finally , your concrete roof may need to be waterproofed to ensure a long - lasting roof .
Recycled or certified wood shake :
Wood shake roofs are environmentally friendly , especially if they ’re made from responsible harvests , including FSC - certified products .
Storm - damaged trees and older wood left over from previous harvests resists rot , but some wood still may not fare well in areas with heavy rain and / or snowfall .
Slate : Outside of clay , this is one of the most water - quality - friendly choices for your roof .
Although expensive , 100 - year warranties are n’t uncommon .
Additionally , slate goes from quarry to roof with minimal processing .
But , since most of the slate quarries are located in the northeast U.S. , transportation would prove non-friendly to the environment for west coast residents .
Additionally , some slate is produced abroad ; before you purchase , you might want to learn about the slate ’s origins .
Like clay and cement , slate may require extra structural support , as it weighs as much as terracotta .
Slate roofing has been in use in this country since before the Revolutionary War , so search for used or recycled slate tiles to save money .
Go totally green : Ecoroofs have captured the minds of city officials as well as organic hippies .
Ecoroofs are vegetated roof systems used in place of a conventional roof .
Cost estimates come in at approximately twice per square foot of a quality metal roof , but this cost can vary depending upon roof design and your willingness to participate in labor .
Over the long term , however , the extended life span of a green roof makes this option extremely competitive .
Plus , some homeowners may find city incentives to ‘ grow ’ a green roof , an option that provides great insulation , treats rainwater with respect , and may extend the space for your garden !
Collect rainwater :
You probably wondered about the “ water - quality ” notes in the roofing materials above .
This is the deal – not only does excessive amounts of rainwater get wasted as it ’s diverted into storm or sewer systems , it also damages local natural water resources .
However , if you collect that rainwater , you can store it for later use .
Yes , you can use rain barrels ; but a better option might be a cistern that can hold from several hundred to thousands of gallons of water .
This amount of water is enough to reduce or even eliminate the need to use municipal water for landscaping , especially if you landscape wisely .
Learn more from the Texas Manual on Rainwater Harvesting [ PDF ] .
Wall Options
Wall decoration and protection choices are extensive , but many of your choices could be based upon whether you plan to stay in that home or if you plan to sell sometime soon .
In the latter instance , staging is important , and good staging advice includes the use of neutral paints .
But , if you plan to pass that house on to the grandkids , you can use many options , including recycled wallpaper and tiles and more .
Get the lead out :
If you own an older home ( built before 1978 , for instance ) , it almost certainly will contain some lead - based paint .
The presence of this paint makes renovation and repainting hazardous .
Before you begin to paint , visit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) information site and download their fact sheet [ PDF ] on “ Remodeling or renovating a home with lead - based paint . ”
You can also order it by calling ( 800 ) 424-LEAD ( 5323 ) .
Additionally , The Washington Toxics Coalition also offers an excellent fact sheet [ PDF ] , “ Reducing Exposure to Lead in Older Homes , ” which has a specific section on remodeling and paint removal .
Indoor paint : Some people are especially sensitive to various compounds found in paints , such as formaldehyde , chemical preservatives and fungicides .
It ’s best for your green remodel that you avoid any paints with the words , “ poison ” and “ warning ” on the labels .
Instead , use eco-friendly paints that contain low or no levels of VOCs that can cause eye or skin damage .
The advantage is that they ’re odorless , and these paints may actually improve the overall air quality since they ’re safe for the environment .
You can find these paints in a variety of colors , and they ’re cost efficient .
Do it right the first time : Learn more about the types of paint available and what to use indoors and outdoors .
Then , choose your brushes and rollers accordingly .
Choose colors carefully , so you do n’t waste time , money , and the environment with extra purchases .
You can find great tips on painting and the tools you ’ll need through an online brochure [ PDF ] produced by Seattle , Washington ’s Department of Planning and Development .
Paint first : Before you plan a carpet - elimination party , paint your walls .
You should still use tarps and / or drop clothes , but you wo n’t damage the floor under that carpet if you paint after you remove it .
Avoid sprayers :
It ’s human nature these days to want to finish a project yesterday .
So , sprayers seem to make sense since they appear to get a painting job done quickly and easily .
However , Paint sprayers can also be dangerous , injecting paint under the skin and into the bloodstream .
Because of these potential hazards , the use of paint spray equipment is best left to professionals .
Tile :
Tile usually is considered an environmental choice because it ’s durable and it ’s made from natural materials ( primarily clays and talc combined with water , pressed or poured into forms , then fired in a kiln ) .
Look for locally produced designs to avoid shipping and transportation costs when possible .
Also , you can find tiles with recycled contest , such as waste glass , feldspar tailings , or reprocessed porcelain .
Note , however , that 100 % recycled glass time makes for a slippery surface , so it ’s best suited for walls or accents .
While most professionals suggest hand - applied mortar and galvanized reinforcing mesh for a tile base , cement board applied to a sufficiently rigid subfloor is adequate for tile flooring .
Cost of tile will soar dramatically depending upon materials used , quality , size of tile , and complexity of tile design or the installed design .
Remember to avoid sealers free of formaldehyde and low in volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) when you finish installing your tile .
Use recycled wallboard and insulation when possible :
More companies are jumping on the recycling bandwagon as they realize the potential in reusing materials rather than producing them new .
Recycled wallboard represents one of those options , and if you hunt around you also can find recycled insulation .
Remember that your wallboard and insulation may be recyclable as well , and some companies may pay to haul it away for you .
Use the GreenHomeGuide and other resources to help decide what type of insulation you might need for your home .
Wallpapers : Just because that wallpaper ’s graphics detail endangered species , it does n’t mean that product is environmentally sound in its manufacturing .
The problem with wallpapers is that they take time to install ; so if you plan to resell that home the new owners might not take to your taste .
For reselling , it ’s best to stick to paint in neutral colors .
But , if you need to remove wallpaper , do your research .
Older wallpaper often can be removed with steamers .
Newer wallpaper pastes , however , were made to resist moisture , so you may need to find a professional wallpaper removal service for this situation .
If you ca n’t avoid using wallpapers , try to look at some recycled options and kits , or choose papers made from sustainable wood pulp , formaldehyde - free , and printed with water - based inks .

Ventilation
Levels of indoor air pollution can be two to five times higher than outdoor levels , thanks to toxic building materials , molds , allergens , and poor ventilation .
The following tips will help you bring fresh air indoors and circulate that air more efficiently :
Replace inefficient windows : Replacing windows can make a big difference to your utility bills .
Because it ’s a fairly challenging job for the average homeowner , most folks will want to bring in a contractor for this job .
Stop drafts :
Use caulk or weather stripping to seal doors and windows and close vents and doors to unused rooms .
Random leakage is n’t effective ventilation , because it ’s not reliable , regulated or distributed .
But you still need to vent :
A tight home is fine , as long as it comes with a controlled ventilation system .
The controlled ventilation described in this article is intended to maintain overall indoor air quality as ventilation systems should expel toxic air and increase the flow of fresh air .
Check filters :
Change cooling and heating filters monthly to allow for better air flow .
Keep that range hood small :
The hankering for commercial stoves has created a ventilation problem .
Larger hoods can suck exhaust gases out of a fireplace , wood stove , water heater or furnace , adding to toxic fumes in the home with backdrafts .
The Home Ventilating Institute ( HVI ) , a fan manufacturers ’ trade association , recommends range hood capacity of 40 to 50 CFM per linear foot of range , or about 120 to 150 CFM for the standard 30 - in. range .
Keep it small , or no larger than what you absolutely need .
Test for carbon monoxide :
If you insist on that large range hood , it might be wise to test for Carbon Monoxide in your home .
There are many hundreds of fatalities every year from Carbon Monoxide ( CO ) and just a small amount of CO in your living area can cause major problems over time .
If you outfit your new green abode with a CO detector , it will provide you and future owners with peace of mind , especially if you own a fireplace .
Replace attic vents with soffit and ridge vents :
If you own an older home , you may discover that you need more ventilation in your attic ( your county building codes will be instructive in this case ) .
If so , you might want to adopt the soffit and ridge vent combination , which seems to work well to distribute fresh air , to lower energy costs , and to keep your attic dry .
Search for this combination on the Internet , and you ’ll find various ‘ how to ’ articles that can shed light on how to install this type of ventilation .
Avoid ceiling fans :
It ’s long been held that ceiling fans reduce energy use because users can raise thermostat setting point two or three degrees .
However , a field study by the Florida Solar Energy Center ( FSEC ) revealed that there was no correlation between using ceiling fans and saving energy .
Instead , a computer simulation showed a potential energy use increase of ten percent , as the energy used to run the fans exceeded the potential savings .
Additionally , waste heat from the fan motos added to the building ’s cooling load .
monitored energy use and surveyed the occupants of 400 new homes in central Florida .
They also collected indoor temperature readings for 63 homes .
The average home had four or five ceiling fans that operated 13 to 14 hours per day .
Landscaping
Learning how to landscape with an environmental objective may seem foreign to you at first .
But , the links and tips below will help to guide you along the way as you begin to restore your landscape to its natural ecological functions , and reduce your need for water , fertilizer , pesticides , and other toxic chemicals .
Rethink your attitude :
The EPA estimates that the average American spends more than 90 % of his or her life indoors .
Considering that indoor air is more polluted than outdoor air , you might look at your yard in a new light .
Consider that yard as a healthy extension to your home , an investment in your health , and as added value to your home .
Head back to the local planning department :
Before you decide to build shelters or outbuildings , check with the county planning and development department for codes that you might need to abide by and for permits that you may need to build .
Consider taking a course : Local colleges might have what is known as a “ Master Gardener ” course that residents can take .
These courses are worth their weight in gold , as they look at local resources and environments and teach you what plants and grasses you might use to help conserve that environment .
Plan long and hard :
Taking a course is well within your time frame , as a landscaping revamp is a time - consuming project .
Doing it right the first time around will save you time and money in the long run .
Search online for “ landscape symbols ” and print some out .
Play around with graph paper and these images as you learn about local environments and you ’ll discover the landscape plan suited for your home .
Study Xeriscaping : Xeriscape began in Colorado as a means to promote creative approaches to water conserving .
These environmentally specific landscape techniques help people to conserve water , maintenance , and other resources by using techniques , plants , and grasses that are indigenous to a given area .
In other words , you would n’t want to grow plants from the northeast U.S. in the southwest , as you ’ll need to use too much water to keep that plant alive .
Nor would you want to try to grow cactus in Seattle , as the amount of rainwater in that city would kill the effort .
Some cities have adopted local Xeriscape centers , so conduct some research to see what you have available locally .
Learn about construction options :
Once again , the city of Seattle pulls through with a great brochure [ PDF ] that provides information about various landscape construction materials and mulches .
They also offer information on decks , fences , raised rockbeds , irrigation , and ‘ found objects ’ as yard art .
The only disappointment is that they do n’t include recycled rubber as a choice for walkways ( see Flooring above ) .
Watch HGTV : Although the Home and Garden television station is n’t always about greening your home ( although they now maintain a new green mission ) , they have some great ideas for curb appeal .
If you threw out your TV along with your meat - eating habits , then visit the HGTV site online for ideas .
Other green landscaping sites also carry some creative thoughts that might fit with your ideals and with your home .
Without a doubt , the green movement is on , it ’s real , and you ’ll be left behind if you do n’t begin making changes now .
But , do n’t feel as though you need to complete a total remodel within the next year .
Take your time , learn as much as possible about your choices , and have fun with the process .
You are , after all , improving your health along the way , and – as a result – you might live longer to enjoy the changes that you ’ve wrought .

I ’m sure there might be something else out there , perhaps the caning of Charles Sumner by Preston Brooks , but I think it was reached yesterday when a Congressional Committee started investigating Roger Clemens ’ ass :
WASHINGTON — Throughout the confrontation between Roger Clemens and Brian McNamee , much of the back and forth has been based on recollections of events as far as 10 years ago .
But on Wednesday , the committee produced documentary evidence that appeared — at least in part — to corroborate McNamee ’s account that Clemens was treated for an infection in his left buttocks in 1998 .
The only good thing that could have happened at that moment would have been if Daniel Webster and Henry Clay had risen from their respective graves and kicked those 40 morons out of their seats .
Update 2/15/2008 : Henry Waxman now says he regrets the hearing was held at all :
WASHINGTON — A day after a dramatic , nationally televised hearing that pitted Roger Clemens against his former personal trainer and Democrats against Republicans , the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said Thursday that he regretted holding the hearing in the first place .
The chairman , Henry A. Waxman , Democrat of California , said the four - hour hearing unnecessarily embarrassed Clemens , who he thought did not tell the truth , as well as the trainer , Brian McNamee , who he thought was unfairly attacked by committee Republicans .
“ I think Clemens and McNamee both came out quite sullied , and I did n’t think it was a hearing that needed to be held in order to get the facts out about the Mitchell report , ” Waxman said .
“ I ’m sorry we had the hearing .
I regret that we had the hearing .
And the only reason we had the hearing was because Roger Clemens and his lawyers insisted on it . ”
Well , you could ’ve said no Chairman .
Frequent Slashdot contributor Bennett Haselton wants to make online dating better .
Here 's how he wants to do it .
" Suppose you 're an entrepreneur who wants to break into the online personals business , but you face impossible odds because everybody wants to go where everybody else already is ( basically , either Match.com or Yahoo Personals ) .
Here is a suggestion that would give you an edge .
In a nutshell : Each member lists the criteria for people that they are looking for .
Then when people contact them , they choose whether or not to respond .
After the system has been keeping track of who contacts you and who you respond to , the site lists your profile in other people 's search results along with your criteria - specific response rate : " Lisa has responded to 56 % of people who contacted her who meet her criteria . "
Read on for the rest of his thoughts .
I realize that every time I write something along the lines of " They should do it this way instead of the way they do it now " , whether for search engines content rating systems or whatever , I leave some people shrugging and wondering why anyone should switch to my idea .
So let me try something new : I want to prove mathematically that this change would result in some ( in fact , most ) of the participants being better off , while nobody would be worse off ( what economists call a Pareto improvement ) .
I am not necessarily saying that it would lead to a good outcome for everybody ; basically , it will lead to better outcomes for most users ( although some of those will still be bad outcomes ) , and will do so in a lot less time .
If as soon as you read the phrase " I can prove mathematically " you thought , " Oh well no wonder he gets such a low response rate if he talks like that all the time " , then I humbly submit that ( 1 ) while I like my Slashdot persona of a pedant banging people over the head with what I think is a brilliant idea , I do have other programmable settings , like conversation about movies , and ( 2 ) for once , it 's not just me .
Sites like eDateReview.com list hundreds of reviews for the most popular sites like Yahoo , Match.com and eHarmony , all of which got an average rating of about 2 out of 5 .
Another site hosting reviews of online personals services , DatingSitesReviews.com , posted a message urging people to take the predominantly negative reviews with a grain of salt , since users with a bad experience are much more likely to post a review than users with a positive one , but that only generated comments from the site 's users reiterating , " No , they really do suck . "
Most of the complaints from men are not just about the number of obviously fake profiles ( which led to lawsuits against Yahoo and Match.com ) , but about the low response rate even from women who are ostensibly real .
Not that I blame the women .
Having watched over the shoulder of some female friends scrolling through their Yahoo Personals inboxes , some of them get far too many messages to reply to ( and even if they had time to reply , they 'd only be leading on most of the correspondents , since there would never be enough time to actually meet all of them ) .
Yahoo Personals formats your inbox so that you see each person 's picture along with the first few words of what they wrote , so if you have too many messages , all you can really do is scroll through the pictures ( yes , women do care about that ) .
In fact , Yahoo has a feature that lets you see the users who have viewed your profile -- which may have revealed more than Yahoo intended , since sometimes after writing to 20 or 30 people , I find out that none of them even clicked through to my profile anyway -- so if you 're a guy , take Yahoo 's advice about " polishing your profile " with a grain of salt .
( In fact , many users with Yahoo Personals profiles are not paid members , which means they cannot reply to the messages you send them except with boilerplate like " I liked your message " , and Yahoo blocks you from sending them your e-mail address .
So Yahoo is listing them as people that you can contact through their service , even though Yahoo knows those people wo n't be able to write you back .
If this strikes you as something between bad site design and actionable fraud , then you are not a Yahoo employee . )
So , yes , there is a problem worth solving .
For the purpose of describing the response - rate system , I 'm going to dispense with political correctness and refer to the people sending the messages as the " men " and to the people receiving messages as the " women " .
I hear from the pilot episode of Sex and the City that after the " mid- thirties power flip " , the odds shift the other way ( due to women getting older and the men accumulating more money , although the show does n't put it quite so bluntly ) , so if you 're in that age bracket , substitute the appropriate genders in the discussion below .
Note that I when I talk about listing women 's response rates , I am talking about their response rates to men who meet their criteria .
If you only want to meet men aged 28 to 29 who are interested in paddleboating , then your displayed response rate is only affected by the percentage of messages that you respond to from men in that group .
The mathematical argument commences :
If you 're a man writing to women on a site , for every women there are two essential variables : the probability P that she will reply to you , and how much value V you would place on getting a reply from her ( say , on a scale of 1 to 10 ) .
For any woman that you write to , if P = ( probability of getting a reply ) and V = ( value of getting a reply ) , then then probabilistic benefit of writing to her is P x V .
( And I swear I did n't notice this until after I 'd written the article , but I do not want to hear anything juvenile about framing a discussion of men meeting women in terms of the " P " and the " V " . )
If you have non-standard tastes , such as a preference for " Big Beautiful Women " , that 's great , since the women that you consider to be 9s and 10s may also be the ones that you have the highest chance of getting a reply from , since fewer other men are writing to them , and P x V for those women will be -- in a manner of speaking -- huge .
Unfortunately , if your tastes are fairly typical , then the women you consider to be 9s and 10s are also getting lots of messages from other men , and have the lowest probability of replying to you .
So as V = ( value of getting a reply ) goes up , P = ( probability of getting a reply ) goes down , and the product does n't vary as much as you would like .
There 's nothing that the response - rate system can do about that .
In any case , if you 're allocating your time rationally , you would first write to the members where you estimate P x V to be the highest , and then write to the members where P x V was the next highest , and then based on the cost - benefit principle , you 'd continue writing until P x V of writing to the next person is exceeded by the value of the time it would take you to do it .
( The incremental value of each additional minute of your time is not constant -- after a long time spent sending messages , you might get bored , and would require a larger incentive to spend an additional minute of your time doing it . )
All of this is basically intuition and common sense , even if people do n't think of it in terms of these equations ( except me ! ) .
But here 's the advantage of the response - rating system :
With a conventional personals site , you 're only guessing the value of P x V -- to be precise , you know the value of V ( at least as well as anyone can possibly know it from reading someone 's profile ) , but you 're only estimating P , based on how many messages you think she 's probably getting from other people .
Because of that randomness , that means some of the time you are sending messages without the best possible P x V value , and probably some of the time you are even sending messages where P x V would not even be worth the effort of sending the message , if you knew how low P was .
Whereas with a system that shows a woman 's response rate to people who meet her criteria , if you 're someone who meets her criteria , you know roughly the probability P of getting a reply .
( Actually , the probability P for you of getting a response , might not be the percentage - response - rate displayed by the site -- if you have an especially attractive or unattractive face , but there 's no way for the woman to specify that in her criteria , then your chance of getting a reply might be higher or lower than the displayed percentage - response - rate .
But , then you could just scale all of the displayed response rates upwards or downwards to gauge your probability P of getting a reply .
It would still be better than making a total guess on a conventional personals site that did n't display percentage response rates at all . )
So this is an unambiguous improvement from the point of view of the men .
Another reason why men would be much better off is a specific case of this : they would avoid the time sink of writing to women who do not or cannot respond to most of the messages they 're getting .
With a response - rate system , those women 's profiles would gradually display lower and lower response rates until the percentage was low enough to dissuade all but the most optimistic ( or handsome ) suitors .
Without a display of the response rate , those users continue getting ridiculously large numbers of messages for as long as their profiles are active ( as some of my female friends with profiles could attest ) .
Then consider from the women 's point of view .
Suppose you 're a woman interested in meeting people who meet certain criteria , and you 're sincerely interested in replying to at least a significant portion of people who fit those criteria .
The problem is that of the men who meet those requirements , some of their attention is still going to be siphoned off by them writing to other women who only have a low chance of responding .
Even if you have very specific criteria , so the men who meet your criteria have a great chance of getting a reply from you , on a conventional personals site they might not realize that .
But if your response rate were displayed by your profile , then when men searched for women whose criteria they met ( and who met their own criteria as well ) , you would be listed as one of the people with the highest chance of replying , and you 'd have a greater chance of hearing from men who met your requirements .
( This is not a huge benefit for women , because most women get enough messages that there will usually be some who meet their criteria anyway .
The response - rate system would mainly be beneficial to men ; I 'm just saying it would not be worse for women and would in fact be a little better for some of them . )
Now there 's one group of people who would not be better off : Women who create accounts mainly for the ego boost of getting huge numbers of messages and not replying to them .
I talked with a few women who used the personals sites for this purpose ; some I knew in person , some of them I talked to back when Yahoo Personals would display a woman 's Yahoo Messenger screen name , and if you sent them an instant message they would sometimes reply out of sheer boredom and admit that that was what they were doing .
These people would not be better off in a system that displayed response rates , since after their response rates dwindled low enough , so would the number of messages .
So this would not be a true Pareto improvement , since the definition of a Pareto improvements insists on nobody being worse off , and does n't make judgments as to people 's reasons .
Fine , but I submit that people who use the personals sites for the ego boost of ignoring messages are going against the site 's purpose , and any improvement that pisses them off but improves things for everybody else , is still a good thing .
You might worry that the ego - trippers would continue to game the system by writing trivially short replies to all the messages they got , in order to keep their " response rate " high and keep the messages coming .
I 'm not sure , but I do n't think that would be very common , because my impression from talking to the girls who do this is that the whole point of the ego boost is that the messages keep coming in without them having to do anything .
If they had to exert themselves at all -- even long enough to reply to each message and say " yeah " -- then it would n't feel as much fun .
Probably some would do this anyway .
But of the men who kept getting responses like " yeah " and " I dunno " , hopefully they would get the message quickly and stop wasting time .
I could be wrong about some of these things , but my point is that it would not be any worse than the old system , where so many users already waste time writing to people who do n't write back , and the new system would probably be better since it would eliminate some of the time - wasters .
There are some design decisions that I did n't specify here -- for example , do you display each user 's response rate over their entire history on the site , or just over the last 24 - 72 hours , or both ?
A trickier question :
Do you display the user 's criteria that they have entered to specify what they 're looking for , and which are used when the site calculates their response rate to all users who " meet their criteria " ?
Most sites do of course let users list what they are looking for .
But suppose a woman is only interested in meeting men who make more than $ 75,000 per year , but she thinks it would be crass to list that on her profile .
On the other hand , if she does n't list it as a requirement , then her percentage response rate will be dragged down by all the men writing to her who make less than $ 75,000 but who she 's not interested in replying to .
One alternative would be that she could still have one set of public criteria displayed on her profile , and one set of " secret " criteria that included the $ 75,000 cutoff .
Then men who made $ 75,000 or more would be steered toward her profile with the message , " You meet her criteria , and she responds to 50 % of men who meet her requirements ! "
But you 'd have the ticklish business of men who somehow find her profile , and meet all of her public criteria , but can't figure out why the system is telling them that they were n't a match for her -- and they contact the service to ask why , and tech support has to tactfully explain that sometimes you do n't meet all of someone 's secret requirements .
In any case , a man would be able to reverse - engineer a woman's " secret " requirements by varying his own characteristics on his profile until the system said , " Ding !
You 're a match for her ! "
( But then what are you going to do , send her a message calling her a gold digger ?
Go ahead , it does n't affect her percentage response rate anyway . )
In concluding that " everyone " would be better off under this system , I did make the type of assumptions that are common in mathematical / economic models , such as assuming that all participants are cold rationalists maximizing benefit to themselves .
Such assumptions often do model human behavior pretty well , even in romantic pairings -- it explains why 10's usually end up with 10's , 9's usually end up with 9's , and so on .
But these axioms may not take seemingly " irrational " preferences into account .
For example , I 've assumed that if it would be a waste of time for a user to write to 10 women who are not going to write back , then the new system is an improvement if it dissuades him from ever writing to those 10 women in the first place , because the end result is the same ( nothing ) and you 've saved them the effort .
But on a conventional personals site , after someone has written to 10 people and before they realize they 're not getting any responses , they still have the hope that they might get answers , and that can be a good feeling .
They 'll be disappointed later on once they realize they 're not getting any responses , but if they have a personality that is especially receptive to hope and especially resistant to disappointment , then it could average out to a better overall experience under the old system .
Well , the old - style Match.com and Yahoo Personals would still be around for people who prefer to dream .
I 'm just saying the new - style system would better suit people looking for results .
The real problem with starting a competing personals site around this system ( apart from pulling in enough users to reach " critical mass " , but assume you had an ad campaign to do that ) , is that even if your system produced better matches for everybody in the long run , Yahoo Personals and Match.com would still be better at luring people in with the hope of getting a fabulous match - up .
Even if Yahoo Personals got rid of all the fake profiles , and even if they gave anyone listed as a " member " a way to reply to people who send them messages ( which among other things would bring them in line with laws against false advertising ) , their gallery would still be glittering with all the profiles of people who are getting too much mail to possibly reply to it all -- but as a new user , you would n't know that .
On the other hand , with a personals site that listed criteria - specific response rates next to each profile , if you did n't have a good chance of getting a response from the most popular users , you 'd know that from the beginning .
You could then come back down to Earth and focus on the users whose criteria you met and who responded to most of their mail .
But the site would n't be able to use its superstars to lure people in and string them along like Yahoo and Match.com can do .
So , to the business that launches a personals site around this system , this is what I 'd propose to do :
Since your system really does work better , contact a bunch of single reporters ( I mean , higher up than me ) and tell them to sign up for an account with Yahoo Personals , an account with Match.com , and an account with your new response - rating site , and spend twenty minutes on each site writing to users that they 're interested in meeting .
Or sponsor a controlled study where dozens of users try the same thing .
Your site will be the only one where the participants can find and write to the members with the highest response rate for people meeting their criteria , and if the system really does result in more efficient matches , then the reporters and the study organizers ought to be able to verify that .
Then you have your new ad campaign !
It 's easy to list all the problems that would occur in this system :
People could lie on their profiles , you can't always judge someone from a profile even if they 're honest , people could waste your time starting a conversation and then bailing on you , just because people meet through the site does n't mean they 'll be a good match in person , etc .
But these are problems with any personals site .
This system only addresses the specific problem of efficiency ; I have n't come up with an algorithmic solution to all of the problems of dating and love .
It 's only Tuesday .
Belichick did say that the video assistant Matt Estrella would not be on the sideline videotaping during tomorrow night ’s game against the Chargers .
Commissioner Roger Goodell told the Patriots the league would be monitoring their videotaping from now on .
“ We will change our procedure on that , ” Belichick said .
The Patriots owner Robert K. Kraft , who has been largely silent while the drama played out the last two days , said in a statement that the week had been extremely difficult .
Goodell made a point of noting , when he announced his punishment Thursday night , that Kraft did not know what Belichick was up to .
Kraft is extremely concerned about the image his team projects and he said he was “ deeply disappointed that the embarrassing events of this past week may cause some people to see our team in a different light . ”
How this transgression will affect Belichick ’s relationship with Kraft remains to be seen .
His contract status is unknown .
But for now , Kraft gave Belichick , who has won three Super Bowls with the Patriots , a vote of support .
“ I believe that Coach Belichick always tries to do what is best for the team and he is always accountable for his decisions , ” Kraft said .
“ He has been a very important part of what our organization has accomplished over the last seven years .
In this case , one of his decisions has resulted in a severe penalty for our franchise .
He has paid a heavy price and so has our organization .
He has apologized for his actions .
I accept his apology and look forward to working with him as we move forward . ”
Still , the conversation about whether Goodell ’s punishment was severe enough continued yesterday .
Wade Wilson , the Dallas assistant who was suspended five games for using human growth hormone , told ESPN.com that he believed a double standard was applied that allowed Belichick to avoid suspension and remain on the sideline .
“ I do n’t want to be seen as a crybaby or as someone questioning the commissioner ’s decision , but I see some major inconsistencies here , ” Wilson said .
The Giants owner John Mara said most teams would think the penalty — the Patriots also will lose a first - round draft pick in 2008 if they make the playoffs , and second - and third - rounders if they do not — was appropriate .
Roddick was not impressed by the newly - laid clay courts

France , Argentina , Russia and the Czech Republic also made strong starts .
" Is it the worst I 've played on in the Davis Cup ?
Absolutely .
It was terrible but at least it was terrible for both sides , " said Roddick .
" I 'm not sure why they were granted special permission by the ITF to do this .
I tried asking the referee and did n't get an answer .
" I do n't know who I should ask next .
It was only laid on Tuesday and clay needs time to settle .
It 's a shame when points are decided by the court and not the players . "

Now , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , ratified by the U.S. in 1994 , further observes that the U.S. must do more to protect and support the African American community .
In 2006 , the United Nations Human Rights Commission “ noted its concern that while African Americans constitute just 12 % of the population , they represent 50 % of homeless people , and the government is required to take ‘ adequate and adequately implemented ’ measures to remedy this human rights violation . ”
In short , the United Nations has issued reports squarely calling for the United States to do more to eliminate racial discrimination — and this discrimination is a human rights violation .
I am deeply offended that in the middle of a Presidential campaign , remarks–be they from a pastor or a communications mogul , or a former Vice Presidential nominee–are the cause of a focus on race , and not the deep racial disparities that communities are forced to endure on a daily basis in this country .
Myriad reports and studies that have been done all come up with the same basic conclusion : in order to resolve deep and persisting racial disparities in this country , a public policy initiative is urgently needed .
A real discussion of race , in the context of a Presidential election , ought to include a discussion of the various public policy initiatives offered by the various candidates to eliminate all forms and vestiges of racial discrimination , including the racial disparities that cloud the hopes , dreams , and futures of millions of Americans .
For example , every year on the anniversary of the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , United for a Fair Economy publishes a study of the true state of people of color in America called the “ State of the Dream Report . ”
And it was their 2004 report that noted that without public policy intervention , it would take 1,664 years to close the racial gap in home ownership in this country .
And that on some indices , for example , infant mortality , the racial disparities were worse at the time of the report than at the time of the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr .
In their 2005 report , entitled , “ Disowned , ” United for a Fair Economy explored the disparate impact of Bush ’s “ Ownership Society ” economic program that saw Black and Latino lives shattered as unemployment , income , home ownership , business ownership , and stock ownership plummeted even in the face of Administration economists trumpeting the phenomenal “ growth ” of the U.S. economy as a result of their policies .
In 2006 , United for a Fair Economy focused on the devastating and embarrassing effect of government inaction before , during , and after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita .
They focused on something as simple as car ownership and the relationship between vehicle ownership and race .
In the case of New Orleans , car ownership literally meant the difference between losing or saving one ’s life .
In 2007 , United for a Fair Economy explored the Black voters ’ attachment to the Democratic Party , and in a piece entitled , “ Voting Blue , but Staying in the Red , ” they explored goals that the Democratic Party should have put at the top of its agenda for its first 100 hours in the majority .
While noting that the Democrats did n’t even mention Katrina in their agenda , United for a Fair Economy concluded that Blacks and Latinos voted in the November 2006 elections in the blue , but due to a failure of public policy that pays attention to their needs , they continue to live in the red .
In their 2008 report , United for a Fair Economy explores the sub - prime mortgage crisis and note that the largest loss of wealth in U.S. history is being experienced by the Black and Latino communities with an estimated $ 92 billion being lost by Blacks and an estimated $ 98 billion being lost by Latinos .
And while families are losing their life savings and the only major investment that they own , policy makers are asking them to tighten their belts .
But the predator banks ’
CEOs are walking away with record remuneration .
And our policy makers are notable for their inaction : first on the predatory lending that disproportionately affects Blacks and Latinos , and then on offering relief so that homeowners remain homeowners , including in the midst of this crisis .
Sadly , United for a Fair Economy is n’t the only research organization to find glaring and intolerable disparities in our society by race and no appropriate public policies enacted to address them .
Hull House did a study that found that it would take 200 years to close the gap in the quality of life experienced by black Chicagoans and white Chicagoans .
There has been no public policy initiative taken up by the mayor or the governor of Illinois to begin closing that gap .
Several years ago , the New York Times published a finding that nearly half the men between the ages of 16 and 64 in New York City were unemployed .
There was no initiative by the mayor or the governor of New York to begin addressing such pain .
Every year , the National Urban League publishes a study , “ The State of Black America , ” in which the ills and disparities that persist in this country are catalogued .
Every year , the story is basically the same .
The United States has a way to go that only public policy can address .
However , when Harvard University / The Kaiser Family Foundation did a study on White attitudes about race several years ago , it found that Whites have little appreciation for the reality of Black life in America , from police harassment and intimidation , to imprisonment , to family income , unemployment , housing , and health care .
But without an appreciation of the reality faced by many of our fellow Americans , the necessary public policy initiatives to change those realities will find difficulty gaining acceptance in the public discourse .
Additionally , compounding the problem , there is little public discourse because the corporate press refuse to cover the deep implications of the results of all these studies .
I am convinced that if the American people knew the truth of the conditions , change would surely follow .
I believe that to be the case because of the impact of the images of “ Bloody Sunday ” on the passage of the Voting Rights Act .
I believe that to be the case because of the impact of the images of the Vietnam War on the turn of the tide of public opinion against that War .
This moment sheds light on a much - needed discussion : on race and the legacies of race and slavery and the continuing problems associated with our failure to treat racism as a curable American disease .
I am glad that candidate Obama mentioned the existing racial disparities in education , income , wealth , jobs , government services , imprisonment , and opportunity .
Now it is time to address the public policies necessary to resolve these disparities .
Now it is time to have the discussion on how we are going to come together and put policies in effect that will provide real hope and real opportunity to all in this country .
To narrow the gap between the ideals of our founding fathers and the realities faced by too many in our country today :
That must be the role of public policy at this critical moment in our country today .
I welcome a real discussion of race in this country and a resolve to end the long - standing disparities that continue to spoil the greatness of our country .
I welcome a real discussion of all the issues that face our country today and the real public policy options that exist to resolve them .
That must be the measure of this campaign season .
For many voters , this important discussion has been too vague or completely non-existent .
Now is the time to talk about the concrete measures that will move our country forward : on race , war , climate change , the economy , health care , and education .
Our votes and our political engagement must be about ensuring that fairness truly for all is embodied in “ liberty and justice for all . ”
His first big subject was belief itself .
Instead of waging a partisan campaign as Clinton had just done , he vowed to address “ not just Democrats , but Republicans and independents who ’ve lost trust in their government but want to believe again . ”
Then he made a broader attack on the political class , and without mentioning her , threw Clinton in with the decrepit old order .
“ The same old Washington textbook campaigns just wo n’t do , ” he said , in a now familiar line .
He said it was time to “ finally tackle problems that George Bush made far worse but that had festered long before George Bush ever took office  the problems that we ’ve talked about year after year after year . ”
Obama sketched out a different theory of social change than the one Clinton had implied earlier in the evening .
Instead of relying on a president who fights for those who feel invisible , Obama , in the climactic passage of his speech , described how change bubbles from the bottom - up : “ And because that somebody stood up , a few more stood up .
And then a few thousand stood up .
And then a few million stood up .
And standing up , with courage and clear purpose , they somehow managed to change the world ! ”
For people raised on Jane Jacobs , who emphasized how a spontaneous dynamic order could emerge from thousands of individual decisions , this is a persuasive way of seeing the world .
For young people who have grown up on Facebook , YouTube , open - source software and an array of decentralized networks , this is a compelling theory of how change happens .
Clinton had sounded like a traditional executive , as someone who gathers the experts , forges a policy , fights the opposition , bears the burdens of power , negotiates the deal and , in crisis , makes the decision at 3 o’clock in the morning .
But Obama sounded like a cross between a social activist and a flannel - shirted software C.E.O.  as a nonhierarchical , collaborative leader who can inspire autonomous individuals to cooperate for the sake of common concerns .
Clinton had sounded like Old Politics , but Obama created a vision of New Politics .
And the past several months have revolved around the choice he framed there that night .
Some people are enthralled by the New Politics , and we see their vapors every day .
Others think it is a mirage and a delusion .
There ’s only one politics , and , tragically , it ’s the old kind , filled with conflict and bad choices .
Hillary Clinton has fought on with amazing resilience since then , and Tuesday night may well bring another surprise , but she ’s always been the moon to his sun .
That night in November , he defined the campaign .
[ Excerpt from the new book by Greg Mitchell , So Wrong for So Long : How the Press , the Pundits  and the President  Failed on Iraq ( Union Square Press ) . ]
On March 6 , 2003 , less than two weeks before he ordered the country to war , President Bush conducted a televised press conference , stating in his intro , “ We will not wait to see what terrorists or terrorist states could do with weapons of mass destruction . ”
Some of the questions from the press were sharp , many others weak , but one asking about his religious strength gave him an opportunity to say , “ My faith sustains me because I pray daily .
I pray for guidance and wisdom and strength .
But it ’s a humbling experience to think that people I will never have met have lifted me and my family up in prayer .
And for that I ’m grateful . ”
It was the mood of the affair that was most noteworthy .
Bush smiled and made his usual quips , and many of the reporters played the game and did not press him hard .
This was how these press gatherings had gone throughout the run-up to war .
But this meeting was heavily scripted , with Bush looking at a slip of paper and calling on reporters in a prearranged order .
No one challenged him on this .
When it was over , I asked Ari Berman , then an intern with Editor & Publisher and now a talented veteran at The Nation , to come up with a few questions we wished reporters had asked that night .
I added a few myself , and published them , under the heading , “ Questions We Wish They ’d Asked . ”
Some of reporters at the press conference appeared to have some second thoughts themselves .
ABC ’s Terry Moran said the president was not “ sufficiently challenged ” and that reporters ended up “ looking like zombies . ”
Elisabeth Bumiller of the New York Times explained , “ We were very deferential ” because “ it ’s very intense , it ’s frightening to stand up there on primetime live television asking the president of the United States a question when the country ’s about to go to war . ”
She admitted that “ no one wanted to get into an argument with the president at this very serious time . ”
Here are most of the unasked questions that Berman and I put together then :
This web page , consisting of quotations from several speeches made on the Floor of the House of Representatives by the Honorable Louis T. McFadden of Pennsylvania , should be printed , linked to , and circulated far and wide .
Due to his having served as Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee for more than 10 years , Congressman McFadden was the best posted man on these matters in America and was in a position to speak with authority of the vast ramifications of this gigantic private credit monopoly .
As Representative of a State which was among the first to declare its freedom from foreign money tyrants it is fitting that Pennsylvania , the cradle of liberty , be again given the credit for producing a son that was not afraid to hurl defiance in the face of the money - bund .
Whereas Mr. McFadden was elected to the high office on both the Democratic and Republican tickets , there can be no accusation of partisanship lodged against him .
Because these speeches are set out in full in the Congressional Record , they carry weight that no amount of condemnation on the part of private individuals could hope to carry .
On May 23 , 1933 , Congressman , Louis T. McFadden , brought formal charges against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank system , The Comptroller of the Currency and the Secretary of United States Treasury for numerous criminal acts , including but not limited to , CONSPIRACY , FRAUD , UNLAWFUL CONVERSION , AND TREASON .
The petition for Articles of Impeachment was thereafter referred to the Judiciary Committee and has YET TO BE ACTED ON .

I see that Andrew Sullivan was asked to list what he got wrong about Iraq for the five year anniversary of the invasion , and since I was as big a war booster as anyone , I thought I would list what I got wrong :
Everything .
And I do n’t say that to provide people with an easy way to beat up on me , but I do sort of have to face facts .
I was wrong about everything .
I was wrong about the Doctrine of Pre-emptive warfare .
I was wrong about Iraq possessing WMD .
I was wrong about Scott Ritter and the inspections .
I was wrong about the UN involvement in weapons inspections .
I was wrong about the containment sanctions .
I was wrong about the broader impact of the war on the Middle East .
I was wrong about this making us more safe .
I was wrong about the number of troops needed to stabilize Iraq .
I was wrong when I stated this administration had a clear plan for the aftermath .
I was wrong about securing the ammunition dumps .
I was wrong about the ease of bringing democracy to the Middle East .
I was wrong about dissolving the Iraqi army .
I was wrong about the looting being unimportant .
I was wrong that Bush / Cheney were competent .
I was wrong that we would be greeted as liberators .
I was wrong to make fun of the anti-war protestors .
I was wrong not to trust the dirty smelly hippies .
I mean , I could go down the list and continue on , but you get the point .
I was wrong about EVERY .
GOD .
DAMNED .
THING .
It is amazing I could tie my shoes in 2001 - 2004 .
If you took all the wrongness I generated , put it together and compacted it and processed it , there would be enough concentrated stupid to fuel three hundred years of Weekly Standard journals .
I am not sure how I snapped out of it , but I think Abu Ghraib and the negative impact of the insurgency did sober me up a bit .
War should always be an absolute last resort , not just another option .
I will never make the same mistakes again .
*** Update ***
Here is someone who got it right .
A genetic test that identifies men most at risk of prostate cancer could be available within three years , scientists said yesterday .
British doctors will use the test in screening programmes to spot the disease in its earliest stages , before it has become dangerously advanced or has spread throughout the body .
Early detection could boost the survival rate of the tens of thousands of men diagnosed with the disease in Britain every year .
Scientists began work on the test following a landmark study of nearly 2,000 cancer patients , which found seven previously unknown genetic markers that are linked to the disease .
Each one raises the risk of prostate cancer by around 60 % .
The findings , reported in the journal Nature Genetics , pave the way for the first reliable screening test for men at high risk of the disease , but might also lead to new drug therapies for the condition .
" We are entering an era of very exciting medicine .
This kind of genetic medicine will definitely happen and I definitely think it will deliver , " said Dr Rosalind Eeles , lead author of the study at the Institute for Cancer Research in Sutton , Surrey .
Prostate cancer is the most common form of male cancer in developed countries and cases are rising among men under 50 .
Every year , more than 32,000 British men are diagnosed and 10,000 die from the disease .
Screening for the disease relies on the PSA ( prostate specific antigen ) blood test .
Men with a high reading are usually sent for further tests and may have to undergo a biopsy , a painful procedure to remove prostate tissue for testing .
But because the test is unreliable , Britain has held back from offering it to all men over the age of 50 , as is now routine in the US .
The latest work , funded by Cancer Research UK , identified genetic markers that may be carried by more than half of all men with prostate cancer .
The international team led by Dr Eeles discovered the markers by comparing DNA of men with prostate cancer with DNA from healthy patients .
They collected DNA samples from 1,854 men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer by the age of 60 or younger , or who had a family history of the disease .
They then gathered DNA from 1,894 men with similar lifestyles , who were known to have a low risk of prostate cancer from PSA tests .
By comparing the DNA from the two groups , the scientists identified seven " spelling mistakes " in the genetic code that were strongly linked to the cancer .
One gene called MSMB seems to play a role in prostate cancer returning after treatment , but could also be used to screen for the disease .
A second gene , called LMTK2 is a promising target for new drugs to treat the disease , the researchers said .
The team has now set up a new study to test whether screening men for the genetic markers helps predict who will develop the disease .
If it works , doctors will be able to single out men who are most at risk for closer monitoring .
Laurie Whelan , a 69 - year - old father of three from London , took part in the study after doctors discovered he had advanced prostate cancer .
He was persuaded to take the test by his younger brother , who already had prostate cancer .
Their older brother had previously died of the disease .
" It turned out that I had a locally advanced cancer which had reached the outside of the gland , " he said .
His cancer was too far developed for surgery to help , but instead he received hormone treatment and radiotherapy .
Another group of scientists based in Iceland said yesterday they will be offering a genetic test for prostate cancer after finding two new markers for the disease .
( CNN ) --
Berkeley , the famously liberal college town in California , has taken aim at Marine recruiters , saying they are " not welcome in our city . "
Berkeley passed a measure last week encouraging protesters to gather outside the Marine office .

Republican lawmakers in Washington fired back this week , threatening to take back more than $ 2 million of federal funding to the city as well as money designated for the University of California - Berkeley , the campus that became a haven of protests during the Vietnam War .
The battle erupted after the Berkeley City Council approved a measure last week urging the Marine recruiters to leave their downtown office .
" If recruiters choose to stay , they do so as uninvited and unwelcome intruders , " the item says .
It goes on to say the council applauds residents and organizations that " volunteer to impede , passively or actively , by nonviolent means , the work of any military recruiting office located in the City of Berkeley . "
See photos of protesters camped outside Marine office »
Outside the Shattuck Avenue recruiting station earlier this week , a handful of protesters with the anti-war group Code Pink camped out , strumming a guitar as they sang anti-war songs and held signs against the Iraq war .
" Time to end the war , time to end the war , time to end the war right now , " they sang to the beat of " I 've Been Working on the Railroad . "
Watch protesters sing " I Ain't Afraid " »
One giant sign said , " No Military Predators in Our Town . "
Another message on a pink placard read , " Join the Marines .
Travel to Exotic Lands .
Meet Exciting and Unusual People -- And Kill Them . "
Zanne Joi peered out from under her straw hat .
" This Marine recruiting station is trying to recruit our youth to go to Iraq to kill and be killed .
And we are against that , " said Joi , a member of Code Pink Women for Peace .
" This is part of a multi - pronged effort to end this war . "
Protester Sharon Adams added : " This recruiting station recruits people to go fight and then once they fight and they serve their country , our country does n't take care of them .
That 's a shame . "
But not everyone here supports the protesters .
Watch young men confront protesters »
Forrest Smith , who described himself as a veteran of U.S. Special Forces , said his son recently returned from a tour in Iraq and his daughter served in Afghanistan .
" My position on this is the Marines are the best thing we have , " said Smith , decked out in Army fatigues .
He blasted the City Council for its action .
" It 's clearly an abuse of power . "
A group of young students who strolled down the sidewalk shared that sentiment .
They derided one of the protesters who argued the United States was involved in an illegal war in Iraq .
" Where 's the logic in that whatsoever ? " one of the young men said .
" That 's our national security , and you 're here protesting the Marines . "
Another said , " It makes me sick .
It makes me sick . "
Gunnery Sgt. Pauline Franklin , a spokeswoman for the Marine Corps Recruiting Command , told CNN there is " no plan for that office to move . "
She said recruiters are there to " provide information to qualified men and women who are looking for opportunities that they may benefit from by serving in the military . "
" The Marine Corps is here to support and defend the Constitution of the United States , which does guarantee the freedom of speech , " Franklin said .
" In terms of the situation in Berkeley , the City Council and the protesters are exercising their right to do so . "
In Washington , a group of Republican lawmakers have introduced the Semper Fi Act of 2008 -- named after the Marine motto -- to rescind more than $ 2 million of funds for Berkeley and transfer it to the Marine Corps .
" Like most Americans , I really get disturbed when taxpayer money goes to institutions which proceed to take votes , make policy or make statements that really denigrate the military , " said Sen .
David Vitter , R- Louisiana , a co-sponsor of the bill .
He told CNN he believes the bill will pass .
" I think it 's going to have significant support . "
The bill 's co-sponsor , Sen. Jim DeMint , R - South Carolina , said in a written statement , " Berkeley needs to learn that their actions have consequences . "
Berkeley 's declaration , which was introduced by the city 's Peace and Justice Commission , accuses the United States of having a history of " launching illegal , immoral and unprovoked wars of aggression and the Bush administration launched the most recent of those wars in Iraq and is threatening the possibility of war in Iran . "
It adds , " Military recruiters are salespeople known to lie to and seduce minors and young adults into contracting themselves into military service with false promises regarding jobs , job training , education and other benefits . "
Out on Shattuck Avenue , it appears the protesters have no plans to leave anytime soon .
" We are the civilian population ; we control the military , " Adams said .
" We the people have to take back our control of the military . "

If you 're curious whether or not you should be indulging in the communal cheese dip at this year 's Super Bowl party , one scientist has some answers for you .
Whether or not the infamous George Costanza " double - dipping at a funeral scene " had an impact on your snacking habits , according to this terrific NY Times piece , the clip definitely affected Prof.
Paul L. Dawson .
A food microbiologist at Clemson University , Dawson commissioned a study on double - dipping largely because he was skeptical that redipping a chip could be bad for you .
The results surprised him .
According to the study , " three to six double dips transferred about 10,000 bacteria from the eater 's mouth to the remaining dip . "
Dawson 's conclusion : that while double dipping wo n't kill you , you should take a look around the room before bathing your tortilla in party sauce .
Said Dawson , " The way I would put it is , before you have some dip at a party , look around and ask yourself , would I be willing to kiss everyone here ?
Because you do n't know who might be double dipping , and those who do are sharing their saliva with you . " 
So , beware readers .

You probably know that the Acid 3 score for nightly builds of WebKit was 90/100 last week .
Today it ’s up to 91/100 because I fixed our handling of DOM ranges under document mutation .
In older versions of WebKit , if you removed the node at one end of a DOM range from the document , the range would end up with one endpoint in the document and another endpoint outside the document .
Ranges are n’t supposed to work that way .
Instead , when you modify the document the range is supposed to get “ fixed up ” so that both endpoints are still in the document .
That ’s fixed now and so Acid 3 test 13 now passes .
See bug 11997 if you want to know more of the details .
YahooNews :
One of seven Miami men accused of plotting to join forces with al - Qaida to blow up Chicago 's Sears Tower was acquitted Thursday , and a mistrial was declared for the six others after the federal jury deadlocked .
The Bush administration had seized on the case to illustrate the dangers of homegrown terrorism and trumpet the government 's post - Sept. 11 success in infiltrating and smashing terrorism plots in their earliest stages .
The group never actually made contact with al - Qaida and never acquired any weapons or explosives .
Prosecutors said no attack was imminent , acknowledging that the alleged terror cell was " more aspirational than operational . "

THE marvellous edifice of modern finance took years to build .
The world had a weekend to save it from collapsing .
On March 16th America 's Federal Reserve , by nature hardly impetuous , rewrote its rule - book by rescuing Bear Stearns , the country 's fifth - largest investment bank , and agreeing to lend directly to other brokers .
A couple of days later the Fed cut short - term interest rates — again — to 2.25 % , marking the fastest loosening of monetary policy in a generation .
It was a Herculean effort , and it staved off the outright catastrophe of a bank failure that had threatened to split Wall Street asunder .
Even so , this week 's brush with disaster contained two unsettling messages .
One is analytical : the world needs new ways of thinking about finance and the risks it entails .
The other is a warning : the crisis has opened a new , dangerous chapter .
For all its mistakes , modern finance is worth saving — and the job looks as if it is still only half done .
Rescuing Bear Stearns and its kind from their own folly may strike many people as overly charitable .
For years Wall Street minted billions without showing much compassion .
Yet the Fed put $ 30 billion of public money at risk for the best reason of all : the public interest .
Bear is a counterparty to some $ 10 trillion of over - the - counter swaps .
With the broker 's collapse , the fear that these and other contracts would no longer be honoured would have infected the world 's derivatives markets .
Imagine those doubts raging in all the securities Bear traded and from there spreading across the financial system ; then imagine what would happen to the economy in the financial nuclear winter that would follow .
Bear Stearns may not have been too big to fail , but it was too entangled .
Gordian conduits
As the first article in our special briefing on the crisis explains , entanglement is a new doctrine in finance ( see article ) .
It began in the 1980s with an historic bull market in shares and bonds , propelled by falling interest rates , new information technology and corporate restructuring .
When the boom ran out , shortly after the turn of the century , the finance houses that had grown rich on the back of it set about the search for new profits .
Thanks to cheap money , they could take on more debt — which makes investments more profitable and more risky .
Thanks to the information technology , they could design myriad complex derivatives , some of them linked to mortgages .
By combining debt and derivatives , the banks created a new machine that could originate and distribute prodigious quantities of risk to a baffling array of counterparties .
This system worked ; indeed , at its simplest , it still does , spreading risk , promoting economic efficiency and providing cheap capital .
( Just like junk bonds , another once - misused financial instrument , many of the new derivatives will be back , for no better reason than that they are useful . )
Yet over the past decade this entangled system also plainly fed on itself .
As balance sheets grew , you could borrow more against them , buy more assets and admire your good sense as their value rose .
By 2007 financial services were making 40 % of America 's corporate profits — while employing only 5 % of its private - sector workers .
Meanwhile , financial - sector debt , only a tenth of the size of non-financial - sector debt in 1980 , is now half as big .
The financial system , or a big part of it , began to lose touch with its purpose : to write , manage and trade claims on future cashflows for the rest of the economy .
It increasingly became a game for fees and speculation , and a favourite move was to beat the regulator .
Hence the billions of dollars sheltered off balance sheets in SIVs and conduits .
Thanks to what , in hindsight , has proven disastrously lax regulation , banks did not then have to lay aside capital in case something went wrong .
Hence , too , the trick of packaging securities as AAA — and finding a friendly rating agency to give you the nod .
That game is now up .
You can think of lots of ways to describe the pain — debt is unwinding , investors are writing down assets , liquidity is short .
But the simplest is that counterparties no longer trust each other .
Walter Bagehot , an authority on bank runs , once wrote : “ Every banker knows that if he has to prove that he is worthy of credit , however good may be his arguments , in fact his credit is gone . ”
In our own entangled era , his axiom stretches to the whole market .
A question of priorities
This mistrust is enormously corrosive .
The huge damage it could do to the world economy dictates what must now be done first .
No doubt , there are many ways in which financial regulation needs to be fixed ; but that is for later .
The priority for policymakers is to shore up the financial system .
That should certainly be done as cheaply as possible ( after all , the cash comes from the public purse ) ; and it should avoid as far as possible creating moral hazard — owners and employees should bear the costs of their mistakes .
But these caveats , however galling , should not get in the way of that priority .
To its credit , the Fed has accepted that the new finance calls for new types of intervention .
That is the importance of its decision on March 16th to lend money directly to cash - strapped investment banks and brokers and to accept a broader array of collateral , including mortgage - backed and other investment - grade securities .
If investment banks can overcome the stigma of petitioning the central bank , this will guard them against the sort of run that saw Bear rejected by lenders in the short - term markets .
Henceforth , the brokers will be able to raise cash from the Fed .
The Fed is now lender - of - last - resort not just to commercial banks but to big investment banks as well ( a concession that will surely in time demand tighter regulation ) .
Even if that solves Wall Street 's immediate worries over liquidity , it still leaves the danger that recession will lead to such big losses that banks are forced into insolvency .
This depends on everything from mortgages to credit - card debt .
These , in turn , depend on the American economy 's likely path , the depth to which house prices decline and the scale of mortgage foreclosures — and none of these things is looking good .
Goldman Sachs 's latest calculations , which suppose that American house prices will eventually fall by 25 % from their peak , suggest that total losses will reach just over $ 1.1 trillion .
At around 8 % of GDP that is not to be sniffed at .
But it includes losses held by foreigners , and “ non-leveraged institutions ” such as insurers .
Goldman expects eventual post - tax losses for American financial firms to be around $ 300 billion , just over 2 % of GDP , or about 20 % of their equity capital .
The rebuilders ' dilemma
That suggests a serious problem , but not a catastrophic banking crisis .
And with the world awash with savings , banks ought to be able to raise new capital privately and continue lending .
Unfortunately , things are not quite so simple .
It would not take many homeowners to walk away from their debts for the losses to grow rapidly .
Also , bank shareholders may prefer to cut back on lending rather than raise new equity .
That would suit them , as equity is expensive and dilutes their stake .
But it would not suit the economy , which would be pushed further into recession by sudden cuts in leverage .
By lending money to more banks for longer against worse collateral , the Fed hopes to stem panic and buy time .
It wants Wall Street 's banks to assess their losses and strengthen their balance sheets without the crippling burden of dysfunctional markets .
And it hopes that cheaper money will ease that recapitalisation , inject confidence and cushion the broader economy .
But that lingering risk of insolvency means that the state needs to be ready to take yet more action .
One option is to keep on intervening as events unfold .
The other is to shock the markets out of their mistrust by using public money to create a floor to the market , either in housing or in asset - backed securities .
For the moment , gradualism is the right path : it is cheaper and less prone to moral hazard ( ask investors in Bear Stearns ) .
Yet it is not easy to pull off — again , ask Bear Stearns 's backers , who could possibly have been saved had the Fed begun lending to brokers sooner .
If the crisis drags on and claims more victims , gradualism could yet become more expensive than a more ambitious approach .
Something important happened on Wall Street this week .
It was not just the demise of a firm that traded through the Depression .
Financiers discovered that they had created a series of risks that the market could not cope with .
That is not a reason to condemn the whole system : it is far too useful .
It is a sign that the rules need changing .
But , first , stop the rot .
The Iraq war is now going better than expected , for a change .
Most critics of the war , myself included , blew it : we did n’t anticipate the improvements in security that are partly the result of last year ’s “ surge . ”
The improvement is real but fragile and limited .
Here ’s what it amounts to :
We ’ve cut our casualty rates to the unacceptable levels that plagued us back in 2005 , and we still do n’t have any exit plan for years to come  all for a bill that is accumulating at the rate of almost $ 5,000 every second !
More important , while casualties in Baghdad are down , we ’re beginning to take losses in Florida and California .
The United States seems to have slipped into recession ; Americans are losing their homes , jobs and health insurance ; banks are struggling  and the Iraq war appears to have aggravated all these domestic woes .
“ The present economic mess is very much related to the Iraq war , ” says Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel Prize - winning economist .
“ It was at least partially responsible for soaring oil prices .
... Moreover , money spent on Iraq did not stimulate the economy as much as the same dollars spent at home would have done .
To cover up these weaknesses in the American economy , the Fed let forth a flood of liquidity ; that , together with lax regulations , led to a housing bubble and a consumption boom . ”
A mother killed her two children and later went to the nearby college she attended and brandished a gun Thursday before handing the weapon to a health counselor , police said .
The threat at the University of Louisville ended with no injuries about half an hour after it began , but police who were then asked by school officials to check on the children found them dead with gunshot wounds .
Gail Lynn Coontz , 37 , is charged with murder in the deaths of 14 - year - old Greg Coontz and 10 - year - old Nikki Coontz , said Louisville police Officer Phil Russell .
Gail Coontz was taken to a hospital psychiatric ward , said university President James Ramsey , and was later transferred to the Louisville jail .
Officials there did not know whether she had a lawyer .
The woman was also charged with one count of terroristic threatening for pointing a handgun at an officer , university police Maj .
Kenny Brown said .
The woman gave her handgun to a counselor at the health services building , he said .
" When we were able to open the door and go in , the student and the counselor were both sitting on the couch , " Brown said .
The children were shot sometime in the past day , Russell said , not citing a motive .
They were probably shot in their sleep , having been found " in the sleeping position " said Jo - Ann Farmer , chief deputy coroner for Jefferson County .
Coontz has been a student in the college of arts and sciences since fall 2006 and had not declared a major , university spokesman John Drees said .
The school sent safety alerts to student phones , cellphones and posted one on its website .
The campus was not locked down , university spokeswoman Cindy Hess said .
The two - story red brick home where the children were found is in a tidy middle - class neighborhood about 10 miles south of the university .
A garden at the home has a statue of two children playing with a bicycle .
Russell and neighbors said Coontz was a widow .
" She was a good mom , " said next - door neighbor Sheryl Hayven .
" I would have never thought anything , nothing like this would have indicated this to me . "
The neighborhood is normally quiet and the neighbors generally know one another , said neighbor Patty Schneider .
Greg would run from the school bus to the house every day , while Nikki would arrive home later , get the mail and stroll inside , Schneider said .
" It just all seems like it 's going to be a bad dream and I 'm going to wake up from it , " said Schneider , who lives directly across the street .

US - Iranian tensions have mounted significantly in the past few days , with heightened rhetoric on both sides and the US decision to establish a military base in Iraq less than five miles from the Iranian border to block the smuggling of Iranian arms to Shia militias .
The involvement of a few hundred British troops in the anti-smuggling operation also raises the risk of their involvement in a cross - border clash .
US officers have alleged that an advanced Iranian - made missile had been fired at an American base from a Shia area , which if confirmed would be a significant escalation in the " proxy war " referred to this week by General David Petraeus , the US commander in Iraq .
" The proxy war that has been going on in Iraq may now cross the border .
This is a very dangerous period , " Patrick Cronin , the director of studies at the International Institute for Strategic Studies , said .
Iran 's leaders have so far shown every sign of relishing the confrontation .
The supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , declared yesterday that American policies had failed in the Middle East and warned : " I am certain that one day Bush and senior American officials will be tried in an international court for the tragedies they have created in Iraq . "
In such circumstances , last week 's Israeli air strike against a mystery site in northern Syria has triggered speculation over its motives .
Israel has been silent about the attack .
Syria complained to the UN security council but gave few details .
Some say the target was Iranian weapons on their way to Hizbullah in Lebanon , or that the sortie was a dry run for a US - Israeli attack on Syria and Iran .
There is even speculation that the Israelis took out a nuclear facility funded by Iran and supplied by North Korea
The situation is particularly volatile because the struggle for influence threatens to exacerbate a confrontation over Tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
The US has called a meeting of major powers in Washington next Friday to discuss Iran 's defiance of UN resolutions calling for its suspension of uranium enrichment .
It comes amid signs that the Bush administration is running out of patience with diplomatic efforts to curb the nuclear programme .
Hawks led by the vice - president , Dick Cheney , are intensifying their push for military action , with support from Israel and privately from some Sunni Gulf states .
" Washington is seriously reviewing plans to bomb not just nuclear sites , but oil sites , military sites and even leadership targets .
The talk is of multiple targets , " said Mr Cronin .
" In Washington there is very serious discussion that this is a window that has to be looked at seriously because there is only six months to ' do something about Iran ' before it will be looked at as a purely political issue . "
US presidential elections are due in November 2008 , and military action at the height of the campaign is usually seen by voters as politically motivated .
Vincent Cannistraro , a former CIA counter - terrorism chief who is now a security analyst , said : " The decision to attack was made some time ago .
It will be in two stages .
If a smoking gun is found in terms of Iranian interference in Iraq , the US will retaliate on a tactical level , and they will strike against military targets .
The second part of this is : Bush has made the decision to launch a strategic attack against Iranian nuclear facilities , although not before next year .
He has been lining up some Sunni countries for tacit support for his actions . "
US and British officials have complained to Iran about the use by Shia militias in Iraq of what they say are Iranian - made weapons .
The main concern is the proliferation of roadside bombs that fire a bolt of molten metal through any thickness of armour , which the officials say must have been made in Iran .
A US military spokesman in Baghdad , Major General Kevin Bergner , raised the stakes when he said the 240 mm rocket that hit the US military headquarters outside Baghdad this week , killing an American soldier and wounding 11 , had been supplied to Shia militants by Iran .
Gen Bergner used to work in the White House , where he was aligned with administration hawks , and his dispatch to Baghdad was seen by some as a move to increase pressure on Iran .
" There are an awful lot of lower level officers who are very angry about the deaths from explosively formed projectiles said to come from Iran .
There is a certain amount of military pressure to do something about this , " said Patrick Clawson , the deputy director for research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
" That said , it is very difficult for us to do anything without much better evidence .
In that respect , border control is a sensible solution . "
Any US decision to attack Iran would force Gordon Brown to choose between creating a serious rift in the transatlantic alliance and participating in or endorsing American actions .
British officials insist that Washington has given no sign it is ready to abandon diplomacy and argue that UN sanctions are showing signs of working .
They point to the resurgence in Iran of Hashemi Rafsanjani , seen as a pragmatic counterweight to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Hopes that a new war could still be avoided have also been boosted by Gen Petraeus 's claim that Iran 's covert Quds force alleged to be supporting Shia attacks on coalition forces had been pulled out of Iraq .
If true , it could be that in the stand - off between the US and Iran , Iran has blinked first .
I am away this week filming the pilot for The Skeptologists .
For NeuroLogica this week I am updating and editing some previous essays that I have written .
This one was originally published in my Weird Science column in November 2004 .
________________________________________________________
I listened patiently as the UFO enthusiast explained how humans were transplanted to the earth from another world by our alien forebears .
“ Then how do you explain the fact that humans share 98 % of our DNA with chimpanzees , and a genetic code will all life on earth ? ” I asked .
“ Well , I think you have to keep an open mind , ” was her starry - eyed response .
People who believe odd things - that coffee enemas can cure cancer , that the Loch Ness Monster exists , that art on the dollar bill can explain secret conspiracies - are always telling us to “ keep an open mind . ”
The now standard skeptical response is to quip : “ Keep an open mind , sure–but not so open that your brains fall out . ”
In the endless sparring between skeptics and believers , the “ keep an open mind ” rejoinder is the favorite weapon in the believers ’ arsenal .
It is their all - purpose tool .
But what does it really mean to be open - minded , and is it the skeptics or the believers who are truly closed - minded ?
Having an open mind is a curious virtue : Everyone agrees that open - mindedness is indeed a virtuous state , but it ’s most often praised by those being decidedly closed - minded .
Also , the most open - minded people are those whom you would least suspect as paragons of this particular virtue – skeptics .
And those most lacking open - mindedness are those most likely to admonish others for not being so – true believers .
Let me explain .
Having an open mind means you do n’t dismiss claims to truth out of hand .
You analyze first .
When you analyze a claim , you consider all the relevant evidence and examine all the logic involved , in a fair and unbiased manner , then grant tentative acceptance or rejection .
If new arguments or new evidence come up , then you revise your opinion .
Being open means that you apply this standard fairly to all claims .
Being open - minded does not mean believing every claim , no matter how improbable - that ’s being gullible , not open .
This process of fair analysis , based upon logic and evidence , leading to tentative conclusions , which are open to revision , is part of science .
It is also the very soul of true open - mindedness .
By contrast , true believers adhere to a desired claim regardless of evidence or logic .
No argument is persuasive enough , and no evidence ( or lack thereof ) is compelling enough to nudge them from the perch of their belief .
They are closed to the possibility that Bigfoot might be a delusion , that crop -circles are pranks , that coffee enemas do n’t cure cancer - that their cherished belief might be wrong .
Yet it is such believers who most frequently claim the moral high ground of open - mindedness , then condemn unbelievers for being closed - minded .
They wish others to accept their claims either without examining the logic and evidence , or despite refutation from such examination .
The “ open - minded ” police often use the label of “ closed - minded ” as a personal attack to dismiss the arguments of those who dare to examine their claims ( and are therefore committing an ad hominem logical fallacy ) .
You do not believe I was abducted by aliens , they argue , because you are closed - minded .
( Could it be because they lack credibility or any evidence to back up the claim ?
Or because the claim is inherently improbable ? )
To them , being abducted by aliens is an article of faith , much as religious believers take certain beliefs on faith .
That ’s fine .
People are entitled to their faith .
It ’s an important freedom , guaranteed in the Constitution .
But personal faith cannot be used to justify a scientific claim about the factual state of nature .
Scientific claims must be public , open , and transparent - they cannot be based upon secret knowledge , special talents , or unquestioned virtues .
If you think aliens have visited the planet , you must be prepared to offer evidence , not just accuse other people of being closed - minded for not believing you .
Science is also a cumulative process .
At this point in history we happen to be sitting on centuries of painstakingly accumulated scientific knowledge .
It would be both hubris and folly to ignore all that has gone before .
So while keeping an open mind to new ideas and claims , it is to our advantage to view such claims through the filter of established knowledge .
Believers would have us view new claims in an intellectual vacuum , as if all claims were inherently equal .
So let me turn the tables and humbly ask you , dear reader , to be truly open - minded .
Adhere to the advice of David Hume , who wrote , “ A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence . ”
Keep your brains tucked safely inside your skulls .
Be open but not gullible .
And remember , it is better to think than to believe .
Nokia 's new Morph concept phone would use nanotechnology to give it a flexible body with a transparent display that could be re-shaped depending on the user 's needs , a far cry from today 's solid and chunky devices .
Even the electronics inside it would be transparent and flexible , so the whole phone may be twisted and stretched into bracelet shapes or tablet form , and nanotech cleverness means it would even clean itself .
Developed in cooperation with Cambridge University , this glimpse of a distant future is now on display at the MoMA in New York .
Jump for video and yadda - yadda press release .
Nokia and University of Cambridge launch the Morph - a nanotechnology concept device
New York , US and Espoo , Finland — Morph , a joint nanotechnology concept , developed by Nokia Research Center ( NRC ) and the University of Cambridge ( UK ) - was launched today alongside the " Design and the Elastic Mind " exhibition , on view from February 24 to May 12 , 2008 , at The Museum of Modern Art ( MoMA ) in New York .
Morph features in both the exhibition catalog and on MoMA 's official website .
Morph is a concept that demonstrates how future mobile devices might be stretchable and flexible , allowing the user to transform their mobile device into radically different shapes .
It demonstrates the ultimate functionality that nanotechnology might be capable of delivering : flexible materials , transparent electronics and self - cleaning surfaces .
Dr. Tapani Ryhanen , Head of the NRC Cambridge UK laboratory , Nokia , commented : " We hope that this combination of art and science will showcase the potential of nanoscience to a wider audience .
The techniques we are developing might one day mean new possibilities in terms of the design and function of mobile devices .
The research we are carrying out is fundamental to this as we seek a safe and controlled way to develop and use new materials . "
Professor Mark Welland , Head of the Department of Engineering 's Nanoscience Group at the University of Cambridge and University Director of Nokia - Cambridge collaboration added " Developing the Morph concept with Nokia has provided us with a focus that is both artistically inspirational but , more importantly , sets the technology agenda for our joint nanoscience research that will stimulate our future work together . "
The partnership between Nokia and the University of Cambridge was announced in March , 2007 - an agreement to work together on an extensive and long term programme of joint research projects .
NRC has established a research facility at the University 's West Cambridge site and collaborates with several departments - initially the Nanoscience Center and Electrical Division of the Engineering Department - on projects that , to begin with , are centered on nanotechnology .
Elements of Morph might be available to integrate into handheld devices within 7 years , though initially only at the high - end .
However , nanotechnology may one day lead to low cost manufacturing solutions , and offers the possibility of integrating complex functionality at a low price .

That sickening - not to mention painful - feeling as your car crunches into a vehicle in front looks like becoming just an expensive memory for drivers .
Volvo has come up with a crash - proof family car which will go on sale in the autumn .
Its secret is a laser - guidance system to spot vehicles in front that are too close or stopping suddenly .
When it does , the Volvo will stop of its own accord to avoid a smash .
Scroll down for more ...
The CitySafety system , which kicks in at speeds of up to 20 mph and is designed for urban driving , has the potential to prevent half of all rear - end collisions , said Volvo .
A laser sensor built into the windscreen reacts to traffic in front that is either stationary or moving in the same direction .
It scans up to six yards ahead and , sensing the difference in speed between it and a vehicle in front , it makes 50 calculations a second to determine the braking force needed to avoid crashing .
If the driver fails to slow , the system brakes automatically and disables the accelerator .
The system will be standard in the XC60 car , priced from £ 25,000 .
But Jonas Ekmark , of Volvo , said : " It is important to stress that CitySafety does not relieve the driver of the responsibility from maintaining a safe distance . "
Safety experts say this and similar technology being developed by other makers will help save more than 125,000 painful and costly whiplash injuries alone each year .
Rear - end collisions make up 29 per cent of all reported car accidents .
In more than half , the driver does not brake at all .
And 90 per cent of all such collisions are partly due to distracted drivers .
Three - quarters of all collisions happen at speeds up to 19mph .
Volvo said that if the relative speed difference between two vehicles was below 10 mph the system can help avoid a collision entirely .
" Between 10 mph and 20 mph , the focus is on reducing speed as much as possible before impact , " said Volvo .
At higher speeds , including on motorways , a separate " adaptive cruise control " system keeps the car safe from traffic in front by braking and accelerating as necessary .
Volvo , Mercedes and Honda will be demonstrating their anti-collision technology at Thatcham , the motor insurance repair research centre , in Berkshire on Tuesday .
A spokesman for the centre said : " It sounds like sci - fi fantasy - cars that can't crash .
But the fictional notion is about to become reality . "
VoteVets.org has a new ad out to confront John McCain 's warmonger stance and question -- in flesh and blood terms -- exactly where his priorities lie .
From their email :
The ad features , for the first time , a female Iraq veteran and her small child .
Rose Forrest served 12 months in Iraq , and gave birth to her little son , when she came home .
In the ad , Rose challenges John McCain to tell the truth about what endless war means for her child , and all of our children .
Senator McCain needs to give us some straight talk about how much endless war in Iraq is going to cost .
We do n't have an endless pot of money , or an endless supply of troops and equipment .
So what are Americans going to have to sacrifice if he has his way on Iraq ?
Health care ?
Decent jobs ?
Border security that all those National Guardsmen in Iraq could be performing ?
Rescue and cleanup after disasters like Katrina and tornados in Kansas and Tennessee ?
Are we going to have to sacrifice our chance to cripple Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda in Afghanistan ?
We can't do it all , but John McCain seems to pretend that we can .
We 're airing this ad in the hopes that Senator McCain finally gets honest with the American people .
We 're putting it out there so that the media and power - brokers start to ask the same questions .
Endless war in Iraq means drastic sacrifices for Americans in their everyday lives , and in terms of our own security .
NEW YORK –
It 's been a long , hard year for Battlestar Galactica fans .
The wait for season four is almost over , though , and BSG junkies can get their fix online 10 hours before the show airs on TV .
The final season premiere will stream live on SciFi.com from noon to 1 p.m. ( EST ) April 4 – get your lunch orders in now .
The streaming revelation along with other show secrets and anecdotes , was revealed last night at the Morgan Library during a panel discussion with series executive producers David Eick and Ron Moore and nine of the show 's stars .
More news on a confirmed BSG prequel , identifying the final cylon and what it 's like to find out you 're a toaster , all after the jump .
Caprica , a two - hour pilot that takes place 50 years before BSG , has been given the green light .
As the Galactica stars were gearing up to come on stage , Eick was setting up meetings to start casting and continue planning .
The show will begin production this spring and will air in the fall .
Producer Moore is directing his first episode ( episode 12 to be exact ) , and Edward James Olmos , who directed two episodes in the past * * , will direct this season as well .
A new series of webisodes has been ordered for season four .
There are no plans to turn BSG into a movie franchise .
" I get this question a lot from the people on this stage , " joked Moore .
" I think the series works best as an ensemble television base .
Part of the special quality of this show is that you use this entire cast and you have all these complicated story lines that you embroider on these characters to get into the richness of the plot . "
Moore said to make the show into a movie he would have to concentrate on just two characters and make everyone else supporting characters , as he did in the Next Generation films with Jean - Luc Picard and Commander Riker .
Michael Hogan , who plays Colonel Tigh , said he was stunned when he found out his character was a cylon .
He joked that he had said , since the series ' beginning , " Boy am I glad I 'm not a cylon . "
Oops !
Aaron Douglas ( the Chief ) said he made a conscious decision this season to play his character differently when he 's in cylon mode .
He 's curious to see if it works on screen .
Douglas said he hated discovering he was a cylon , especially since he found out by accident three months before he was supposed to .
" I was over at ' someone 's ' house and saw some papers lying around : ' Oooh outlines for – I gotta go to the bathroom ! '
I locked myself in the bathroom and was looking for my material and suddenly , ' WHAT !?!'"
He had to keep the revelation a secret for three months , but he would occasionally go up to Moore and Eick and ask , " So , anything going on with the Chief ? "
Olmos joked that it was in his contract that he would n't be a cylon .
James Callis , who plays Gaius Baltar , was n't allowed to say anything about his character , other than the fact that he 's involved with a cult this season .
Ummm , duh .
Season four will have the majority of the ship assuming Starbuck is a cylon ( who would n't ? ) , but she may not be .
In response to a question to the actors on whether or not they found themselves lobbying to be the last cylon , Moore joked , " There 's really no one left .
Who 's left ? "
To which Katee Sackhoff , who plays Starbuck , sheepishly raised her hand .
Hint or trick ?
Playing a cylon is actually harder than playing a human , according to Sackhoff .
She revealed that the filming process for the cylons is much , much more intensive – it takes longer to film a scene because the actors who play skin jobs have to do multiple takes as their different models ( changing wardrobe , angles , etc . )
" Every time I have a scene with a cylon I 'm like , ' Ooooh God !
Why am I in this scene today !?
So I have no desire to be a cylon , ' " Sackhoff explained .
When someone from the audience asked Mary McDonnell , who plays President Roslin , if Barack Obama had approached her to be his running mate , she replied that Hillary had .
At which point Douglas quipped : " Hillary 's the final cylon . " Badabum !
Photos , more anecdotes from the cast , and a look inside the swag bag coming later today .

Astronomers have noticed a change on Saturn .
The planet ’s rings are getting thinner and thinner and the detailsÂ in the dark bandsÂ are getting harder to observe .
What ’s more , at this rate , Saturn ’s rings will have completely vanished by Sept. 4 , 2009 !
But do n’t pack up your telescopes quite yet , there ’s no reason to be alarmed .
This phenomenon occurs every 14 to 15 years and the explanation is down to an astronomical optical illusion called “ ring plane crossing ” …
In 1612 , Galileo noticed something was awry with the beautiful gas giant .
The distinctive rings of Saturn were shrinking until he was unable to see them any more .
The situation was so strange that Galileo even stopped observing the planet ( most likely through frustration ! ) .
He had discovered the rings two years earlier and was instantly entranced by them .
He once wrote to his Medici patrons on the discovery in 1610 : “ I found another very strange wonder , which I should like to make known to their Highnessesâ€ ¦ ” so you can imagine his confusion when the rings slipped out of view .
Ring plane crossings occur periodically when the tilt and position in Saturn ’s orbit combine to allow astronomers a unique side - onÂ view of the rings .
Far from being a loss , looking at the paper - thin rings side - on will remove the glare from the bright rings giving astronomers a superb opportunity to see the icy moons orbiting close to Saturn .
Also , Saturn ’s strangely blue north pole should be observable .
Saturn is better known for its brown - golden clouds of gas , but in high latitudes , these clouds thin out to reveal a blue dome .
Cancelling the light from Saturn ’s rings may provide a perfect environment to see the blue from Earth and to view the points of bright light shining off the small moons .
So dust off those telescopes , a once - in - 14 - year astronomical opportunity is approaching …

Socialist - style Fed or financial saviour ?
The cover of the latest issue of BusinessWeek shows Ben Bernanke in profile against a bright red and orange backdrop , pensively stroking his grey beard and looking remarkably like Vladimir Ilyich Lenin .
The imagery is intentional and pointed .
" Comrade Ben is determined that there will be no financial meltdown and no depression while he is in command , " economist Ed Yardeni wrote to clients .
" Given the initial reaction [ on Wall Street ] , I suppose this means we are all financial socialists now . "
Guaranteeing Bear Stearns ' portfolio of troubled investments sets a bad precedent by transferring potential losses from the market to taxpayers , complained Allan Meltzer , a professor of political economy at Pittsburgh 's Carnegie Mellon University .
" I do not believe the current system can remain if the bankers make the profits and the taxpayers share the losses . "

Fed Calls Regulatory Overhaul " Timely "
Upcoming Treasury Department proposals to make the Federal Reserve the chief regulator of U.S. financial markets and give it sweeping new powers won praise on Saturday from the central bank and the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
" The Treasury 's report presents a timely and thoughtful analysis and is an important first step in the complex task of modernizing our financial and regulatory architecture .
We look forward to working with the Congress and others to help develop a policy framework that will enhance financial and economic stability , " a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said .
Let 's Take a Look at " Timely "
Who is to blame for the mess we are in ?
Perhaps the clearest evidence of the perceived benefits that derivatives have provided is their continued spectacular growth .
The Fed And The Henhouse
The Bush administration is proposing the broadest overhaul of Wall Street regulation since the Great Depression .
But the plan , to be unveiled on Monday , has its genesis in a yearlong effort to limit Washington ’s role in the market .
The regulatory umbrella created in the 1930s would grow wider , with power concentrated in fewer agencies .
But that authority would be limited , doing virtually nothing to regulate the many new financial products whose unwise use has been a culprit in the current financial crisis .
The plan hands vast new authority to the Federal Reserve , essentially formalizing what has been an improvised process over the last three weeks .
But some fear that the central bank ’s role in creating the current mess will undercut its ability to clean it up .
“ The Fed oversaw this meltdown , ” said Michael Greenberger , a law professor at the University of Maryland who was a senior official of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Clinton administration .
“ This is the equivalent of the builders of the Maginot line giving lessons on defense . ”
The Fed ’s former chairman , Alan Greenspan , for years praised the growth in the derivatives market as a boon for market stability , and resisted calls to use the Fed ’s power to increase regulation of the mortgage market .

Bay Area Real Estate : Wait 2 Months ; Save $ 50,000
It ’s been two months since I ’ve done an update on local real estate in the Bay Area .
One of the reasons I track the real estate market so closely is that most people simply are n’t aware of the magnitude of the price drops that are occurring right now .
I ’m still hearing quotes like “ It ’s a good time to buy ” .
I write these posts to create a larger awareness of the real state of the real estate market here in the Bay Area .
The main thing I want to point out is that the magnitude of the price drops is increasing , not decreasing .
Prices are dropping faster than they were 6 months ago .
While this means you ’re likely to get a better “ deal ” if you shop for real estate now , it ’s also likely that you ’ll save a lot more money by waiting …even if you choose to only wait 6 months .

It ’s an outlying part of San Jose that has a lot of “ starter homes . ” 95127 has more foreclosures and the prices are progressing downward faster than most other zip codes I track here in San Jose — hence the “ leading indicator ” moniker .
What is happening in 95127 is a microcosm of the distress that is hitting most suburban , “ middle - class ” ( if you can call zip codes where the average house is over $ 600,000 “ middle - class ” ) areas of San Jose .
To illustrate this point , let ’s refer back to the two properties I highlighted in my January real estate post .
First of all , it ’s worth noting that both houses I highlighted in January have sold — no doubt to people who thought they were picking up a pretty good deal .
If they intend to live in the house for at least 10 years , they did n’t do too badly — that ’s what they are probably thinking .
However , I ’m going to show you how by waiting just 2 months , they could have saved $ 50,000 on the price of their homes .
That ’s 12.5 % of the value of these homes !
From my January post :
Property # 1 is 124 Birch Ln , San Jose , CA 95127 .
3BR , 1 bath , 1564 sq.ft . on a nice - sized lot of 7840 sq.ft .
Last sale 7/1/2005 for $ 601,000 .
Now asking $ 399,000 .
Doing the math , we find that is a 34 % discount off peak .
The MLS lists 3 pictures of the inside and it seems to be in fairly good condition .
Now , just two months later :
Take a look at MLS # 733671 — 10309 Murtha Dr. Five bedrooms , 2 baths , 1965 square feet .
A couple warning factors :
The property is sold “ as - is ” , and states “ Remodeled kitchen , granite counters , hardwood floors prior to foreclosure lot . ”
This could mean that some of the flooring and counters have been torn up .
This property is obviously a “ look before you leap ” situation .
It is currently listing for … $ 399,900 .
Even if it does need work , 400 more square feet and 2 extra bedrooms for just $ 900 more than the house in January mean waiting was the right decision .
This house last sold in February 2007 ( just over one year ago ?! ) for $ 689,713 .
That ’s a 42 % discount in 13 months .
I do n’t think there has ever been a stronger argument for waiting to buy .
Imagine what waiting another year will bring !
January House # 2
Back to January :
3356 Joanne Ave. , San Jose , CA 95127 .
3BR , 1 bath , 1075 square feet , on a 4,792 sq.ft .
lot .
A pretty fair specimen of a house for San Jose , though the MLS listing does n’t include inside pictures , so it probably needs work .
Now asking $ 400,000 .
This is n’t as good a deal as the first property …
This is where you start to see some huge advantages to waiting .
In January , I pored through over 200 properties in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties before finding these two to highlight .
Now there are twenty - two 3BR + , 1000sq.ft + properties in 95127 under $ 400,000 .
There were just a handful in January .
I figure we might as well compare our January property to a similar one .
Since there are so many to choose from , I picked the cheapest one : MLS # 783032 , 3420 Dominick Ct , 95127 .
Unlike the Joanne Ave. property I covered in January , this one has several pictures .
It is 1203 sq. ft. ( 128 sq.ft. bigger than the Joanne Ave. property ) , with 2 baths instead of one .
It ’s also on a larger lot : 5227 sq.ft .
The pictures show dated carpet , paint , and wallpaper that need to be updated , but the house is overall in good shape .
And are you ready for this …this larger house is listing for $ 350,000 .
So , by waiting 2 months , you can either get a much larger house for the same price , or save $ 50,000 ( and get the seller to front an additional $ 10,000 on paint and wallpaper to have a house that matches your needs . )
Also , though I still have n’t seen a house that is cheaper to buy than to rent when factoring in property taxes , maintenance , and insurance , at least the mortgage payments by themselves are similar to your rent payments .
A Quick Synopsis Of 95118
For the first time in several years , two 3BR + , 1000sq.ft .+ houses in my zip code , 95118 , dropped below $ 500,000 .
They sold quickly after dropping their prices below $ 500,000 .
However , since there is a lot of inventory in San Jose , I expect other sellers to do the same .
This is especially noteworthy since nothing similar in this neighborhood sold for less than $ 600,000 in the past few years .
Now it seems that < $ 500 K is the price point where houses sell .
There are also some short sale 2 BR condos for $ 250,000 in my neighborhood — again , a price that has n’t been seen in a few years .
Finally , there is a duplex almost identical to the one I live in on the market , in my zip code , for about the same price my landlord paid in 2004 .
I see no one is really rushing to buy it …and after watching my landlord put tons of money into this duplex over the past 4 years , I understand why !
Of course , I will keep you posted as things change — I ’ll likely post every month or two with updates .
I am also tracking Pacifica and Half Moon Bay ocean - view houses , since that ’s what I ’m most interested in buying .
Non-ocean - view houses have been tanking almost as hard as San Jose , but ocean view properties are n’t falling as quickly .
Ocean view houses only seem to be down about 10 % from the peak .
I think it will take another 6 - 12 months before there is significant price movement there .
Should You Buy Now ?
So now should you buy ?
No way !
If houses dropped this much in the past 2 months , they will continue to drop more .
Besides , even with these price drops , you ’re still better off renting .
The conforming loan limit change wo n’t make any difference — these houses are under the old $ 417,000 limit anyway .
There are now more houses for a better price than there were two months ago .
What will the next year or two bring ?
It will certainly be interesting … and I will keep posting about it .
To be sure , the real outrage in the scandal surrounding trumped up charges against former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman ( D ) are the charges themselves .
Local Republican officials , in apparent conjunction with Karl Rove , railroaded a sitting governor because he was a Democrat .
It was political corruption at its most pernicious .
But if we also take a moment to consider the Alabama media , the decisions of WHNT , the CBS affiliate in northern Alabama , are almost comical in their ineptitude .
In 1955 , when WLBT - TV , the NBC affiliate in Jackson , Miss. , did not want to run a network report about racial desegregation , it famously hung up the sign : “ Sorry , Cable Trouble . ”
Audiences in northern Alabama might have suspected the same tactics when WHNT - TV , the CBS affiliate , went dark Sunday evening during a “ 60 minutes ” segment that strongly suggested that Don Siegelman , Alabama ’s former Democratic governor , was wrongly convicted of corruption last year .
The report presented new evidence that the charges against Mr. Siegelman may have been concocted by politically motivated Republican prosecutors — and orchestrated by Karl Rove .
Unfortunately , WHNT had “ technical problems ” that prevented it from broadcasting a segment ( the problems were resolved in time for the next part of the show ) that many residents of Alabama would no doubt have found quite interesting .
After initially blaming the glitch on CBS in New York , the affiliate said it learned “ upon investigation , ” and following a rebuke from the network , that “ the problem was on our end . ”
It re-broadcast the segment at 10 p.m. , pitting it against the Academy Awards on rival ABC , before Daniel Day - Lewis won the best actor Oscar .
As public criticism grew , it ran it again at 6 p.m. on Monday .
WHNT ’s president and general manager assured viewers that “ there was no intent whatsoever to keep anyone from seeing the broadcast . ”
No , of course not , it was only the most remarkable set of coincidences in modern broadcast history .
Consider the tale of the tape :
* WHNT is owned by one of the Bass brothers of Texas , former business partners of George W. Bush and generous contributors to Republican causes .
* WHNT ’s broadcast signal was just fine before the Siegelman story on “ 60 Minutes , ” and was just fine after the story ended .
* The Siegelman story was bound to make the state Republican machine and Rove ’s office look pretty awful , which was apparent from pre-broadcast commercials .
* WHNT was harsh in covering Siegelman when he was governor .
* WHNT could n’t keep its story straight about who was responsible for the “ technical glitches . ”
But no , there certainly could n’t have been any “ intent ” to “ keep anyone from seeing the broadcast . ”
Who could ever have thought such a thing ?
The irony is , if WHNT was trying to suppress a report that made Republicans look bad , the station ended up creating a backlash — interest in the “ 60 Minutes ” report soared once locals were led to believe they were n’t supposed to see it .
Suppressing the forbidden fruit sometimes only serves to make it more enticing , oddly enough .
Corn is a key element of the U.S. food supply .
It is what dairy cows eat to make milk and hens consume to lay eggs .
It fattens cattle , hogs and chickens before slaughter .
It makes soda sweet .
As the building block of ethanol , it is now also a major component of auto fuel .
And that may signal trouble ahead .
Economists are cautioning that the nation ’s growing dependence on corn would make for a double jolt in the event of a drought across the Midwest : soaring prices not just for food but also for gasoline .
Analysts now warn that a “ corn shock ” might not be far off -- and it could lead to $ 5 gas and $ 3.50 eggs as the effects reverberate across the economy .

“ We are replacing price volatility from the Middle East with Midwestern weather price volatility , ” said Michael Swanson , a Wells Fargo & Co. vice president and agricultural economist .
Such a disaster would occur against a backdrop of soaring prices for basic food items and other commodities that are already stressing the economy .
Coffee is up 21 % to date , platinum 42 % and already high oil an additional 6 % .
After a torrid 2007 , corn prices have risen an additional 20 % this year because of global demand for livestock feed , sweeteners and ethanol .
The rush by American farmers to forgo other grains to plant cash - producing corn , along with weather problems , has squeezed wheat supplies , pushing the price of that grain up 21 % .
Soy has risen 25 % this year .
Analysts are already simulating what would happen if a drought hit the corn belt .
Bruce Babcock , an agricultural economist at Iowa State University , estimates that corn could reach $ 8 a bushel from $ 5.46 now .
Advertisement
It could happen as soon as this summer .
“ The risk of a drought right now is higher than normal because of the La Nina we are seeing , ” Babcock said , referring to the cooling of ocean temperatures that often has a drying effect .
As any farmer can tell you , Mother Nature is fickle .
The U.S. has suffered four major weather disasters since 1971 that wiped out 21 % to 29 % of the corn crop at a time .
Periodic bad weather , including droughts , scorching heat waves and cold , cloudy spells at just the wrong time , has reduced harvests by billions of bushels .
Previously , these disasters have raised food prices .
The next drought will be the first to affect gas prices .
Advertisement
That ’s because ethanol -- mostly refined from corn -- will make up about 6 % of the nation ’s gasoline supply this year , and that ’s expected to rise to 10 % over the next five years .
The amount of ethanol used in California gasoline is expected to grow at a faster rate , reaching 10 % by 2010 .
But if there were a crop shortfall , the rising price of corn would prevent ethanol distillers from earning a profit , prompting them to slash production , Babcock said .
Oil companies would have to scramble to fill that sudden gap with conventional gasoline .
Prices would soar for both fuels , said Philip K. Verleger Jr. , an energy economist in Aspen , Colo .
“ One way to see this is to look at what happened last year , ” Verleger said .
Industrial accidents and other refining disruptions -- all factors outside the corn belt -- cut U.S. gasoline production about 10 % in February 2007 , sending wholesale prices soaring , he said .
Advertisement
If there were a crop failure now , the U.S. would try to ease the crunch by sopping up any excess refining capacity overseas .
A slowing U.S. economy would also blunt demand .
But such safety valves wo n’t always exist .
“ Five years from now , this could be a big , big deal , ” Verleger said .
Farmers are also worried about what could happen in the short term .
“ A drought would be bad for everyone .
The high prices would hurt my customers , and I would have no crop to sell , ” said Ron Heck , a fourth - generation soy and corn farmer from Perry , Iowa .
Blame oil companies for part of the problem , said Matt Hartwig , spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Assn. in Washington .
Advertisement
“ The oil industry has just not made the investment in refineries to keep up with the demand for gasoline , ” Hartwig said .
As demand for gasoline outstrips refinery expansions , fuel prices will be linked more tightly with the size of the corn crop .
“ You might see a point where even the threat of a drought could cause gas prices to rise , ” Wells Fargo ’s Swanson said .
Lester R. Brown , an author and president of the Earth Policy Institute , sees a different scenario , one with global implications .
He estimates that as long as oil prices continue to hover around $ 100 a barrel , ethanol distillers could pay up to $ 7 a bushel for corn and still make money .
Advertisement
However , Brown said , “ if the ethanol producers stay in the market , that will disrupt the food supply . ”
Because of the interrelationships among crops , a major shortfall in the U.S. harvest could tip global grain and soy markets into chaos .
It would affect the prices of food made directly from these commodities , such as bread , pasta and tortillas , and food made indirectly , such as pork , poultry , beef , milk and eggs .
If it happened this summer , it would be especially bad because of the current pace of global food inflation .
“ The rest of the world is less able to pay high prices for food .
What ’s annoying for us is life - threatening elsewhere , ” Brown said .
Advertisement
The shortfall would lead to the “ politics of scarcity , ” in which nations would stop exporting their domestic grain and soy crops to keep food prices under control for their own people .
Even without a crisis in America ’s corn belt , that ’s already happening , Brown said .
In January , China levied export tariffs of 5 % for corn , rice and soybeans and 20 % for wheat to keep grains from leaving the country .
Russia , Argentina and other nations also are slapping tariffs on grain exports to protect their food supplies .
All of this has contributed to the growing cost of corn and wheat .
With wheat prices at record levels , economists expect American farmers to shift some corn acreage back to wheat , a move that could make corn supplies and prices even more vulnerable to the climate .
Advertisement
Here in the U.S. , a corn shortfall would also force federal regulators to make difficult choices .
Among them :
Should they stick to the ethanol production goals outlined in the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act or work to free up corn stocks to replenish the domestic and international food supply ?
The government could also lift tariffs on sugar - based ethanol from Brazil and start buying up available product .
Regardless , U.S. consumers would be faced with higher prices for gasoline or food , probably both , analysts believe .
“ We could see a spike that would raise prices so much in so many places that it could tip the U.S. into a recession , ” said Darin Newsom , senior analyst for DTN , an agriculture and energy research firm in Omaha .
Advertisement
More research and improved production of cellulosic ethanol -- made from agricultural waste , switchgrass and other nonfood plant material -- would ease dependence on corn , said Hartwig of the Renewable Fuels Assn .
But substantial production of such fuel is at least a decade away , according to government projections .
For now , the U.S. will have to hope for good weather , Brown said .
“ Historically , we have had a food economy and an energy economy that were for the most part separate , ” Brown said .
“ Now they are starting to fuse . ”

A rubbish dump twice the size of the
United States has been discovered
floating in the Pacific Ocean .
The vast expanse of debris , made up
of plastic junk including footballs ,
kayaks ,
Lego blocks and carrier bags ,
is kept together by swirling underwater
currents .
It stretches from 500 nautical miles off
the Californian coast , across the
northern Pacific , past Hawaii and almost as
far as Japan .
Scroll down for more ...
Because the rubbish , which
has been called a “ plastic soup ” and a
“ trash vortex ” , is translucent and lies
just below the water 's surface it cannot
be seen in satellite photographs .
American oceanographer Charles
Moore discovered the Great Pacific
Garbage Patch by chance in 1997 while
taking a short cut home from a yacht
race .
He said : “ Every time I came on
deck there was trash floating by .
How
could we have fouled such a huge area ?
How could this go on for a week ? ”
He warned that the rubbish could
double in size over the next decade if
consumers do not cut back on their
use of plastics .
More than a million
seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals
die every year as a result of plastic
rubbish .
Syringes , cigarette lighters
and toothbrushes have all been found
inside the stomachs of dead seabirds .
The rubbish can also be dangerous for
humans , because tiny plastic pellets
in the sea can attract man-made
chemicals which then enter the food chain .
Research director Dr Marcus
Eriksen said : “ What goes into the ocean
goes into these animals and onto your
dinner plate .
It 's that simple . ”
Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer compared
the rubbish to a living entity .
He said : “ It
moves around like a big animal without
a leash . ”
Describing what happens when
it reaches land , he said : “ The garbage
patch barfs , and you get a beach covered
with this confetti of plastic . ”
The rubbish dump is made up of two
linked areas either side of Hawaii .
Around one - fifth of the junk is thrown
off ships or oil platforms , while the
rest comes from the land .
Google has always had a love - hate relationship with advertising .
Its power and wealth come from the $ 16 billion a year of advertising that it sells .
Yet on its most important pages , the results from its
Web search engine , it has limited ads to nothing more garish than a dozen words of text .
That is about to change .
On Thursday , Google started testing video ads on some pages of search results .
And it is developing ad formats with images , interactive maps and other more elaborate features .
Marissa Mayer , Google ’s vice president of search products and user experience , said in an interview that the change reflects the evolution of the once - sparse Google pages .
Last year Google introduced what it calls universal search , which mixes images , videos , news stories and other types of information with the standard text links to Web pages .
“ The big insight of Google was n’t text ads ; it was that the ads should be conducive to the format , ” Ms. Mayer said .
“ We were doing text - based search that was all textual .
Visual ads do n’t work in that format . ”
By contrast , she said text ads are not as effective on pages with search results that include images and video .
The eyes of users automatically gravitate to the images more than the text , she said .
Now that Google ’s main search results pages include more images , video links and other elements , it is more appropriate , she argued , to have corresponding advertising formats .
“ With universal search , something is getting shaken up a bit on the bottom part of the page , ” she said .
“ The ads on the top part of the page should match . ”
At first , users will barely notice the change because the videos will not be immediately obvious .
Ads with accompanying videos will have a small button with a plus sign .
Google has increasingly used the plus icon to indicate that certain information — like a map — can pop up on a search results page .
Users that click the plus button on an ad will see a small video player that shows a commercial , movie trailer or other clip .
Ms. Mayer said , however , that the company would explore adding small thumbnail photos to the video ads as well .
And a spokesman said the company is considering testing other formats that may include ads with images .
But it is taking a delicate approach .
“ We do n’t want all sorts of video and banner ads all over the site all the time , ” Ms. Mayer said .
“ People who advertise a movie want to show a trailer .
Why should n’t they have the same format we use for search results and have a little plus box that says watch the trailer ? ”
For now , advertisers will not pay extra to put video in the ads .
They enter a price they will pay for a click in Google ’s regular text - ad auction .
But in the video ads , the advertiser pays when users click to see the video , even if they never click through to the advertiser ’s site .
This allows Google to expand what it can offer advertisers that are focused on promoting their brands , rather than driving traffic to a Web site .
But Ms. Mayer said the company was not changing its idea that ads need to be directly relevant to what users are searching for .
“ If you search for golf clubs , you get ads for golf clubs , not a banner ad about Pepsi that you may drink on the golf course , ” Ms. Mayer said .
As always on Google , ads are shown based on a combination of factors , including the amount bid and how often they are clicked on .
Google , which owns YouTube , the largest user - contributed video site on the Web , has been exploring a wide range of ways to put video ads online .
It started selling video ads that could appear on other Web sites two years ago .
The test is scheduled to begin today in a small fraction of Google searches .
Google would not provide an image of what they look like .

The Masdar Headquarters building will produce more power than it needs ( an energy positive building ) .
In fact , the solar roof ( one of the largest in the world ) will be constructed first , and it will power the construction of the rest of the building .
The video link on this page has a great view of the sun-infused interior .
The 1.4 million square foot building was designed by Chicago architecture firm Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill .
It will serve as the centerpiece of Masdar City , which will end up being about a $ 22 billion development in Abu Dhabi ( the capital of United Arab Emirates ) .
Masdar Headquarters will have the lowest energy consumption per square foot , it will feature the largest photovoltaic system and the largest solar thermal driven cooling and dehumidification system .
The building will also have integrated wind turbines .
It will consume about 70 % less water than a typical mixed - use building of its size .
Construction of Masdar City commenced with a formal ground - breaking ceremony on February 9 , 2008 .
The City will be constructed over seven phases and is due to be completed by 2016 .
Masdar ’s headquarters is part of phase one and will be completed by the end of 2010 .
The design competition for Masdar ’s headquarters was managed by the Louis Berger Group and began with a field of 159 participants , which was narrowed down to 15 architecture and design firms .
The criteria for selection of the 15 included building functionality , water and wastewater efficiency , indoor environmental quality , zero carbon emission , carbon
footprint reduction and firm experience .
Four global leaders in sustainable architecture and design were then chosen to submit final proposal .

But it ’s not true .
And , for the first time ever , the public can now see the extent to which they have been misled .
As lies go , it ’s a whopper .
Here ’s the real situation .
Like the three IPCC ‘ assessment reports ’ before it , the Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) released during 2007 ( upon which the UN climate conference in Bali was based ) includes the reports of the IPCC ’s three working groups .
Working Group I ( WG I ) is assigned to report on the extent and possible causes of past climate change as well as future ‘ projections ’ .
Its report is titled “ The Physical Science Basis ” .
The reports from working groups II and II are titled “ Impacts , Adaptation and Vulnerability ” and “ Mitigation of Climate Change ” respectively , and since these are based on the results of WG I , it is crucially important that the WG I report stands up to close scrutiny .
There is , of course serious debate among scientists about the actual technical content of the roughly 1,000 - page WG I report , especially its politically motivated Summary for Policymakers which is often the only part read by politicians and non-scientists .
The technical content can be difficult for non-scientists to follow and so most people simply assume that if that large numbers of scientists agree , they must be right .
Consensus never proves the truth of a scientific claim , but is somehow widely believed to do so for the IPCC reports , so we need to ask how many scientists really did agree with the most important IPCC conclusion , namely that humans are causing significant climate change — in other words the key parts of WG I ?
The numbers of scientist reviewers involved in WG I is actually less than a quarter of the whole , a little over 600 in total .
The other 1,900 reviewers assessed the other working group reports .
They had nothing to say about the causes of climate change or its future trajectory .
Still , 600 “ scientific expert reviewers ” sounds pretty impressive .
After all , they submitted their comments to the IPCC editors who assure us that “ all substantive government and expert review comments received appropriate consideration . ”
And since these experts reviewers are all listed in Annex III of the report , they must have endorsed it , right ?
Wrong .
For the first time ever , the UN has released on the Web the comments of reviewers who assessed the drafts of the WG I report and the IPCC editors ’ responses .
This release was almost certainly a result of intense pressure applied by “ hockey - stick ” co-debunker Steve McIntyre of Toronto and his allies .
Unlike the other IPCC working groups , WG I is based in the U.S. and McIntyre had used the robust Freedom of Information legislation to request certain details when the full comments were released .
An examination of reviewers ’ comments on the last draft of the WG I report before final report assembly ( i.e. the ‘ Second Order Revision ’ or SOR ) completely debunks the illusion of hundreds of experts diligently poring over all the chapters of the report and providing extensive feedback to the editing teams .
Here ’s the reality .
A total of 308 reviewers commented on the SOR , but only 32 reviewers commented on more than three chapters and only five reviewers commented on all 11 chapters of the report .
Only about half the reviewers commented more than one chapter .
It is logical that reviewers would generally limit their comments to their areas of expertise but it ’s a far cry from the idea of thousands of scientists agreeing to anything .
Compounding this is the fact that IPCC editors could , and often did , ignore reviewers ’ comments .
Some editor responses were banal and others showed inconsistencies with other comments .
Reviewers had to justify their requested changes but the responding editors appear to have been under no such obligation .
Reviewers were sometimes flatly told they were wrong but no reasons or reliable references were provided .
In other cases reviewers tried to dilute the certainty being expressed and they often provided supporting evidence , but their comments were often flatly rejected .
Some comments were rejected on the basis of a lack of space – an incredible assertion in such an important document .
The attitude of the editors seemed to be that simple corrections were accepted , requests for improved clarity tolerated but the assertions and interpretations that appear in the text were to be defended against any challenge .
An example of rampant misrepresentation of IPCC reports is the frequent assertion that ‘ hundreds of IPCC scientists ’ are known to support the following statement , arguably the most important of the WG I report , namely “ Greenhouse gas forcing has very likely caused most of the observed global warming over the last 50 years . ”
In total , only 62 scientists reviewed the chapter in which this statement appears , the critical chapter 9 , “ Understanding and Attributing Climate Change ” .
Of the comments received from the 62 reviewers of this critical chapter , almost 60 % of them were rejected by IPCC editors .
And of the 62 expert reviewers of this chapter , 55 had serious vested interest , leaving only seven expert reviewers who appear impartial .
Two of these seven were contacted by NRSP for the purposes of this article - Dr. Vincent Gray of New Zealand and Dr. Ross McKitrick of the University of Guelph , Canada .
Concerning the “ Greenhouse gas forcing … ” statement above , Professor McKitrick explained “ A categorical summary statement like this is not supported by the evidence in the IPCC WG I report .
Evidence shown in the report suggests that other factors play a major role in climate change , and the specific effects expected from greenhouse gases have not been observed . ”
Dr. Gray labeled the WG I statement as “ Typical IPCC doubletalk ” asserting “ The text of the IPCC report shows that this is decided by a guess from persons with a conflict of interest , not from a tested model . ”
Determining the level of support expressed by reviewers ’ comments is subjective but a slightly generous evaluation indicates that just five reviewers endorsed the crucial ninth chapter .
Four had vested interests and the other made only a single comment for the entire 11 - chapter report .
The claim that 2,500 independent scientist reviewers agreed with this , the most important statement of the UN climate reports released this year , or any other statement in the UN climate reports , is nonsense .
“ The IPCC owe it to the world to explain who among their expert reviewers actually agree with their conclusions and who don’t , ” says Natural Resources Stewardship Project Chair climatologist Dr. Timothy Ball .
“ Otherwise , their credibility , and the public ’s trust of science in general , will be even further eroded . ”
That the IPCC have let this deception continue for so long is a disgrace .
Secretary General Ban Kai-Moon must instruct the UN climate body to either completely revise their operating procedures , welcoming dissenting input from scientist reviewers and indicating if reviewers have vested interests , or close the agency down completely .
Until then , their conclusions , and any reached at the Bali conference based on IPCC conclusions , should be ignored entirely as politically skewed and dishonest .

Labour ran up a bill soaring towards £ 1 million for the general election that Gordon Brown called off , it was reported today .
Party chiefs had given the go - ahead for hundreds of thousands of pounds to be spent on booking hoarding sites , hiring staff and printing letters , as well as other pamphlets .
With the Prime Minister 's decision resting on the political situation in key marginals , Labour is also believed to have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on detailed surveys by Mr Brown 's favourite pollster Opinion Leader Research .
Around three million letters to be sent to key voters and Labour backers had already been printed , according to The Guardian , while technical experts working at the Tory annual rally in Blackpool were summoned by Labour , under a contract , to prepare a media centre in Victoria Street in central London .
Martin Linton , Labour MP for Battersea who has a majority of only 163 , despatched thousands of letters to Labour supporters but most of them were caught up in the postal strike .
Furniture was ordered for the media complex and a lorry delivering it reportedly had to be turned away on Monday 8 October , just days after the election had been cancelled .
Labour also had to pay in advance for hundreds of poster sites , it was claimed , emphasising how close Mr Brown got to announcing an election .
The expenditure will be a further blow to Labour 's finances as it seeks to pay off a deficit of around £ 20 million .
The Conservatives are thought to have spent less than £ 200,000 as they geared up for a general election and are now using poster sites booked for a campaign for a referendum on the new EU treaty .
Mr Brown ruled out a referendum on the EU " son of constitution " treaty today on the grounds that it is different from the failed constitution .
The Prime Minister faced a rebellion from Eurosceptic Labour MPs over his refusal as he reported back to the Commons from the Lisbon summit .
Conservatives , meanwhile , were hinting that they could pull out of the treaty if they win the next election - even if it has been formally adopted into UK law in the meantime .
This afternoon 's statement by Mr Brown marks the start of months of parliamentary debate over the EU Reform Treaty which critics say is virtually identical to the rejected EU Constitution .
The Conservatives claim as many as 120 Labour backbenchers have signalled that they either privately oppose the treaty or simply want a referendum to be held on it .
But Shadow Foreign Secretary William
Hague conceded there was little chance of defeating the Government in a Commons vote because the Liberal Democrats are backing the treaty .
• Mr Brown is facing a fresh " bottling " debate with allegations that his right - hand man Ed Balls - now Children 's Secretary - used the word when Mr Brown stepped back from launching a full - scale revolt among Labour MPs against Tony Blair after last year 's local elections .
According to a new book , Blair Unbound , by the biographer and headmaster of Wellington College , Anthony Seldon , Mr Balls yelled : " You bottled it ! "
Mr Balls , a former Treasury adviser and minister , strongly denied the charge and a spokesman said : " This is just invention and nonsense and littered with claims which are simply untrue . "
In the book , Mr Blair reportedly complains of being treated " like an abused and bullied wife " after one row with Mr Balls about when he would leave No10 .
The book claims that Mr Balls took an increasingly aggressive role in stoking up moves to oust Mr Blair .
Mr Seldon wrote : " His increasingly assertive role at the Treasury struck some as echoing the 1963 film The Servant , in which the butler , played by Dirk Bogarde , progressively takes over as the dominant force from the owner of the house , James Fox . "
Mr Blair is also said to have had concerns about Mr Brown's " character and personality , the dark side of his nature , his paranoia and his inability to collaborate " .
The timing of the serialisation is likely to frustrate Mr Brown , who is trying to haul Labour out of an opinion poll trough following the debacle of the snap election that never was .
so apparently Nintendo hates their customers ?
The Wii uses gamecube controllers with many of it's games as an input option why would they work backwards towards wires again !?
I know the Wavebird is more expensive to produce but its not like the Wii and DS print money or anything to pay for such a cost .. oh wait they do !
WHO would dare to kill off anything so obviously virtuous as the “ Protect America Act ” ?
Nancy Pelosi , speaker of the House of Representatives , did just that last week .
The result has been a fiery row over American surveillance policy — and a big political headache for Ms Pelosi 's party .
The act , which was passed in August and expired on February 16th , authorised American intelligence officials to eavesdrop on foreigners without having to ask for warrants , even when the targets were communicating with American citizens .
George Bush began doing this without congressional approval shortly after September 11th 2001 ; but after the New York Times exposed the programme , stoking much liberal outrage , Congress helpfully stepped in to give its permission .
The law , however , was only temporary .
With the need for an extension drawing near , President Bush insisted the Democrats tack on retrospective immunity for the telecommunications companies that had earlier co-operated with his warrantless dragnet .
( These firms now face lawsuits for having done so . )
House Democratic leaders refused and left for a recess , leaving the law to expire .
Mr Bush pounced , claiming that America had been left “ more in danger of an attack ” .
His intelligence chief claimed that America 's information - gathering capabilities had begun to deteriorate as soon as the law expired .
Robert Novak , a conservative commentator , accused Democrats of pandering to rich trial lawyers at the risk of American lives .
In reality , the statute 's demise has done little practical harm .
Existing wiretaps can continue .
American spies can also tap away as long as they get permission from the attorney - general ; warrants , which have to be signed by a judge , can be obtained subsequently .
( Preparing warrant applications , even after the fact , is time - consuming , but that should not be an immediate problem . )
And telecommunications firms worried about lawsuits are no worse off than they were before .
The political fallout , however , is much more significant .
Polls show that Americans now trust the Democrats as much , if not more , than Republicans on national security and terrorism — a striking change from the position earlier in the decade .
The Republicans are desperate to reverse that trend , not least because their presumptive presidential nominee , John McCain , will doubtless have much to say about the war on terror .
The Democrats ' balkiness will only help Mr McCain 's case .
They will , of course , end up passing eavesdropping legislation much along existing lines ; but every day of delay will hurt them .
IMAGINE being able to peek inside a black hole and even perform experiments there .
It may not be as far - fetched as it sounds , thanks to a team which claims to have simulated a black hole 's event horizon in the lab .
Ulf Leonhardt at the University of St Andrews , UK , and his colleagues accomplished the feat by firing lasers down an optical fibre , exploiting the fact that different wavelengths of light move at different speeds within an optical fibre .
They first shot a relatively slowmoving laser pulse through the fibre , and then sent a faster " probe wave " chasing after it .
The first pulse distorts the optical properties of the fibre simply by travelling through it .
This distortion forces the speedy probe wave to slow down dramatically when it catches up with the slower pulse and tries to move through it .
In fact , the probe wave becomes trapped and can never overtake the pulse 's leading edge , which effectively becomes a black hole event horizon , beyond which light cannot escape .
This " laser black hole " could allow physicists to examine what happens to light on both sides of a event horizon - " a feat that is utterly impossible in astrophysics " , the authors note in their paper .
Cosmologists have already worked out exactly how light should change frequency as it approaches an event horizon - from the outside or the inside of a black hole - and sure enough , the team observed exactly these shifts in their experiment .
It should also be possible to use the artificial event horizon to help test whether anything can escape from a black hole .
In the 1970s , Stephen Hawking predicted that hot black holes could radiate particles , dubbed Hawking radiation , but it 's tough to check this using telescopes , because they'd be swamped by noise .
The team calculates that their laser black hole shares this property , and that it will " radiate " photons if it heats up to about 1000 degrees centigrade .
Ray Rivers at Imperial College London is impressed by the work 's potential to test astrophysical phenomena : " They 've done some clever stuff to give us a chance of seeing Hawking radiation for the first time . "
Leonhardt presented the results at the Cosmology Meets Condensed Matter meeting in London last month .

At Cincinnati , Bill Cunningham , according to the LAT , who “ introduced presidential candidate John McCain at a rally here today accused Barack Obama of sympathizing with ‘ world leaders who want to kill us ’ and invoked Obama ’s middle name — three times calling him ‘ Barack Hussein Obama . ’ ” John McCain repudiated Cunningham ’s low tactics and said that using the middle name like that three times was “ inappropriate ” and would never happen again at one of his rallies .
I want to say something about Barack Hussein Obama ’s name .
It is a name to be proud of .
It is an American name .
It is a blessed name .
It is a heroic name , as heroic and American in its own way as the name of General Omar Nelson Bradley or the name of Benjamin Franklin .
And denigrating that name is a form of racial and religious bigotry of the most vile and debased sort .
It is a prejudice against names deriving from Semitic languages !
Christian , Western heroes have often been bequeathed Middle Eastern names .
Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar , the medieval Spanish hero , carried the name El Cid , from the Arabic al - Sayyid , “ the lord . ”
Barack and Hussein are Semitic words .
Americans have been named with Semitic names since the founding of the Republic .
Fourteen of our 43 presidents have had Semitic names ( see below ) .
And , American English contains many Arabic - derived words that we use every day and without which we would be much impoverished .
America is a world civilization with a world heritage , something Cunninghamism will never understand .
Barack is a Semitic word meaning “ to bless ” as a verb or “ blessing ” as a noun .
In its Hebrew form , bara k , it is found all through the Bible .
It first occurs in Genesis 1:22 : “ And God blessed ( ḇāreḵə ) them , saying , Be fruitful , and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let fowl multiply in the earth . ”
Here is a list of how many times bara k appears in each book of the Bible .
Now let us take the name “ Hussein . ”
It is from the Semitic word , hasan , meaning “ good ” or “ handsome . ”
Husayn is the diminutive , affectionate form .
Barack Obama ’s middle name is in honor of his grandfather , Hussein , a secular resident of Nairobi .
Americans may think of Saddam Hussein when they hear the name , but that is like thinking of Stalin when you hear the name Joseph .
There have been lots of Husseins in history , from the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad , a hero who touched the historian Gibbon , to King Hussein of Jordan , one of America ’s most steadfast allies in the 20th century .
The author of the beloved American novel , The Kite Runner , is Khaled Hosseini .
But in Obama ’s case , it is just a reference to his grandfather .
It is worth pointing out that John McCain ’s adopted daughter , Bridget , is originally from Bangladesh .
Since Hussein is a very common name in Bangladesh , it is entirely possible that her birth father or grandfather was named Hussein .
McCain certainly has Muslim relatives via adoption in his family .
If Muslim relatives are a disqualification from high office in the United States , then McCain himself is in trouble .
In fact , since Bridget is upset that George W. Bush does n’t like her “ because she is black , ” and used her to stop the McCain campaign in South Carolina in 2000 , you understand why McCain would be especially sensitive to race - baiting of Cunningham ’s sort .
The question is how vigorously he will combat it ; he has n’t been above Muslim - taunting in the campaign so far .
( And , the McCains really should let Bridget know that she is Asian , not “ black . ”
The poor girl ; Bush and Rove have done a number on her , and Cindy ’s confusion ca n’t help . )
The other thing to say about grandfathers named Hussein is that very large numbers of African - Americans probably have an ancestor ten or eleven generations ago with that name , in what is now Mali or Senegal or Nigeria .
And , since so many thousands of Arab Muslims were made to convert to Catholicism in Spain after 1501 , many Latinos have distant ancestors named Hussein , too .
In fact , since there was a lot of Arab - Spanish intermarriage , and since there was subsequent Spanish intermarriage with other European Catholics , more European Americans are descended from a Hussein than they realize .
The British royal family is quite forthright about the Arab line in their ancestry going back to Andalusia .
Obama , being a cousin of Dick Cheney on one side and having relatives in Kenya on the other , is just more and more typical of the 21st century United States .
So , anyway , Obama ’s first two names mean “ Blessing , the Good . ”
If we are lucky enough to get him for president , we can only hope that his names are prophetic for us .
Which brings me to Omar Bradley .
Omar is an alternative spelling of Umar , i.e .
Umar ibn al - Khattab , the second caliph of Sunni Islam .
Presumably General Bradley was named for the poet Omar Khayyam , who bore the caliph ’s name .
Omar Khayyam ’s Rubaiyat , in the “ translation ” of Edward FitzGerald , became enormously popular in Victorian America .
Gen . Omar Bradley , who bore a Semitic , Muslim first name , and shared it with the second Caliph of Sunni Islam , was the hero of D - Day and Normandy , of the Battle of the Bulge and the Ruhr .
Would Mr. Cunningham see Omar Bradley as un-American , as an enemy because of his name ?
What about other American heroes , such as Gen. George Joulwan , former NATO Supreme Allied Commander of Europe ?
“ Joulwan ” is an Arabic name .
Or there is Gen. John Abizaid , former CENTCOM commander .
Abizaid is an Arabic name .
Abi means
Abu or “ father of , ” and Zaid is a common Arab first name .
Is Cunningham good enough to wipe their shoes ?
Is he going to call them traitors because they have Arabic names ?
What about Congressman Darrell Issa of California ?
( “ `Isa ” means Jesus in Arabic ) .
Former cabinet secretary Donna Shalala ?
( Shalala means “ waterfall ” in Arabic ) .
I wo n’t go into all the great Americans with Arabic names in sports , entertainment and business , against whom Cunningham would apparently discriminate on that basis .
Does he want to take citizenship away from Kareem Abdul Jabbar [ meaning “ noble the servant of the Mighty ” ] and Ahmad Jamal [ meaning “ the most praised , beauty ” ] ?
What about Rihanna [ “ sweet basil , ” “ aromatic ” ] ?
Tony Shalhoub [ i.e. Mr. Monk ] ?
Let us take Benjamin Franklin .
His first name is from the Hebrew Bin Yamin , the son of the Right ( hand ) , or son of strength , or the son of the South ( yamin or right has lots of connotations ) .
The “ Bin ” means “ son of , ” just as in modern colloquial Arabic .
Bin Yamin Franklin is not a dishonorable name because of its Semitic root .
By the way , there are lots of Muslims named Bin Yamin .
As for an American president bearing a name derived from a Semitic language , that is hardly unprecedented .
John Adams really only had Semitic names .
His first name is from the Hebrew Yochanan , or gift of God , which became Johan and then John .
( In German and in medieval English , “ y ” is represented by “ j ” but was originally pronounced “ y ” . )
Adams is from the biblical Adam , which also just means “ human being . ”
In Arabic , one way of saying “ human being ” is “ Bani Adam , ” the children of men .
Thomas Jefferson ’s first name is from the Aramaic Tuma , meaning “ twin . ” Aramaic is a Semitic language spoken by Jesus , which is related to Hebrew and Arabic .
In Arabic twin is tau ’am , so you can see the similarity .
James Madison , James Monroe and James Polk all had a Semitic first name , derived from the Hebrew Ya’aqov or Jacob , which is Ya`qub in Arabic .
It became Iacobus in Latin , then was corrupted to Iacomus , and from there became James in English .
Zachary Taylor ’s first name is from the Hebrew Zachariah , which means “ the Lord has remembered . ”
Abraham Lincoln , of course is , named for the patriarch Abraham , from the Semitic word for father , Ab , and the word for “ multitude , ” raham , .
Abu , “ father of , ” is a common element in Arab names today .
So , Mr. Cunningham , Barack Hussein Obama fits right in this list of presidents with Semitic names .
In fact , we have n’t had one for a while .
We are due for another one .
A blessed and good one .
The Washington Post today had Ron Paul in the spotlight .
After raising 5.1 million dollars , 70 % from online donations , Ron Paul is making big - time waves in the GOP .
This is particularly noteworthy as the Mainstream Media gave the Representative from Texas hardly any media â€œplayâ€ .
This has truly been a grassroots success story that still has a long way to go before we find out what the ending will be .
Ron Paul seems to have struck a nerve in the vast blogosphere where he has gotten two thirds of his contributions from .
His strict constitutionalist stand , after the savagery that the Bush Administration subjected the Constitution to , seems to have endeared him to Independents , Republicans and even Democrats that yearn for someone that can restore the basis of our representative republic .
The civil liberties and the rights that the American people have allowed this administration to remove , law by law , are seen by many Americans as an attack on the Constitution that Bush has called a â€œquaint piece of paperâ€ .
Apparently most Americans want that piece of paper restored to its proper placeâ€¦ as the law of the land .
What makes Ron Paulâ€™s campaign so important to America besides the platform that he is running on is that this campaign clearly shows the world the power of the internet .
Paul , formerly dubbed a â€œtier three candidateâ€ by the media , has risen to the status of a contender without the media glitz that surrounds the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Rudy Guiliani , Fred Thompson and others .
The spotlight has been , for the GOP anyway , on Guiliani and Thompson , while the Paul camp has steadily received contributions and support from the internet .
This clearly shows that the Mainstream Media , while still an important force in American politics , is not the only venue that candidates can use effectively .
This development should be used as a wake - up call to the MSM to do their jobs and not only cover their â€œfavoritesâ€ lest they end up with egg on their faceâ€ ¦again .
While Ron Paulâ€™s stance on the war and the Constitution are certainly appealing after two terms with â€ œThe Unitary Executiveâ€ , many liberals wonâ€™t be pleased to learn that some of his views donâ€™t really meld with many liberal / progressive views .
He is pro-life , and being a strict constitutionalist , he is against many social programs such as universal health care and many educational programs run by the federal government .
Paul believes in a smaller , less powerful federal government and is a proponent of states rights .
In a perfect society this would work , but in a very broad sense , many individual states have at times neglected to provide for the social programs that many segments of their populations need .
One of the best examples of this was the social programs of the 60â€™s when the federal government had to intervene to force the end of segregation .
This is not to say that Ron Paulâ€™s views on the role of the federal government and relegating power back to the states on such things as education and health care wouldnâ€™t or couldnâ€™t work .
The only way that they would work is if citizens of took an active role in making sure the individual states did fill the gap that would be left if federal programs were discontinued .
The desire to trim the federal budget and limit the power that it now wields in desirable , as long as people understand that the state taxes will rise in proportion to the cuts the federal government makes .
Of course the President canâ€™t cut federal programs alone ; it must be done with the consent of Congress .
Still , a Paul victory would probably bring in a Republican majority in Congress .
I bring this up only to illustrate what a Paul presidency might look like .
I donâ€™t in any way suggest that this in itself should influence anyone from supporting Rep .
Paul in his bid for the Presidency ; as far as Iâ€™m concerned he may be exactly what the country needs .
Unless Dennis Kucinich or Mike Gravel can garner the same kind of support that Paul has managed to gather , it looks as if the race could end up in Paul facing Clinton in â€™08 .
If this were to be the case , unless something happens between now and then , Paul could very well get my vote .

Marine divers are racing to try to save 18 Ukrainian crew believed to be trapped on the ocean floor in their overturned ship after two vessels collided off Hong Kong , officials said .
" The top priority of the ongoing rescue operation is to locate the missing persons , both inside the vessel and on the sea surface , " the director of the city 's marine department , Roger Tupper said .
The missing were thought to be trapped in the engine room and cabins of a Ukrainian tug , the Naftogaz - 67 , which collided with a China - registered cargo ship , the Yao - Hai , late on Saturday ( local time ) .
The Ukrainian vessel , which was carrying 24 Ukrainian crew and one Chinese sailor , sank quickly after the collision and came to rest on the seabed at a depth of 37 metres , Hong Kong officials said .
Six Ukrainians and the Chinese sailor were rescued shortly afterwards , they said .
' Still hope '
At Simferopol in Ukraine , the president of the energy company Chornomornaftegaz which owns the ship expressed hopes that the missing sailors would be found alive .
" We have not lost hope of finding the other sailors alive , as long as they are in the interior ( of the ship ) where there are still pockets of air , " said Anatoly Prisiazhnyuk , who said he spoke by telephone with the ship 's captain who was one of those who had escaped .
According to the captain , the collision happened because the Chinese vessel refused to give his ship the right of way .
" He had received from the controller permission to pass .
The Chinese cargo ship should have let it pass , but it did not do that , " said Mr Prisiazhnyuk .
It took divers six hours to locate the sunken vessel , which was found several hundred metres from the location initially given by maritime police , probably because it was moved by a strong current , officials said .
Nine attempts by divers to reach the wreck were unsuccessful due to the current , poor visibility and the depth of its position , the government said .

The crisis was eased when leaders met at a regional summit
Caracas broke off relations with its neighbour in protest at a Colombian military raid into Ecuador , in which a leading leftist Farc rebel was killed .
Over subsequent days , regional tensions soared , but the crisis was defused when leaders met at a summit on Friday .
But Ecuador , which accused Colombia of violating its sovereignty , has said it will take some time to restore ties .
Threat of confrontation
Last week 's crisis saw both Venezuela and Ecuador deploy troops to their respective borders with Colombia , diplomatic ties between Colombia and a number of countries in the region cut , and commercial traffic disrupted .
[ Friday 's summit was ] a victory for peace and sovereignty ... and demonstrated the importance of Latin American unity in overcoming conflicts
Venezuelan foreign ministry
The crisis in pictures
Observers said the tensions threatened to spill over into military confrontation , but just a week after the crisis blew up it was apparently resolved at Friday 's Rio Group summit .
There , the region 's leaders accepted a 20 - point declaration by the Organization of American States ( OAS ) , sealing their reconciliation with smiles and handshakes .
The declaration included a promise by President Alvaro Uribe that Colombia 's forces would never again violate the territory of its neighbours .
In its statement on Sunday , Venezuela 's foreign ministry called the summit outcome a " victory for peace and sovereignty ... which demonstrated the importance of Latin American unity " .
It said Venezuelan diplomatic personnel would be immediately returned to their embassy in Bogota , and Colombian personnel had been invited to do the same .
Today ’s NY Times has an in - depth look at the spending practices of the Obama and Clinton campaigns for the upcoming week .
I did get a chuckle out of Mark Penn ’s complaint about the Obama campaign : “ they are dumping a lot of money there . ”
Given the millions his firm has raked in — and where it ’s gotten his candidate , Penn is the last person who should accuse anyone of dumping money .
But , that ’s not key point of the article .
The key point for me actually did n’t make the Times on - line version of the story , I read it in my print edition .
It ’s about the Obama campaign ’s on - going efforts “ to grow the electorate . ”
I did find it on the Barre Times - Montpelier Argus website
Obama has been particularly aggressive in these contests in using Internet tools to identify and turn out supporters , building on tools they have developed throughout the campaign .
For example , anyone using the search engine Google to look for Texas caucus locations will see an advertisement from Obama ’s campaign listing the caucus sites , and , after a click , inviting people to sign in with their names and e-mail addresses .
Visitors to the Web sites of The Houston Chronicle and The Cincinnati Enquirer were confronted with a moving advertisement that took up nearly half the screen that showed a video of Obama and urged voters to sign up and pledge their support to his campaign .
“ We are trying to grow the electorate , ” said David Plouffe , Obama ’s campaign manager , referring to the Internet effort .
“ We have had almost 20,000 people come through our ads looking for their early vote location . ”
Growing the electorate is why Obama wins .
Traditionally , at this point in a campaign , the get - out - the - vote effort is aimed only at already confirmed supporters .
Those folks get harassed over and over with multiple phone calls .
That ’s what traditional campaigns do .
Winning campaigns find new voters , too .
And , the Obama campaign keeps finding new voters .
That ’s what adds to the numbers .
It really is a new generation campaign .
Plouffe , Steve Hildebrand and Paul Tewes ( who is running Ohio after managing the Iowa victory ) and that whole political / field / internet team deserve major kudos .
They ’re redefining the ways Democrats campaign .
They ’re using every tool to add support .
And , that ’s how we ’ll win in the fall against McCain .
It has been 10 years since the world last heard from Portishead , when TV producers ' turned our sounds into a fondue set ' .
A stunning new album could even herald the rebirth of the Bristol scene .
An exclusive interview by Ben Thompson
This is how the new Portishead album starts .
A friendly voice says something vaguely introductory in Brazilian - Portuguese .
There 's a bit of subdued chatter in the background , and the reassuring plink of a distant piano , as if you 're arriving at a half - empty Latin nightclub .
Then a huge pummelling beat comes in ( Geoff Barrow insists that he was ' massively unhappy ' with this rhythm for many long months , but it sounds pretty unstoppable now ) .
Sawing strings summon up a demonic echoing cowbell , before this in turn gives way to ominous slashes of spaghetti western guitar - the sort of thing you 'd expect to hear just before a hired gun played by Lee Van Cleef accidentally shoots an innocent child .
Two minutes and 10 seconds in , the scene is finally set for Beth Gibbons 's vocal to make its entrance .
But however effectively the listener has been softened up for this momentous event , no one will quite be prepared for the pitch of ecstatic anguish at which her voice announces itself .
' Wounded and afraid inside my head , ' Beth flails poignantly , as a Tardis seems to take off in the background , ' falling through changes ...
Did you know what I lost ?
Do you know what I wanted ?'
It 's stunning stuff .
And this is just the opening number .
Later on , once Third ( for that is the title : it is , after all , Portishead 's third album - well , if you do n't count the live one ) is properly up and running , it features a run of five or six songs which are not just worthy of the records this band were making 10 or even 14 years ago , but feel like the sonic destination which they were always meant to arrive at .
Being amazed by the music of Portishead was not an activity at the top of many people 's agendas for 2008 .
A couple of years ago , when this slow - moving West Country ensemble tentatively emerged from retirement by contributing a track to a poorly conceived English - language Serge Gainsbourg tribute LP , they sounded like a band on the verge of total creative exhaustion .
When checking in with Barrow 's blog in the run-up to December 's comeback as curators of the more - underground - than - thou ATP festival at Minehead Butlins , the omens were no more propitious .
' This album has been like watching Lost , ' he pronounced gloomily , 'a never - ending journey with few answers . '
' Wish we had more time , ' he yearns poignantly at another juncture .
And why should n't he ?
It 's only been 10 years since their last record , after all .
What you might call Bacardi advert time - frames have always been an issue with the music made in this part of the world , however vehemently those responsible might protest otherwise .
And with Tricky and Massive Attack also poised to release new albums , perennial late starters Portishead find themselves in the unaccustomed position of being first out of the blocks .
Far from being unnerved by his band 's decade - long shore leave , genially rumpled bed - head poster - boy Barrow seems to view it in an entirely positive light .
' Over that 10 - year period , ' he explains , ' the pressure to have successful records obviously dies .
Which is really good , as then you can just do what you want . '
The home studio on the top floor of Portishead guitarist Adrian Utley 's five - storey Georgian house in the classy district of Kingsdown supplies an abundance of circumstantial evidence as to how that decade might have been spent .
A lovely old harmonium Utley bought off eBay for £ 29 squats elegantly in one corner .
In another , there 's an ancient synthesiser signed by its designer , recently deceased musical pioneer Bob Moog .
Anyone who has even a passing familiarity with Portishead 's bespoke blend of antique futurism and ambient savagery would expect them to inhabit a world full of lovely - looking musical instruments .
But there 's an intensity to the atmosphere in this room which suggests it 's home to a band who care about substance more than style .
' We 've had some dark moments in here , ' admits the usually ebullient Utley .
' Discussing things for hours to try and make the world around the music completely solid , then listening back to stuff and not liking it , and then not listening to it and talking for hours about biscuits . '
The vista that unfolds across the long picture window above the giant wooden mixing - desk - a breathtaking view down the slope to Bristol 's notoriously unsatisfactory city centre ( of which more later ) and beyond to the green hills in the distance - would grab the attention of even the most sceptical observer .
Whatever the precise explanation for Portishead 's unlikely creative renaissance , it seems probable that the complex relationship between this panoramic backdrop and the essential privacy of the band 's notoriously complicated recording process is going to be somewhere near the heart of it .
When a lot of exciting music emerges from one place at roughly the same time , it does n't usually take long for the things people say in the hope of capturing this excitement to start looking foolish .
Whether it 's Newport being the new Seattle , or Sunderland being the old Sheffield , the onward march of rock 'n ' roll history soon tends to tramp down such proudly regionalist boasts into a kind of hyperbolic mulch .
In the case of the ' Bristol sound ' of the early - to - mid- 1990s , however , the idea that something special happened at that particular time and in that particular place has grown more persuasive rather than less with the passing years .
This is partly because the music has lasted so well - listening to Massive Attack 's Blue Lines , Portishead 's Dummy and Tricky 's Maxinquaye a decade and a bit later , it 's impossible to deny that these are three of the most resonant and perfectly - formed debut albums to emerge in over 50 years of British pop .
The particular circumstances of growing up in that city in the Eighties - from the endless social ramifications of Bristol 's historic connections with slavery , to the fallout from an especially euphoric punky - reggae crossover , the enduring influence of art - school polemicists the Pop Group , and the shared hip - hop heritage of the Dug Out Club and the Wild Bunch sound - system - helped shape a uniquely cosmopolitan culture which the rest of Britain recognised but could not hope to emulate .
And at a time when the kind of sophistication a broadband connection or a nationwide Italian - style coffee franchise brings are equally accessible to everyone , the idea of such a distinct mindset now seems almost impossibly mysterious .
Yet speaking to all the major players in this story as it was unfolding , it soon became clear that what divided them was every bit as important as what they had in common .
' Everyone thinks we 're all sleeping together , ' Blue Lines 's puckish featured rapper Tricky Kid murmured to me in 1994 , before bemoaning the fact that while he was working on his first solo endeavour ( a contribution , as it happened , to a benefit project for research into sickle - cell anaemia ) , all the full - time members of Massive Attack ' came back from the pub to take the piss ' .
And while acknowledging that his band represented ' the first generation of immigrants that grew up in England ' , in conversation Massive stalwart Daddy G was quick to emphasise that ' you can't say that living here has affected us all in the same way , because it has n't ' .
Perhaps inevitably , two of the clearest and most commercially successful paths through the Bristol scene 's forest of inter-personal connections were trodden by white kids .
Nellee Hooper jumped ship from the Wild Bunch sound - system to become first one half of Soul II Soul , and then ( for a while at least : no one seems to know what he 's up to at the moment ) the world 's most sought after record - producer .
And Barrow - teenage tea-maker and tape operator at the Coach House studios where Massive Attack recorded Blue Lines - went on first to co-produce Tricky 's solo debut , and then to start his own group , named ( in classic hip hop - style ) after the town he'd grown up in .
The fact that this place - Portishead - was neither an LA ghetto nor a suburb of New York but a no- horse satellite town of Bristol , clinging on to the edge of the Severn Estuary by its scabby fingernails , was a reality which Barrow has scrupulously refused to overlook from that day to this .
In his quest to make music which was informed by the American hip hop he loved , but also true to the place it came from , he enlisted two somewhat unlikely allies .
One , Beth Gibbons , was a singer - songwriter almost a decade his senior .
The other , Adrian Utley , was a veteran jazz guitarist who was rumoured to have once played with Art Blakey .
Because it 's simpler , people have tended to see the subsequent development of Portishead 's music as a straightforward tug of war between rough - edged cut - and - paste merchant Barrow , and Gibbons the enigmatic chanteuse .
In fact , the band 's creative power - base has always been more of a triangle ; the atmospheric sound - scapes do n't really make sense without a proper understanding of Utley 's contribution .
The great thing about this apparently ill - matched trio was that each person brought something to the table that the others needed : Gibbons 's striking vocal and visual presence and old - school song - writing talent , Barrow 's fan - boy grasp of the mechanics of hip hop , and Utley 's musicianly chops .
' Because we came from such different worlds , ' Utley remembers , ' what really got me and Geoff talking to each other first was Public Enemy .
As I 'd come from a traditional playing - with - other - people type of background , I did n't know how these records were being made .
I 'd never had a sampler - they were really expensive at the time - so I just did n't understand where these amazing sounds were coming from . '
' With samples , in those days , ' he continues - ' Before time - stretching and all this Pro Tools tomfoolery , ' qualifies Barrow , ever the home - schooled rap technician - ' you were actually forcing notes against notes , so there was a proper clash and everything was slightly out of tune .
Because you want this riff to go over that beat and you 've just got to make it happen , you end up with this kind of roughness , which is what made Public Enemy or Eric B so exciting . '
' For me , ' adds the older man , ' finding hip hop was a huge life - changing experience - like having a baby or something ' .
Even as he says this , Utley 's 14 - month - old daughter is taking some of her first steps across the wooden floorboards of the downstairs kitchen .
And just as this road - hardened jazz - warrior was first discovering hip - hop 's ' whole world of fantasticness ' , he toddled into Barrow coming back the other way .
Years of immersion in the crate - digging one - upmanship of DJ culture were making the younger man increasingly uncomfortable with hip hop's ' trainspotting tendencies ' .
And what better way to transcend your disenchantment with ' people getting excited about the first two bars of some beat that sounds like it was played at Butlins ' than by forging a new creative partnership with someone who might have helped keep that beat ?
When Barrow was holidaying at Torbay Pontins as a child in the very early Eighties ( ' We never went to Butlins - it was too posh ' ) , Utley was actually playing in the band .
Portishead were painfully aware of the embarrassment that can ensue when white musicians try to appropriate black musical innovations wholesale - ' We did n't want to be Cliff Richard singing over a loop of " Funky Drummer " , ' Barrow almost snarls ( Bristol 's biggest venue , the Colston Hall , might still be named after a slave - trader , but that 's all the more reason for the city 's artists to eschew a colonial mentality ) .
So they set themselves the challenge of incorporating a sense of that distance from their source material into the very fabric of their music .
' It ca n't just be like a live tape played by a load of musicians , ' Utley explains , 'it has to feel like it 's already a record of something , like it 's come from a world . '
The band 's determination to be true to this underlying principle has necessitated a uniquely painstaking process of artistic evolution .
Each time they 've proved a particular way of doing things can work for them , they seem to feel compelled to tear up that rulebook .
Thus , when making Dummy , Barrow would record a combination of samples and live music , press them on to vinyl , then scratch - mix the results to make backing tapes for Gibbons to add lyrics and a tune to .
But for 1997's Portishead this methodology was no longer deemed tortuous enough , so the band invested endless months in creating their own samples from , as it were , scratch .
( ' We could n't just put the needle on a record and take someone else 's music , ' Barrow grins painedly , ' and besides , it was more fun to do it ourselves . ')
At the time , Utley described this process as being ' like trying to walk with one Wellington boot full of concrete ' , but Portishead 's endless labours received their just reward in the end .
Not commercially ( the second album sold less than the first ) , but in the loftier realm of kudos .
When ' Over ' was sampled by both Timbaland and Wu - Tang Clan 's RZA , Barrow had achieved his ultimate objective of giving something back : supplying actual fuel for hip hop 's hungry furnace .
Small wonder that Portishead - like their increasingly fractured and discontented peers Massive Attack and Tricky - were running out of steam by the end of the Nineties .
Geoff Barrow looks worn - out even having to think about this stage of his band 's history .
' After we got back and mixed the live album [ 1998 's impeccably grandiose Roseland NYC Live - probably , strangely , the best place to start for people unfamiliar with their previous oeuvre ] we did n't really get together for six years ...
It was n't that we were n't speaking .
But Beth got ill and moved back to Devon for a while .
I got divorced , and we all worked on a few solo projects . '
The smart money , at this stage , would not have been on Portishead 's most sonically adventurous and exhilarating work still being ahead of them .
And when they finally got back together , things - to put it mildly - took a while to get going .
' I bought hundreds and hundreds of records , ' Barrow remembers , glumly , ' sampled them , looped them up and made backing tracks ... and it just put me into a massive state of depression , basically . '
Why ?
' It just seemed so backward , and like something we 'd done too many times .
The songs sounded OK as instrumental hip hop , but as soon as Beth started singing , it was like " Oh man , no way " .
The idea of us just trying to be Gang Starr with Beth on top just was not really interesting to any of us any more - her included .
We ended up going back to early hip hop drum machines , because they were the only things we could really stand listening to .
The idea of classic breaks that had been chopped up was not really palatable any more . '
The roots of Barrow 's allergic reaction to the sounds he once loved probably lay in the unasked - for ubiquity of his band 's debut album .
At some point around the time Dummy won the 1995 Mercury Prize , Portishead found that the music they had lovingly fashioned from scraps of Lalo Schifrin 's old film scores had suddenly ( when featured in the background on aspirational twenty - something TV drama This Life ) become the soundtrack to a mid-Nineties media lifestyle fantasy .
' They turned our songs into a fondue set , ' he observes , disgustedly , more than a decade on .
The same anger was on public display in his recent entertaining blog - spat with Mark Ronson , in which he accused the well - connected New Yorker of making ' shit funky supermarket muzak ' , eliciting a pithy but intriguingly off - target response about Portishead 's music no longer being ' popular enough to be played in supermarkets ' ( an eventuality which actually seems to be a great source of relief to the whole band ) .
Barrow and Utley seem to agree that one of Third 's subliminal themes is the ' ridiculousness ' of contemporary existence .
' You 've got the surface world - the absolute unreal world that everyone is supposed to live in - and then there are the actual real things that are happening , and then there 's this ginormous layer of media which divides the two , ' Barrow fulminates sheepishly , as if conscious that he has expressed this dilemma more elegantly in musical form .
It 's a neat demonstration of the contrasting personalities which give the music of Portishead its light and shade that when the topic of This Life comes up while he and Utley are chatting to photographer Harry Borden at the OMM photo shoot , Beth Gibbons pipes up from the other corner of the room : ' Oh , I always quite liked that show ! '
Under normal circumstances , this would be the only quote from the notoriously reticent vocalist that would be available to us .
Happily , in the course of my previous professional encounter with Portishead , in late 1994 , a sudden indisposition on the part of Barrow ( who'd been hospitalised with a suspected ulcer ) caused Gibbons to lift her lifetime ban on talking to British journalists for the only time .
Far from the Garboesque recluse of legend , she turned out to be a genial , no - nonsense character , wearing glasses and speaking with a light Devonian burr rather than a tortured croak .
After rooting through a cupboard in her small terraced house in the Easton district of Bristol , she unearthed a series of unreleased Portishead songs and played them back with a self - deprecating running commentary - ' This is where I tried to rip off Sinead O'Connor ' - or ' Neil Young ' , or ' Tom Waits ' or ' a black soul singer ' .
Yet it seemed the harder Beth Gibbons tried to copy someone else , the more she sounded like no one but herself .
Before giving me a lift back to the station in her elegantly battered Triumph , with a pre-release copy of Maxinquaye on the stereo , Gibbons said a couple of things which enhanced her band 's air of mystery far more effectively than any long - term vow of silence .
The first was that even though in some ways the loneliness which had driven her to write songs in the first place had been intensified by sending that music out into the world as a commercial product , 'if you think of something like the mannequins in Blade Runner , they only think they 're human because of the pictures they hold ' .
The second - rather less existential , but none the less intriguing - observation concerned her relationship with Barrow .
' It may be the age gap , but he never quite knows how to take me , ' she said , of the musical associate she 'd first teamed up with at an enterprise allowance induction day three years earlier .
' If you asked him about me , I do n't know what he'd say . '
Fourteen years later , Barrow discusses their initial meeting in similarly uncertain tones : ' She was a woman , but I was still just a boy really .
I mean , the lyrics she 'd written for the first song we worked on together name - checked Gandhi !
I just did not have the first idea of what she was on about . '
In the intervening years , the distance between Portishead 's ruling triumvirate has greatly decreased .
' We 're closer now than we 've ever been , ' insists Utley , ' and the lines between what each of us contributes have totally blurred . '
The way the band works has basically turned inside out .
And you can feel the ensuing emotional thaw in the music on Third .
In place of the old demarcations , there 's now the sense of a rush towards a shared objective .
Some of this extra momentum comes from the beats .
Take the percussive thrust of the album 's opening track , for example .
' The vibe I really wanted , ' Barrow explains , ' was when Muhammad Ali fought George Foreman at the Rumble in the Jungle and James Brown played .
I wanted it to feel like it had been recorded somewhere really fucking remote . '
But there 's a further source of additional energy at work , one which ( for Geoff at least ) comes close to matching the intensity of his earlier connection with the hip hop mother lode .
' If you look back at the ATP line - up , ' Geoff enthuses , 'it 's basically a list of the music that makes our album . '
Given that this three - day event traditionally offers a bill of fare so ascetic that even hardened readers of the Wire magazine are inclined to want to listen to Diana Ross and the Supremes in the car on the way home , readers could be forgiven for feeling somewhat unnerved by the prospect of Portishead 's new doom - metal direction .
But listening to Third , the sheer savagery of the album 's numerous sonic switchbacks seems to have also shaken free the band 's melodic sense as well .
The first three songs are something like you 'd expect from a new Portishead album .
They 're kind of the same , but different - like arriving at the airport and having to carry your toothpaste through passport control in a plastic bag .
But then the record really takes off , and suddenly it 's taking you somewhere you 've never been before .
A tune called ' The Rip ' starts out like an old English folk remnant but ends up in the enchanted realm of early Kraftwerk .
Another amazing song , ' We Carry On ' , joins the dots between the ramshackle urgency of Sixties punk and the terrifying precision of Joy Division .
And let 's not forget ' Deep Water ' ( which Utley hates ) : it 's the most touching Steve Martin - inspired close - harmony ukulele ballad in Portishead 's entire repertoire .
Back up in Portishead 's rooftop eyrie , Adrian Utley points out places of local interest through the window : ' Nellee Hooper came from Barton Hill , over there , which is not a fairytale place to live .
Tricky was from Knowle , which is pretty grim as well , and Mushroom lived in Fishponds . '
At this point , talk turns to Bristol 's endlessly postponed city - centre redevelopment .
There 's a school of thought which believes that Tony Wilson 's Factory Records dreamt up the Manchester of the 21st century .
Can either Barrow or Utley imagine a metropolitan hub inspired by Dummy or Maxinquaye
' I do n't know what that would look like , ' the former grins , ' but it would be fairly frightening , I reckon . '
At this point , a courier arrives with a freshly remastered copy of Third , and Barrow sticks it into the CD player and strains his ears to assess the impact of another set of infinitesimal adjustments .
If Massive Attack 's and Tricky 's forthcoming albums sound anything like as good as this one , well , Bristol just might be the new Bristol .
· Third ( Island ) is out on 14 April ; Portishead also tour that month .
The title of this post sounds like an oxymoron .
But it is a fact of life for me and probably many of the people who read this blog .
The idea of a ' get away from it all ' vacation is a romantic notion that I cannot seem to achieve as much as the Gotham Gal and my kids would like me to .
This week , for example , I am in the middle of assisting two of our portfolio companies close on very senior hires .
I am helping with the negotiations and trying to keep the rest of the board in the loop .
And we are closing a deal which requires some attention on my part .
And we are working with all of our portfolio companies to ensure they have their cash invested wisely .
None of these efforts will or should wait for next week
I do have partners and a very capable associate to back me up and I rely on them a lot more when I am on vacation .
But the reality of venture capital is that its a relationship intensive business .
You can't just disengage from a complicated negotiation and say ' my partner is taking over for me for the next week ' .
We all wish it was so , but its not .
So what do I do to manage ?
First , I block out 90 minutes in the morning when my family is asleep for emails and phone calls .
Hawaii makes that easy because at 6 am in hawaii , its 9 am in the bay area and noon in NYC .
I schedule all my calls for this time slot .
And I keep my blackberry with me but try to keep it off unless we have some down time like waiting for a tour to begin .
I have gotten very good at quickly scanning email to see if there is anything urgent .
I also find time to do stuff , like post on the eliptical trainer , where I am not taking time from the family and the vacation
Most of all , when there 's a question between family and work , family wins .
That has to be asbolute
I 've heard of some amazing tricks .
A friend of mine listened in to a board call where he is an observer while skiing with his wife .
He had the call on mute and the headphones under his helmet .
We 'll have to ask his wife what kind of company he was on the hill that morning but that 's the kind of mutli- tasking we have resorted to at times
My friend Brad Feld does ' go off the grid ' for one week a quarter every quarter .
I 've asked him how he does it and I honestly can't see myself pulling it off .
I wish I could .
But one things for sure .
We all need vacations and we should n't let the need to work ruin them for ourselves and our families .

Mideast military chief resigns after magazine article RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday March 11 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Defense Secretary Robert Gates says that Admiral William Fallon , the top U.S. military commander for the Middle East , is resigning .
Gates said Fallon had asked Gates for permission to retire and that Gates agreed .
Fallon was the subject of an article published last week in Esquire magazine that portrayed him as opposed to President Bush 's Iran policy .
It described Fallon as a lone voice against taking military action to stop the Iranian nuclear program .
In one passage , the magazine said : So while Admiral Fallon 's boss , President George W. Bush , regularly trash - talks his way to World War III and his administration casually casts Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as this century 's Hitler ( a crown it has awarded once before , to deadly effect ) , it 's left to Fallon - - and apparently Fallon alone -- to argue that , as he told Al Jazeera last fall : " This constant drumbeat of conflict . . . is not helpful and not useful .
I expect that there will be no war , and that is what we ought to be working for .
We ought to try to do our utmost to create different conditions . "
Gates described as " ridiculous " any notion that Fallon 's departure signals the United States is planning to go to war with Iran .
And he said " there is a misperception " that Fallon disagrees with the administration 's approach to Iran .
" I do n't think there were differences at all , " Gates added .
Fallon told the Washington Post that the Esquire article was " poison pen stuff " that is " really disrespectful and ugly . "
He did n't note any specific objections , though .
Retiring after a 41 - year Navy career , Fallon took the Central Command post on March 16 , 2007 , succeeding Army Gen. John Abizaid , who retired .
Fallon previously served as commander of U.S. Pacific Command .
Gates said that until a permanent replacement is nominated and confirmed by the Senate , Fallon 's place will be taken by his top deputy , Army Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey .
The secretary called Fallon a very able military strategist and said his advice will be missed at the Pentagon .
" I think this is a cumulative kind of thing , " said Gates , speaking of the circumstances leading up to Fallon 's decision .
" It is n't the result of any one article or any one issue . "
" As I say , the notion that this decision portends anything in terms of change in Iran policy is , to quote myself , ' ridiculous , ' " he said .

The Adelaide Advertiser had a rather more serious photo problem in this promotion for their classified ads .
Week - end Shopper
You can sell your goods for free Emily Ramsden was given plenty of new furniture when she married in January and she needs to make room by selling her old furniture .
—
The Advertiser , pg 2 , August 6 , 2005
When Emily placed her ad , the Advertiser asked if they could take her photo , to promote their new free ads .
Emily Ramsden contemplates her savings —
The Advertiser , pg 2 , August 6 , 2005
Emily told us that photographer Ben McMahon wanted her to lie on the bed .
He asked me to lie on my stomach , which is quite hard to do when you 're six months pregnant .
Then he said " Ok move up to the bed post , he kept trying to get me to move up more .
— Emily Ramsden to Media Watch
The photo that was published does make a big feature of the bed post , attached to which are these ...
Emily was shocked and embarrassed .
The handcuffs were a gift from a friend , given as a joke .
We 've never used them .
I did n't even think about it when the photographer was taking the photos .
I have been crying about it for days .
We 've had people ringing up my husband saying " Look at what she gets up to . ? " — Emily Ramsden to Media Watch
The Advertiser 's Editor , Melvin Mansell , told us their photographer :
Did not deliberately frame the handcuffs in the picture , he tried to disguise them after a conversation with Ms Ramsden .
— Fax : Melvin Mansell , Editor , The Advertiser , to Media Watch
Read the reply from Melvin Mansell in full
Oh really ?
We asked Emily Ramsden about that " conversation " and she moved from embarrassed to furious .
That 's a complete lie .
I never discussed the handcuffs with him , either at the time the photo was taken or afterwards .
— Emily Ramsden to Media Watch
Editor Mansell does admit that the paper 's editorial staff knew the photo showed the handcuffs , but went ahead and published .
I apologised to Ms Ramsden and her family .
The photographer has been suspended for one week while this is investigated .
— Fax : Melvin Mansell , Editor , The Advertiser , to Media Watch
But will the photographer wear this crass error of judgment alone ?
Whatever made the editors think that Emily might not mind the cheap laugh at her expense , and the lewd phone calls ?
She told Media Watch :
There 's this newspaper clipping that 's been sitting among the flotsam of my desktop for the last week or so .
I tore it out of the December 20 Wall Street Journal because it struck me .
Struck me how ?
Well , that 's pretty much what I 've been trying to figure out since then .
Having lived through the last seven years of you - know - what , I figured I 'd been rendered immune further from shock or awe .
And I was sure I 'd exceeded my lifetime supply of irony - spotting .
Then I saw the story in question .
It could n't have been considered very important by WSJ editors , because it was buried on an inside page .
But it sure jumped out to me .
The headline asked :
Who Bought the Magna Carta ?
The story answered it 's own question :
" Talk about your historic takeovers .
David Rubenstein , co-founder of the private - equity firm Carlyle Group , bought a 710 - year - old copy of the Magna Carta for $ 21.3 million on Tuesday . " ( Full Story )
If you 've put up with my rants for any time at all , you know I 'm no lover of conspiracy theories .
And so that 's not where I ;m going with this .
The Carlyle Group has replaced the Trilateral Commission as the conspiracy - minded 's invisible hand of all things devious and evil .
I do n't see it that way at all .
Instead I see the Carlyle Group for what it is -- America 's preeminent conduit of the fruits of crony capitalism .
Founded in 1987 with $ 5 million , the Washington - based merchant bank controls nearly $ 14 billion in investments , making it the largest private equity manager in the world .
Carlyle does n't dabble in investments .
It buys and sells entire companies the way most other investment firms trade shares of stock .
I 'm not saying that the Magna Carta 's new owner , David Rubenstein , is a bad man .
I did some research and he gives a lot of ( tax deductible ) money to worthy charities .
But then , why not ?
If members of this exclusive group have anything in excess , it 's money .
At any point in time , Carlyle and it's investors have vested interests virtually any thing important that 's going down in the world .
Wars are bullish for Carlyle .
Which is why Carlyle 's board of directors and advisor 's has read like a Who 's
Who of all things that go BANG -- and KA - CHING .
Oh , and all things Bush too .
Former president George H.W. Bush is a Carlyle adviser , as is former British prime minister John Major who heads its European arm .
Former secretary of state James Baker is senior counselor , former White House budget chief Richard Darman is a partner , former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt is senior adviser -- the list goes on .
Carlyle has , from time to time , played the role of power - legacy incubator , as it did when asked to find a no-work job for George H. Bush 's good - for - nothing son , George W. George and Barbara Bush are close to the Rubensteins .
David , his wife and three children tagged along on an African safari with Barbara Bush .
Four years before George W. Bush 's first run for Texas Governor , Rubenstein was asked to find a soft spot for Georgie to cool his heels and earn some easy money .
Carlyle had just purchase Caterair , a company that provided food service to the airlines .
A Bush family confident came to Rubenstein and pitched young George .
" ... we were putting the board together , somebody [ Fred Malek ] came to me and said , look there is a guy who would like to be on the board .
He 's kind of down on his luck a bit .
Needs a job .
Needs a board position .
Needs some board positions .
Could you put him on the board ?
Pay him a salary and he 'll be a good board member and be a loyal vote for the management and so forth ... We put him on the board and [ he ] spent three years .
Came to all the meetings .
Told a lot of jokes .
Not that many clean ones .
" ( David Rubenstein )
( Irony alert : Fred Malek received his 15 minutes of fame in the 1970s as deputy director of CREEP ( Committee to Re-elect the President ) , the Nixon White House operation behind Watergate . )
Did Carlyle 's managers laugh at George 's jokes ?
Hard to say .
More likely they just grinned and bore it , which paid off a decade and half later :
April 2003 : Directors of one of the world ’s largest armament companies are planning on meeting in Lisbon in three weeks time .
The American based Carlyle Group is heavily involved in supplying arms to the Coalition forces fighting in the Iraqi war .
It also holds a majority of shares in the Seven Up company and Federal Data Corporation , supplier of air traffic control surveillance systems to the US Federal Aviation Authority .
The 12 billion dollar company has recently signed contracts with United Defense Industries to equip the Turkish and Saudi Arabian armies with aviation Defense systems .
Top of the meeting ’s agenda is expected to be the company ’s involvement in the rebuilding of Baghdad ’s infrastructure after the cessation of current hostilities .
Along with several other US companies , the Carlyle Group is expected to be awarded a billion dollar contract by the US Government to help in the redevelopment of airfields and urban areas destroyed by Coalition aerial bombardments .
( Full Story )
And , talk about being in on the ground floor of the " War on Terror : " On September 11 , 2001 , the day two planes crashed into the World Trade Center the Carlyle Group was hosting an investors conference at the nearby Ritz - Carlton , a conference attended by none other than Osama bin Laden 's brother .
George H. Bush attended the conference the day before and had met personally with the bin Laden kin .
No , I 'm not siding with the 9/11 conspiracy folks .
I still think they 're nuts .
I am simply making the point that when it , if it 's big , or promises to be big , the Carlyle Group makes sure it has an arm lock on good hunk of the action .
Former Secretary of State James Baker is ( of course ) a member of Carlyle 's inner circle and he bristles at the notion that the company somehow manipulates world events .
" I say that 's bullshit , and you can print it ! "
Baker snapped at a reporter .
" Somebody would say , ' well , you had one of the bin Laden brothers as an investor . '
Well , that 's exactly right , " he says , adding that the bin Ladens are one of the wealthiest families in the Middle East and have disowned Osama .
( Duh Alert : After 9/11 Rubenstein announced he had returned the bin Ladens ' $ 2 million investment . )
Rubenstein has stopped trying to deny the benefits of his company 's toady hyper - connectedness :
" We 've actually replaced the Trilateral Commission " as the darling of conspiracy theorists , " Rubenstein jokes .
( Irony alert : Rubenstein is also a member of said Trilateral Commission . )
So there we are .
The new owner of one of the most important documents in mankind 's march towards democracy has been purchased by Carlyle co-founder David Rubenstein .
His new acquisition will be housed and conserved , at taxpayer expense , at the National Archives .
Rubensteins copy of the Magna Carta is sure to continue to rise , even as the paradigm - shattering rights it was the first to enshrine into law slip , one by one , from our lives today .

I will make this brief .
This week was the fifth anniversary of one of the most disastrous endeavors in American history .
The invasion of Iraq has cost America thousands of lives , billions of dollars , and devastated any future prospects of a normalized state in Iraq for the foreseeable future ( not to mention the untold diplomatic damage such unilateral action has caused ) .
It ’s fitting that on the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq , Bush would declare “ a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror ” was achieved by the five years spent in Iraq .
It appears the Chief Executive is either delusional or myopic : the Iraq war neither combatted terrorism ( and in fact stoked more of it ) and has yet to be a victory in any sense of the word .
On the same day , poll numbers showed that Bush has also achieved the lowest approval rating of his Presidency — 31 percent — which is also among the lowest among modern presidency ’s ( lower then Clinton during impeachment , lower then Carter during the Tehran hostage crisis , and even lower than Nixon after Watergate ) .
Sources : CNN : Poll : Bush ’s popularity hits new low and BBCNews : Bush speech hails Iraq ‘ victory ’ .

Peter ponders Charlie 's peter placement
by Jeremy Hooper
If Florida governor and possible VP candidate Charlie Crist ( pic. ) is into dudes , then he owes it to Republicans to let his man-loving ways known .
Or so says our old poker buddy Peter LaBarbera , who writes the following on his Americans For Truth site :
Too many politicians with a homosexual problem are hiding this “ special interest ” from the voters ; they should run as openly homosexual Republicans ( or Democrats ) so we can avoid post-election surprises like the pathetic Gov. Jim ( ” I ’m a gay American ” ) McGreevey scandal in New Jersey .

Based on what ’s already out there , if Crist were to be chosen , it would only be a matter of days — make that hours — before there would be national political and media speculation about his “ sexual orientation . ”
You wo n’t believe the amount that ’s already been written and discussed in the media about Crist ’s sexuality and related issues in the homosexual and liberal press .
In our view , that ’s a reason right off the bat not to consider Gov. Crist for the highly visible and important position .
But the biggest reason is that Gov. Crist is weak on protecting marriage as between a man and a woman , having straddled the fence on whether and how strongly he would support the Florida Marriage Amendment that will be on the state ’s ballot this November after much hard work by pro-family forces .
So essentially Pete thinks Charlie , if gay or bisexual , should out himself just so that he can be thrown to the lions of anti-gay evangelical Christianity .
If he already thinks mere discussion of Crist 's sexuality is a dealbreaker and thinks that homosexuality is a " problem " , then it 's not as if he 's going to view a gay revelation as a refreshing change of pace for the GOP .
No , no -- he wants the possible homosexuality fully disclosed while there 's still time to find a Veep who would keep the party 's someday - to - be - remembered - as - reprehensible homophobia firmly in place for a just a wee bit longer .
And then of course a gay disclosure would also make Crist vulnerable to scrutiny from the pro-gay side , who would ( rightfully ) be upset about the hypocrisy of even CONSIDERING supporting a marriage amendment ( while he does n't outright support an amendment , he does oppose marriage equality and did sign the petition to put the amendment on the ballot ) .
So for Crist , an affirmative on his queer orientation would certainly be a bi-political orgy waiting to happen .
But as for us , we 're not going to speculate .
While you can't help but acknowledge that this speculation is plying out , digging for the facts behind one 's bedroom activity is not what we do .
And we 're certainly not going to do something bizarrely compulsive like this :
We called the Florida Governor ’s office to ask if the governor is a homosexual or bisexual , and whether he has ever engaged in homosexual behavior — odd questions , to be sure , but necessary ones in this situation .
We did not hear back .
Oh my .
What next , Peter -- fact - finding missions at the Governor 's mansion ?
Honestly , brother .
Never again can you call us obsessive !
Florida Media Speculate on Gov. Charlie Crist ’s ( Bi ? ) Sexuality [ AFT ]
Your thoughts
OH .
And MY .
And GAWD !!!!!
As a Floridian ( left four years ago , still keep up ) , I have to say the rumors have in fact been swirling for years .
Still !
At least Governor Crist probably will not be stupid enough to find a date in the loo !
Love the graphic .
Porno Pete deserves it .

I thought this was going to be a nice morning .
" Too many politicians with a homosexual problem are hiding this “ special interest ” from the voters ... "
I think i prefer tosubstitute " homosexual " with " religious " then it speaks much more to what i see as a problem with politics in this country .

LaBabera thinks like so many right - wing homophobes .
If someone is gay they do n't deserve a job ( fire them ) , they 're against God because they are against the modern , non-biblical Western notion of monagamous heterosexual marriage .
In essence , they do n't care if he 's unemployed or dead because there 's a rumor he 's gay .
There is nothing christian about that no matter how they try to spin it nor how many times they repeat it in the media .

If Crist is gay I 'd like him to come out .
But in any case , I 'm glad he supports civil unions and refuses to be an anti-gay activist ( the real reason LaBarbera does n't like him ) .
He stopped the party in Florida from funding the anti-gay marriage initiative , even if he did sign it .
I wish he were fully in favor of equality , but if all Republicans were where Charlie Crist is on the issue it would be a much better world .

Ah of course , being gay is a problem .
It explains so much .

Five years ago , the European Union sent some 1,500 soldiers to DR Congo as part of a UN mission to take action against the bandits marauding the north - eastern part of the country .
The troops were there to protect the civilians .
Now the Swedish military is saying that French soldiers tortured Congolese civilians during the operation .
The German government , which did n't send troops on the mission but provided logistical assistance , could n't confirm the accusations .
" The Foreign Ministry is not aware of the report , " a ministry spokeswoman told DW - WORLD .DE .
" We will examine the issue . "
Swedish soldiers witnessed torture
Critics have said the EU should have joined forces with the UN
According to an Internet notice posted by the Swedish military , a claim was filed in late May 2007 .
Results from an ensuing investigation indicate that it is highly probable that the torture allegations are valid .
In the notice , a lawyer representing the Swedish military said that " torture - like methods " had been implemented during the Artemis mission .
The other EU countries that participated in the operation have been informed of the scandal , claimed the military .
France led the Artemis operation in 2003 and sent the largest contingent of soldiers .
Other European countries , including Sweden , also sent troops .
According to the Swedish television news magazine Uppdrag Granskning , Swedish soldiers observed their French compatriots as they tortured a Congolese man in civilian clothes for hours , allegedly beating and strangling him .
According to the report , the episode did n't end until the Swedish soldiers went to the French commander .
Doubt cast on the necessity of mission
Germany sent troops to DR Congo in 2006
Operation Artemis is considered today to mark the beginning of Europe 's security policy , which makes the accusations all the more explosive .
It was the first mission that the EU carried out without relying on resources from NATO .
The German military , the Bundeswehr , sent supplies via Transall cargo aircraft stationed in neighboring Uganda and provided an Airbus for medical purposes .
In addition , two German soldiers were sent to work at the Artemis headquarters in France .
The operation lasted just a few months and officially ended on Sept. 1 , 2003 .
Tens of thousands of refugees returned to the city of Bunia and the EU troops succeeded in disarming the militias , the German government reported .
Critics of the operation have said that the EU could have backed up the UN peacekeeping force in DR Congo instead of sending their own troops .
" It was a field test for joint military operations , " said German EU parliamentarian Frithjof Schmidt from the Greens .
He added that he thought France just wanted to have its own troops on the scene , independent of the UN .

High energy prices that were once easily absorbed by consumers are now more likely to act as a drag on household budgets , leaving people with less money to spend elsewhere .
Gasoline prices , which for months lagged the big run-up in the price of oil , are suddenly rising quickly , with some experts fearing they could hit $ 4 a gallon by spring .
Diesel is hitting new records daily and oil closed at an all - time high on Tuesday of $ 100.88 a barrel .
The increases could not come at a worse time for the economy .
With growth slowing , high energy prices that were once easily absorbed by consumers are now more likely to act as a drag on household budgets , leaving people with less money to spend elsewhere .
These costs could exacerbate the nation ’s economic woes , piling a fresh energy shock on top of the turmoil in credit and housing .
“ The effect of high oil prices today could be the difference between having a recession and not having a recession , ” said Kenneth Rogoff , a Harvard University economist .
The depth of the nation ’s economic problems became clearer Tuesday with the release of figures showing that prices at the producer level rose 1 percent in January , driven in large measure by energy costs .
Compared with a year ago , prices were up 7.4 percent , the worst producer price inflation in the United States since 1981 .

Crazy Heather Mills Dumps Water on Lawyer 's Head ( Photos )
has really lost it .
We have seen her in rant mode on live television and in front of the courthouse after receiving $ 50 million .
The gold digging wacko showed her true stripes when she dumped a water pitcher on top of 's lawyers head .
Mills was reportedly ticked off atfor calling her names during the proceedings .
We have before and after photos of the barrister , who was looking like a drowned rat at the end of the hearing .
It must have been a sheer joy for McCartney to have others see the true essence of his demented ex-wife .
The court sketch artist captured the scene for the greater audience to enjoy .
No report on any sanctions that may have come out of the outburst .
She did look a little wild eyed when she stepped up to the microphone to spin her victory .
Now we know the reason why .
In a side note , Mills will be serving as a judge in the Miss USA pageant that will be held in Las Vegas on April 11th .

Imagine , for a moment , that you live in a small town somewhere near the Southern California coast .
You ’re going about your daily life , trying to scrape by in hard times , when the missile hits .
It might have come from the Iranian unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV )  its pilot at a base on the outskirts of Tehran  that has had the village in its sights for the last six hours or from the Russian sub stationed just off the coast .
In either case , it ’s devastating .
In Moscow and Tehran , officials announce that , in a joint action , they have launched the missile as part of a carefully coordinated “ surgical ” operation to take out a “ known terrorist , ” a long - term danger to their national security .
A Kremlin spokesman offers the following statement :
“ As we have repeatedly said , we will continue to pursue terrorist activities and their operations wherever we may find them .
We share common goals with respect to fighting terrorism .
We will continue to seek out , identify , capture , and , if necessary , kill terrorists where they plan their activities , carry out their operations , or seek safe harbor . ”
A couple in a ramshackle house just down the street from you  he ’s a carpenter ; she works at the local Dairy Queen  are killed along with their pets .
Their son is seriously wounded , their home blown to smithereens .
Neighbors passing by as the missile hits are also wounded .
As it happens , there are no terrorists in the vicinity .
Outraged , you organize your neighbors and march angrily in protest through the town , shouting anti-Russian , anti-Iranian slogans .
But , of course , there is nothing you can really do .
Iran and Russia are far away , their weaponry powerful , your arms nonexistent .
The state of California is incapable of protecting you .
This is , in fact , at least the fourth time in recent months that a “ terrorist ” has been declared “ taken out ” from the air or by a ship - based cruise missile , when only innocent Californians have died .
As news of the “ collateral damage ” from the botched operation dribbles out , the Russian and Iranian media pay next to no attention .
There are no outraged editorials .
Official spokesmen see no need to comment further .
No one is held responsible and no promises are made in either Tehran or Moscow that similar assassination strikes wo n’t be launched in the near future , based on “ actionable intelligence , ” possibly even on the same town .
In fact , the next day , seeing UAVs once again soaring overhead , you load your pickup and prepare to flee .
Swatting Flies in Somalia
Philip K. Dick , meet George W. Bush .
When it comes to such a thing happening in the United States , we are , of course , at the wildest frontiers of science fiction .
The U.S. is a sovereign nation .
We guard our air space and coastal waters jealously .
Any country violating them for purposes of aggressive action , no less by launching a missile against an American town , would be committing an act of war and would certainly be treated accordingly .
If , somehow , such an event did occur , it would be denounced in Washington and on editorial pages across the country as a shocking contravention of international legal conventions and a crime of war unless , of course , we did it in a country where sovereignty has been declared meaningless .
In fact , an almost exact replica of the above fictional incident  at least the fourth of its kind in recent months  did indeed take place at the beginning of March in the embattled failed state of Somalia .
( For that country ’s most recent abysmal collapse , the Bush administration , via an invasion by Ethiopian proxy forces , can take significant credit . )
One or two houses in Dobley , a Somali town , were hit , possibly by two submarine - launched Tomahawk Cruise missiles in what a U.S. official termed “ a deliberate strike against a suspected bed - down of known terrorists . ”
The missiles were evidently meant for Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan , an al - Qaeda suspect in the bloody bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 .
He was , however , not in Dobley , despite the “ actionable intelligence ” on hand .
Accounts of the dead and wounded in the town vary .
One report claimed only wounded Somalis ( and two dead cows ) ; most spoke of anywhere from four to 10 dead civilians .
Local district Commissioner Ali Nur Ali Dherre told CNN that three women and three children had been killed and another 20 people wounded .
While a “ U.S. military official said the United States is still collecting post - strike information and is not yet able to confirm any casualties .
He described [ the ] strike as ‘ very deliberate ’ and said forces tried to use caution to avoid hitting civilians . ”
For the dead Somalis , not surprisingly , we have no names .
In stories like this , the dead are regularly nobodies and , though the townspeople of Dobley did indeed march angrily in protest yelling anti-American slogans , just about no one noticed .
In our world , only the normal smattering of small news reports dealt with this modest sidebar in the president ’s Global War on Terror ( GWOT ) .
On the GWOT scorecard  if you remember , for a long time George Bush kept “ his own personal scorecard ” of top terror suspects in a desk drawer in the Oval Office , crossing off al - Qaeda figures as U.S. forces took them down  this operation hardly registered .
One terrorist missed , and not for the first time , possibly a few dead peasants in some godforsaken land .
Please , move on
In a recent Pentagon briefing for reporters featuring Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Adm.
Michael Mullen , who had just returned from a trip to Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan , 4,500 words of back - and - forth were interrupted by this question from a reporter :
“ Secretary Gates , the strike on Somalia two days ago  did the missiles that were fired  did they strike their target ?
And was the target Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan ?
Do you have a report back from the field ?
And Admiral Mullen , what message did you give to President Musharraf , and why did you meet with him ? ”
Gates responded to the Somali part of the question in eight words : “ You know we do n’t talk about military operations . ”
He might have added : unless they ’re successful .
That was evidently all that the incident and its minor “ collateral damage ” deserved in such a global war .
So Gates and Mullen moved on immediately .
So many matters more important than a single “ decapitation ” strike that did n’t succeed to consider .
The Decapitation Strike as Global Policy
Minor as that Somali mis-strike might seem , this is not , in fact , a small matter .
Think of that strike and the many like it around the world over these last years as reflections of George Bush ’s post - 9/11 update of globalization .
After all , the most basic principle of his Global War on Terror has been the erasure of global boundaries and whatever international agreements about war - making might go with them .
Across the Islamic world , in particular , boundaries simply no longer matter .
In fact , in such regions no aspect of sovereignty can now constrain a U.S. president from acting as he pleases in pursuit of whatever he may personally define as American interests .
“ Assassinations by air ” are , writes David Case in Mother Jones magazine , “ a relatively new tactic in warfare . ”
By the beginning of 2006 , however , U.S. Predator drones “ bearing Hellfire missiles  the preferred weapon in decapitation [ strikes ]  had already hit ‘ terrorist suspects overseas ’ at least 19 times since 9/11 . ”
Such strikes and other similar operations by air , land , and sea have been a crucial follow - on to the Bush administration ’s proclamations , immediately after 9/11 , that there would be no “ safe havens ” for terrorists on the planet , nor safety for those countries which housed them , inadvertently or otherwise .
Within days of the destruction of the World Trade Center towers , Bush administration officials were already identifying up to 60 countries - cum - targets .
This aspect of the Bush Doctrine , of what the president likes to call staying “ on the offensive , ” when mixed with a couple of decades of “ advances ” in air warfare , including the development of sophisticated , missile - armed drones , “ smart bombs , ” “ precision - guided munitions , ” and the like , has resulted in a lethal globalizing brew of assassination and destruction .
It recognizes neither boundaries nor sovereignty across much of the planet .
With all its “ actionable ” possibilities , it will surely be with us long after George W. Bush has left office .
Of course , those few nameless dead or wounded Somali civilians  swatted like so many flies and forgotten as quickly as flies would be  do n’t faintly match up against the “ dozens ” of Iraqi civilian deaths that , according to Human Rights Watch , were caused by 50 decapitation strikes launched against the top officials of Saddam Hussein ’s regime back in March 2003 .
( Not a single official was harmed . )
Nor do they quite make it into the company of the “ Afghan elders ” being taken to President Hamid Karzai ’s inauguration back in 2001 , who were mistaken “ for a Taliban group ” and bombed , with 20 killed ; nor the 30 or more guests at an Afghan wedding party back in 2002 blown away by 2,000 - pound bombs after celebratory gunfire was evidently mistaken for an attack ( no apologies offered ) ; nor that wedding party in the western desert of Iraq near the Syrian border wiped out in 2004 with 42 deaths , including 27 in one extended family , 14 children in all .
They were , of course , taken for terrorists .
( As U.S. Maj .
Gen. James Mathis put the matter in offering an explanation : “ How many people go to the middle of the desert to hold a wedding 80 miles from the nearest civilization ? ” )
And these are just a few prominent cases , not including the civilians killed in periodic Predator and other strikes in Pakistani border areas , in Afghanistan , and elsewhere whom no fuss is ever made about  not here , anyway .
After all , there ’s always going to be “ collateral damage ” when you keep your eye  and your 2,000 - pound bomb or Hellfire missile  focused on the prize .
The “ Right ” to Kill Civilians
Remember back in the 1990s , when the glories of an economically borderless world were being limned ?
Just after Sept. 11 , 2001 , the Bush administration proudly declared us to be in a far darker world without borders ( except , of course , when it came to our own ) .
In this new world , whether we knew it or not , whether we cared or not , we granted our highest officials  specifically our military and intelligence services  the full powers of prosecutor , defense counsel , judge , jury , and executioner , as well as the right to report on such events only to the extent , and as , they wished .
This was the sort of power that monotheistic religions normally granted to an all - powerful god , that kingdoms generally left to absolute rulers , and that dictators have always tried to take for themselves ( though just , of course , in the domains under their control ) .
Our domain , it seems , is now much of the globe , when it comes to the bloody work of assassinating individuals via bombs or missiles that , however precise , surgical , and smart , are weapons meant to kill en masse and largely without discrimination .
There are still limits of sorts on such actions .
These put bluntly  though no one is likely to say this - are the limits imposed , in part , by racism , by gradations , however unspoken , in the global value given to a human life .
The Bush administration has , so far , only been willing to carry out “ decapitation ” strikes in countries where human life is , by implication , of less or little value .
It has yet to carry one out in London or Hamburg or Tokyo or Moscow or the Chinese countryside , even though “ terrorist suspects ” abound everywhere , even ( as with the anthrax attacks of 2001 ) in our own country .
On the other hand , given the impetus of this kind of globalization , who knows when such a strike might come .
After all , the CIA has already carried out clearly illegal , sovereignty - violating “ extraordinary rendition ” operations ( kidnappings of terror suspects ) on the streets of European cities .
In this country , we still theoretically venerate the sovereign self ( “ the individual ” ) and that self ’s right to “ life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . ”
Despite George Bush ’s “ Freedom Agenda , ” however , the sovereignty , not to say the life , liberty , and happiness of other peoples , individually or collectively , have not really been much on our minds these last years .
Our freedom of action , our safety , has been the only freedom , the only “ security , ” to which we have attached much global value .
And do n’t for a second think that , when the “ actionable intelligence ” comes in to John McCain ’s , Hillary Clinton ’s , or Barack Obama ’s Oval Office , those Predators wo n’t be soaring or those cruise missiles leaving subs lurking off some coast  and that innocent civilians elsewhere wo n’t continue to die .
In places like Somalia , we deliver death , and every now and then an American bomb or missile actually obliterates a terrorist suspect .
Then we celebrate .
The rest of time , it ’s hardly even news .
When the deeper principle behind such global strikes is mentioned in our papers , in some passing paragraph , it ’s done  as in a recent Washington Post article about a Predator strike , piloted from Nevada , that killed a suspected “ senior al - Qaeda commander ” in Pakistan  in this polite way : “ Independent actions by U.S. military forces on another country ’s sovereign territory are always controversial ” ( Imagine the language that the Washington Post would use if that had been a Pakistani drone strike in Utah . )
This version of globalization is already so much the norm of our world that few here even blink an eye when it ’s reported , or consider it even slightly strange .
It ’s already an American right .
In the meantime , other people , who obviously do n’t rise to the level of our humanity , regularly die .
And here ’s the thing :
In our world , there is a chasm that can never be breached between , say , a Sunni extremist clothed in a suicide vest who walks into a market in Baghdad with the barbaric intent of killing as many Shi’ite civilians as possible , and an air or missile attack , done in the name of American “ security ” and aimed at a “ known terrorist , ” that just happens to  repeatedly  kill innocent civilians .
And yet , what if you know before you launch your attack , as American planners certainly must , that the odds are innocents ( and probably no one else ) will die ?
Not so long ago in the United States , presidentially sanctioned assassinations abroad were illegal .
But that was then , this is so now .
Nonetheless , it ’s a fact that the “ right ” to missile , bomb , shell , “ decapitate , ” or assassinate those we declare to be our enemies , without regard to borders or sovereignty , is based on nothing more than the power to do it .
This is simply the “ right ” of force ( and of technology ) .
If the tables were turned , any American would recognize such acts for the barbarism they represent .
And yet , late last week , like clockwork , the Associated Press brought us the latest notice : “ In Afghanistan , a spokesman for the American - led coalition said troops had used ‘ precision - guided munitions ’ to strike a compound about a mile inside Pakistan . ”
This operation was , as they all are , said to be based on “ reliable intelligence ” ; in this case , “ senior ” Taliban commanders were said to be in residence .
As it happened , according to the Pakistani military and the AP reporter who made it to Tangrai , a village of about 40 houses , the residence hit was that of “ Noor Khan , a greengrocer who said the house was his family home . ”
The AP reporter added that “ only one of its four walls was standing amid a tangle of mud bricks , bedding , and cooking pots . ”
And Noor Khan , who was quoted saying , “ We are innocent , we have nothing to do with such things , ” claimed that six of his relatives , four women and two boys , had been killed .
( The Pakistani military , on investigating , reported that two women and two children had died . )
This was but the latest minor decapitation strike , and  we can be sure of this  not the last .
Philip K. Dick , move over .
We ’re already in your future .

Spokesman : Taiwan has no right to " recognize " Kosovo´s independence
Source : Xinhua | 02-19-2008 09:00
BEIJING , Feb. 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Taiwan has no right and qualification to recognize Kosovo 's independence , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said here Monday .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao
( File Photo )
" It is known to all that Taiwan , as a part of China , has no right and qualification at all to make the so - called recognition , " Liu Jianchao said in a press release .
Liu made the remarks in response to the report that Taiwan authorities congratulated on Kosovo 's independence and might recognize it .
There is only one China in the world .
The commonly accepted consensus is that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory and the government of the People 's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of China , said Liu .
" We firmly oppose to anyone or any organization under any form to split Taiwan from the mainland .
Any attempts that separates Taiwan from the mainland is doomed to fail , " Liu said .
Kosovo 's parliament voted Sunday to adopt a declaration of independence at an extraordinary session on its independence from Serbia .

Kosovo was a southern autonomous province within Serbia before the breakup of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
Among its population of 2 million , over 90 percent are ethnic Albanians and Serbs make up about 7 percent .
Kosovo has been under UN administration since mid-1999 , after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces from the province .

Famed microbiologist Carl Woese has a unique suggestion for teaching evolution to schoolchildren : do n't do it .
I recently talked to Woese , best known for rearranging the organismal kingdom from five branches to three , while reporting on an upcoming story about the union of complexity theory and evolutionary biology .
For decades
Woese has argued – and many other scientists agree – that genetic mutations and natural selection do n't provide a complete explanation for Earthly life .
He believes these mechanisms to be part of a grander phenomenon of evolution , in which jumps of extraordinary complexity – from single - celled to multicellular organisms , from organism to ecosystem – are non-linear emergent phenomena , a function of networked interactions obeying a variant on the second law of thermodynamics .
I asked Woese what he thought about the situation in Florida , where an evolution - heavy state curriculum was attacked by religious conservatives trying to balance classroom evolution with " alternatives . "
These alternatives are generally creationist , and Woese is caught in the middle : he has no sympathy for religion masquerading as science , but mainstream evolutionary thought has little room for him .
Said Woese ,
My feeling is that evolution should n't be taught at the lower grades .
You do n't teach quantum mechanics in the grade schools .
One has to be quite educated to work with these concepts ; what they pass on as evolution in high schools is nothing but repetitious tripe that teeachers do n't understand .
I certainly do n't want any intrusion of religious ideas in the name of science – but I do n't want this bland soup that 's taught as evolution in the name of science , either .
It 's not science – it 's catechism .
Let 's hold off until college , then hire some teachers who really know what to teach them .
You have to go to the higest levels to find people with an understanding .
That whole setup is n't there at all ; all that 's there is teaching the same old pap for 150 years , modfied by neo -Darwinists but not in an useful way .
But what if a parent says that neo -Darwinian evolution still explains , for example , the primate family tree ?
I do n't know , when you put it that way ... you 'd have to teach this stuff with the understanding that these are just the facts we can learn , and they do n't have a religious explanation .
[ Mainstream neo- Darwinian evolution ] does n't begin to talk about the evolution of the brain , and I think that 's what the whole difference is .
Man is working now on a higher level of organization than you can get form any other biological organization on the planet , and it does n't do you a damn bit of good to say that the complex brain was a product of natural selection .
It just does n't help you .

New Biology for a New Century , " published in 2004 in Microbiology and
Molecular Biology Reviews .

Whether you ’re looking for a child ’s laptop , or just want a cheap piece of hardware to play with , the sub -$ 300 laptop category has a lot to offer .
With a field full of open source plaforms and rugged designs , you ’re sure to find something you ’ll like .
Here we ’ll take a look at 5 of the best .
Classmate PC : Intel ’s Classmate PC is an education - centric subnotebook designed for children in the developing world .
Although it does n’t have the cute factor that the OLPC XO has , it seems to be more sturdy .
This machine is designed to be used on the move , as it comes fully equipped with a handle and leather case for transporting from school to home .
Some of the drawbacks include limited hard - drive space of 2GB , and a low screen resolution that ’s to be expected with laptops of this size .
It ’s reported that the hardware can run on either Windows or Linux , and storage is handled by flash memory , making this a very flexible machine .
OLPC XO : The OLPC is the flagship of subnotebooks , with a glowing review from David Pogue and just about everyone else .
People , especially children , seem to just love this little laptop , not just because of its low price , but for its innovation .
Designed for children in poor countries , the OLPC is an efficient , stripped - down version of the laptops most people use , with a Linux operating system , no CD / DVD drive , hard drive , or bloatware , and interesting power methods .
Perhaps the most appealing part of this machine is its look , with shiny green and white plastic and toylike antennas .
Plus , the screen boasts one of the brightest and clearest resolutions , and is easy to view even in the sunlight .
However , it is not without its problems , primarily its slow processing , and an unclear battery capacity .
This laptop is best reserved for the children it was designed for , or those who want to tinker around with an innovative machine .
Elonex ONE : Soon , the subnotebook industry will have a new kid in town , called the Elonex One .
The $ 195 device will be unveiled at The Education Show in Birmingham .
It ’s aimed at consumers , but they ’ll donate a machine to an underprivileged child for each 100 that are sold .
The One ’s main appeal is price , but that ’s not all it has to offer .
Its battery life clocks in at 3 hours , and it has a flash - based hard drive .
Like its competitors , it has a rugged case to facilitate mobile use .
The hardware runs Linux , a choice made both for financial and political reasons .
The One is not much to look at , with retro-IBM stylings , but current buzz suggests that it will be one to watch .
Zonbu : Zonbu presents a low - cost Windows alternative , with a custom operating system that offers built - in programs like Open Office and the Banshee music player .
It ’s definitely a lot larger than its competitors , coming in with a 15.4 inch widescreen , 60 GB hard drive , and a CD - RW / DVD drive .
It offers quiet operation , an easy wireless connection , and pretty flawless operation right out of the box .
One drawback of the Zonbu is that you have to buy a monthly plan , or buy the device for much more than $ 279 .
However , this notebook offers a very positive user experience overall , and ongoing support that makes it easier to use than any of its competitors .
Asus Eee PC 2G Surf : The Asus Eee PC 2G Surf is the little sister of the Asus Eee PC with a price to match , coming in just under $ 300 .
It offers ease of use in a tiny package .
It ’s just a bit larger than a DVD case , so it ’s easy to take out just about anywhere .
Just like its brethren , this notebook is durable , although perhaps not as rugged as the OLPC or Classmate .
Some reviewers found the device to be a but sluggish , most likely due to its lowered caching ability .
This notebook is seemingly designed with road warriors in mind , offering a microphone , speakers , and pre-installed Skype software .
You can even upgrade to get a webcam .
Battery life is not as impressive as others , clocking in at about 2 hours .
One major drawback is that this fairly limited device has a soldered - on back , so upgrading would be difficult .
It is , however , visually appealing with a variety of pastel colors .
Overall , it ’s a neat little device , but you ’d probably do better going with the larger 4G or 8G version .
In the sub -$ 300 category , you ’ll definitely get what you pay for , but that ’s not to say that it wo n’t be enough .
Armed with efficiency , open source software , and durable design , these devices have a lot to offer .
Children , road warriors , and curious gadget freaks would love any one of these laptops .

It looks like the kind of rubbish that piles up on waste ground or adorns hedgerows .
But this collection of plastic bags was found in a far more disturbing place - the stomach of a minke whale washed up from the English Channel .
The young female suffered an appalling death , starved , exhausted and in agonising pain .
The discovery in 2002 was a wake - up call for marine scientists , who realised that plastic bags and other waste were one of the biggest threats to the whales , dolphins and turtles swimming around our shores .
Scroll down for more ...
Hard to stomach : Scientists were shocked to discover this rubbish inside the gut of a dead minke whale in 2002
The minke was found on the Normandy coast .
At first , it was assumed she had died of natural causes .
When her stomach was cut open , scientists were amazed to find nearly two pounds of plastic bags , eaten by mistake as she searched for food .
The 2lb haul included two plastic bags from English supermarkets , seven transparent plastic bags , and fragments from seven dustbin bags .
In an ironic twist , one of the bags found in the gut of the dead whale appears to read : " We support good farm animal welfare . "
Most worrying of all , there was no proper food in her stomach .
Minkes are among the smallest of the whales and the fastest moving .
They can be seen swimming off the coasts of Scotland , Ireland and the South West .
The females are around 24ft long and weigh between five and ten tons .
They can live for up to 60 years .
Although minkes are not threatened with immediate extinction , whale campaigners are concerned about their numbers .
There are thought to be fewer than 184,000 left in the Atlantic .
Until the 1980s their biggest danger was hunters from Japan , Norway and Iceland .
But another major threat has
emerged in the plastic debris and rubbish in the seas .
Minkes feed by sieving huge amounts of water through plates in their mouths .
The technique is supposed to catch small fish .
But as the seas get more polluted , the whales are also swallowing more rubbish .
The plastic can block their digestive tracts , causing serious internal damage .
If the creatures consume enough bags , their stomachs become full , they stop eating and they starve .
A spokesman for the Marine Conservation Society said the Normandy minke had shocked the scientific world .
" It is an appalling amount of plastic to find in one female whale , " he said .
" It brings home what happens if we allow plastics into the marine environment . "

There are several categories of camera gear available : there 's the sensible , the desirable and then there 's the stuff that you 'd never even imagined .
Here 's a selection of equipment that most definitely belongs in the latter category .
Sigma APO 200-500 F/2.8
Image : Sigma
Perhaps the most " sensible " of the items presented in this list , this is nevertheless one of the heftiest tele zoom lenses for SLR cameras around .
While the zoom range of 200 - 500 mm is nothing new or exciting , it 's the maximum aperture of an incredible f/2.8 throughout the focal range that makes this such a special lens .
While a lot of tele lenses have a distinct cannon barrel look , Sigma have apparently done all they can to enhance that trait , giving the lens a leafy green finish .
The end result is an extremely fast tele zoom lens that could easily be confused with a surface - to - air missile launcher .
Zeiss Apo Sonnar T* 1700 mm F4
Image : Zeiss
For people who have been into photography for a while , the name Carl Zeiss means top of the line optical quality , usually with a matching price tag .
While continuing to produce their top - of - the - line optics for various camera systems , Zeiss have more recently also begun cooperating with Nokia and Sony , making optics for their mobile phones and digital cameras .
Two years ago , the company presented a remarkable one - off tele lens , reportedly custom built for a wealthy Qatari .
Weighing in at 256 kilos , it 's is a 1700 mm f/ 4 lens designed for medium format ( which roughly equals 750 mm in 35 mm SLR format ) .
The monster bears more than a fleeting resemblance to a jet engine ; given the size the ' super tele lens ' labeling on the side seems a little superfluous – it is n't very likely that it would be mistaken for an average 70 - 200 mm , after all .
The little black lump at the end is your average 6x6 medium format camera , in itself a quite bulky piece of equipment , but completely dwarfed by the Zeiss lens .
Upon it 's unveiling , it was said to be the largest non-military tele lens in the world .
One wonders what the largest military tele lens might look like .
Drawing from their experience in manufacturing large telescopes and instruments for astronomical sciences , Zeiss had to develop an entirely new focussing system , Due to the massive size of the glass elements , the lens had to be equipped with extremely powerful focussing motors , capable of moving all that heavy glass around .
The rear end of the lens has a dedicated LCD monitor built in to display focussing distance , aperture etc .
No price has been published , but Zeiss hinted at a price of at least several million Euros .
The intended use for the lens is reportedly " antelope photography " .
This does n't immediately strike one as the kind of kit you want to bring along on a safari to photograh fast moving and easily startled animals – hiding in the bushes is certainly off the agenda – but the uncompromising construction is said to allow the lens to autofocus as fast as a ' regular ' telephoto lens .
Polaroid 20x24 '' Camera
Image : Joyce Vanman / www.mammothcamera.com
The average film camera has for the last 50 years used either 120 rollfilm or so - called 135 film , 135 being by far the most commonly used type .
Each frame of 135 film is 36x24 milimeters , while the average consumer dSLR camera today has a sensor size of approximately 60 % of this , around 23x15 milimeters .
The sensors in digital compacts are much smaller still .
Within this tiny space , the camera and its lens has to compress the vast amount of detail visible to the human eye .
The resulting replications of reality are far from perfect , they can't be .
One way of partially overcoming this problem is quite simply to use larger film formats or digital sensors .
Within the digital realm , the 48x36 mm sensor size available in certain medium format digital backs is pretty much as large as it gets without substantial R&D resources ( like what a major corporation , national government or army might have at their disposal ) .
In film , things are a bit simpler .
While constructing huge digital sensors is a challenging task , creating a huge sheet of film or photographic paper is really – simply put – just a matter of making it bigger than usual , and building a camera large enough to house it .
The biggest ' instant ' camera I know of is Polaroid 's 20x24 '' behemot .
It 's 1.5 meters tall and weighs in at 106 kilos .
The Polaroid paper sheets used in this camera is , as the name implies , 20 x 24 ' ' , which equals 50x60 cm. Keeping in mind that the aforementioned 135 film is a mere 3.6 x 2.4 cm , it 's easy to see why such a larger - than - life camera would be capable of producing prints of far superior detail compared to smaller formats .
A number of these cameras are available for hire , complete with a dedicated studio space , in San Fransisco , New York and Prague .
Following Polaroid 's recent announcement that they will completely cease the production of their signature instant film , there is a certain risk that these cameras will be destined for the museum soon .

Seitz 6x17 '' digital panoramic camera
Image : Seitz
Instead of the common digital camera sensor which records the entire scene at once , the Seitz 6x17 '' uses a scanner to literally scan the view through the lens .
The end result is 160 megapixel images in a panoramic format .
It does the job a bit faster than your average flatbed scanner though , recording a full - sized frame ( 21 250 x 7500 pixels ) in two seconds .
It 's big , it 's heavy ( 5 kilos if you wish to use it outside a studio ) and quite silly , but it turns out huge , amazing photos – and it should , costing as it does $ 42 000 .
Hasselblad H3DII
Image : Hasselblad
Swedish camera manufacturer Hasselblad ( or " ' blad " as they are often called ) has for a long time been ranked among the very best when it comes to cameras .
Indeed , NASA 's space programme chose Hasselblad as their camera provider , and three Hasseblads where carried aboard the Apollo 11 mission , perhaps the company 's most famous feat .
Priced at around $ 40 000 , a Hasselblad H3DII with a 39 megapixel backpiece is one of the most expensive photo kits available in ordinairy retail sale .
It 's fairly large , fabulously expensive and capable of creating huge , extremely detailed image files with its 39 megapixel , 48x36 mm sensor .
For photographing your cat , you can probably make do without this camera , but if you 're shooting supermodels for Vogue , you might just need a camera of this caliber .
If you ever watch TV shows like " Top Model " , there 's a fair chance you 'll see a ' blad involved in a shoot every now and then .
Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM
Image : Robert
While the 1700 mm lens mentioned earlier is all fine and dandy if you 've got a truck to mount it onto , some may prefer a more lightweight , nimble sollution .
Weighing a mere 16.5 kilos and being only 83 centimeters long ( without the bucket - like hood ) , this delicate little flower will nevertheless magnify faraway objects ( or perhaps more relevant , faraway people ) to a degree that will leave little to the imagination .
To my knowledge , this is the longest focal length available to autofocus SLR cameras without using any extra magnifiers .
Due to its size , limited area of use and robust price tag , it has only been available from Canon built to order , and to date they have apparently produced fewer than 20 samples of this lens .
The company recently announced that they would be slashing the 1200 mm from their catalogue , so if you want one , better be quick about it .
The suggested price of the lens upon unveiling in 1993 , converted to present day money puts it at apx .
$ 120 000 , or the cost of " a small sports car " which is the most common price comparison given for the lens .

The Gigapxl Project
Launched by physicist Graham Flint , the Gigapxl Project set about creating a camera system that would allow the creation of photos with billions of pixels ( or thousands of megapixels if you like ) .
The Gigapxl Project employs a large format camera with 9x18 '' film sheets to shoot big panorama photos of places of interest , primarily in the USA .
The film sheets are then scanned using a highly sophisticated technique , resulting in digital files that contain the equivalent resolution of several gigapixels .
Though the original aim was to reach a single gigapixel ( 1000 megapixels ) , the project website now claims it is able to create images with a resolution of aproximately 6 gigapixels .
Nowadays , camera manufactureres like to stick very dense sensors into tiny consumer cameras with mediocre optics , which results in images that despite the 12 or 14 megapixel resolution are n't really any better than 4 megapixels .
It 's a way of cheating customers who do n't know much about digital photography as most people seem to think that more megapixels equals better photos , which is a truth with great limitations .
It would be easy to think that the Gigapxl Project is much the same , just a whole lot of pixels wasted on creating huge digital files that contain little in terms of actual details .
However , at the project website , it 's made very clear that the technology and knowledge put into these photos means that the 2 , 4 or 6 gigapixel photos they produce are in fact as detailed as their pixel size suggests .
But why take my word for it ?
Check out the amazing images in their gallery for an idea of what I 'm talking about !

Cameratruck
Image : Cameratruck
A pinhole camera is perhaps the simplest kind of camera there is .
You make a tiny hole in an otherwise light - sealed container , but in a sheet of film or other photo - sensitive media , point it towards what you want to photograph and let light pass through the hole for a set period of time .
The reflected light will , just like the light reflected through the lens of an ordinairy camera result in a photo , be it through a digital sensor or on a piece of film .
Pretty much any container can be made into a pinhole camera ; the more outlandish the better – the Pringles Cam , Spam Cam and Trashcan Cam are just a few examles I 've seen .
But it could also be built out of a box truck , which is exactly what an inventive bunch of spaniards and americans did .
By drilling a hole in its side and attaching huge sheets of photographic paper ( 100x30 cm ) to the inside of a truck , they created a huge mobile pinhole camera .

" The Great Picture "
The photographic canvas of " The Great Picture " Image : The Legacy Project
But why stop at a truck , when you could convert an entire airplane hangar into a pinhole camera ?
While the Cameratruck above is touted as the world 's largest mobile camera , this hangar is certified by the Guinness Book of Records as the largest camera in existance , albeit immobile .
It 's basically an old hangar building at the disused El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in Southern California , which has been made light tight to ensure no light gets in except through the little pinhole in one of the hangar 's sides .
To create the image alluringly described as " The Great Picture " , a huge sheet of made - to - order canvas was suspended inside the hangar and coated in 80 litres of Liquid Light , making it photosensitive .
The exposure time of the world 's largest camera was set to aproximately 35 minutes , after which the canvas was chemically developed ( in a pool of 2300 litres of developer – photography at this scale does not come cheap ! ) into the world 's largest photo , 313 square meters ( 3375 square feet ) in size .
Compare that to a standard 135 film frame , which you might remember from earlier on in the article is 36x24 milimeters , equalling 8.64 square centimeters , or 0.00864 square meters .

Tracy Morgan : ' Black is the new President , Bitch ! '

In light of Geraldine Ferraro 's controversial comment expressing her opinion that White House hopeful Barack Obama 's race is playing a significant role in his success , former Saturday Night Live cast member Tracy Morgan appeared on the show 's weekend update segment to offer his views on Obama and race .
Countering Tina Fey 's earlier pro-Clinton pronouncement that " Bitch is the new black , " Morgan said , " Bitch may be the new black , but black is the new president , bitch . "
The comment , which was said in jest , came at the end of a longer monologue by Morgan , during which he defended Obama and asked " Why is it every time a black man in this country gets too good at something , someone always comes along and reminds us that he 's black ? "
Morgan explained his theory as to why that may be , saying , " It 's a little complicated , but basically it goes like this :
We are a racist country .
The end . "
He went on to discuss Clinton 's 3 AM phone call ad , saying , " Barack knows how to answer that phone .
He 's not going answer it , like , ' Hello .
I 'm scared .
What 's going on ? '
He 's going to answer it like I would get a phone call at 3:00 in the morning .
Yeah !
who 's this ?
Better be good or I 'm coming down there and put something in a wheelchair ! "
On the recent controversy regarding past statements made by Obama 's pastor , Morgan quipped , " Barack 's got to stay away from this pastor , because he 's too black !
But look , just because he knows the dude , does n't mean he thinks like him .
Just because I got a friend that goes to the strip club , does n't mean I 'm going go to the strip club . "
Saturday Night Live has been the topic of discussion recently due to segments they 've done that seemed to some to be overtly pro-Clinton .
The Raw Story recently looked at these skits , as well as the financial contributions writers and producers of the show have made to different candidates .
Tracy Morgan 's comments can be seen in their entirety in the video below :
Transcript via closed captions :: this week the issue of race once again became the focal point for the democratic presidential candidates .
hillary clinton 's longtime adviser geraldine ferraro said if barack obama was white man he would n't fb kniss position in a woman , would n't be in this position .
he happens to be very lucky to be who he is .
here to comment a good friend of ours , tracy morgan .

first , it was tiger .
then donovan mcnabb .
then me !
[ laughter ] now barack .
i've got a theory about that .
it 's a little complicated , but basically it goes like this .
we are a racist country .
the end .
[ laughter ] maybe not the people in this room .
but if it's not a racist country , then why did n't , like , everybody in texas and ohio go crazy when they thought that a black man could n't answer the phone at 3:00 in the morning ?
[ laughter ] let me tell you something -- barack know how to answer that phone .
[ laughter ] he 's not going answer it , like , " hello . i'm scared .
what 's going on ? " he 's going to answer it like i would get a phone call at 3:00 in the morning .
yeah !
who 's this ?
better be good or i'm coming down there and put something in a wheelchair !
[ laughter ] some things just have to change , seth .
people are saying he 's not a fighter .
let me tell you something , he is gangster .
he 's from chicago ! [ laughter ] barack is not just winning because he 's a black man .
if that was the case , i would be winning , and i'm way blacker than him !
i can smoke newports and drink olde english .
[ laughter and applause ] i grew up on government cheese .
[ laughter ] i prefer it !
now there 's all this stuff and talk about the pastor .
barack got to stay away from this pastor , because he 's too black .
[ laughter ] but just because he knows it , look , just because i got a friend that goes to the strip club , does n't mean i'm going go to the strip club . :: but you do go to the strip clubs . :: yeah , but i go for the girls .
i'm not going to go just because my friend is going .
[ laughter ] i got the integrity .
[ laughter ] barack is qualified .
personally , i want to know what qualifies hillary clinton to be president ?
is it because she was married to the president ?
if that were true , then robin givens would be heavyweight champion of the world .
[ laughter and applause ] if hillary 's last name was n't " clinton , " you know -- she 'd just be some crazy white woman with too much money and not enough lovin ' .
[ laughter ] that 's where i come in .
[ laughter and applause ] i know women like that .
you do n't want them answering the phone at 3:00 in the morning .
[ laughter ] this , in conclusion -- three weeks ago , my friend , a tina fay , she came on the show and she declared that bitch was the new black .
right ?
you know i love you , tina fey .
you are a first - class bitch .
[ laughter ] i have something to say .
bitch may be the new black , but black is the new president , bitch ! [ laughter ] [ cheers and applause ] :: tracy morgan , everybody ! [ cheers and applause ] :: thank you , tracy .

While we think this is a really poor way to deal with all the shit that 's going on , we have been there many , many times , and survived .

* John Kennedy at Global Voices confirms the YouTube block :
As Tibet transitioned into total lockdown and videos of the violent situation proliferated on YouTube , people began noticing Saturday afternoon in China that the video - sharing website could not be accessed .
Tech blogger Rick Martin on the CNET Asia Little Red Blog has done some tests which confirm what many have assumed :
* Rebecca McKinnon at Global Voices has an excellent roundup of reactions in the Chinese blogosphere :
For those living in the West who did n't realize that there 's little sympathy for Tibet independence among ethnic Chinese in the PRC , this blog post on Global Voices will be a shocker .
John Kennedy has translated chatter from Chinese blogs and chatrooms that generally runs along the lines of : those ungrateful minorities , we give them modern conveniences and look how they thank us … where have we heard this before ?
Reuters has a roundup on the Washington Post that begins : " a look at Chinese blogs reveals a vitriolic outpouring of anger and nationalism directed against Tibetans and the West . " ( …) " Davesgonechina " at the Tenement Palm blog has been translating the chatter coming from Chinese netizens on Fanfou and Jiwai – Chinese versions of Twitter .

Dave has done more than translate : he points out that this Tibet situation is a real challenge to all people who believe that the Internet can help foster free speech and bring about better global understanding .
Here is his challenge to all of us …
* On Friday , protest in the Tibetan capital , Lhasa , erupted into violence when police , army troops , and ethnic Tibetan demonstrators clashed .
Some accounts place the death toll at 30 , some at 100 , some at 300 .
It 's hard to separate rumor from truthful first - hand account , and hard to know exactly how many have been killed or injured , because communication in the region is so difficult .
Foreign journalists are not allowed in , unaccompanied by official escorts .
Internet and phone communications are routinely blocked by Chinese authorities when unrest occurs ; some blogging tourists in Lhasa wanting to upload photos of what they witnessed have reported the presence of authorities inside ' net cafes .
Pro-Tibetan - sovereignty sites like TCHRD , SFT , and Phayul are posting first - person accounts online .
Some of those reports are difficult to independently confirm , given the circumstances .
The website of the Central Tibetan Administration ( part of the government in exile , led by the Dalai Lama , based in India ) posts this update .
* The unrest spread this weekend to regions outside Lhasa : police and protesters also clashed in China 's Sichuan and Qinghai provinces , and Gansu province , all of which have large ethnic Tibetan populations .
On Saturday …
Demonstrations erupted for the second consecutive day in the city of Xiahe in Gansu Province , where an estimated 4,000 Tibetans gathered near the Labrang Monastery .
Local monks had held a smaller protest on Friday , but the confrontation escalated Saturday afternoon , according to witnesses and Tibetans in India who spoke with protesters by telephone .
Residents in Xiahe , reached by telephone , heard loud noises similar to gunshots or explosions .
A waitress described the scene as " chaos " and said many injured people had been sent to a local hospital .
* China 's government has declared a " people 's war " against the Tibetan independence movement , in " propaganda and security " measures , and has implemented what amounts to martial law in Lhasa .
" Fight a people 's war to oppose separatism and protect stability … expose and condemn the malicious actions of these forces and expose the hideous face of the Dalai clique to broad daylight , " senior regional and security officials announced after a meeting , according to the official Tibet Daily on Sunday .
* China 's governor in Tibet promises harsh consequences for protest participants who do not turn themselves in by Tuesday .
* Speaking to reporters today in Dharamsala , India , the home of the Tibetan Government in Exile , the Dalai Lama called for an international inquiry into the current human rights conditions in Tibet .
" Whether intentionally or unintentionally , some kind of cultural genocide is taking place , " said the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader .
He was referring to China 's policy of encouraging the ethnic Han majority to migrate to Tibet , restrictions on Buddhist temples and re-education programs for monks .
* George Bush removed China from a human rights blacklist just three days before the bloodshed in Lhasa .
UPDATE : Boing Boing reader Adam writes ,
I am visiting Beijing on business , and staying at a hotel that caters
to Westerners .
There have been reports that China was loosening
controls on the media ahead of the Olympic games , in order to give
visitors the impression that the media is unrestricted , but that is
not the case in the last day .
While watching CNN in my hotel room , the station goes dark during the
top - of - the - hour news flash on the riots , then returns when the
synopsis of " what 's to come " is given about other stories , and then
goes dark again while the coverage switches to Lhasa .
Coverage returns with the anchor asking users to send in their
first - hand reports to ireport.com , after all mention of the incident
is over .
Same results for BBC as well .
The China Daily newspaper I grabbed from the lounge has a small
article on the bottom of the front page , titled " Dalai Lama behind
sabotage " , and states that his " clique " has " organized , premeditated ,
and masterminded " the beatings , looting , and arson , which " has aroused
the indignation of , and is strongly condemned by , the people of all
ethnic groups in Tibet . "
* Reports estimate that 20,000 Chinese troops have now been deployed to Lhasa ( thanks , Christal ) .

Two weeks ago , while all eyes were focused on the case of international arms dealer Viktor Bout , I spent about five hours at the Moscow City Court watching the appeal case of another accused arms smuggler , Yair Klein .
Known as Israel 's most famous arms smuggler , Klein has been fighting extradition to colombia , where he was tried in absentia in 2001 and sentenced to a 10 - year prison term .
Klein was arrested in Moscow last August on an Interpol warrant as he boarded a plane to Tel Aviv .
Now he stood just one court decision away from being shipped off in cuffs to Bogota , where he ’d rot away in some mosquito - swarmed dungeon .
Given the international profile of the case , and the brouhaha involving Bout , there were surprisingly few reporters present at Klein ’s appeal hearing .
Other than a ponytailed colombian journalist and two female staffers from the colombian embassy , I had the pews all to myself as Klein was brought in to the courtroom , shackled and under guard .
The Israeli ’s 64 years showed in the splotches on his bald head and hands , but you would never guess his age by his muscle mass index .
His solid beefy build was visible even through his baggy sweater and cargo pants .
After six months in a Russian jail , he was still built to harm , and he seemed in good spirits , smiling and joking with the young female interpreter brought in at his own expense .
Klein is no Viktor Bout , but he is one of the better - known figures in the shadowy world of international arms dealers .
Over the course of his career , Klein has equipped and trained some of the most notorious paramilitary outfits out there — from Nicaraguan death squads to the child armies of Sierra Leone .
And he ’s never been shy about it .
Klein has openly explained his activities in pretty much every media format : articles , radio programs , TV interviews , documentaries , and self - made promotional videos .
Klein and his merry band of Israeli mercenaries even appeared in a 1989 PBS documentary boasting of their activities in Central America , including working with the Nicaraguan Contras , a CIA creation that was known primarily for massacre - and - run operations in poor defenseless villages .
I first became aware of Klein ’s case in December 2007 , when I received a call from Mordechai Tzivin , Klein 's Israeli lawyer , asking me to meet him at the kosher restaurant inside Moscow 's Bolshaya Bronnaya synagogue .
He phoned me because I occasionally write for Ma’ariv , Israel ’s second - largest circulation daily , so he figured I might be useful in raising his client ’s profile .
I met Tzivin for dinner in a corner table , where he explained the case to me in between taking calls on his two cell phones , barking the whole time in English , Hebrew , and broken Russian , depending on which phone he was shouting into .
During our conversation , Tzivin boasted of his long and deep connections in Russia dating back to the Yeltsin years , when he managed to get a couple of Israelis off the hook for illicit diamond exports ( one of them was pardoned personally by Yeltsin ) .
He cursed the Israeli government for not doing enough to help his client .
" They are abandoning a decorated war hero , " Tzivin complained .
" Israel never does this !
There is something going on behind the scenes . "
He was sure that some kind of deal had been cut , something funny was going on .
But what ?
* * * Yair Klein was born in British - occupied Palestine in 1943 , the son of hardcore Zionist settlers .
He is a member of the Ariel Sharon Generation , a tough Jewish warrior mofo .
A veteran of the IDF ’s special forces , Klein fought in the Six Day War , the Yom Kippur War , and was part of the 1972 team that rescued dozens of hostages held captive in a Libyan plane at Lod airport in Tel Aviv .
Klein entered the mercenary business in the early 80s , when he founded a private security firm called Spearhead .
The timing was perfect .
Israel soon invaded south Lebanon and Spearhead landed its first major contract training and supplying basic army gear to the Phalangists , the notorious Lebanese Christian militia responsible for shooting up the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps .
The attack left hundreds of Palestinians dead and tarnished Israel ’s reputation around the world .
According to a 2007 interview Klein gave on colombian TV , his infant firm made $ 2 million from that deal alone .
He was off and running .

The trust is cutting 600 jobs as part of its cost savings
Medical director Dr Ian Holland said the bird had died on the roof , which was not an area covered by regular maintenance checks .
He stressed there was no health risk to patients or babies at any time .
" Living at the seaside , seagulls are a part of our lives , but this was entirely unforeseeable , " he added .
However , the hospital denied that the incident was linked to cuts in its maintenance budget as the debt - laden Scarborough and North East Yorkshire NHS Trust tries to save £ 15 m .
Unfortunately this led to there being larvae in the roof cavity , a few of which found their way through the ceiling fittings
Dr Ian Holland , medical director
A trust spokeswoman said : " This incident does not relate to everyday maintenance as the roof space is not part of our standard checks .
" There is no link between the ongoing cost savings and the level of maintenance . "
Dr Holland said : " It appears that a seagull died on the tiled roof above the maternity department .
" Unfortunately this led to there being larvae in the roof cavity , a few of which found their way through the ceiling fittings .
Specialist equipment
" As soon as we became aware of this , we took immediate action , bringing in specialist equipment to remove the dead bird from the tiles and cleaning out the roof cavity . "
Dr Holland said all affected areas had been cleaned thoroughly and were now back to normal .
" I 'd like to thank staff for their prompt actions and hard work and apologise to mums and families for any inconvenience , " he said .
" It 's been an example of how everyone in the NHS has to cope with whatever situation arises , and everyone has done a marvellous job to take such an unexpected incident in their stride . "
No -one from the hospital unions was available for comment on Saturday .
Agi says music is just a " tool to sell things " in China
The huge numbers of pirated CDs and high levels of illegal downloading are forcing Chinese pop stars to find alternative ways to make a living , as a Beijing - based BBC reporter finds out .
Agi knows her music carries a different price tag in the UK than in China .
The singer made about $ 2000 ( £ 1,000 ) a month from music royalties and live shows with her band Mika Bomb when she lived in London .
But in China , her band Long Kuan Jiu Duan can almost double that by singing just one song at a commercial gig .
At these gigs , artists get paid a set amount by companies or promoters regardless of how many tickets they sell .
With no royalties , pirated CDs and illegal downloading , this is one of the ways bands have learned to survive in China .
" I never thought I could perform on stage for five minutes and earn so much money , " says Agi , whose real name is Long Kuan .
Lost cause Chinese pop stars rely heavily on these types of commercial performances , which make up more than half of their income .
China sued over music piracy
At the height of her popularity in China a few years ago , Agi says she would do two to three performances a week , making as much as 30,000 yuan ( £ 2,100 ; $ 4,100 ) each time .
" It 's really hard to earn money from records because of illegal downloading from the internet and pirated CDs , " says the singer .
Whereas the US and Europe are still finding ways to counter piracy , Chinese record companies have already decided it is a lost cause , finding other ways to make money which are not directly related to music sales .
This comes from necessity rather than by choice , says Shen Lihui , the head of China 's largest independent label , Modern Sky , based in Beijing .
The firm 's entire record collection can be downloaded for free through the country 's largest search engine Baidu.com .
You can use their money to promote your own image to market your songs
Huang Feng
Shen says he hopes to get the royalties back sometime in the future , but in the meantime he is looking at other ways to earn money from the label 's music .
Chinese artists ' unique reliance on commercial gigs is exacerbated by the fact that many bands find it hard to get on radio and TV .
They also find it expensive to market themselves .
Huang Feng , who used to work for Warner Music China , says artists have to turn to big brands , such as Apple , Nokia and Levi's .
The big firms get popular bands to promote their products , and the bands also benefit .
" If they choose you , you can use their money to promote your own image to market your songs , " says Huang .
Chaotic industry Chinese artists rely on sponsorship and paid gigs for an income
This kind of reliance makes artists in the US and Europe squeamish , but there are signs that international music labels are waking up to the possibilities .
Private equity firm Terra Firma , which bought music publishing group EMI , announced in January it would try more direct band sponsorship , similar to that used by football teams .
It is sending the music industry into a tailspin , with leading artists like Coldplay threatening to withhold their albums from EMI .
Chinese artists have yet to reach that level of corporate sponsorship , but it could be the next logical step .
China 's music industry is considered the world 's most chaotic , those involved in the business say .
People abroad definitely come to see you perform for no other reason than they are a fan of your music
Agi
But the founder of Modern Sky is optimistic that China will be at the forefront of the music industry in the future .
" It 's the first place that encountered the problem ( of piracy ) , " says Shen Lihui .
" But you can do anything in China .
It 's the freest place .
Try another business model . "
Singer Agi says she may make more money singing in China , but she prefers doing shows in Europe .
" People abroad definitely come to see you perform for no other reason than they are a fan of your music , " she says .
" But on the Chinese mainland there could be a hundred other reasons .
They think you 're pretty , or whatever .
Music is just a tool to sell things . "

Taoism ’s central organizing principle is the interconnectedness of all life with its flow of continuous change .
Nowhere is this idea expressed in such a unique and exquisite manner as in the concept of yin -yang , which describes the underlying unity of life through the interplay of opposites .
Taoist writings state that all things and all processes contain two primal energies or forces .
These two basic aspects of manifestation often are described as masculine and feminine , light and dark , negative and positive , creative and receptive .
The original meaning of the term signified the light and dark sides of a mountain .
Our common English - language expression , " there are two sides to everything , " expresses this concept quite succinctly .
From a Taoist point of view , however , these two polar opposites are not seen as distinctly separate or in conflict , but rather as interdependent and complementary .
In actuality , one creates the other .
" Is there a difference between yes and no ? " , Lao Tzu , one of Taoism ’s immortal sages , asks .
" Is there a difference between good and evil ? "
His reply is that " Under heaven all can see beauty only because there is ugliness .
All can know good as good only because there is evil . "
Chuang
Tzu , another legendary Taoist sage , states with delightful wit and humor : " Everything can be a ‘ that ’ ; everything can be a ‘ this . ’
Therefore , ‘ that ’ comes from ‘ this ’ and ‘ this ’ comes from ‘ that ’ - which means ‘ that ’ and ‘ this ’ give birth to one another .
When there is no more separation between ‘ that ’ and ‘ this ’ , it is called being one with the Tao . "
These two sages are telling us is that the seeming opposites of life - the " yes " and " no , " the " good " and " bad , " are merely expressions of a deeper underlying unity , the connectedness that characterizes life in all its forms and processes .
They advise us to not get caught in these apparent contradictions , rigidly choosing one side against the other .
We are urged , rather , to perceive them in their relatedness , to experience how one grows out of the other .
In so doing we can partake in the reconciling of opposites , " in blunting the sharpness and untangling the knot , " as Lao Tzu states .
Nature ’s tendency is to constantly move to a state of harmony and balance .
The idea of change leading to harmonious balance underlines another aspect of yin -yang .
These two polar forces are not static or rigidly locked in battle with one another .
Just as one side of the mountain does not remain sunny all day , but gradually becomes shady as the sun moves across the sky and lights the other side , so also do the two forces of yin and yang constantly move and interact .
When one energy becomes full and complete , then the other begins to grow and ascend .
" That which shrinks must first expand .
That which fails must first be strong .
That which is cast down must first be raised . "
Lao
Tzu is telling us that life is a process .
There is constant change , one thing flowing into another , one thing becoming another .
Furthermore , within this constant change is a recognizable cyclical pattern , like the alternating of day and night or the turning of the seasons .
For all things there is a natural expansion and contraction , on both the most minute and grandest levels .
It is the breathing pattern of life itself .
What implications does this have for us on a personal level ?
How can we apply the concept of yin -yang in our daily lives ?
For the past two thousand years traditional Western thinking has been dominated by a dualistic , either - or approach : either something is good , or it is bad ; desirable or undesirable ; someone is an ally or an enemy .
We perceive experiences to be either positive or negative and we expend much energy in trying to eradicate what we consider to be negative .
From a Taoist point of view , this is like trying to erase the negative current from electricity because it is not " positive . "
Because we perceive ourselves as separate from others , we often find ourselves in opposition to them , locked into " this " and " that , " merely because of skin color , language , or beliefs .
Taking these " differences " for the way things " really are " leads to breakdowns in relating , arguing , fighting , and even killing .
All because of " this " and " that . "
We do the same with ourselves .
We dislike or disown parts of ourselves and struggle to change , not trusting that our own inner nature , as an expression of the Tao , will of its own accord move towards a harmonious balance .
" Everything can be a ‘ that ’ ; everything can be a ‘ this ’ , " Chuang Tzu writes .
" Thus the sage does not bother with these distinctions , but beholds the light beyond right and wrong . "
As strange as such thinking may seem to us , we can recognize that every good negotiator and mediator certainly looks beyond " right " and " wrong " in order to reconcile opposites , to " soften the glare and untangle the knot . "
By being yielding and receptive , by remaining in relationship with others as well as with ourselves , we learn to flow with life ’s myriad of changes .
Indeed , we become an agent of change ourselves , rather than resisting it while desperately clinging to one pole , one experience or perception , or the other .
" What goes up must come down , " and " Every cloud has a silver lining . "
Our own language echoes the wisdom found within the concept of yin -yang .
Bad luck becomes good luck and crisis contains the opportunity for growth .
We can choose to cooperate with this complimentary set of opposites by not denying , suppressing , or struggling against unwanted discomfort or pain , but rather by accepting all facets of our existence , " good " and " bad , " as the natural flow of the Tao .
By following the path of acceptance and responsiveness to change we can become , in the words of Chuang Tzu , true women and men of Tao .
The true person of Tao " is not always looking for right and wrong , always deciding ‘ Yes ’ or ‘ No ’ .
The true person has no mind to fight Tao and does not try by her own contriving to help Tao along .
Mind free , thoughts gone , brow clear , face serene .
All that comes out of him comes quiet , like the four seasons . "
The next article in this series will explore the concept of wu- wei , or " non-doing , " often popularly referred to as " going with the flow . "

How should a society treat its youngest criminal offenders ?
And the families of victims of those offenders ?
Half a dozen states are now weighing these questions anew , as they consider whether to ban life sentences for juveniles that do n't include a option for parole – and whether those now serving such sentences should have a retroactive shot at parole .
Here in Illinois , proposed legislation would give 103 people – most convicted of unusually brutal crimes – a chance at parole hearings , while outlawing the sentence for future young perpetrators .
The proposal has victims ' families up in arms , angry that killers they had been told were in prison for life might be given a shot at release and that they 'd need to regularly attend hearings in the future , reliving old traumas , to try to ensure that these criminals remain behind bars .
Advocates of legislation , meanwhile , both in Illinois and elsewhere , note that the US is the only country in the world with anyone – nearly 2,400 across the nation – serving such a severe sentence for a crime committed as a juvenile .
They criticize the fact that the sentence is often mandatory , part of a system devoid of leniency for a teenager 's lack of judgment , or hope that youth can be reformed .
" Kids should be punished , and held accountable .
The crimes we 're talking about are very serious crimes , " says Alison Parker , deputy director of the US program of Human Rights Watch and author of a report on the issue .
" But children are uniquely able to rehabilitate themselves , to grow up and to change .
A life - without - parole sentence says they 're beyond repair , beyond hope . "
The sentence is automatic for certain crimes in more than half of all states , part of a wave of " get tough " laws aimed at cracking down on rising crime rates during the 1980s and '90s .
Which means judges often have little to no discretion when they mete out punishment .
In many instances , they are prohibited from considering age or even whether the juvenile was the one who pulled the trigger .
About a quarter of the juveniles serving life without parole sentences nationally were convicted of what is known as " felony murder , " says Ms. Parker .
They participated in a felony in which murder was committed , but they were n't the ones who did the actual killing .
In Illinois , that list includes Marshan Allen , a 15 - year - old who accompanied an older brother and some friends on a drug - related mission , and says he did n't know they were going to kill several people .
In California , another state considering doing away with the sentence , it includes Anthony , a 16 - year - old painting graffiti with a friend when the friend produced a gun and decided to rob an approaching group of teenagers .
His friend pulled the trigger , but Anthony – who turned down a plea bargain because he could n't imagine paying for a crime he did n't feel he 'd committed – got a life - without - parole sentence .
" There are people in prison for crimes they committed as juveniles that should never see the light of day , " says Rich Klawiter , a partner at the law firm DLA Piper and part of the Illinois Coalition for the Fair Sentencing of Children , which produced a report on the issue last month and advocates reform .
" But those that show themselves worthy of redemption ought to be given an opportunity before a parole board . "
The frequent citing of cases like Allen 's bothers supporters of the sentence , who say such examples are hardly representative .
Generally , the mandate is saved for such extreme offenses as multiple murders , killing of a police officer , aggravated sexual assault , and murder of a child .
" These guys are the worst of the worst , " says Jennifer Bishop - Jenkins , whose pregnant sister and brother - in - law were murdered by a 16 - year - old in their Winnetka , Ill. , townhome in 1990 .
She acknowledges automatic sentencing has probably punished a few juveniles unfairly , but notes that such individuals can always appeal for clemency .
What she does n't understand is bringing offenders back for hearings that , in her mind , would only unearth the past for the families of victims who thought they 'd seen their loved ones ' killers put away forever .
Ms. Bishop - Jenkins and her sister , Jeanne Bishop , are both prominent victim activists against the death penalty , and helped in the case that got the juvenile death penalty overturned by the Supreme Court three years ago .
Now , they both say , they feel betrayed by the same allies with whom they fought against the death penalty , who never sought their input on this issue .
" Once you say this person could get out someday through this mechanism , you 've just placed a crushing burden on the hearts and minds of the victims ' families , " says Jeanne Bishop , a Cook County public defender who has also defended juveniles .
She and her sister both support getting rid of the mandatory sentencing and giving judges more discretion , but worry that in all the talk of the human rights of juvenile offenders , the rights of victims are being forgotten .
The current legislation in Illinois is unlikely to go anywhere , with its key sponsor backing away last week and saying more time is needed to dialogue with victims .
Reform advocates hope to have new legislation introduced in the near future .
Colorado outlawed juvenile life without parole in 2006 , and legislation is pending in Michigan , Florida , Nebraska , and California , while a few other states are experiencing grass - roots efforts .
Some activists against the sentence say they hope they can work with victims ' families to take their concerns into account even as they do away with the sentence .
In Michigan , where a set of bills is before both the Senate and the House , activists have had some success building dialogue with victims , says Deborah LaBelle , a human rights attorney based in Ann Arbor and director of the ACLU 's Juvenile Life Without Parole Initiative .
" We need to allow both voices to be heard , " says Ms. LaBelle .
But she feels strongly that the sentence is inappropriate for youth .
" As every parent knows and as every social scientist understands , this is a time of ill - thought - out , impulsive lack of judgment , problematic years …
To throw them away and say you 're irredeemable as a child is a disturbing social concept . "
Quaker teacher fired for changing loyalty oath CAL STATE EAST BAY Quaker put ' nonviolently ' in document she signed
A depiction of how Marianne Kearney - Brown modified the oath .

California State University East Bay has fired a math teacher after six weeks on the job because she inserted the word " nonviolently " in her state - required Oath of Allegiance form .
Marianne Kearney - Brown , a Quaker and graduate student who began teaching remedial math to undergrads Jan. 7 , lost her $ 700 - a- month part - time job after refusing to sign an 87 - word Oath of Allegiance to the Constitution that the state requires of elected officials and public employees .
" I do n't think it was fair at all , " said Kearney - Brown .
" All they care about is my name on an unaltered loyalty oath .
They do n't care if I meant it , and it did n't seem connected to the spirit of the oath .
Nothing else mattered .
My teaching did n't matter .
Nothing . "
A veteran public school math teacher who specializes in helping struggling students , Kearney - Brown , 50 , had signed the oath before - but had modified it each time .
She signed the oath 15 years ago , when she taught eighth - grade math in Sonoma .
And she signed it again when she began a 12 - year stint in Vallejo high schools .
Each time , when asked to " swear ( or affirm ) " that she would " support and defend " the U.S. and state Constitutions " against all enemies , foreign and domestic , " Kearney - Brown inserted revisions :
She wrote " nonviolently " in front of the word " support , " crossed out " swear , " and circled " affirm . "
All were to conform with her Quaker beliefs , she said .
The school districts always accepted her modifications , Kearney - Brown said .
But Cal State East Bay would n't , and she was fired on Thursday .
Modifying the oath " is very clearly not permissible , " the university 's attorney , Eunice Chan , said , citing various laws .
" It 's an unfortunate situation .
If she 'd just signed the oath , the campus would have been more than willing to continue her employment . "
Modifying oaths is open to different legal interpretations .
Without commenting on the specific situation , a spokesman for state Attorney General Jerry Brown said that " as a general matter , oaths may be modified to conform with individual values . "
For example , court oaths may be modified so that atheists do n't have to refer to a deity , said spokesman Gareth Lacy .
Kearney - Brown said she could not sign an oath that , to her , suggested she was agreeing to take up arms in defense of the country .
" I honor the Constitution , and I support the Constitution , " she said .
" But I want it on record that I defend it nonviolently . "
The trouble began Jan. 17 , a little more than a week after she started teaching at the Hayward campus .
Filling out her paperwork , she drew an asterisk on the oath next to the word " defend . "
She wrote : " As long as it does n't require violence . "
The secretary showed the amended oath to a supervisor , who said it was unacceptable , Kearney - Brown recalled .
Shortly after receiving her first paycheck , Kearney - Brown was told to come back and sign the oath .
This time , Kearney - Brown inserted " nonviolently , " crossed out " swear , " and circled " affirm . "
That 's when the university sought legal advice .
" Based on the advice of counsel , we cannot permit attachments or addenda that are incompatible and inconsistent with the oath , " the campus ' human resources manager , JoAnne Hill , wrote to Kearney - Brown .
She cited a 1968 case called Smith vs. County Engineer of San Diego .
In that suit , a state appellate court ruled that a man being considered for public employment could not amend the oath to declare : his " supreme allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ Whom Almighty God has appointed ruler of Nations , and expressing my dissent from the failure of the Constitution to recognize Christ and to acknowledge the Divine institution of civil government . "
The court called it " a gratuitous injection of the applicant 's religious beliefs into the governmental process . "
But Hill said Kearney - Brown could sign the oath and add a separate note to her personal file that expressed her views .
Kearney - Brown declined .
" To me it just was n't the same .
I take the oath seriously , and if I 'm going to sign it , I 'm going to do it nonviolently . "
Then came the warning .
" Please understand that this issue needs to be resolved no later than Friday , Feb. 22 , 2008 , or you will not be allowed to continue to work for the university , " Hill wrote .
The deadline was then extended to Wednesday and she was fired on Thursday .
" I was kind of stunned , " said Kearney - Brown , who is pursuing her master 's degree in math to earn the credentials to do exactly the job she is being fired from .
" I was born to do this , " she said .
" I teach developmental math , the lowest level .
The kids who are conditionally accepted to the university .
Give me the kids who hate math - that 's what I want . "

It 's been over four months since Eric Kidd posted his infamous Why Ruby is an acceptable LISP article .
You know , the one that got approximately 6.02e23 comments , ranging from " I agree ! " through " I hate you ! " to " I bred them together to create a monster ! "
Any time the comment thread becomes huge enough to exhibit emergent behavior , up to and including spawning new species of monsters , you know you 've touched a nerve .
What amazes me is that nobody 's pointed out the obvious counter - observation : Lisp is not an acceptable LISP .
Not for any value of Lisp .
There 's nothing magical about this , nothing partisan .
If Lisp were acceptable , then we'd all be using it .
You 've all read about the Road to Lisp .
I was on it for a little over a year .
It 's a great road , very enlightening , blah blah blah , but what they fail to mention is that Lisp is n't the at the end of it .
Lisp is just the last semi-civilized outpost you hit before it turns into a dirt road , one that leads into the godawful swamp most of us spend our programming careers slugging around in .
I guarantee you there is n't one single Lisp programmer out there who uses exclusively Lisp .
Instead we spend our time hacking around its inadequacies , often in other languages .
So for four months I 've been waiting for someone else to say it , but so far it 's not happening .
Why are n't we admitting it ?
Oh , right .
Religion .
I keep forgetting about that .
Lisp programmers are just like all other programmers : they want to write code and get cool stuff done , which presupposes they 've already learned the last programming language they 'll ever need .
There 's all this real - life stuff ( jobs , family , stability , all the usual suspects ) intruding on you as a programmer , demanding that you quit dorking around looking for the One True Language , and settle down on whatever barren rock you happen to be squatting on at the moment , and call it Good .
So most Lisp programmers — and that 's not many , since not many programmers make it even close to that far down the Road — see that last outpost of technical civilization , peer balefully into the swamp , and decide to check into the Lisp hotel for good .
Not realizing , of course , that all its rooms are in the swamp proper .
We all know it 's tricky to have a rational discussion about a religion .
Non-Lispers will be able to read this without getting their feathers ruffled .
Some Lispers are n't too far gone , so let 's assume we 're talking to them , and take a look at some of Lisp 's problems that make it flat - out unacceptable .
At least for LISP , you know , the idealized one .
Sorry , folks , but you can't trivialize this one .
Let 's say I 'm a new would - be Lisper , just finished walking down that long damn Road , and now that I 'm here , I 'm ready to start using it .
Which " it " should I use ?
The answer is " it depends " , and that 's pretty unfortunate , because right there you 've just lost users .
With Python or Ruby or Java , you 've only got one language to choose from .
Or at least you can be comfortable that there 's a single canonical version , and the rest ( e.g. Jython ) are highly experimental territory .
Pick Scheme , and you have to pick a Scheme .
Pick Common Lisp , and you have to pick a Common Lisp .
Heck , there are even two or three flavors of Emacs - Lisp out there .
Most newcomers eventually ( and independently ) decide the same thing : Scheme is a better language , but Common Lisp is the right choice for production work .
CL has more libraries , and the implementations are somewhat more compatible than Scheme implementations , particularly with respect to macros .
So newcomers heave a deep sigh , and they learn to accept LISP - 2 , names like rplaca , case - insensitivity , '( ALL CAPS OUTPUT ) , and all the other zillions of idiosyncracies of a standard Common Lisp implementation .
Eventually , if they stick with Lisp at all , they learn they can override most of these defaults in nonportable ways , which makes things infinitesimally more bearable .
Whatever .
If you 're a Lisper , you dealt with all this crap years ago , and now you 're committed .
If you 're not a Lisper , then you 're not very likely to become one any time soon .
In fact your probability of learning Lisp is decreasing over time , as other languages continue to close the gap in the Lispy areas , and simultaneously increase their lead in non-Lispy areas where Lisp is making little ( if any ) progress .
Let 's look at some of those areas .
But first , let me mention one last problem in the " which Lisp " space .
It 's dirty laundry that needs airing .
The problem : Paul Graham .
I mean , the guy 's a genius , and I love reading his essays , and his startups are doing great things , etc. etc .
You can't fault him .
But he 's created something of a problem .
Before Paul Graham , Lisp was dying .
It really was , and let 's not get all sentimental or anything ; it 's just common sense .
A language is always either gaining or losing ground , and Lisp was losing ground all through the 1990s .
Then PG came along with his " I 'm not talking to you if you 're over 26 years old " essays , each a giant slap in our collective face , and everyone sat up and paid attention to him in a hurry .
And a TON of people started looking very seriously at Lisp .
Lisp might or might not have experienced a revival without Paul 's essays , but it 's moot : he showed up , and Lisp got real popular , real fast .
And then he said : " Do n't use it ! "
Sort of .
I mean , that 's effectively what he said , is n't it ?
By deciding to pre-announce Arc , he Microsofted Lisp .
Killed it with vaporware .
It 's a great strategy when you 're an evil empire .
I do n't think that 's exactly what Paul had in mind , but let 's face it : that 's what happened .
So Common Lispers grumble about Paul in the hallways .
If I read newsgroups ( every time I try , the overall ugliness of humanity drives me away within hours ; I only re-attempt it every decade or so ) I see them grumbling there too .
He 's put them in a tough spot , because he did use Common Lisp for Viaweb , and his arguments in favor of Lisp ( in the general sense ) have been compelling enough to bring in newcomers by the droves .
But he 's not throwing his weight behind CL .
He 's not even taking the marginally - acceptable route ( from a damage - control perspective ) of recommending Scheme .
Instead , Paul's ( * gasp * ) starting a new religion .
Arc 's going to be a new religion , of course , because programmers just haaaaaave to make it that way .
If it ever appears , anyway .
But will it ?
That 's the tricky thing about Cathedral - style software ; you never can tell .
My prediction : someone will get tired of waiting , and they 'll Torvalds Arc into obsolescence before it 's ever released .
( If you do n't get the reference , it 's what Linux did to GNU Hurd ) .
Long story short : nobody knows what the hell Lisp they 're supposed to be using , and it 's absolutely killing adoption .
Oh , ouch , did I have to put it quite like that ?
I mean , c'mon , let 's be fair , there are literally hundreds of people out there who disagree .
Unfortunately , the simple fact is that the spec is ancient .
Every time someone talks about updating it , someone screams about time or money or whatever .
The problem is ( like the problem with RSS ) a people - problem , not a time or money problem .
This is absolutely true in the Scheme world , too .
There are a bunch of old - timer stakeholders who want to have their say .
So you 're basically asking a goverment ( complete with lobbyists , political parties , the works ) to design Lisp if you go that route .
The naysayers are right about one thing : it 'll never happen .
Your only other option is to design a new language , and you wo n't get any help from Lisp people , because they will hate you .
They love pointing to the trail of bodies left in the wake of every pioneer who 's tried this before , none of whom has emerged with a " successful " Lisp .
Of course , they have n't been successful because Lispers did n't want to have anything to do with them ; Lispers are just as incapacitated by their techno - religious beliefs as folks from other languages .
Religions dislike each other , but no heretic is as damned as someone who starts with your religion and makes a modification to it .
Just ask the Albigensians , for instance .
But what 's wrong with Common Lisp ?
Do I really need to say it ?
Every single non-standard extension , everything not in the spec , is " wrong " with Common Lisp .
This includes any support for threads , filesystem access , processes and IPC , operating system interoperability , a GUI , Unicode , and the long list of other features missing from the latest hyperspec .
Effectively , everything that can't be solved from within Lisp is a target .
Lisp is really powerful , sure , but some features can only be effective if they 're handled by the implementation .
CLOS is icky .
I have n't worked with Smalltalk a whole lot , but I 've worked with it enough to know that to do OOP right , you have to do it from the ground up .
CLOS was bolted on to Common Lisp .
Everyone knows it , although not many people want to admit it .
It was bolted on very nicely , and it's not my intention to disparage the efforts of the people who created it .
It was an amazing piece of work , and it did a great job of being flexible enough to tie together the conflicting OO systems of existing Lisp implementations .
But let 's face it ; CLOS has problems .
One obvious one is thatis n't a polymorphic function .
It 's one of the first speed bumps you encounter .
You can't create a new kind of measurable object and give it amethod ; you have to call itoror whatever .
That 's part of Lisp 's endoskeleton showing ; you can see the bolt sticking out plain as the nose on your face .
It 's not seamless ; it 's not orthogonal , and it's not the Right Thing .
But it 's not going to change , either .
Another problem is the slot accessor macros .
They 're insanely clever , but clever is n't what you want .
You want first - class function access , so you can pass the getters and setters to , etc .
You can work around these things , but they 're a leaky abstraction , and enough of those will add up to significant mental resistance to getting things done .
It 's like all those weird little rules in Perl : non-orthogonal rules that add up to forgetting the language every time you leave it alone for more than a week .
What you really want in lieu of CLOS is ... complicated .
It 's a hard problem .
Lisp wants to be constructed entirely from macros .
It 's part of the purity of the idea of LISP : you only need the seven ( or is it five ? ) primitives to build the full machine .
Doing CLOS as a bunch of macros was very much in the spirit of Lisp : it was a Lispy thing to do .
But macros are a problem .
Yes , they 're one of the most important differentiators .
But macros are like having these high - powered band - aids , when what you want is not to be wounded in the first place .
Having the object system — something pretty fundamental to the language , you 'd think — written as a bunch of macros does n't feel right when all is said and done .
When you work with Ruby or Smalltalk or any suitably " pure " OO language ( Python does n't quite count , unfortunately ; its bolts are also showing ) , you realize there are some distinct advantages to having everything be an object .
It 's very nice , for instance , to be able to figure out what methods are applicable to a given class ( e.g.from Ruby ) , and to be able to extend that list with your own new methods .
It 's a nice organizational technique .
Of course , that forces you into a single - dispatch model , so it becomes harder to figure out what to do about multi-methods .
Some Python folks have implemented multi-methods for Python , and they do it by making them top - level functions , which makes sense ( where else would you put them ? )
I 'm not claiming that Smalltalk 's object model is going to translate straight to Lisp ; you have to decide whether cons cells are " objects " , for instance , and that 's a decision I would n't wish on my worst enemy .
I do n't envy the person who tackles it .
Regardless of what the solution might be , CLOS remains a problem .
It 's over - complicated and yet not quite OOP-y enough or expressive enough .
The problem of reflecting on an object to see which methods are valid for it is one example , but there are tons of others .
Heck , one possibly valid complaint is that it does n't work very much like the " conventional " OOP systems of C++ , Java , Python and Ruby .
There 's no real reason it should n't be more like them .
But changing CLOS to be simpler and more seamless essentially means replacing it .
And replacing it is probably best done inside the implementation .
In other words , any fix means starting virtually from scratch .
Or maybe you could go the Haskell route and not have OOP at all .
That seems to alienate most programmers , though , despite the attractions of not having to create nouns for everything .
( Have you ever noticed that turning a non - object - oriented program into an object - oriented one in the same language that does the same thing essentially doubles its size ?
Try it sometime ... )
At the risk of predicting future fashion trends , which is rarely a good idea , I 'll venture that objects are going to continue to be trendy for at least a few more decades .
So I think Lisp needs some form of " seamless " OOP .
Macros are one of the worst problems with Lisp , or at least they 're one of the biggest unsolved problems .
Yes , they 're amazingly powerful and critically important and blah Blah BLAH .
You can read all about them elsewhere .
Paul Graham 's On Lisp is the best reference I 've found .
But they 're fraught with problems .
One is that they 're not hygienic .
You should at least have the option of requesting hygienic macros .
Various papers have been published , and implementations implemented , for hygienic .
Yeah , it 's hellishly hard to get right , and it 's overkill for many situations , but it really does need to be offered as an option .
A portable one .
For that matter , you should also have a choice between Scheme - style pattern - matching macros and Lisp - style code - style macros .
They 're very different , and each kind is better ( cleaner ) in some situations .
People often act as if hygiene is synonymous with define - syntax , but the pattern - template style is orthogonal to the question of hygiene .
Style considerations aside , macros have tool problems .
Macros are notoriously hard to debug , and honestly it need n't be that way .
If your editor knows all about macros , then you should be able to click to see the expansion , and click again to see its sub-expansions , all the way down to the primitive functions .
Some editors can do this , but none of them ( that I 'm aware of ) handle macros as cleanly or seamlessly as they do normal functions .
Syntax in general is a problem .
Lisp has a little syntax , and it shows up occasionally as , for instance , '( foo ) being expanded as ( quote foo ) , usually when you least expect it .
Truth be told , Lisp should probably have a skinnable syntax .
That implies a canonical abstract syntax tree , which of course has n't been defined ( and in many implementations is n't even available to you , the way it is in the Io language , say ) .
Once you 've got a canonical AST defined , syntax should , in theory , be like CSS chrome .
Of course , there are plenty of bodies left in the trail of this particular theory as well .
Someday ...
In any case , because macros are rarely supported " well enough " by the tools , and because they 're not first - class functions , and so on , they wind up being second - class citizens .
The rule " you should only use a macro when nothing else will do " implies that they really are a last resort , which ( to me ) is synonymous with band - aid .
Yes , it 's wonderful that you have the band - aid — or maybe duct tape is a better analogy — certainly you miss them dearly when you 're working in other languages .
But you do n't want to have to build your entire object system with duct tape .
So macros , like the object system , need to be re-thought from the ground up .
There 's undoubtedly enough research in the space that someone could throw together a working definition in no time , something just good enough for today 's programmers , the ones who expect ( and rightfully so , I might add ) to be able to name their methods " length " without getting a compiler error .
See , that 's just exactly the problem with type systems .
They can make sure you use headings , but they can't ensure you get the numbering right .
Well , it 'll take me forever to talk about this one , so I 'll have to leave it for another blog .
The problem is that the type system has to be extensible and skinnable , and I 'm not strictly talking about user - defined types in the sense of OOP or CLOS .
Unfortunately it really is a huge open issue , one that 'll take longer than this blog to sort through , so I 'll have to leave it for today .
Lisp , for all the strengths of its flexible type system , has n't got this issue right either .
Otherwise Haskell and OCaml ( and C++ , gack ) would n't be kicking its ass all over the performance map .
' nuff said , at least for now .
[ And no , they do n't quite have it right either . ]
I promise I 'll talk about type systems soon .
But I also promised some friends I 'd make my blogs shorter .
This is a problem .
It 's not a little teeny one , either .
The Lisp communities ( yeah , there are a bunch ) are going to have to realize that if Lisp is ever going to be massively successful , it needs an overhaul .
Or maybe a revolution .
Contrary to what some might tell you , it does n't need a committee , and it does n't need a bunch of money .
Linux proved exactly the opposite .
Lisp needs a benevolent dictator .
Lisp needs to ditch the name " Lisp " , since it scares people .
And Lisp needs to learn from the lessons of the 45 years of languages that have followed it .
And no , I 'm not the guy .
You 're all far more qualified to tackle this problem than I am .
Especially if you 're under 26 .
Five years on , let us take the high road .
When the invasion of Iraq was conceived , it was as an experiment in the transforming force of a confident superpower ; an evangelistic Tony Blair trotted on behind .
Removing a dictator was only to be the start ; the objective was a benign and democratic Middle East – an environment in which Israel and the Palestinians could make peace , and energy exports were plentiful and secure .
Even now , the removal of that dictator remains the single attainment of an enterprise that was always as flawed in its genesis as in execution .
Iraq is a war - torn and wasted land .
Estimates of its civilian dead range from almost 100,000 to more than 10 times as many .
More than two million of its people have fled .
The indiscriminate killings may have slowed , but ethnic cleansing continues apace .
Any semblance of democracy is confined to the Kurdish region – as it was before the war .
The government and parliament are corralled in the Green Zone , walled off from the citizens they are supposed to serve .
Neither the central government , nor the 150,000 US troops , have been able to match even the inadequate supplies of power and clean water that Saddam Hussein made flow in his day .
Iraqi police and armed forces are still nowhere near up to standard or strength .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Over five years , the US has lost almost 4,000 troops , with 30,000 wounded – a toll of grief and suffering that is already influencing the course of US politics .
At 175 , the number of British dead might seem modest ; as the price of involvement in a war that was unjustified and unnecessary , any figure would be too high .
Nor is the south that we British have handed back to the Iraqis the model of peace and tolerance that we had hoped to bequeath .
Plagued by warlordism and riven by sectarianism , it is now left pretty much to its own devices .
Yet they are still seen as holding a necessary line , now that the rest of the foreign coalition , such as it was , has departed .
The Poles and Australians were the last to leave – both essentially voted back by disgruntled domestic electorates .
A RESURGENT IRAN
The US , for its part , is trapped .
The controversial troop surge briefly subdued the violence – but at tremendous cost in men and material .
With the effect wearing off , however , Washington can ill - afford to reduce their numbers , lest the violence return to previous levels .
And their necessary visibility places them at greater risk .
On the plus side , then , the demise of Saddam Hussein .
On the minus side : thousands of deaths , the proliferation of suicide bombings , no great groundswell of democracy , still less energy security , and a resurgent Iran – youthful and militant – sweeping into the power vacuum left by Saddam .
On the world stage , both the US and Britain are smaller countries .
Five years on , the totality of our failure is clear .
But worse even than that failure , perhaps , is the obstinate refusal of our political leaders to learn the obvious lessons .
Of course , any lingering shreds of idealism are long gone .
On becoming Prime Minister , Gordon Brown changed the Government 's tone to one of sombre realism , rather than messianism .
And for a brief spell , he drew a distinction between the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq , rather than dishonestly conflating the two .
That did not last .
And the promise of a parliamentary vote on any future war , while good for a headline , is of limited value .
There was a parliamentary vote on Iraq : the problem was not the lack of a vote , but the lack of an opposition .
On both sides of the Atlantic , however , political leaders still insist that the war was the right thing to do .
If there were errors – and they admit there were – they were all in the implementation , not the enterprise itself .
Nor , in official parlance at least , does the appetite for using armed force seem diminished .
Mr Bush persists in threatening Iran with armed force , despite overwhelming evidence that his military is overstretched , while the British foreign secretary gives gung - ho speeches on the misunderstood merits of armed intervention .
In his Budget , Alistair Darling announced the higher military budget as though he was talking about new social spending , rather than the – very high – price of Mr Blair 's Mesopotamian adventure .
In terms of manpower and money , we have acquired a long - term obligation in Iraq .
The true cost has still not been honestly acknowledged .
INQUIRY NEEDED
Meanwhile we await the comprehensive inquiry into how we got into Iraq – into the decision - making involved , the intelligence debacle , and the rest .
Mr Brown 's recent promise of an inquiry when the troops are home is a small step in the right direction – at least he recognises that such an investigation is desirable – but it disgracefully , and perhaps indefinitely , postpones the day of reckoning .
There are those , of course – an increasing number of self - justifying memoir - writers among them – who maintain that five years is but the blink of an eye in the greater perspective of history .
The worst , they suggest , is over , and a new , modern Iraq will then arise from the blood and ashes .
We hope against hope that it will .
The evolution of a new Iraq , however , will be proof not that might was right but of the indomitability of the human spirit .
We would also remind those tempted to regard these five years of suffering as somehow vindicated that the timescale Mr Bush envisaged for operations was rather closer to five months .
The fact that this is one of the only machines for which there are no details does not mean that its the most secretive .
In fact it means the opposite – that the Swedish military are so nice and open and Scandinavian that they actually tell you what they are buying .
This kind of shows why the supercomputer list is somewhat inaccurate , otherwise it would indicate that the Swedish military , is the second worlds biggest in terms of its computing requirements .
This will be an HP Blade server system with 14,000 processors .
103 Teraflops .

At first , it seemed some geeked - out supercoder was going to make an easy million .
In October 2006 , Netflix announced it would give a cool seven figures to whoever created a movie - recommending algorithm 10 percent better than its own .
Within two weeks , the DVD rental company had received 169 submissions , including three that were slightly superior to Cinematch , Netflix 's recommendation software .
After a month , more than a thousand programs had been entered , and the top scorers were almost halfway to the goal .
But what started out looking simple suddenly got hard .
The rate of improvement began to slow .
The same three or four teams clogged the top of the leaderboard , inching forward decimal by agonizing decimal .
There was BellKor , a research group from AT&T .
There was Dinosaur Planet , a team of Princeton alums .
And there were others from the usual math powerhouses — like the University of Toronto .
After a year , AT&T 's team was in first place , but its engine was only 8.43 percent better than Cinematch .
Progress was almost imperceptible , and people began to say a 10 percent improvement might not be possible .
Then , in November 2007 , a new entrant suddenly appeared in the top 10 : a mystery competitor who went by the name " Just a guy in a garage . "
His first entry was 7.15 percent better than Cinematch ; BellKor had taken seven months to achieve the same score .
On December 20 , he passed the team from the University of Toronto .
On January 9 , with a score 8.00 percent higher than Cinematch , he passed Dinosaur Planet .
The Netflix challenge is just one example of a kind of problem called data mining — trying to make useful sense out of a gigantic dataset , typically rather noisy , completely unintelligible to the naked eye , and , despite its size , often painfully incomplete .
Data mining is what Google does when it transforms the vast and ever - changing array of links on the Web into one number , PageRank , which it uses to figure out which page comes up first in your search .
It ’s what intelligence agencies do — or at least what we surmise they do — when they search for red - flag patterns in a heterogeneous stew of visa applications , phone calls , and flight and hotel reservations .
And it ’s what computer - aided detection software does for doctors when it boils down millions of observations of electrons passing through tissue into a single binary variable — tumor or no tumor .
Secrecy has n't been a big part of the Netflix competition .
The prize hunters , even the leaders , are startlingly open about the methods they 're using , acting more like academics huddled over a knotty problem than entrepreneurs jostling for a $ 1 million payday .
In December 2006 , a competitor called " simonfunk " posted a complete description of his algorithm — which at the time was tied for third place — giving everyone else the opportunity to piggyback on his progress .
" We had no idea the extent to which people would collaborate with each other , " says Jim Bennett , vice president for recommendation systems at Netflix .
When I ask Yehuda Koren , BellKor 's leader , whether the prize money would go to him and his teammates or to AT&T , he pauses .
He seems honestly to have never considered the question .
" We got a big prize by learning and interacting with other teams , " he says .
" This is the real prize for us . "
" Just a guy in a garage " was the exception to all this openness .
He did n't even have a link attached to his screen name , which kept creeping higher and higher on the leaderboard .
By mid-January , there were just five teams , out of 25,000 entrants , ahead of him .
And still , no one knew who he was or by what statistical magic he kept improving .
" He 's very mysterious , " says Koren with unconcealed interest .
" I hope you will at least be able to find out his name . "
His name is Gavin Potter .
He 's a 48 - year - old Englishman , a retired management consultant with an undergraduate degree in psychology and a master 's in operations research .
He has worked for Shell , PricewaterhouseCoopers , and IBM .
In 2006 , he left his job at IBM to explore the idea of starting a PhD in machine learning , a field in which he has no formal training .
When he read about the Netflix Prize , he decided to give it a shot — what better way to find out just how serious about the topic he really was ?
In 2001 , Potter cowrote a book called Business in a Virtual World that described how companies could best take advantage of new technology .
So he 's well aware of the commercial value of improving recommender systems , which tend to perform poorly , sometimes comically so .
( You liked The Squid and the Whale ?
Try this Jacques Cousteau documentary . )
" The 20th century was about sorting out supply , " Potter says .
" The 21st is going to be about sorting out demand . "
The Internet makes everything available , but mere availability is meaningless if the products remain unknown to potential buyers .
Potter says his anonymity is mostly accidental .
He started that way and did n't come out into the open until after Wired found him .
" I guess I did n't think it was worth putting up a link until I had got somewhere , " he says , adding that he'd been seriously posting under the name of his venture capital and consulting firm , Mathematical Capital , for two months before launching " Just a guy . "
When he started competing , he posted to his blog : " Decided to take the Netflix Prize seriously .
Looks kind of fun .
Not sure where I will get to as I am not an academic or a mathematician .
However , being an unemployed psychologist I do have a bit of time . "
Oh , and he's not really in a garage :
He works in a back bedroom on the second floor of his home in a quiet Central London neighborhood .
The room is painted a cheery bright green and his children 's toy boxes line the walls .
His hardware rack is what he calls an " elderly "
Dell desktop , recently refitted with 6 gigs of RAM to speed things up a bit .
He does n't run any experiments overnight ; the rattling of the fan keeps his family awake .

On it is an intricate computation in a neat , squarish hand .
Not his — the calculation was done by his oldest daughter , Emily , a high school senior who plans to start a degree at Oxford next fall .
She is , for the moment , serving as her father 's higher - math consultant .
" He gives me bits of calculus to do , " she says , in a manner that suggests she feels ready to assume a position of greater responsibility on the project .
( Emily has received no authoritative word as to what portion of any prize money would accrue to her personal accounts . )
Potter has had to work hard to understand and implement the complex mathematics that most contestants use .
But he 's no stranger to computers — as a young man he built an Ohio Scientific Superboard home computer from a kit and wrote software to predict the outcome of Premier League football matches .
Anyway , his strategy is n't to out - math the mathematicians .
He wants to exploit something they 're leaving untapped : human psychology .
Netflix headquarters is a faux - Tuscan palazzo on the edge of Silicon Valley .
The three - story building overlooks Interstate 280 in Los Gatos and shares a parking lot with an apartment complex from which it is architecturally indistinguishable .

Founded in 1997 , the company has more than 7 million subscribers , who have the option to rate movies on a scale of 1 to 5 .
In 2000 , to encourage users to keep their subscriptions active , Netflix rolled out Cinematch , which used those ratings to help customers find new movies they 'd like .
When a user logs in , the service suggests " Movies You 'll Love " — a list of films that the algorithm guesses will get a high rating from that particular user .
In March 2006 , hoping to accelerate progress on Cinematch , the company decided to crowdsource the algorithm .
Netflix constructed a data set of 100 million of the ratings customers had previously supplied and made it available to any coder who wanted a crack at it .
The programmers use the data to write algorithms that predict how well users will like movies they have n't yet rated .
Netflix tests the algorithms on a different ratings data set , which they 've kept secret .
Top scores are then posted on a leaderboard .
The benchmark Netflix uses for the contest is called root mean square error , or RMSE .
Essentially , this measures the typical amount by which a prediction misses the actual score .
When the competition began , Cinematch had an RMSE of 0.9525 , which means that its predictions are typically off by about one point from users ' actual ratings .
That 's not very impressive on a five - point scale : Cinematch might think you 're likely to rate a movie a 4 , but you might rank it a 3 or a 5 .
To win the million , a team will have to make predictions accurate enough to lower that RMSE to 0.8572 .
How much difference could that possibly make ?
A lot , Bennett says .
Netflix offers hundreds of millions of predictions a day , so a tiny reduction in the frequency of insultingly stupid movie suggestions means a lot fewer angry users .
Over the last few years , the RMSE of Cinematch has steadily improved , as has Netflix 's success at retaining customers from month to month .
Bennett can't prove the two are related , but he 's willing to bet on his belief that they are .
He refuses to speculate on the dollar value of a 10 percent improvement to Cinematch , but he 's certain it 's substantially more than $ 1 million .
Contest participants retain ownership of the code they write , but the winning team must license it ( non-exclusively ) to Netflix .
The company is already incorporating some of BellKor 's ideas into its own system and in the future may buy code from other contestants , as well .
The data set , 100 times larger than any of its kind previously made public , is like a new , free library for specialists in data mining .
So the contest has already brought Netflix a chorus of goodwill from computer scientists , who have , in turn , been happy to provide Netflix with free labor .
" It 's up to them to innovate now , " Bennett says .
" We 're just the enablers . "
The Netflix team did n't publicize the strategies that were on the to - do lists of its own researchers — but one by one they were rediscovered , implemented , and evaluated by contestants .
Netflix 's programmers watched the leaderboard and read the forum obsessively .
Various people had various bets on specific teams , Bennett says .
" They all turned out to be wrong !
But we did n't mind . "
Since the prize has been such a success , might Netflix use the same model to solve other problems ?
I ask Bennett if there are more contests on the way .
He pauses for a moment , thinking about what he wants to tell me .
" One at a time , " he says finally .
Many of the contestants begin , like Cinematch does , with something called the k - nearest - neighbor algorithm — or , as the pros call it , kNN .
This is what Amazon.com uses to tell you that " customers who purchased Y also purchased Z. " Suppose Netflix wants to know what you 'll think of Not Another Teen Movie .
It compiles a list of movies that are " neighbors " — films that received a high score from users who also liked Not Another Teen Movie and films that received a low score from people who did n't care for that Jaime Pressly yuk - fest .
It then predicts your rating based on how you 've rated those neighbors .
The approach has the advantage of being quite intuitive :
If you gave Scream five stars , you 'll probably enjoy Not Another Teen Movie .
BellKor uses kNN , but it also employs more abstruse algorithms that identify dimensions along which movies , and movie watchers , vary .
One such scale would be " highbrow " to " lowbrow " ; you can rank movies this way , and users too , distinguishing between those who reach for Children of Men and those who prefer Children of the Corn .
Of course , this system breaks down when applied to people who like both of those movies .
You can address this problem by adding more dimensions — rating movies on a " chick flick " to " jock movie " scale or a " horror " to " romantic comedy " scale .
You might imagine that if you kept track of enough of these coordinates , you could use them to profile users ' likes and dislikes pretty well .
The problem is , how do you know the attributes you 've selected are the right ones ?
Maybe you 're analyzing a lot of data that 's not really helping you make good predictions , and maybe there are variables that do drive people 's ratings that you 've completely missed .
BellKor ( along with lots of other teams ) deals with this problem by means of a tool called singular value decomposition , or SVD , that determines the best dimensions along which to rate movies .
These dimensions are n't human - generated scales like " highbrow " versus " lowbrow " ; typically they 're baroque mathematical combinations of many ratings that can't be described in words , only in pages - long lists of numbers .
At the end , SVD often finds relationships between movies that no film critic could ever have thought of but that do help predict future ratings .
Singular value decomposition is one example of a family of techniques in data mining known as " dimension reduction . "
A classic example of dimension reduction is the work of Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace on the Federalist Papers .
They showed that frequencies of certain words distinguished those papers written by James Madison from those by Alexander Hamilton .
Madison used " upon " and " while " much more frequently than Hamilton , while for " although " and " whilst " the situation was reversed .
So for each paper of disputed authorship , one can write down four numbers , corresponding to the frequencies of " upon , " " while , " " although , " and " whilst . "
If the former two numbers are large and the latter two are small , you can confidently ascribe the paper to Madison .
In this way , Mosteller and Wallace settled an argument that historians had been feuding about since the 19th century , with no firm conclusion in sight .
The danger is that it 's all too easy to find apparent patterns in what 's really random noise .
If you use these mathematical hallucinations to predict ratings , you fail .
Avoiding that disaster — called overfitting — is a bit of an art ; and being very good at it separates masters like BellKor from the rest of the field .
In other words :
The computer scientists and statisticians at the top of the leaderboard have developed elaborate and carefully tuned algorithms for representing movie watchers by lists of numbers , from which their tastes in movies can be estimated by a formula .
Which is fine , in Gavin Potter 's view — except people are n't lists of numbers and do n't watch movies as if they were .
Potter likes to use what psychologists know about human behavior .
" The fact that these ratings were made by humans seems to me to be an important piece of information that should be and needs to be used , " he says .
Potter has great respect for the technical prowess of BellKor — he is , after all , still behind the team in the rankings — but he thinks the computer science community studying this problem suffers from a bad case of groupthink .
He refers to the psychological model underlying their mathematical approach as " crude . "
His tone suggests that if I were n't taping , he might use a stronger word .
It 's easy to say you should take human factors into account — but how , exactly ?
How can you use psychology to study people about whom you know nothing except what movies they like ?
Some things are easy .
For example , the Netflix data set now covers eight years of ratings .
If you think people 's tastes change over time , you might want to weigh recent ratings more heavily than older ones .
A deeper part of Potter 's strategy is based on the work of Amos Tversky and Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman , pioneers of the science now called behavioral economics .
This new field incorporates into traditional economics those features of human life that are lost when you think of a person as a rational machine , or as a list of numbers representing cinematic taste .
One such phenomenon is the anchoring effect , a problem endemic to any numerical rating scheme .
If a customer watches three movies in a row that merit four stars — say , the Star Wars trilogy — and then sees one that 's a bit better — say , Blade Runner — they 'll likely give the last movie five stars .
But if they started the week with one - star stinkers like the Star Wars prequels , Blade Runner might get only a 4 or even a 3 .
Anchoring suggests that rating systems need to take account of inertia — a user who has recently given a lot of above - average ratings is likely to continue to do so .
Potter finds precisely this phenomenon in the Netflix data ; and by being aware of it , he 's able to account for its biasing effects and thus more accurately pin down users ' true tastes .
Could n't a pure statistician have also observed the inertia in the ratings ?
Of course .
But there are infinitely many biases , patterns , and anomalies to fish for .
And in almost every case , the number - cruncher would n't turn up anything .
A psychologist , however , can suggest to the statisticians where to point their high - powered mathematical instruments .
" It cuts out dead ends , " Potter says .
We 've entered the long twilight struggle of the Netflix Prize .
" The last 1.5 percent is going to be harder than the first 8.5 percent , " Potter tells me .
In the past three months , BellKor 's score has barely budged and now stands at 8.57 percent .
Potter , meanwhile , is at 8.07 percent , and his pace has slowed , too .
It 's entirely possible that neither will ever make it to 10 percent .
After all , there 's a certain inherent variability to human choices that even the savviest computer can't predict .
Maybe the psychologist and the computer scientists would make more headway if they joined forces .
Indeed , BellKor 's leading program is actually a blend of 107 different algorithms , and the team is open to adding new ones .
Potter has begun mixing more pure mathematics in with his psychology - inspired programs .
But the two teams have n't expressed any interest in merging .
Potter says he 's " still got juice left , " but perhaps not quite enough to get to 10 percent .
He 's still hopeful though , and he 's still testing new ideas .
After all , if he wins , he 'll be the guy who pointed the way to a new synthesis between psychology and computer science — and pocketed a million dollars in the process .

Substroke Design Dump
Bret Victor / April 17 , 2007
Substroke was a research language for drawing dynamic ( data - dependent ) pictures .
The description given here was intended as a brain - dump of a work - in - progress .
The work - in - progress is no longer in progress as such , but ideas and insight from this exploration will find their way into future work on dynamic drawing .
This description is an admittedly poor explanation of the language , especially lacking in the motivation for each of the features , but I hope you can glean some inspiration from the high - level ideas and general philosophy .
If you get overwhelmed by minutia , try going straight to the examples .
( If you hunger for even more minutia , see the details page . )
Contents :
Primary Ideas Traditional " visual " languages ( with boxes and arrows ) visualize program structure .
This is the wrong thing to visualize !
An artist does n't want to build a machine to draw pictures -- he wants to draw the pictures themselves .
Substroke visualizes the data , not the code .
Machinery is minimized .
, not the .
Machinery is minimized .
As a pure - functional language , there is no state and no time .
This eliminates a huge class of complications and confusions .
However , the comic - strip syntax gives a comfortable illusion of time and mutation , with none of the drawbacks .
The comic - strip syntax provides the artist with a concrete visual output at every point .
This is in contrast to conventional languages , where the programmer has to imagine ( often abstractly ) what each line of code does .
( often abstractly ) what each line of code does .
The language encourages " geometric programming " -- constructing pictures out of shape interactions and intersections , instead of numerical algorithms .
Graphical properties ( such as Bezier points and color ) are represented as objects on the canvas , and can thus be manipulated geometrically ( via the standard move , rotate , scale functions ) .
This is a powerful orthogonality , allowing for conceptual simplicitly .
Layers allow multiple objects to interact .
Linked layers allow the artist to " play " with properties and see the results immediately .
Generic linking allows for arbitrary " interfaces " for object properties .
Motivation
It is not currently possible to draw dynamic pictures .
By draw , I mean construct via direct manipulation of the picture itself , with a clear view of the picture being constructed .
By dynamic picture , I mean a graphic that can vary , in a fully general way , according to a set of parameters .
Most things that appear on a computer screen can be considered dynamic pictures .
The most interesting cases to me are information graphics and technical drawings .
Some examples :
Currently , creating such pictures requires an awkward dance of drawing components or mockups in a static drawing tool ( Photoshop , Illustrator , etc. ) and then blindly manipulating them in a textual programming language .
Unlike drawing on a canvas , textual programming offers no visual feedback -- the programmer must imagine the effects of each code element , and maintain a complex mental mapping between lexical and graphical concepts .
This indirection severely limits artistic freedom .
Furthermore , most visual artists cannot handle the textual abstraction .
The result is poorly - designed pictures drawn by programmers , and pictures tediously designed by an artist / programmer pair .
I believe that much valuable data , particularly in scientific applications , is unvisualized or poorly - visualized , because visual artists lack the means to create effective visualizations .
For a more detailed motivation , see Designing a Design Tool in Magic Ink .
Philosophy
Substroke is a visual language for drawing dynamic pictures .
The language is intended to be a " Scheme for pictures " .
That is , the intent is a simple , elegant framework , using simple , fundamental constructs , that allows fancy functionality to be implemented in libraries .
This is a research project .
It is ambitious and exploratory .
It is more important that the language inspire descendants than be directly usable itself .
It is more important to change the way people think about graphics programming than to create the end - all graphics tool .
Principles :
The artist always sees and manipulates concrete visual examples .
The effect of every change can be seen immediately with examples .
The artist only sees and manipulates concrete examples .
The only visual objects are those he 's drawn .
Visual elements related to abstraction and syntactic structure ( ie , " code " ) are minimized .
sees and manipulates concrete examples .
The only visual objects are those he 's drawn .
Visual elements related to abstraction and syntactic structure ( ie , " code " ) are minimized .
Programs are very easy to read .
A reader can understand a good program just by scanning the visual examples .
All semantic objects are pictures .
That is , all objects have a meaningful appearance .
There are no non-visualizable " data structures " .
The language encourages " geometric programming " -- constructing pictures via geometric operations on the canvas , using intermediate objects that are visually meaningful .
The artist keeps his hand on the mouse or stylus most of the time .
Typing is minimized .
Although this is a fully - capable programming language , it should feel comfortable to artists .
Words are preferred to semantic punctuation .
Art jargon ( and to some extent , geometry jargon ) is preferred to programming jargon .
Overview
This section gives a tour of the language .
Slightly gorier details are are on the details page .
Strips and Panels
Substroke is conceptually a transform language .
The artist thinks in terms of transforming one picture to another :
In the top - level case of transforming a set of data into an information graphic , the initial " picture " might be a block of text :
A chain of transforms is called a strip ( in analogy to a comic strip or film strip ) .
Each picture in the strip is called a panel .
Strips should appear comfortable to artists -- if you were to take a series of snapshots as an artist drew a picture , it might look like this .
Functions and Properties
A function is a strip with a name .
The function below does n't offer any abstraction -- it is essentially a thunk :
The function below is abstracted , because it takes a direct object .
The first panel in the strip operates on the direct object :
The function can be applied elsewhere .
Wherever it is applied , the previous panel is used for the direct object :
A function can have properties .
These properties are themselves functions , which may or may not have direct objects .
The function 's strip can refer to the properties .
The properties can refer to each other .
When a function is applied in a panel , its properties can be overridden by parameters :
Objects
The function below has no strip of its own -- it has only properties .
Such a function is called an object constructor :
When this function is applied , it returns an object that holds the given properties .
An object is rendered visually by evaluating its Appearance property .
Below each panel in a strip , there is a description of the object in the panel .
By default , the description is the name of the object 's constructor .
Each panel holds a single object .
The description " 4 shapes " is short for " Group of 4 shapes " .
A Group is an object that has a " First " property and a " Rest " property .
The " Rest " property , if it exists , is another Group .
A property can be extracted from an object via the possessive syntax .
Below , within " Pentahair " , we extract the Hair property from the Pentapair object using " Pentapair 's Hair " :
Members of a Group can conveniently be extracted by index .
One or more indices can be provided .
The syntax " # 7,etc " refers to member # 7 and all subsequent members .
Labels
To refer to the object in the previous panel , we can use the pronoun It .
" Its " and " It 's " are synonyms .
We can refer to an object in any panel by giving the panels labels .
A label can be used anywhere within the function 's strip or properties ( even in earlier strips ! ) .
Below , the second panel is labeled " Greenie " , and is used in the fourth panel .
A label ( including " It " ) can be applied like a function .
By giving parameters to this function , we can " set " the object 's properties .
( Note that objects are immutable , so by " set " , we mean " reconstruct the object with some properties overridden " . )
Conditionals
There is an object named Nothing .
Nothing has no properties and no appearance .
If you try to extract a non-existent property from an object , you get Nothing .
Sometimes a function must do one of several things conditionally .
We can supply multiple definitions of a function , with some properties marked ( required ) :
When a function is applied , the required properties in its first definition are evaluated .
If any of them evaluates to Nothing , the next function definition is tried .
If none of the definitions pass their requirements , the function returns Nothing .
The direct object is implicitly required .
This allows many recursive functions to be written without an explicit base case .
In the function below , the recursive invocation automatically returns Nothing if Source 's Rest is Nothing , thereby terminating the recursion :
If a base case is needed , we can provide a second definition which does not take a direct object .
Extension
It is possible to give an object new properties via application :
However , this is n't typically useful .
Due to lexical scoping , existing properties and new properties cannot see one another .
To add or override properties that can interact with existing properties , we can extend an object .
In the function below , the " Base " property is marked ( extended ) :
When a Hexapair is constructed , the " Base " property is evaluated , and the properties from the resulting object are ( conceptually ) copied to Hexpair .
It behaves ( aside from some scoping subtleties ) as if we had defined it like so :
There are now two definitions of " Head " , but Hexapair 's definition appears first , and thus dominates .
( Although if Hexapair 's Head had required properties that failed , it would " fall through " to the Pentapair 's Head .
That is called conditional override . )
Hexapair inherits Pentapair 's functionality , but provides a new " Face " property :
Extension is dynamic -- extended properties can be a function of the direct object or other parameters .
This allows us to create mix-ins .
Suppose we have a function called " brushstroke " which takes Shapes and renders them with an organic brushstroke :
We can mix this functionality into any object with a mix -in :
Not only does this give any object a brushed appearance , it also adds a " Brush Width " property to the object , which controls the effect :
Any number of properties may be marked ( extended ) .
Higher ones take precedence .
With extension , scoping is not strictly lexical .
But if we think about extension as copying one definition into another ( ie , as a sort of run - time macro ) , we can reason about it similarly .
In particular , functions " close over " ( capture ) externally - defined names as in a lexically - scoped language .
Layers
Multiple objects can be tracked independently through a strip , by using scratch layers .
Layers other than layer 1 are tinted a particular color :
The color of a function application indicates which layer it takes its direct object from .
The ( n ) prefix indicates which layer it sends its result to .
Layers allow multiple objects to be viewed in the same space .
They are helpful when multiple objects interact :
Property linking binds one layer to a property of another layer .
When either layer changes , the other layer is updated .
Generic linking allows two layers to be bound via a linking function .
When either layer changes , the function is called to update the other layer .
Linked layers are extremely important -- they allow the artist to adjust an object by " selecting " parts of it and manipulating the parts on the canvas .
Generic linking is especially important -- it allows one to define various " interfaces " through which an object can be manipulated .
But I 'm having trouble right now coming up with good example pictures .
Linking is explained better on the details page , and it 's used a lot below ; hopefully you can get the idea .
Theory
Substroke is a language based on extending immutable records .
It is quite similar in that respect to the research language Piccola ( which I discovered only after I did most of the work here ! ) .
Substroke is a pure language .
Functions have no state or external effects .
In fact , there is no notion of " time " -- there are only dependencies .
Substroke is a lazy language .
Computation proceeds by working backward from the output , along a dependency graph .
Properties are evaluated only when " needed " .
( Where " is needed " might mean " is applied as a function " , " has a property extracted " , or " is a required property " . )
Despite being a pure language with immutable data , the comic - strip syntax provides the comfortable familiar feeling of mutating a picture , even allowing objects ' properties to be " set " .
Libraries
I have explored most of the language 's features using micro-examples .
It is difficult to come up with complete macro- examples , because libaries play such a major role , and library design is a can of worms that I have n't opened yet .
Below are a few library functions which might be important .
Distances and angles are represented with paths , not numbers .
However , functions are available to convert when necessary , along with a little syntax sugar :
Path intersection :
Shape algebra :
Move , resize , rotate :
" replace " returns its " With " property , but uses the direct object 's location and coordinate transform .
" replace each " is similar to the conventional " map " , but respects the location and transform as above :
" replace each " can take an optional predicate :
" select " is similar to the conventional " filter " .
( It can also be used as a linking function , as shown above . )
Midpoint , subpath , tangent , normal .
( The percents should be visual , but I do n't know how yet . )
Translating an object along a path .
Tweening shapes .
Using a Path as a mapping curve .
( Below might be an " ease " curve . )
The Path object has a Points property , which is a Group of Points or Paths .
These represent Bezier points / vectors .
The Path 's shape can be manipulated by manipulating this property .
( Layer - linking is especially helpful . )
The key idea is that reshaping is done with plain old geometry functions -- move , resize , rotate , etc . ( A Shape is the same as a Path , but it 's closed . )
Even color can be represented and manipulated geometrically .
Below , color is represented by a vector in colorspace .
Rotating the vector changes hue , moving it horizontally changes saturation , and moving vertically changes brightness .
( Note that the " colorspace " linking function provides an interface for changing the color , and the actual Color property may be implemented differently . )
IDE
The IDE looks and feels almost exactly like a conventional vector drawing tool , such as Illustrator .
It is intended to be used with one hand on the mouse or stylus , and the other on the keyboard .
Most Substroke - related functionality is specified through drawing or dragging .
Typing is normally only used for naming properties and labels .
Simple manipulation functions can be specified by manipulating the example in the appropriate panel .
Below , the artist resizes and moves the blob using the conventional gestures , and the IDE automatically creates the " scale " and " move " panels .
Note that , as panels are added to the right , the entire document pans to the left .
This keeps the manipulated panel in exactly the same position , so the artist can create a series of panels simply by drawing in place .
Below , the artist goes back and rotates the first panel .
A new panel is inserted in the second position , and the examples in subsequent panels update appropriately .
Most drawing tools provide " smart guides " which " snap " dragged objects into alignment with other objects .
If the artist drags an object into some alignment , the IDE creates a panel which applies the alignment :
Many common dynamic relationships can be specified in this way .
It also encourages the artist to draw explicit guides on scratch layers , which makes the program easier to read and modify later .
And because Bezier points , colors , and ( hopefully ) most other things are represented geometrically , they too can be " programmed " simply by dragging objects on the canvas :
The artist can create new " blank " panels simply by drawing a box :
The artist can factor a range of panels into a property by selecting them and dragging them to an empty area .
Above , the name " new property " can be renamed in either place it appears , and the other will update automatically .
( That is , the IDE remembers a binding that is stronger than just a name . )
Similarly , one or more members of a Group can be factored by dragging them off :
All library functions are listed in a scrolling pane to the side .
The library functions are categorized for easy browsing , and the pane also has a live search - box , which searches by name , tags , and description / documentation , in that order .
Functions are shown as before / after pairs with short descriptions .
I 'm not sure how parameters are documented .
The artist uses a library function simply by dragging it from the library to the appropriate strip .
Examples
Eye
Below is an eye that can follow a target .
The eyeball is constrained to lie within a given outline .
Like any unfamiliar language , this may seem overwhelming at first .
The way to read it is to ( initally ) ignore all the text above and below each panel .
Just look at the property names and example pictures as if you were reading a comic strip .
Glance up to the function name when you do n't understand what 's happening in a given panel .
Gear
Below is a gear shape .
The tooth width ( and number of teeth ) is controlled by the " Tooth Angle " property .
Functional Programming
Below are Substroke implementations of some standard list - munging functions .
There are many possible implementations for each of these ; I 've tried to come up with ones that reflect a ( nascent ! ) " Substroke Style " .
The above function , when given a Group , returns the first n members , where n is the size of the " As Many As " parameter .
Notice that no base case was needed -- when either the direct object or " As Many As " becomes Nothing , the recursion will stop .
Also notice that the return value was not constructed from scratch , but was obtained by " setting " the input 's Rest property ( by linking to " Its # 2,etc " ) .
This might be important if the input is not just a raw Group , but has been changed in some way ( via a geometric transform , a mix - in , ... ) .
The above function applies its " with " parameter to each member of a Group .
It would conventionally be called " map " .
Notice how layer linking makes the strip easy to read -- the affected parts of the group " light up " in red before and after they change .
The above function returns the members of a Group that fulfill a given predicate .
The predicate is passed as the " If " parameter .
In the example , it is filtering the members that intersect a particular shape .
Note that the recursive calls to " filter " assume that the overridden " If " parameter is maintained , and does not need to be passed explicitly each time .
I do n't know whether this is correct behavior .
Probably not .
Implementation
This section discusses the internal implementation of an interpreter .
A user of the language would never see this .
I have implemented a toy intepreter , mostly as a way of discovering technical flaws and inconsistencies .
The compiler accepts a program in substroke - text format .
It translates it to a substroke - core data structure , which is then translated a little more into an internal structure which is executed .
Consider the following program :
The substroke - text for this would be :
constructor : function [ source ] : hello [ label ] pass with : param its prop 2.1 from1 3=1's linky 1.2 backto1 subproperty : sub property ( required ) : foo daddy ( extended ) : bar
This is translated into the following substroke - core data structure ( shown here with Lua syntax ) :
constructor = { _extended = " daddy " , _required = " property " , function = { _eval = " panel_6 " , source = " panel_0 " , label = " panel_1 " , panel_0 = " nothing " , panel_1 = { _apply = " hello " , panel_0 = " panel_0 " , } , panel_2 = { _apply = " pass " , panel_0 = " panel_1 " , with = { _eval = " panel_1 " , panel_1 = { _apply = " param " , panel_0 = " panel_0 " , } , } , } , panel_3 = { _apply = " panel_2.prop " , panel_0 = " panel_2 " , } , panel_4 = { _apply = " from1 " , panel_0 = " panel_3 " , } , panel_5 = { _apply = " panel_3.linky " , panel_0 = " panel_3 " , } , panel_6 = { _apply = " backto1 " , panel_0 = " panel_4 " , } , panel_7 = { _apply = " panel_6.linky " , panel_0 = " panel_6 " , } , subproperty = { _eval = " panel_1 " , panel_1 = { _apply = " sub " , panel_0 = " panel_0 " , } , } , } , property = { _eval = " panel_1 " , panel_1 = { _apply = " foo " , panel_0 = " panel_0 " , } , } , daddy = { _eval = " panel_1 " , panel_1 = { _apply = " bar " , panel_0 = " panel_0 " , } , } , } ,
Note that panels and properties are one and the same here .
The direct object is passed through the property " panel_0 " .
Layers do n't exist at this point ; the only evidence of layers is which " previous panel " is passed as the direct object .
( panel_6 , for instance , takes panel_4 as direct object . )
Note also that panel_7 was generated automatically , because a linked layer was changed .
A strip has the meta - property _eval = " panel_n " , which indicates that evaluating the strip means evaluating the final panel .
A function application has the meta- property _apply = " function_name " .
An object constructor has neither .
The interpreter is fairly simple .
( It 's also stunningly inefficient , due to the prevalence of deep copying . )
Below are the two primary functions :
function eval ( obj ) if obj._name then return evalName ( obj._name , obj._parent ) end if obj.
_extended then return eval ( extend ( obj ) ) end if obj._apply then return applyName ( obj._apply , obj._parent , obj ) end if obj._eval then return evalProperty ( " _eval " , obj , obj ) end return obj end function apply ( func , params ) if func.
_name then return applyName ( func._name , func._parent , params ) end if func._apply then return apply ( eval ( func ) , params ) end local obj = copy ( func ) for name , value in iterateProperties ( params ) do obj [ name ] = copy ( value , params .
_parent , params ) end return eval ( obj ) end

Over the years , media coverage occasionally ramps up around what I think of as the Great Penny Debate : whether to discontinue the U.S. one - cent denomination .
The issue was covered on 60 Minutes a few weeks back , and now it 's showing up in an excellent New Yorker article .
The heart of the issue is that pennies cost more than one cent to make , so why not stop making them ?
There 's also some disagreement as to the efficiency ( and thus cost ) of counting out change using pennies -- would n't rounding to the nearest five cents be faster ?
Given the prevalence of " take - a- penny " dishes at many checkout counters , it seems that cashiers already prefer rounding than dealing with pennies .
Countries ( including the U.S. , with the 1857 elimination of the half - penny ) have discontinued low - denomination coins before , so it 's not a far - fetched notion to think that the penny 's days are numbered .
But the actual issue aside , this whole penny discussion is jam - packed with trivia about coins and metallurgy .
The New Yorker piece linked above brings us some great tidbits .
I 've gone ahead and collected some of its best factoids for your reading pleasure :
A penny minted before 1982 is ninety - five per cent copper -- which , at recent prices , is approximately two and a half cents ' worth .
... More recent [ pennies ] are ninety - seven and a half per cent zinc .
Nickels , despite their silvery appearance , are seventy - five per cent copper .
Canadian five - cent coins ... were a hundred per cent nickel most years from 1946 to 1981 .
Primarily because zinc [ in addition to copper ] has soared in value , producing a penny now costs about 1.7 cents .
... The Treasury incurs an annual penny deficit of about fifty million dollars -- a condition known in the coin world as " negative seigniorage . "
Breaking stride to pick up a penny , if it takes more than 6.15 seconds , pays less than the federal minimum wage .
... Eliminating pennies would increase our reliance on nickels , which now cost almost ten cents to manufacture ....
There 's much more to the article than these bits of trivia , so I encourage you to read it in full .
Also , the article mentions people " throwing away " pennies .
Really ?
Dear readers , please tell me if you 've been throwing away pennies .
I toss mine in a jar , but never the trash .
25 Firefox Extensions to Make You More Productive
Firefox is my weapon of choice when it comes to browsing the web .
It ’s fast , free , and gives the user the best feature ever : Choice .
The beauty of the Firefox extension is that it allows you to add a specific feature or function , fully customizing your browsing experience .
For someone wanting to make the most of their online time , this is a huge opportunity .
There are limitless ways to tailor your browsing with Firefox extensions .
Here are 25 of my favorite extensions that help me save time while online .
Update April 2018 : Firefox is removing AddOns in favor of WebExtensions .
You may need to search for the updated versions of these recommended extensions in the Firefox Add - ons page .
For an explanation and some updated Productivity extensions , you can check out more ideas here : https://digital.com/blog/webextensions-firefox
Autocopy –
The name pretty much says it all .
Instead of having to hit cmd +c ( or ctrl + C for our Windows readers ) , every time you highlight text it automatically copies it to the clipboard .
If you do n’t want it on 100 % of the time , you can toggle it on and off in the bottom - right of the browser .
Better Gmail – A must - have for any Gmail user .
Maintained by the legendary Gina Trapani of Lifehacker , Better Gmail adds some killer features that would make any developer at Google scratch their head and wonder “ Why did n’t I think of that ?! ” .
Keyboard macros , saved searches , right - click preview views and integrate Google Reader to name a few .
( The keyboard macros are enough of a reason to install this little filly , in my humble opinion . )
Better GReader – Another gem from Gina for Google Reader .
Add feeds to GReader and bypass the default add page from Google , make the most of the reading area and take advantage of some great keyboard shortcuts , to name a few .
No Squint – Finding yourself going cross-eyed form leaning too close to the monitor ?
No Squint can fix it .
Specify a percentage to show all text that ’s larger than the default for your screen resolution .
You can either make all sites a default size , or only specify a few with different font sizes .
Remember the Milk for Gmail – If you ’re a fan of the todo list application Remember the Milk , you ’ll love this extension .
Fully mange your todo items inside of Gmail , instead of having to trek over to the RTM website every time you want to check off a task .
You can also quickly assign emails as tasks .
Very slick .
Shareaholic –
An indispensable extension for those who do a lot of social bookmarking with digg , del.icio.us , twitter , or maintain a tumblelog .
In one click you can share the page you ’re on with the previously mentioned services ( plus a few more ) without spending any more time than you have to away from the article .
LeechBlock –
If you ’re feeling a little vulnerable to the addictive qualities of certain websites , use LeechBlock to literally force you from visiting them within a certain time period of the day .
No joke .
Not for the faint of heart , or those with problems with authority .
Read it later –
Do n’t have time to really focus on an article you ’ve found ?
This extension will enable you to quickly save the page you ’re browsing until you ’re able to read it .
Once you ’re ready to read your saved articles , the extension will open the articles in new tabs with the click of a button .
Scrapbook – Much like the Read it Later extension , Scrapbook allows you to quickly save pages for later reading .
However , it has a few more great features , like taking whole snippets of pages ( like Google Notebook ) , searching within snippets , saving whole websites , and you can even organize the snippets like bookmarks .
Perfect for researching or in - depth bookmarking .
Meetimer – Meetimer is a great way to get a handle on just how much time you ’re spending on various sites around the web .
You can group sites into categories ( ie . facebook .com = “ procrastination ” ) , and track just how much Copy Plain Text –
The name pretty much says it all .
If you do a lot of writing in WYSIWYG editors ( blogging and other word processors ) , then this extension can come in pretty handy .
Copy Plain
Text will leave all the bolds , italics and other unwanted formatting when you copy and paste into text fields .
Ad Block Plus–
For those obsessed with a zen - like minimalist approach to web browsing , this Ad Block Plus will surely keep you focused .

On the surface , FEBE will quickly and easily backup your Firefox extensions .
But the fun does n’t stop there .
You can also sync multiple computers with the same Firefox extensions , and even set up automatic backups , ensuring that you ’ll never lose your Firefox configurations again .
del.icio.us bookmarks [ no longer available ] – Save , search and share your Del.icio.us bookmarks easily inside of Firefox .
Browsing your bookmarks is especially easy with the del.icio.us sidebar .
Googlepedia – I find this extension extremely valuable for getting a more holistic Google search .
Googlepedia splits the Google search results in half and shows the relevant Wikipedia page for the search alongside the Google results .
Errorzilla Mod –
This extension is pretty nifty for troubleshooting error pages that you might come across , giving you the Google Cache , Wayback Machine , Whois , and tons of other useful information about the site and page in question .
Pageaddict – Pageaddict simply shows your internet usage by website .
It ’s not as intrusive as Invisibility Cloak or LeechBlock , but it can provide a helpful look at where you really spend your time online .
urlfixer – I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’ve typed in “ gmail .
cmo ” to get a frustrating error page .
Instead of having to perfectly type in every url , urlfixer can usually guess where you ’re trying to go , and will send you there anyway .
Colorful Tabs –
This extension is deceptively useful .
Much like office file - folder tabs , colorful tabs gives a color to each tab opened in Firefox .
Quickly find which tab you need without having to read it .
Faviconize Tab – Save some serious tab bar real estate with Faviconize tabs .
With a simple right - click , you can shrink each tab to only the size of the favicon ( 16×16 px ) , giving you much more room for open tabs .
Google Notebook -
Google notebook is another bookmarking tool , except it can save whole excerpts from pages , images and links .
Quickly save all parts of a page into an digital “ notebook ” for easily collecting .
Not quite as nifty as the Scrapbook extension , but definitely a contender .
Dictionary Tooltip – A perfect companion for any writer .
Just highlight any word and hit Ctrl +
Shift +
D to see the word ’s definition , without having to open a new window .

It will soon be a year of working at Google and milestones are always a good time for introspection .
I have a lot on my mind but there was one thing in particular that I wanted to share with you all :
What it is has been like working at Google .
Interesting , fun , surprising , insightful , inspiring , impactful , and more such words .
This post shares that experience .
I went into Google with my own filters and expectations on what the experience would be like and what I would end up doing .
Looking back the reality has been different in so many ways , even for a jaded Silicon Valley veteran of layoffs and cool companies like myself .
Before I get any further I wanted to mention that I am the Analytics Evangelist for Google .
I am a Consultant ( a " red badge " as I often remark ! ) .
There is little difference between roles and expected outcomes between a full time employee and a consultant – nonetheless there is a very different benefits structure at multiple levels for consultants ( as Johnny Law dictates ) .
I also do n't have any holdings of Google stock , and , not being a full time employee , I also do n't hold any Google options .
Also my experience is positive , there is a small community that seeks sub optimal stuff about Google constantly .
You can bounce now because you wo n't find it here .
With that squared away , ever wonder what makes Google tick ?
Here are ten insights from / cool things about / reasons for / delightful surprises from almost a year of working at Google :
# 10 : The amazingly fantastic food and impressive digs .
# 9 : " Micro Efficiencies " .
# 8 : A company that truly cares .
# 7 : Brain expansion opportunities .
# 6 : The sheer amount of brilliant Google employees .
# 5 : Empowerment ( The big small company ) .
# 4 : The scale of your impact .
# 3 : Doing Good : Green & .org
# 2 : It 's a happening place .
The energy , the vibe , the passion .
# 1 : The brand .
+
What about the future ?
Let me share some of the reasons why I picked the above ten .
. . .
# 10 : The amazingly fantastic food and impressive digs .
I am sure you have heard about the food , everything you have heard is true ( and it probably understates the story ) .
Brett had always said one of the reasons I should work at Google was the food .
My reply was " My level of gourmet is Taco Bell " . :)
But he was right .
I am convert ( and much to Jennie 's delight my level of gourmet is slowly moving up ! ) .
Google has impressive food .
It is not just that it is yummy , it is , but it is more that the diversity of the food and how fresh everything is and the number of cafes and dishes that you 'll encounter only in the nicest restaurants .
I still can't get used to the fact that every day when I walk into a cafe the food is different and delicious and healthy and mostly organic .
Here 's just one example :
Red beet " Ravioli " with tarragon , cashew filling and yellow pepper puree .
It was to die for .
And that 's from a Taco Bell gourmet !
If you are at the Googleplex try to go to Cafe No Name ( I love that place – world fusion food ) and skip Charlie's .
In Mt. View I also like Pure Ingredients , Slice ( raw , vegan food , great smoothies as well ) and Pintxo 47 ( tapas ! ) , each is unique in its own way .
Hemispheres in NYC is also excellent .
You can eat every day at Google and never get bored .
And you eat healthy , while having a nice one hour relaxing lunch with your co-workers .
As to the digs , I live in the Valley but I have also spent time at Google New York , Atlanta , Chicago , San Francisco and London .
If you visit them I am sure you 'll agree they are cool digs .
Space Ship One in B43 in Mt. View . . . .
Maybe it is how each person personalizes their environment , maybe it is the vibrant colors , maybe it is the energy of people bustling around , maybe it is the pure oxygen that is pumped into each Google building worldwide ( a reporter actually asked me that ! ) .
You 'll find cubicles that are 100 % aluminum foil wrapped , others that are homages to star wars , others to universities or pop culture or countries or customers or …… its a long list .
Here 's a good example .
. . .
This past week I was in Atlanta and on my way to a conference room when I was stopped in my tracks .
On my right was a Zen oasis .
Mood lighting , bean bags and comfy chairs , plants , six small water fountains making bubbling soothing sounds .
Ten mins in there will recharge anyone before or after a few hours of work ( or after every hour of work ! ) .
It is fun to work in a creative environment where collaboration is encouraged by the open layouts and yet you are never far from a nice view .
# 9 : " Micro Efficiencies " .
Google has all these " micro efficiencies " that are very clever and well thought out .
Each in a small way makes life easy for someone working at Google , but taken in aggregate , in my opinion , add up to a big advantage for the company .
Here 's a tiny example .
. . .
All conference rooms are wired for everything you need to make your life easy .
In my prior companies I had to reserve a projector , and mostly forgot , and carry my power bricks and my ethernet cables etc .
At Google all the power adapters you need are in the conf room , Apple or ThinkPads , and there are two projectors in every conf room ( and most have high bandwidth video conferencing ) and did you see the dvi – vga converters ?
This makes my life easier in a small but significant way .
I also absolutely love the tech stop idea .
If there is a tech support issue no need to open a ticket and wait for salvation from the help desk ( though you can ) , you can simply walk to the closest Tech Stop and the Geek Gods there will fix any problem on the spot ( and they smile and are super nice people ) .
What a time saver !
Ditto for the Hardware Depots in various buildings .
Need a mouse or head phones or a battery or power adapter or . . . any peripheral ?
Walk into the the Hardware Depot , scan your badge , pick up , walk out .
Very convenient , huge time saver ( no need to fill requisitions and do a long line of paperwork ! ) .
There are so many little things that you 'll find at Google that you 'll come to appreciate , especially if you have worked for a while at other companies .
Micro efficiencies that result in significant macro efficiency .
# 8 : A company that truly cares .
You sit on the outside and you read all the stories and your first thought was : " Yeah right !
They do " all that " !
Probably just to keep you at work and working like a dog . "
To some extent I did too .
I was wrong , and so are you .
For any company it is easy to provide you with free food , get you shuttles to commute , have beer parties on fridays , decorate the offices nice , and have free drinks and Naked Juices .
If it wanted to .
Typically what happens is that you get bored of the " cafe food " and the rest pretty quickly because often companies pay lip service to things like that .
At Google the food never gets boring because each cafe has a executive / sous chef and when you eat they 'll come chat with you and ask you what you think of the food ( to your utter shock the first few times ) .
They actually care .
TGIF each friday at Google is something else .
The commute shuttles are very comfortable , have wi-fi and are frequent .
I am struck at how with everything there is this touch of extra , and that shows that the company does really care about you .
Here is another example that struck me .
. . .
We live in earthquake belt .
And it is not that hard to create a earthquake kit for yourself .
Gallon of water , first aid kit , manually chargeable flashlight / radio etc etc .
Not that hard , yet few of us have it .
A couple of months ago I saw the Google employees walking around with nifty backpacks .
They were earthquake kits that Google created for and gave all its employees ( not contractors , legally that is not allowed ) .
That was so nice .
It even had water !
The company did not have to do it , to me it was about going to extra step for their employees .
This is why Google employees are so loyal to their company , the company tries to care for them and the employees care back .
# 7 : Brain expansion opportunities .
For some reason this one surprised me .
I do n't know why .
This is not a uncommon sight as you walk into Google buildings .
. . .
On any given day at Google there are brilliant people visiting and giving talks and lectures .
Politicians , authors ( even niche ones : me ! ) , professors , bright young folks ( me , long ago ! ) , environmentalists , journalists , dignitaries , monks , Nobel prize winners , venture capitalists and so on and so forth .
I am astounded at the ability to have access to so many brilliant and leading minds .
If I have some time then I can take an hour out , go listen to someone brilliant and stretch my brain on a wide variety of topics .
Check these out :
After a while at any company your mind gets stale , you can't get out except for a conference or such .
At Google you have alternatives .
This past year I have learned about microexpressions from Paul Ekman ( be careful if you see me intently scanning your face ! ) , saw the light when Barack Obama spoke , realized why John Chambers is so well admired , sat two seats away from Al Gore ( the day before he won his Nobel prize ! ) , had lunch with Guy Kawasaki , gave a presentation right after Ian Ayres ( !!) and well I could keep going .
I am sure you get the point .
At Google I am grateful to have the chance to exercise brain , get a new idea , learn something I otherwise would not have .
It is priceless !
# 6 : The sheer amount of brilliant Google employees .
There is a myth that everyone who works at Google is smart / brilliant / genius / replace your own term here .
That is not true .
Not everyone .
You 'll still be astounded at the hit rate of truly brilliant google employees to the sub brilliant ones ( see Mom , I can be diplomatic ! ) .
It really does not matter who you are and what you have done before .
You could be the greatest at your own field , I assure you in your meetings and as you walk around you 'll see and work with people who you think are genius .
It will keep you humble , and that is a good thing . :)
Here 's an example .
. .
This , as you 'll surely recognize , is Hans Rosling .
. . .
To people who have anything to do with data he is pretty much as good as it gets .
His cube is ten meters from where I sit .
When I see him I am as giddy as a school girl who has just seen Brad Pitt .
If you do n't know who Hans is check out these two videos ( a must watch for anyone who remotely things they present data or do data visualization ) :
He is scanning my book in the picture .
Can you imagine how incredibly cool that is for a humble little web analytics author like myself ?
I of course insisted he keep it .
It is a lot of fun working with smart people because they push you to be better , because you are sure the collaboration will result in something beautiful .
Even when you can't talk quite the same " language " .
. . .
That 's from my white board .
Phil is in the blue .
I am the red .
Notice his use of math as visualization .
Notice my method of visualization .
I smiled in the end , he is " Googlely " in his approach , me less so !!
[ PS :
That is the standard definition of what constitutes a bounce in scenarios where additional pieces of data exist – like exit clicks , event logging entries etc – and what the impact is on standard computation of Time On Site in those scenarios .
How cool is that ? :) ]
Not everyone at Google is brilliant , but you 'll constantly find people who inspire you and who you 'll learn from .
It is nice to have so many people who you 'll genuinely respect .
# 5 : Empowerment ( The big small company ) .
If you are good at something , have passion to do it then you 'll get empowered to go do it .
I know that sounds basic .
It is not .
You could be just out of college and if want to then you 'll get to solve some of the most complex challenges you would ever find .
At other companies you 'll get put into a hierarchy with layers and controls were for the first four years you might learn where all the files are .
I am being a bit dramatic , but not all that much .
In my second week there I was walking over to lunch with a young man and he was describing his work to me .
He had been at Google for less than a year , straight from college and had completely rewritten one of the most challenging " code " during the last few months and his work had yielded dramatic results for Google .
He is good at what he does but I was simply struck by how a company this size would let someone so young and " untested " the task for solving such a complex challenge .
And how awesome must it feel to know that you did that !
That 's what I mean by empowerment .
[ Google NYC campus building made out of legos , above . ]
Google is not a very small company ( GOOG ) .
It is only ten years old , and it is a " big " company now .
Yet it functions like a small company .
People sit together , cross functional teams , and each group is holistically responsible for getting stuff done .
Few layers , lots of empowerment .
It is a big small company .
That is the secret .
If you want to bite of a humongo challenge , and I do mean humongo , then you can rest assured that you 'll get a chance to do it .
You have to be passionate about your cause and be competent at it .
Your youth or old age , your big title or small one , your " tenure " at the company will rarely be barriers .
You want to get @# $& done ?
You can .
That 's a good feeling .
# 4 : The scale of your impact .
This one is my personal favorite .
Google is not quite as big as many companies out there , but in its space it has a huge user base for most of its applications ( search and beyond ) .
Anything you work on will probably touch hundreds of thousands of people – if not multiple times that .
It is such a awesome thrill when you see your work in the hands of so many folks on this planet .
I think of a small idea and collaborate with the team and bam (! ) they make it a reality .
In a few days something that was just in your brain is now in the hands of hundreds of thousands of people !
I open the app and there is such a deep sense of gratification when I see parts of it that helped with ( " mine ! that 's mine ! " ) .
But more than that there is a thrill in the realization that something I helped create takes out just a little bit of stress out ( even if five seconds worth ) of the Users lives , makes data just a smidgen easier to understand , make a tiny bit of difference in how their customer experience .
In many other companies it takes time to drive change ( see # 5 above ) , even then you are just a cog , and even then your power to touch people ( end users ) is limited .
The scale at which you can touch people and make a tiny bit of difference in their day to day life is huge at Google .
It is also very liberating that you can do the right thing , the products are mostly free so you do n't have to worry about the vagaries of trying to do things that are fluff or driven by other interests .
You can focus on the customers .
The impact , for you and me , results in a high , a very high high .
# 3 : Doing Good : Green & .org
This might not resonate with everyone but it is very important to me .
One of the reasons Intuit was so nice , they did so many good and charitable things .
I am a Northern California person , I am green , I buy everything in An Inconvenient Truth ! :)
Google has lots and lots of green initiatives .
From the solar panels on the car ports that are around the buildings .
. . .
to initiatives like the greener cars ( I know green car is a oxymoron ) like the plugin hybrid .
. . .
to the cup of juice that I pick up at breakfast .
. . .
In small and big ways you 'll see around the offices Google takes green seriously in a very real and meaningful way .
They also support great causes , like the matching program for OLPC ( one laptop per child ) when you could buy one laptop and one would be given free to a child in the third world .
Google 's match meant two laptops would be given out for the one you bought .
google.org is a very ambitious initiative to to make a immense difference in the world that we live in .
Lots of companies are lucky to be blessed with great wealth .
I am always biased in favor of companies that do n't wait to make a difference , they take action right way .
Be it google.org or WalMart and their CFL initiative or the , most ambitious of it all , efforts of the Gates Foundation .
At a personal level it feels good to be a part of a company that tries to make a difference ( and some day Google will even lick the problem of how much power web servers consume !! ) .
# 2 : It 's a happening place .
The energy , the vibe , the passion .
Cool projects + empowerment + size of impact = A energetic fun happening place .
:)
Google employees are a passionate bunch , the have a energy to themselves regardless of how big or small their project is , and they are passionate .
People work hard ( and I might stress play hard , see below ) , and you feed off their energy .
There is this constant sense that you are doing something to change the world , there is very positive vibe .
A great example is Testing On The Toilet .
Yes you heard it right .
I can only speak for the mens restroom of course .
As you stand ( or sit :) you can't fail to notice that in front of you a page that teaches the importance of testing .
Each week a new " episode " .
Techie stuff , python and sawzall and bigtable and loops and so on and so forth .
That would be inconsequential ( just like the sign that says " wash your hands after using the bathroom " ) .
But the amazing thing is that these docs , deeply technical as they are , are written with a great sense of humor .
Often subtle , usually techie , always entertaining .
It is not unusual for even someone like me to just stand there and read the whole thing ( sadly blocking traffic ! ) .
I do n't understand everything they teach but I am consistently struck by how well written it is , and the passion of the people who take writing better code so seriously .
It 's just a example of the energy that you 'll see , passionate people trying to do the right thing with a smile .
As Martha would say " That 's a good thing . "
# 1 : The brand .
My son Chirag will be four in a couple months .
The first word he could spell without looking at it was G O O G L E .
I think he was two and half .
I do n't wear too many Google shirts , I do n't have too much Google stuff .
He had visited Google a couple of times , he loves walking around , looking at stuff etc .
As a result he has this deeply favorable view of the Google " brand " .
I was impressed .
Remember this is a little kid ( he can spell more things now ! ) .
The interesting thing is that the Google brand has the same effect on people of all ages .
There is a thriving cottage industry in sub optimal google thoughts , but for the most part people have a wonderful positive response when you tell them you work for Google ( even as a consultant ! ) .
My friend Blaire was telling me how she gets stopped and asked nice things when she is wearing the Google " girl power " t- shirt .
That 's branding .
People have a positive opinion of Google and it transfers to your sense of pride in your company .
Goes to show if you just produce a good product it can translate into something remarkable ( something worth remarking ) .
Google is amongst a select list of companies that will look good on your resume for some time to come , there is little doubt about that .
Phew , deep breath .
That 's the top ten reflecting on my own experience as a consultant at Google .
There are other things that full time employees might list , the 20 % time , or 401k or health insurance or other benefits .
A parting thought .
. . .
Google is 10 years old .
Just 10 years old .
The top ten list above illustrates perhaps some of why it has become so good so fast .
Some things above are hard to do , but most big companies ( say Fortune 1,000 atleast ) can easily do all of them .
Yet they do n't .
The net net of all of the above is , IMHO , that Google is a faith based initiative .
If you treat your employees exceptionally and give them room to breath , then they will reward you exceptionally .
What about the future ?
What the company and its people have accomplished thus far is simply astounding .
But it has yet to face a shock , yet to truly feel pressured , yet to miss earnings for a couple of quarters .
It will .
It is not a question of if , it is a question of when .
Circle of life .
It faces many challenges .
It is doing many things right and it is probably doing other things wrong , and it does not know it yet .
Time will tell .
There is a famous quote used by the great Warren Buffett .
. . .
" It 's not until the tide goes out that you realize who 's swimming naked . "

DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) --
On a good day , Keri Christensen spends the day watching her children .
She prepares their meals , gets them ready for school and helps them with their homework .
Keri Christensen was nearly a victim of a roadside bombing in Iraq when the convoy in front of hers was hit .
But this housewife and mother of two is far different than most of the women living in her Denver , Colorado , suburb .
She 's an Iraqi war veteran , among the first women in the United States to be classified as combat veterans .
Even though she 's been home from the war for more than 2 ½ years , she 's now fighting another battle -- this one with depression , nightmares , sleeplessness and anger .
She says all of it is caused by her time in Iraq .
" I start feeling those feelings of ' I 'm not worthy .
I can't raise my family , ' " Christensen said .
Women have made up about 11 percent of the military force in Iraq and Afghanistan in the past six years , according to the Department of Defense ; that 's an estimated 180,000 women in the war zone .
The figure dwarfs the 41,000 women deployed during the Persian Gulf War and the 7,500 who served during the Vietnam War , mostly as nurses .
Unlike past wars , women are assigned to combat support roles .
Many are seeing violence firsthand in an unconventional war .

They 've made history in combat , now witness the struggles many female veterans endure once they return home .
Watch " Anderson Cooper 360° " Thursday , 11 p.m. ET see full schedule »
As a member of the National Guard , Christensen transported tanks in Iraq .
She says she was shot at and was nearly a victim of a roadside bomb when a convoy in front of hers was hit .
" You have this fear , ' Oh , my God , I still have to go through there , ' " she recalled . " ' Am I going to make it ? ' "
Christensen says that she was sexually harassed by a superior while serving in Iraq and that the harassment added to the pressure created by just being in a war zone .
" I just know it took a big toll on me because I was trying to deal with it myself .
Just trying to be a soldier , " Christensen said .
In 2007 , the Department of Veterans Affairs found that women are reporting signs of mental health issues when they return home at a higher rate than their male counterparts .
The VA diagnosed 60,000 veterans with post - traumatic stress disorder .
Of those , 22 percent of women suffered from " military sexual trauma , " which includes sexual harassment or assault , compared with 1 percent of men .
Christensen , who has been diagnosed with PTSD , says she does n't like leaving her comfort zone .
She does n't drive more than two miles from her home .
" When I get outside my familiar safe territory , I start to feel overwhelmed , " Christensen said .
" It gets foggy .
Not sure where I 'm really going .
Something comes over me where I do n't feel like I have control over it . "
" PTSD is actually something that shows up over time , and so the natural recovery process does n't happen , " said Dr. Darrah Westrup , who counsels female veterans at the VA - run Women 's Health Clinic in Menlo Park , California .
" So three months out or so , you find yourself still not sleeping , still with nightmares , still having intrusive thoughts , " Westrup said .
Westrup says another factor contributing to poor mental health is the high amount of sexual trauma reported by women screened by the Veterans Administration .
She says many women have trouble reporting the trauma to their superiors out of fear of retribution .
" When you are in a war zone , your survival depends on people watching your back and on unit cohesion , " Westrup said .
" The same individuals who attacked you are those who will be protecting you , or you 'll be fighting alongside the next day . "
Christensen receives counseling and group therapy sponsored by the VA .
However , the military has said there is no merit to her claims that she suffered military sexual trauma .
Like many who suffer from post - traumatic stress , Christensen still has her ups and downs .
She says she 's just working to get past the feelings of guilt , shame , loss of control and low self - esteem .
" I do n't think we 'll ever be the same .
I think that you can learn to cope with it , and that 's what I 'm learning right now , " she said .

Zillow maps ups and downs of housing prices
Is your house gaining or losing value ?
It depends on where you live in the Bay Area

The Bay Area is known for its microclimates .
That 's as true for the real estate market as for weather patterns .
While home values have tumbled across the country , the San Francisco region has pockets of strength where prices continue to rise , albeit modestly compared with the double - digit appreciation of recent years .
Not surprisingly , those strongholds are uniformly in affluent areas .
An analysis of home - price changes in Bay Area ZIP codes to be released Tuesday by Zillow.com shows a map of the region as a virtual checkerboard of good news and bad news .
Homes in many parts of Silicon Valley , San Francisco and Marin County appreciated in value as of the fourth quarter , compared with a year ago , Zillow said .
But foreclosure - heavy , low - income areas such as east Contra Costa and southern Alameda counties had more dismal changes - many ZIPs there show home values down 5 to 10 percent , even more than 20 percent , in the space of a year .
The price volatility " is a sobering reminder of what 's going on , " said Stan Humphries , vice president of data and analytics for Seattle 's Zillow .
" It 's pretty dramatic . "
However , he said , the Bay Area map actually is a pretty picture compared with many other places .
" There are a lot of colors ( indicating price fluctuations both up and down ) in the San Francisco Bay Area , which means there is a lot of regional variation , " he said .
" The Detroit area , for example , is more monochromatic , but it 's all bad .
The San Francisco Bay Area at least has some bright spots . "
Overall , though , values in the Bay Area are definitely down for the year , according to Zillow .
Home values fell 6.7 percent in the metropolitan area that includes Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , San Francisco and San Mateo counties .
That 's a steeper drop than throughout the nation , where all homes are down 3 percent year - over - year , Zillow said .
Of the core Bay Area counties , only San Francisco shows appreciation for the year by Zillow 's reckoning .
Median home values were up 3.7 percent , to $ 857,274 .
And that still falls short of inflation , which was just over 4 percent .
Alameda County was down 7.2 percent , to $ 573,458 , and Contra Costa fell an alarming 15.3 percent , to $ 482,70 .
The story was not much better in San Mateo County , which had values down 3.2 percent , to $ 779,702 , or Santa Clara County , down 2.1 percent , to $ 724,354 .
For many people , knowing their home is worth less on paper is just an academic exercise .
But for anyone considering selling or withdrawing equity , a lower value translates into immediate , real - world effects .
Sue McCullough , a computer programmer with Wells Fargo , " Zillowed " her home in Oakland 's Laurel District on Tuesday and was dismayed to see it valued at $ 417,000 - about a 16 percent drop from a couple of years ago .
" It makes me very much more definite : I 'm going to have our open , available line of home - equity ( credit ) shut down so we can't get into trouble , " she said .
McCullough and her husband , Donald Barks , had planned to tap home equity to convert their tumble - down garage into a home recording studio .
They got as far as tearing down the garage and then realized that building a new structure would max out their home equity .
" The last few years we used that home - equity line of credit for fun things , like vacations , " she said .
" That 's not going to happen anymore .
We have not exceeded the value of our home , but I do n't want to go there .
That scares me . "
Zillow takes masses of real estate data - such as county records , MLS listings , its users ' own information - and crunches them with proprietary algorithms to arrive at price estimates , or " Zestimates , " for about 67 million homes nationwide .
The voyeuristic ability to check out not just your own house but your neighbor 's , your boss ' , your friends ' and the one you grew up in has made Zillow an instant water - cooler hit since its release two years ago .
The site had about 4.6 million unique visitors in January .
Zillowing has entered the lexicon , a la Googling .
Many people rely on the Web site to get a gut feeling about their home 's worth .
" I check it quite insanely , " Marcy Orosco , a social worker at the North Bay Veterans Resource Centers , wrote in an e-mail .
" Our home is all we have , and we are desperately trying to hang on to it at this time .
I wish I could shrug it off .
Our home is right on the Russian River , therefore it has held value very well .
If you are across the street from me , on the other hand , your home has really gone down in value . "
But Zillow has taken a lot of fire for valuations that can seem too far off base .
" As a real estate attorney who obtains appraisals regularly , I have found that Zillow 's results are always significantly off of appraised value , occasionally far off , " said William Warhurst , a partner at Redwood City 's Hannig Law Firm .
He thinks the site 's Zestimates are off by 10 to 15 percent .
Zillow said that its price estimates are just that - estimates , not appraisals .
Any real estate transaction involving a mortgage , such as selling or refinancing , almost always requires a professional appraisal .
The company said it continually works to improve its accuracy , most recently adding new data , such as local market conditions , and new algorithms .
In the Bay Area , 35 percent of home sales come within 5 percent of the Zestimate , while 61 percent of sales come within 10 percent , it said .
It appears the government is taking no chances against further attacks
It is one of the latest initiatives to prevent attacks from rebels based in the east of the country .
Last week , tree surgeons cut down centuries - old trees that lined the city 's main avenue for fear they could provide cover for attackers .
The government beat off a coup attempt last month in a fierce two - day battle .
Correspondents say initial fears that the rebels would regroup and attack N'Djamena again have proved unfounded .
But it appears the government is taking no chances .
" It 's part of our strategy , " Interior Minister Ahmat Mahamat Bachir told Reuters news agency , without going into further details .
Last week , the government renewed the state of emergency imposed to restore order after the attack .
President Idriss Deby accuses Sudan of being behind the coup bid .
These charges are denied by Khartoum which in turn accuses Chad of backing rebels in Sudan 's Darfur region .
The rebel attack took place just before the deployment of a European peacekeeping force to safeguard refugees from Darfur in eastern Chad and the Central African Republic .
A clinical trial of Zetia , a cholesterol - lowering drug prescribed to about 1 million people a week , failed to show that the drug has any medical benefits , Merck and Schering - Plough said on Monday .
The results will add to the growing concern over Zetia and Vytorin , a drug that combines Zetia with another cholesterol medicine in a single pill .
About 60 percent of patients who take Zetia do so in the form of Vytorin , which combines Zetia with the cholesterol drug Zocor .
While Zetia lowers cholesterol by 15 percent to 20 percent in most patients , no trial has ever shown that it can reduce heart attacks and strokes  or even that it reduces the growth of the fatty plaques in arteries that can cause heart problems .
This trial was designed to show that Zetia could reduce the growth of those plaques .
Instead , the plaques actually grew almost twice as fast in patients taking Zetia along with Zocor than in those taking Zocor alone .

to_proc
Symbol
The & operator converts Proc objects into blocks and block into Proc objects .
In this case , it tries to convert the symbol :+ into a block .
The conversion uses Ruby 's built - in coercion mechanism .
That mechanism checks to see whether we have a Proc object .
If not , it sends the #to_proc method to the argument to make a Proc .
If the Symbol :+ has a # to_proc method , it will be called .
In Ruby 1.9 it has a # to_proc method .
That method returns a Proc that takes its first argument and sends the + method to it along with any other arguments that may be present .
So , & :+ really means { |x , y| x + y } .
plus = :+.to_proc
puts plus.call ( 1,2 ) # prints ' 3 '

to_s.call ( 42 ) # results in the string " 42 "

end
It creates a Proc which , when called on an object , sends that object the symbol itself .

Seismologist Elizabeth Cochran and a few colleagues hope to add a few seconds to earthquake detection , thereby getting word out faster to a large number of people .
Courtesy Elizabeth Cochran Everybody knows you can't predict an earthquake .
The only way would be to get inside a time machine , go into the future , and send back a message .
So seismologist Elizabeth Cochran of the University of California at Riverside will use thousands of computers to do just that .
Well , it 's not exactly a time machine .
Cochran and Stanford seismologist Jesse Lawrence have made use of the sensors built into many new laptops that sense when the computer is being dropped , and turned them into earthquake monitors .
They hope to sign up thousands of users to act like a grid of detectors that can sense an earthquake before it does too much damage .
Like many earthquake early warning systems around the world , when a quake strikes , this system will send a warning to people living in large cities .
Because electronic communication systems ( in this case , the internet ) are much faster than seismic waves , the warning should arrive before the shaking , giving people 10 or 20 seconds to take shelter .
" We can measure the seismic waves and then get a warning out to people before the seismic waves get to them .
That to me is physically possible , " Cochran says .
Cochran 's system makes use of the accelerometers – tiny motion sensors – built into many modern notebooks , including Apple 's MacBook and Lenovo 's ThinkPad , as well as the iPhone and Nintendo 's Wii .
Accelerometers detect movement and translate it into digital signals .
In notebooks , they function as safety devices :
When the accelerometer detects that the notebook is in free fall , the computer moves the hard drive head to a safe position in order to minimize the risk of damage when it hits the ground .
But the accelerometers are also accessible to software , so they can be used for games or other applications .
As it turns out , one field that already makes extensive use of accelerometers is seismology .
Usually these sensors are buried underground , generating much of the data seismologists use to model earthquakes .
So in 2006 when Cochran saw a program called SeisMac , a light went on .
SeisMac uses the accelerometers in Mac computers to let people shake their computers and watch the motion translated on screen into a graph .
Cochran wondered if the same technology could be used in earthquake sensing , and suggested the idea to colleagues at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography , where she was working at the time .
" I sort of said , ' Hey , what do guys think if we take this accelerometer and make a seismic network out of it ? '
And of course Jesse was like , ' That 's the coolest idea I have ever heard . ' "
Thus was born Quake Catcher Network .
The two scientists – joined by Carl Christensen , a programmer with experience in distributed computing – started in September 2007 .
Distributed computing was made famous by extraterrestrial - scanning network SETI@home , and Cochran uses the same platform , called BOINC , to collect data from the laptops in her project 's network .
However , it may be awhile before the Quake Catcher is up and running .
For one thing , it is extremely hard to decide if a set of movements is an earthquake or , say , just someone working next to a jackhammer .
To sort through the bogus data , the team has to set up algorithms that weigh the statistical probability that half a dozen computers would be shaking the same amount at the same time .
They are still working out how to do this , but Cochran estimates perhaps 10 hits or so may be enough to certify that an earthquake is happening .
However , this is where Quake Catcher breaks new ground .
Not all " stations " will likely be the same .
Some data will inevitably be ranked better than others .
For instance , if you nervously jiggle your leg while you work , your laptop 's earthquake detection data will be looked upon with suspicion .
Cochran and Lawrence expect that once the network is up and running , users will be able to check their ranking based on how much they shake their desks .
It 's not the first time laptop accelerometers have been used for earthquake measurement .
The San Diego Supercomputer Center also links laptop volunteers with webcams to give researchers around the world another tool to understand earthquakes after they happen .
As for Quake Catcher , it 's months from even limited release and probably years from issuing warnings .
The system is far from perfect .
It relies on massive numbers of volunteers that have to stay online .
And it 's hard to tune it without large earthquakes .
So until then , the team is hoping people sign up , leave their laptops on , and then just hold still .
" The ideal situation is that they start up BOINC and they leave their laptop in their closet until the earthquake happens , " she says , laughing .
" That would be great for us . "

Heather Mills v. Ashley Dupre
It is a strange world we live in where a man can be ordered to pay a woman $ 50 million after a mere 4 - year marriage , and the man is seen as the winner of the legal battle .
If you work it out , Heather Mills " earned " $ 1,400 per hour for every hour of her marriage to Paul McCartney .
That tops what Ashley Dupre was paid by Elliot Spitzer on an hourly basis .
According to the summary of the judgment that was released , Mills was seeking $ 7,000 per hour ( $ 250 million ) -- i.e. the amount earned by 7 - diamond - rated escorts at New York 's Emeror 's Club .
She has a high opinion of herself , evidently .
Details that have come out about the judgment , and Mills ' reaction to it , do n't paint a flattering picture of the ungrateful ex-wife .
She is reported to have dumped a glass of water over McCartney 's lawyer 's head in the courtroom -- histrionic behaviour that would never be tolerated by a man in a divorce court .
After delivering an 11 - minute diatribe against the process and the judgment on the courthouse steps , Mills said she would not appeal the ruling and would oppose the release of any more details to the public .
McCartney 's only comment was , " All will be revealed . "
One surmises that the reasons for judgment were not particularly kind to Mills .
As usual , the aggreived ex-wife 's first instinct it to pit the child against the father .
Mills complained bitterly after court that she would only get $ 70,000 per year for little Beatice in child support .
" Beatrice will have to settle for traveling in coach while her dad goes first class , " she said .
As if .
No wonder the judge found her position on almost every issue to be unreasonable .
Still , if Mills were Canadian , she would have a point .
By our standards , $ 70,000 per year in child support is a pittance for someone of McCartney 's wealth and income .
You would only have to be making about $ 700,000 per year in Canada to be on the hook for $ 70,000 in child support for one child .
With an income in the order of $ 40 million per year , McCartney would be paying upwards of $ 340,000 per month -- per month ! -- in child support according to the Federal Child Support Guidelines .
No wonder Erin Pizzey has described Canada as " the scariest country on the planet " for its treatment of men .

Thank goodness McCartney made Heather sign a pre-nup !

Even with your assumption of 24 hour a day services , and not including the tax - free nature of much of the settlement , it is clear that Governor Spitzer was still not speding up to the level of what the UK - or Canadian - judges are used to .

Mills is no Cinderella .
Posted by : dewp | 2008-03-19 9:35:55 AM
Excuse me , McCartney was a foolish old man to have married this slut in the first place .
When you are a worth over a billion you do n't find a young chick half your age who loves you for who you are .
Perhaps Paul is so used to being loved for being a Beatle that he neglected to realized that Heather Mills was n't around when the Beatles were in their hay day .
It 's always best to stay in your own generation when partnering up .
The Steely Dan Tune " Hey Nineteen " comes to mind here .
I do n't mean to excuse Ms Mills , she is a POS of the first order .
But silly old men and their lust for hot young chicks proves fatal in nearly every case .
Posted by : John West | 2008-03-19 9:53:08 AM
It seems whores that fall in the fetish category demand the highest prices .
Paul must have thought an ugly old gimp was less likely to stray .
Now she 's a rich ugly old gimp who can afford a string of young hunks .
Maybe she " hopped " into the sack with the judge .
JW - I must have misjudged your age .
Or maybe you listened to country and western music until 1972 .
You quoted Steely Dan , but had to ask what is CCR ?
Posted by : dp | 2008-03-19 10:35:42 AM
JW : There 's nothing inherently " foolish " about older men partnering up with younger women .
In our legal climate , however , it is risky .
The answer is to change the legal climate rather than attempt to change human nature .

According to the sources I read there was no pre-nuptual agreement between the two .
I can't help but think that there was a Canadian connection to the divorce .
When Danny Williams was eviscerating Mills 'seal hunt argument on the Larry King show , brave Sir Paul did not ride to her rescue , much to her apparent consternation .
Could a snapping seal pup have been the beginning of the end for these upper class twits ?

You wanna play , you 've gotta pay .
Guys will do most anything to get laid .
I 've ridden horses , gone scuba diving , and stepped outside with a few bad - asses .
Lying on an iceberg and getting my ass chewed off by a seal is where I draw the line .
Unless it 's with Lucy Liu .
I 've made several million since my divorce , and I 'm worried I wo n't have enough to put my kids through college .
I live very frugally , compared to my ex .
I 'd be a lot better off if my kids lived on their own , with me paying all their expenses .
In fact , they would have more funds available in that situation .
I 'd be very surprised if half of all child support payments ever trickle down to the child .
An acquaintance of mine told me it's hard to spend quality time with his kid , because when he looks at him he sometimes imagines a big canvas bag with a dollar sign on it .
Pretty sad .

Ca n't buy me love
I 'll buy you a diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright
I 'll get you anything my friend if it makes you feel alright
' Cause I do n't care too much for money , money can't buy me love
I 'll give you all I got to give if you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give but what I got I 'll give to you
I do n't care too much for money , money can't buy me love
Ca n't buy me love , everybody tells me so
Ca n't buy me love , no no no , no
Say you do n't need no diamond ring and I 'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of thing that money just can't buy
I do n't care too much for money , money can't buy me love
~ Paul McCartney
I tell ya , the guy is a romantic .

IF Heather had any intelligence beyond a common twit she would have settled for having it all done in private in the best interest of the child .
Paul 's first marriage was a good partnership by all accounts , hopefully he 's learned from this disaster .
If Paul or twit Heather have a story to tell they should have the sense to consider the daughter they produced from that disaster .

California energy crisis deepened by bankruptcy filing of utility company
By Andrea Cappannari
12 April 2001
On Friday , April 6 , Pacific Gas and Electric ( PG&E ) , one of California 's major energy utilities , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy .
The collapse of the $ 24 billion company — the third largest bankruptcy filing in US history and largest ever for a utility — will deepen the energy and financial crisis in the state , where residents are already threatened with soaring rates and up to 34 days of rolling blackouts this summer .
The bankruptcy filing was widely acknowledged as PG&E 's answer to the emergency plan put together by Governor Gray Davis to manage the fallout from the state 's 1996 energy deregulation law .
The announcement was made the morning after Davis said he would allow the utility to increase its rates , but only if PG&E agreed to sell their transmission system to the state and provide regulated power for 10 years .
PG&E officials denounced the governor 's plan as unacceptable and blamed the governor for driving the company into bankruptcy .
PG&E has been hovering on the edge of bankruptcy , along with the state 's other main energy utility , Southern California Edison , for several months .
After first making millions from the sale of several of their generating facilities , the utilities were caught by the high cost of energy they purchased from outside suppliers .
Under the state 's deregulation scheme , they were unable to immediately pass on the price hikes to consumers .
PG&E accumulated $ 9 billion in debt , while SoCal Edison owes $ 5.4 billion in power costs .
Although SoCal Edison has not filed for court protection , analysts say PG&E 's move might pressure it to follow suit .
PG&E says it will be able to continue delivering energy , albeit an unstable supply , to its 13 million customers while it is protected from creditors , including major financial institutions and energy suppliers .
The state of California , which began purchasing energy for the utilities several months ago , will now be only one of many institutions lining up in federal court to recover its resources .
Although Governor Davis has refused to release information about how much the state government has spent to subsidize the utilities , it is estimated that California is spending $ 50 million a day on power purchases , with total expenditures thus far reaching $ 5 billion .
This has produced a severe financial crisis for the US 's most populous state .
The bankruptcy filing effectively removes the state government from decisions affecting the utility .
All deals involving the financial status of the company , such as how much it can increase consumer rates , or how it will handle the repayment of debt and sale of assets , are now under the jurisdiction of Judge Dennis Montali .
PG&E 's corporate management hopes to reach a more favorable arrangement in bankruptcy court than it could in negotiations with the state government in terms of raising rates and protecting the interests of big shareholders .
During a April 5 telecast , delivered on the eve of the bankruptcy filing , the governor said his rate increase plan was the only alternative to the one announced by the Public Utilities Commission ( PUC ) on March 27 , which called for a 40 percent increase .
Davis — concerned about the political backlash from massive rate hikes — called that plan “ premature . ”
Although he cannot override the PUC 's decision , he urged the government - appointed board to adopt a different plan whereby customers who consumed more energy would see larger rate increases .
According to the governor , the tiered system would encourage “ conservation ” because high - volume users would see a 37 percent jump in rates , while the average consumer , he claimed , would see somewhere between a zero and 26.5 percent rate hike .
While reversing his previous opposition to rate hikes , Davis has increasingly tried to downplay the corporate interests behind the state 's crisis by suggesting that Californians consume too much electricity .
Earlier the company had said the PUC rate increase failed to earmark any money for the payment of debt PG&E had previously accumulated .
Instead , they complained , the plan only allotted increased revenues for future purchases of energy by PG&E and to replenish the drained coffers of the state treasury .
Davis 's plan would have directed 10 to 15 percent of the monies accrued from the rate increase to the utilities without restrictions similar to those of the PUC .
However , this agreement was made contingent upon PG&E agreeing to sell their portion of California 's extensive power grid to the state , a measure which the company — as well as the Bush administration — has opposed .
PG&E Chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr. acknowledged that the company 's decision followed the governor 's April 5 proposals .
“ We listened to the statement and the commentary that followed and this decision is the result , ” Glynn told a news conference following the bankruptcy filing .
“ The regulatory and political processes have failed us , and now we are turning to the court ” to protect the company 's shareholders , he said .
Davis — who has sought to maneuver between the conflicting interests of various utility companies , big banks , energy suppliers and other corporate entities — could do nothing but issue a meek protest after PG&E 's decision , saying the company had “ plunged themselves into bankruptcy for their own strategic advantage . ”
A leading member of the Public Utilities Commission called the filing “ a self - serving and cynical move by PG&E 's management to protect shareholders at the expense of the company 's ratepayer . ”
In the end , however , the verbal protests could not hide the fact that the state government was prostrate before the decisions of the energy giant and its financial backers .
Both the immediate and long - term effects of the PG&E bankruptcy will be extensive .
The energy rate plan proposed by Davis is now null and void , as it will be up to the bankruptcy court to determine the scale of future consumer rate increases , which are expected to be higher than anything previously proposed .
Within hours of the utility 's announcement the effects of the Chapter 11 filing were being felt on the New York Stock Exchange .
Stock trading in PG&E 's parent company was temporarily suspended just prior to the bankruptcy pronouncement .
Upon resumption , the share price slid 37 percent to $ 7.20 .
The market also battered the stock of Edison International , of which SoCal Edison is a subsidiary , with its share value plunging 35 percent .
Major bondholders , lending institutions and energy brokers whose finances are tied into the utility also felt the effects of the bankruptcy filing , with the stocks of JP Morgan , Bank of America , Duke Energy , Calpine , MBA and others undergoing percentage point drops of between 4 and 9 percent .
Two major credit- rating agencies , Moody 's and Standard and Poor , responded to the situation by reducing the bond status of the entire state of California from stable to negative .
Such a move calls into question the viability of the multibillion - dollar bond sale authorized by the legislature to shore up the state 's finances .
PG&E has also ceased paying dividends on its stocks .
Several articles in major newspapers have pointed out that a number of middle and working class families have savings tied into stock in the company , as utilities are often perceived as a relatively safe investment .
While the protections afforded under Chapter 11 provide some degree of immediate stability for PG&E , as creditors are unable to sue the company , smaller energy suppliers that lack large cash reserves are in an extremely vulnerable position .
Many may shut their doors because they are unable to wait months , if not years , for the bankruptcy judge to make payment arrangements .
If these producers are forced to close , or if they refuse to sell their power , the state 's energy supply will be further restricted , driving up wholesale energy prices even more as demand peaks during the summer months .
The Bush administration has refused to compel suppliers to continue selling power to California or to cap the prices they charge .
In addition to the extensive job losses that are expected at PG&E , it is anticipated that the various companies whose business operations are intertwined with the utility will also see cutbacks as the financial fallout reverberates throughout the economy .
Before filing bankruptcy the utility made sure big investors , executives and senior managers were handsomely paid off .
According to the San Francisco Chronicle , PG&E issued bonuses — later estimated to be around $ 50 million — to 6,000 higher - level employees one day before the company filed for bankruptcy .
Although his total compensation for 2000 is not yet available , according to the company 's last proxy statement in 1999 , corporate chief Robert Glynn made $ 2 million in salary and bonuses .
PG&E is also currently under investigation by the Public Utilities Commission to see if it transferred billions of dollars to its parent company , PG&E Corporation , which then disbursed it as dividends to shareholders , even as its California subsidiary was accumulating a growing mountain of debt .
Whatever the findings of this inquiry , due to the Chapter 11 status of the company the PUC will be virtually powerless to enforce any corrective measures on the utility .
Fake Disease Created For Viral Movie Campaign ?
There 's a little rumor going around that a disease called Morgellons , a creepy skin disease that involves little bugs a bug - like sensation under the skin , and the websites associated with it are just a viral marketing campaign for the upcoming movie A Scanner Darkly .
Michael Shostack of The Halting Point has collected some information pointing to the likelihood the disease is , in fact his opinion , a viral campaign .
Shostack , who , since one never knows when it comes to virals , may actually be part of the viral campaign , points to a Slashdot story which says " Imagine having a disease that is so controversial that doctors refuse to treat you . "
The Slashdot story leads to a June 2005 Popular Mechanics story about the disease which has , reportedly , been around since 2002 when websites ( 1 , 2 ) about the disease began appearing .
There 's also a Wikipedia citation for Morgellons which , among other places , points to a April 2005 local CBS TV affiliate story on the disease .
That article says the disease has been around for a long time .
" In 1935 , an English physician wrote a paper about Morgellon 's including excerpts from medical journals from the 1600's , describing the disease . "
A disease with Morgellon - like symptoms is also mention in the first chapter of the 1977 Philip K. Dick novel , A Scanner Darkly , on which the movie is based .
The fact the disease has apparently been around for a while , is referenced in many places , was eluded to by Dick in his novel and has elicited many comments on this website in support of the disease 's validity might lead one to believe , however obscure , the ailment is legit .
On the other hand , the fact the disease 's websites are registered anonymously may give credence to the notion the movie studio co-opted the disease ( or created it along with a fake history ) and created a viral marketing campaign around it .
Additionally , much of the recent news coverage of the disease reads like it came from the same press release .
TV coverage looks like it came from a VNR .
And , interestingly enough , reports point out the highest concentration of the disease is in LA - home to the Hollywood movie - making machine .
In support of the create - a - disease theory , one might find it odd all this flurry of activity is occurring just prior to the movie 's July 7 release date .
Not to mention the disease 's websites making mention of some sort of major announcement in June or July .
Of course , all of this could simply be our jaded , skeptical excuse - for - a - brain run amok .
Anyone care to tell us we 're crazy ?
Anyone care to support the theory ?
We vote viral .
If so , it 's both masterful and scary .
To have created a viral campaign in 2002 , four years prior to the movie 's release and when viral was barely in a marketer 's toolkit , is amazing and commendable .
Of course , to create a fake disease that garners legitimate news coverage is likely to bring down heavily the wrath of the medical community .
One way or another , we 're likely to know the truth in a month or two .
UPDATE : We were completely wrong on this one .
Morgellons is a real disease and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reportedly forming a task force to look into the situation .
We apologize for our idiocy .
UPDATEI II :
We placed a call to the CDC press office and , while we await an " official " reply from a " qualified " press agent , the woman we spoke to in the press office had not heard of Morgellons , did not think the CDC had been made aware of the disease and stated that any prepared alert goes up on their website immediately .
A search of the website found no mention of Morgellons .
Stay tuned .
UPDATE III : CDC Communication Specialist Dan Rutz returned our call and has verified that Morgellons is a syndrome , as he refers to it , the CDC is looking into .
The CDC has received numerous calls from those citing symptoms associated with what is being called Morgellons Disease and has , in fact , formed a group to explore the syndrome and define it .
All angles from environmental to medial to psychological will be taken into consideration .
Rutz says , based on information the CDC has collected to date , it 's highly unlikely this syndrome was " invented " as some us originally thought .
Whether Morgellons is being leveraged in some clandestine fashion to promote A Scanner Darkly is unclear bit if it is , it 's sick , twisted and wrong .
